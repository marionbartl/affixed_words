First - time parents ' relationship satisfaction is related to the amount of sleep they get while caring for an infant , according to a research abstract that will be presented Wednesday , June 9 , 2010 , in San Antonio , Texas , at SLEEP 2010 , the 24th annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies .
Results indicate that self - reported relationship satisfaction among new parents was strongly associated with objective total sleep time measured by actigraphy .
This association was stronger than the association between subjectively reported sleep and relationship satisfaction .
" We were surprised to discover that objectively measured sleep predicted relationship satisfaction above and beyond the couples ' subjectively reported sleep , " said lead author Salvatore Insana , a graduate research assistant in the Sleep and Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory at West Virginia University in Morgantown .
" In other words , how parents actually slept had a greater impact on their relationship satisfaction than how they think they slept .
This was true for both mothers and fathers . "
The study also found that first - time fathers were more satisfied than their partners thought they were : Mothers significantly underestimated fathers ' self - reported relationship satisfaction .
Mothers also overestimated fathers ' self - reported sleep quality , while fathers underestimated mothers ' subjective sleep quality .
Insana and principal investigator Hawley Montgomery - Downs , PhD , studied 22 couples who were first - time parents .
The parents had an average age of 27.6 years , and data were collected from each couple an average of seven weeks after the birth of their child .
Parental sleep efficiency and total sleep time were measured by one week of continuous wrist actigraphy .
Participants also used a Palm Pilot each morning to provide a subjective report of their sleep and the sleep of their partner .
At the end of this week , participants reported on their own and their partner 's re¬lationship satisfaction using the Comprehensive Marital / Relationship Satisfaction Scale .
Although the study did not allow for an examination of causality , Insana said that it is logical to presume that postpartum sleep disturbances have a negative effect on relationship satisfaction .
So it is important for clinicians to help new parents prepare for the sleep challenges that they will face after the birth of a child .
" Preventative measures that target sleep during the postpartum period could potentially be used to buffer against decreases in relationship satisfaction among new parents , " said Insana .
" Furthermore , positive parental relationship satisfaction has been previously associated with positive parenting behaviors ; therefore , our current findings could be used to ultimately promote positive parenting and healthy infant development . "
Insana added that previous research has found that parents have high levels of sleep disturbance and significant daytime functional impairments during the postpartum period .
" Cumulatively , this work suggests that postpartum parents , their infants and society may benefit from an extended family leave policy in the United States , " he said .

A project to spy on two Muslim areas in Birmingham using more than 200 CCTV cameras has been dramatically halted after an investigation by the Guardian revealed it was a counterterrorism initiative .
Bags are being placed over the cameras , recently installed in the neighbourhoods of Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook , to reassure the community their movements are not being monitored while a " full and in - depth consultation " takes place .
In a joint statement last night , West Midlands police and Birmingham city council announced the cameras would not be turned on .
They apologised for not being " more explicit " about the funding arrangements of the project , which stipulated they should be used to combat terrorism , a mistake they conceded may have " undermined public confidence " .
But officials insisted the £ 3 m project would go ahead following a retrospective public consultation , arguing the cameras would help reduce crime .
Under the initiative , Project Champion , two suburbs were to be monitored by a network of 169 automatic number plate recognition ( ANPR ) cameras – three times more than in the entire city centre .
The cameras , which include covert cameras secretly installed in the street , form " rings of steel " , meaning residents cannot enter or leave the areas without their cars being tracked .
Data was to be stored for two years .
There was no formal consultation over the scheme , which includes an additional 49 CCTV cameras .
The few local councillors who were briefed about the cameras appearing in their constituencies said they were " misled " into believing they were designed to tackle antisocial behaviour , drug dealing and vehicle crime .
There were angry public meetings in the city last week , after the Guardian disclosed the cameras were paid for by the Terrorism and Allied Matters ( Tam ) fund , administered by the Association of Chief Police Officers .
Its grants are for projects that " deter or prevent terrorism or help to prosecute those responsible " .
Senior officials involved in the Safer Birmingham Partnership ( SBP ) , a partnership between the police and council tasked with overseeing the project , were unaware of the counterterrorism link until just two months ago .
The partnership said in a statement : " We completely accept that earlier consultation with councillors from Sparkbrook and Washwood Heath – the main focus of the project – should also have included elected representatives from all other areas affected .
" We also accept that we should have been more explicit about the role of the counterterrorism unit in the initial project management of Champion .
" Although the counterterrorism unit was responsible for identifying and securing central government funds , and have overseen the technical aspects of the installation , the camera sites were chosen on the basis of general crime data – not just counterterrorism intelligence .
" Day to day management of the network was always intended to become the responsibility of local police .
We apologise for these mistakes , which regrettably may have undermined public confidence in the police and the council . "
Testing of cameras had already begun , and officials had planned to go live in early August .
However , the plans were placed in jeopardy after a public outcry over the scheme .
Human rights lawyers have pledged to seek a judicial review of the scheme .
Parliament has been asked to denounce Project Champion as a " grave infringement of civil liberties " in an early day motion tabled this week by the Labour MP for Birmingham 's Hall Green constituency , Roger Godsiff .
Police sources said the initiative was the first of its kind in the UK that sought to monitor a population seen as being " at risk " of extremism .
Will Israel have to pay a price for its latest assault ?
Despite international opinion and damage to relations with Turkey and the Arab world , the answer is likely to be no
The Israeli assault on the flotilla bringing aid to Gaza on 31 May has been generally condemned .
It is hard to support an act of piracy in international waters , especially when it kills 10 people .
The disproportionate force and the deliberate nature of the assault rightly make us indignant .
How can we comprehend Israel ’s so - called mistake ?
There is now an unprecedented offensive against human rights organisations in Israel , both international and Israeli ; these organisations are now considered a strategic threat to Israel , second only to that of Iran , Hamas and Hizballah .
There is a serious attempt to delegitimise them , using groups backed by the Israeli government and the far right ( for example , NGO Monitor ) .
It is therefore unsurprising that Israeli soldiers saw the activists who came to bring supplies to Gaza as “ terrorists ” and treated them as such .
The first and most immediate question , though , is will Israel have to pay a price for this crime ?
And will the world ’s governments , especially those of Europe , react with more than words ?
The answer to both questions is likely to be no .
The UN Security Council , which met on 1 June , was unable to adopt a resolution and had to make do with a declaration by its president .
This mentioned the creation of an “ independent and impartial ” commission , but failed to state that it should be international .
That will allow the Israeli government to set up its own enquiry , which will lead nowhere .
The head of the Security Council reminded the world of the need to lift the blockade of Gaza , but that was no different from the unanimous resolutions adopted by the Security Council more than three years ago and never applied .
Israel is rewarded for its intransigence by both the US and the European Union .
Only recently it was admitted to the OECD ( Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ) , the club of the most developed economies .
The Israeli prime minister marked this event with a triumphant visit to Paris .
With hindsight , we might see the OECD admission was a green light for Israel ’s 31 May assault .
In December 2008 the EU decided to upgrade bilateral relations with Israel , giving it a status equivalent to that enjoyed by some great powers .
Two weeks later , violating the ceasefire with Hamas , the Israeli army began its assault on Gaza , which had already been blockaded for several months .
Europe ’s decision could be seen as a green light for the attack , which was marked , according to Judge Richard Goldstone ( 1 ) , by war crimes and crimes against humanity by Israel , and also by Hamas .
The report ’s conclusions have not as yet been put into effect and the blockade continues .
Israel ’s action is likely to have serious repercussions .
First , on international opinion , especially in the West , which sees Israel as an outlaw state that violates all the rules of international law .
Then on bilateral relations between Turkey and Israel , which is losing its most powerful ally in the Muslim world .
The crisis could have repercussions in the Arab world too : Egypt ’s decision to open the Rafah crossing is a sign of real alarm among moderate governments who see their peace strategy trampled by Israel .
But will they go further ?
It seems unlikely .
The media talks of Israel ’s “ mistake ” and its deteriorating image ( sometimes that is the only criticism ) .
But we need to remember that the real war crime , in the proper sense , is the blockade .
This April , only 2,647 trucks crossed into the Gaza Strip from Israel .
Before Hamas took control of the territory in June 2007 , the figure was on average 12,000 a month .
Gaza today receives around 22 % of what arrived before June 2007 ( 2 ) .
The late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin once admitted that he dreamed of seeing Gaza sink into the Mediterranean .
This fantasy is becoming a kind of reality .
Despite international condemnation , Gaza goes on sinking slowly .
The most common voluntary activity is not eating , drinking alcohol , or taking drugs .
It is not socializing with friends , participating in sports , or relaxing with the family .
While people sometimes describe sex as their most pleasurable act , time - management studies find that the average American adult devotes just four minutes per day to sex .
Our main leisure activity is , by a long shot , participating in experiences that we know are not real .
When we are free to do whatever we want , we retreat to the imagination — to worlds created by others , as with books , movies , video games , and television ( over four hours a day for the average American ) , or to worlds we ourselves create , as when daydreaming and fantasizing . …
This is a strange way for an animal to spend its days .
Surely we would be better off pursuing more adaptive activities — eating and drinking and fornicating , establishing relationships , building shelter , and teaching our children .
Instead , 2 - year - olds pretend to be lions , graduate students stay up all night playing video games , young parents hide from their offspring to read novels , and many men spend more time viewing Internet pornography than interacting with real women . …
One solution to this puzzle is that the pleasures of the imagination exist because they hijack mental systems that have evolved for real - world pleasure .
We enjoy imaginative experiences because at some level we do n’t distinguish them from real ones . …
Just as artificial sweeteners can be sweeter than sugar , unreal events can be more moving than real ones .
There are three reasons for this .
First , fictional people tend to be wittier and more clever than friends and family , and their adventures are usually much more interesting .
I have contact with the lives of people around me , but this is a small slice of humanity , and perhaps not the most interesting slice .
My real world does n’t include an emotionally wounded cop tracking down a serial killer , a hooker with a heart of gold , or a wisecracking vampire .
As best I know , none of my friends has killed his father and married his mother .
But I can meet all of those people in imaginary worlds .
Second , life just creeps along , with long spans where nothing much happens .
The O.J. Simpson trial lasted months , and much of it was deadly dull .
Stories solve this problem — as the critic Clive James once put it , “ Fiction is life with the dull bits left out . ”
This is one reason why Friends is more interesting than your friends .
Finally , the technologies of the imagination provide stimulation of a sort that is impossible to get in the real world .
A novel can span birth to death and can show you how the person behaves in situations that you could never otherwise observe .
In reality you can never truly know what a person is thinking ; in a story , the writer can tell you .
( more )
Yes modern stories and art are more enticing than were those of our distant forager ancestors .
But their stories and art also occupied much of their time , especially when food was plentiful .
It seems rather implausible that this was only because “ imagination … hijack [s ] mental systems that have evolved for real - world pleasure . ”
Surely our foragers would have evolved a resistance to such imagination , if it in fact wasted valuable time .
I ’m pretty confident that since foragers had stories and art , then stories and art must have served , and still serve , important functions .
Modern humans often prefer to believe that the activities which they most treasure have no evolutionary function – that they were accidents .
This attitude helps them stay blind to those functions , awareness of which would make their treasured activities seem less noble .

Facebook 's astronomic rise , staggeringly large user - base , and world 's youngest self - made billionaire CEO make it one of the most fascinating companies around today .
While everyone knows the basics about the service 's Harvard dorm room origins , we 've delved a little deeper to find out more interesting snippets of info .
Here are 10 facts you might not know about Facebook , so read on and let us know your favorites in the comments box below .
1. Al Pacino's Face Was on the Original Facebook Homepage
Prior to a major homepage redesign back in 2007 , Facebook 's front page used to feature a man 's face partly obscured behind a cloud of binary code .
Dubbed the " Facebook guy , " it was not known who the mystery man was — until recently .
David Kirkpatrick has revealed in his book The Facebook Effect that the image is a manipulated photo of Al Pacino created by a friend and classmate of Mark Zuckerberg .
2. One Early Facebook Function Was a File Sharing Service
You wo n't find this in the official Facebook timeline , but one of Facebook 's early add - ons was a peer - to - peer , or more technically friend - to - friend , file sharing service called Wirehog , developed alongside Facebook by Mark Zuckerberg and three others .
It launched in 2004 and is reported to have been planned as an integral FB feature .
In 2005 Facebook was actively promoting the service and Zuckerberg told The Harvard Crimson " I think Wirehog will probably spread in the same way that thefacebook did . "
However , likely due to piracy concerns , Wirehog was axed in 2006 before Facebook got really big , although its photo - sharing functionality lives on in spirit .
3. The First " Work Networks " Included Apple and Microsoft
Many of you may know about Facebook 's initial staggered rollout , where they started with Ivy League colleges before encompassing other educational institutions .
But do you know who Facebook first went corporate with in terms of official work places ?
In May 2006 , Apple and Microsoft were among the first , as was Intel , EA and Amazon .
Others in the first round also included Accenture , Gap , Intuit , Pepsi , PricewaterhouseCoopers and the non-profit organization Teach for America .
It was n't until September 2006 that everyone , regardless of school or company affiliation , could join Facebook — and just over a year later the site hit 50 million active users .
4. Facebook 's Hidden Easter Eggs
Facebook is no stranger to Easter eggs .
Early on , mysterious movie - related references ( apparently Zuckerberg is a big film buff ) could be found littering the site .
The references could be found in the footer of the old " Friends Page " in 2007 , and one of the first was a quail - themed quote from the film The Wedding Crashers .
Later dubbed " quails , " other quotes with the avian theme continued to appear in the footer text , including “ Only the craftiest of quails survive hunting season , ” and “ What does n’t kill a quail only makes it stronger . "
In addition , Facebook once boasted a Konami Code ( you know — up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , B , A , enter ) that changed the background of the site to display colorful circles and light flares .
Finally , there 's the " Chris Putnam , " a Facebook Chat Easter egg that still works today .
To test it out , when in chat type in : putnam : and hit enter — ta da !
5 . The Meaning of the Term Poke Has Never Been Defined
While Facebook explains how " poking " works on its help center , there 's no explanation to be found for the origin of the phrase .
The most common definition is a friendly " nudge , " but the more flirtatious connotations cannot be ignored .
David Kirkpatrick reveals in The Facebook Effect that Zuckerberg once responded to a question about what a poke meant on the social networking site with : " We thought it would be fun to make a feature that has no specific purpose ...
So mess around with it , because you 're not getting an explanation from us . "
6. The Average Facebook User Has 130 Friends
How many Facebook friends do you have ?
To put your friend count in perspective , the average user has 130 .
Facebook 's official stats page is full of little gems like this , and more staggering stats , such as the fact that people spend over 500 billion minutes per month on Facebook , while the current active official user count now stands at over 500 million .
As far as Facebook the platform goes , over a million websites have integrated with Facebook , and more than 150 million people engage with Facebook on external websites every month .
7 . There 's an App to See What 's on the Facebook Cafe Menu
Like at Google , Facebook staffers get three free meals a day ( as well as free drinks and snackage ) served up by the " Facebook Culinary Team " at Cafe X or Cafe 6 .
If the staff want to know what 's on the menu , they do n't need to leave their seats .
In fact , they do n't even need to leave their Facebook profiles — the " Lunchtime " Facebook app offers a weekly view of what 's being offered .
And it looks real good .
8. Mark Zuckerberg Calls Himself a " Harvard Graduate "
As you can see for yourself over at facebook.com / zuck ( the personalized URL Zuckerberg nabbed for himself ) , Mark Zuckerberg tells a little fib on his profile page .
He lists himself as a " Harvard Graduate , " which simply is n't true , as he dropped out to concentrate on getting Facebook up and running .
When 60 Minutes reporter Lesley Stahl confronted Zuckerberg with this little inconsistency , he said " That 's true .
We do n't have a setting for dropout . "
Er , memo to Zuck — you kind of have the power to make that happen ...
9. California is Huge on Facebook
As far as Facebook goes , California ( home of Silicon Valley ) is the most social state , with an amazing 15,267,160 users in the region , according to Facebakers .
This amounts to a 41 % penetration rate — pretty astounding that nearly half the state is connected via Facebook .
The next biggest user - base can be found in Texas with 9 million users , but it 's nowhere close to California .
New York comes in third with 8 million , and rounding off the very bottom of the list is ... Delaware .
Of course , actual state population size is a factor here , but you get the point .
10 . A Facebook Employee Hoodie Sold for $ 4,000 on eBay
If Facebook merchandise is collectible now , imagine what it will be worth in years to come .
A Facebook employee standard - issue hoodie recently sold on eBay for a whopping $ 4,050 with nearly 50 bidders battling it out to win the auction .
The fact that Mark Zuckerberg had just been seen sporting the same garment at the D8 Conference and revealed its mysterious insignia to the world certainly helped up the bids , but considering the one that sold had not touched Zuckerberg skin , it 's an astonishing amount .

Meg R. noticed something funny at Woman Within , a website that sells clothing sizes 12w to 44w .
All of the models were very thin , thus not representative of the intended customer base at all .

But , even odder , they were all swimming in clothes that ( by today 's standards ) were far too large for them .
So the website featured thin models selling plus - size clothes ( not , in itself , that surprising ) , but did n't scale down the clothes to fit them !
We might imagine that using thin women would make customers , even if they are n't thin , like the clothes ( because we all internalize thin preference ) , but modeling poorly fitting clothes , as Meg said , was n't doing the product any favors !
We 're both baffled by the logic .

The unemployment report for May , released this morning , reflects the fact that the economy is still a long way from the kind of recovery that will actually put people back to work :
Employers added 431,000 nonfarm jobs nationwide in May , the biggest increase in a single month since the recession , the Labor Department said Friday .
But the bulk of the growth was in government jobs , driven by hiring for the Census , and private - sector job growth was weak .
The unemployment rate fell to 9.7 percent nationwide , from 9.9 percent in April , the department said .
The figures for May represented the fifth consecutive month that payrolls have risen , but fell below analysts ’ expectations that 540,000 jobs would be added to the economy .
The shortfall was immediately reflected in futures trading in the Wall Street stock indexes , with the Dow Jones industrial average expected to open almost 2 percent lower .
Altogether , 411,000 of the jobs added were for Census workers whose positions will disappear after the summer .
The net gain in government jobs was 390,000 , while the private sector added only 41,000 .
In April , nonfarm payroll employment grew by 290,000 , but the unemployment rate rose nevertheless to 9.9 percent because of a surge in the labor force .
The economy has to add more than 100,000 jobs every month to absorb the new entrants to the market .
And they are joining a labor pool that is already swollen with 15 million Americans looking for work .
More than eight million people have lost their jobs since the start of the recession in December 2007 .

If bees and other pollinators were to disappear completely , the cost to the UK economy could be up to £ 440 m per year , scientists have warned .
This amounts to about 13 % of the country 's income from farming .
In a bid to save the declining insects , up to £ 10 m has been invested in nine projects that will explore threats to pollinators .
The Insect Pollinators Initiative will look at different aspects of the insects ' decline .
The initiative brings together specialists from a number of UK universities , as well as from the Food & Environment Research Agency and the Natural Environment Research Council 's ( Nerc ) Centre for Ecology and Hydrology .
It is funded by several public and charity organisations , led by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) .
Honeybees , hoverflies , wasps , bumblebees , moths and butterflies play a vital role in feeding people through the pollination of crops .
Bumblebees have declined worldwide , largely due to the loss of flowers and other habitats they need to survive in the countryside Claire Carvell , Centre for Ecology and Hydrology
Speaking at a news briefing at the Science Media Centre , Professor Andrew Watkinson , director of the Living with Environmental Change programme , said that the new initiative " allowed us to bring in new skills in gene sequencing and epidemiological modelling with the expertise that already exists in the pollinator research community " .
Some projects will look at factors affecting the health and survival of pollinators in general .
Others will focus on specific species and diseases .
' Catastrophic ' decline
Professor Watkinson said there was no single factor that could explain the pollinators ' decline .
" There 's a whole range of agriculture and land use , disease , environmental change [ and ] pesticides , " he said .
" To tackle a complex problem like the decline of pollinating insects , where there are a number of potential causes , requires wide - ranging research . "
For some species , such as bumblebees , the decline was " catastrophic " , he added .
" It 's really difficult to quantify [ the extent of the decline of pollinators ] and that 's one of the problems we really need to address .
" What we need is some robust science and I think that this programme is going to provide it . "
Another speaker , Claire Carvell from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology , said that since the 1970s , there had been a 75 % decline of butterfly species in the UK .
Also , out of 25 species of bumblebees , three had gone extinct , she added .
Image caption Inspectors are monitoring the health of honeybee colonies in England and Wales
These " extra special " bees with large hairy bodies are very effective at transferring pollen between flowers , she commented .
" They are also active at lower temperatures than other bees , so you 'll see them out working earlier and later in the day .
" But bumblebees have declined worldwide , largely due to the loss of flowers and other habitats they need to survive in the countryside . "
Dr Carvell said that her team will use a method of collecting DNA from live wild bumblebees to estimate how far queen bees fly to start new nests and how far workers fly to forage .
" These findings will allow us to manage landscapes in ways that are effective in conserving bumblebee populations , " she concluded .
A brain disorder ?
Neurobiologist Chris Connolly , of the University of Dundee , is leading research into the effect pesticides have on bees .
A single pesticide or miticide is not likely to be responsible … but a cocktail of different pesticides or miticides might [ have a combined effect ] to amplify the brain problem Chris Connolly , University of Dundee
In particular , his team will assess any possible damage to the insects ' abilities to gather food , navigate and even perform their special " waggle dance " , which they use to let other bees know where nectar can be found .
He said that the pollinators ' decline could be partially explained by a brain disorder - triggered by chemicals in pesticides .
" A single pesticide or miticide is not likely to be responsible … but a cocktail of different pesticides or miticides might [ have a combined effect ] to amplify the brain problem , " explained Dr Connolly .
His study will concentrate on identifying these dangerous combinations in order to advise farmers about how to avoid them in the future .
It will include fitting tiny radio frequency ID tags to pollinators , which will act like " barcodes at the supermarket " , recording when insects enter and leave the nest .
Image caption Wasps are also in decline
Other projects include investigating ecology and conservation of pollinators in cities , researching the impact of a mite named Varroa destructor , and looking into the effects of agriculture on bees .
The vital thing , Professor Watkinson stated , was for the scientists to communicate the results of their studies to the people in the field - beekeepers and farmers .
" It is imperative that the science that 's being done is fed through as quickly as possible to the conservationists and to the agricultural community , so that we can ensure food security and also the maintenance of our biodiversity , " he said .
A six - year - old girl died after becoming trapped in an electric gate in Manchester as her mother watched on helplessly .
Emergency services were called to the entrance to flats off Maine Road in Moss Side at about 1930 BST on Monday .
Semelia Campbell was caught between the rolling gate and a brick post .
Her mother Judith Gilroy tried to stop the gate with her fob key and then switched off the electricity but she was unable to save her .
A police officer smashed the motor on the gate to stop it closing further and pulled her out , a police spokesman said .
The youngster went into cardiac arrest and paramedics tried to help her .
They took her to the Royal Manchester Children 's Hospital where she died a short time later , the ambulance service said .
Ms Gilroy , who had moved to the new development three weeks ago , said Semelia was " beautiful " and " exceptional " .
Image caption Police smashed the motor on the gate to stop it closing further
She was playing with her friend when she became trapped in the gate , Ms Gilroy said .
" Maybe she thought she could just get through it and it closed on her , " she said .
" It would n't open and she just died .
" Living without her - I do n't see any point in living really . "
Ms Gilroy , 41 , called for a full investigation into the accident .
She said : " This should never have happened .
The gates are chained up now but they were not secured . "
Greater Manchester Police has started a joint inquiry with the Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) .
Developer ' shocked '
As the site is still under construction and the gate was in a communal area , the HSE must investigate the incident , a spokeswoman said .
A spokesman for Lowry Homes , which is building the development , said : " Lowry Homes is both saddened and shocked at the tragic incident at the Maine Road .
" Our thoughts are with Semelia Campbell 's family and friends at this time .
" The company is continuing to co-operate fully with the police and the HSE investigation and , in these circumstances , it is inappropriate for us to comment any further at this stage . "
Image caption Semelia was described as " a bubbly girl "
Tributes , including flowers and toys , have already started to be laid next to the wrought - iron gate .
One tribute read : " The best little sister anyone could wish for .
I still can't believe you are gone . "
Another read : " Rest in peace baby girl . "
Semelia 's headteacher at The Divine Mercy RC Primary School , Paddy Heneghan , also paid tribute to her .
He said : " Semelia was a lovely , bubbly little girl who loved school and who was very well liked .
" She was friends with everyone and always had a smile for her teachers and friends , many of whom she had known since she started in nursery three years ago .
" Semelia was in school on Monday , and staff as well as pupils have been understandably very upset at the news .
She is going to be very much missed by all of us . "
Police officers and HSE investigators remained at the scene on Wednesday .
The first Lebanon war and the Oslo Accords are missing from Israeli history textbooks , Haaretz has learned , while more recent events , such as the signing of the peace agreement with Jordan , are included .
The Education Ministry said in response that " naturally , not all historic events could be included in the curriculum . "
Some 10 days ago , public school history teachers received a handbook sent by the director of history education at the Education Ministry , Michael Yaron .
The handbook , titled " Subjects for the High School History Curriculum " sets down the topics history teachers are expected to cover over the three years of high school .
Open gallery view An Israeli classroom .

History lessons in high school are divided into two units , both mandatory for all students .
The second unit is further divided into the following two groupings : Nazism , anti-Semitism , World War II and the Holocaust ; and building the State of Israel in the Middle East .
The latter grouping includes all Israeli conflicts from the struggle for statehood to the 1973 Arab - Israeli war , followed by a section on the " peace agreements between Israel , Egypt and Jordan . "
In the past , the Education Ministry generally avoided teaching recent history , arguing that it takes 20 to 30 years to arrive at a historical perspective suitable for teaching young people .
However , skipping over the first Lebanon war and the Oslo Accords , but including the peace accords with Jordan as well as " Jewish immigration into Israel during the last 30 years of the 20th century , " appears to represent a deviation from the rule .
" The Education Ministry does n't like [ to address ] controversial issues like the first Lebanon war or the Oslo Accords , " a veteran history teacher told Haaretz .
" It 's not necessarily political , it 's more of a desire to avoid confrontation and keep things quiet . "
" This is wrong , even pedagogically , " the teacher continued .
" The so - called sensitive subjects are the most relevant ones and the most interesting to students . "
' Mapping out reality '
" Professionally speaking , this is a ridiculous and unreasonable decision , " said professor Hannah Yablonka of Ben-Gurion University , who chairs the ministry 's advisory committee on history education .
" The peace agreement with Jordan did n't appear in a vacuum , but as a result of the Oslo Accords .
But it 's more than that , these issues are existentially important .
Students need to know what the Palestinian Authority is .
This is part of mapping out reality . "
As for the Lebanon war , she said , " 28 years offers enough perspective on this particular event , especially if later events are taught in schools .
There 's no professional justification for these decisions . "
An Education Ministry official rejected the claims that the decision to exclude these subjects was political .
" A professional external committee staffed comprised of the best historians put together the curriculum from which these guidelines are derived , and which was published two years ago , " he said .
" There were plenty of arguments and deliberations within the committee before they agreed on a program that took into account not just historic events , but the fewer number of teaching hours allocated to history lessons . "
The chairman of the committee , Professor Yisrael Bartal of the Hebrew University , could not be reached for comment .
The Education Ministry also released a statement in which it said that " naturally , the curriculum cannot include all historical subjects and events .
The program includes the formative historic events of the Jewish people , which have led to the establishment of the Jewish Zionist state and which continue to remain relevant today . "
The Muslim Student Union at UC
Irvine should be suspended for one year for its involvement in repeated disruptions of a February speech by Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren , according to a disciplinary report released by the university .
The Muslim Student Union has appealed the recommendation .
The speech about U.S. - Israeli relations was interrupted 10 times by students who got up and yelled out things like , " Michael Oren , propagating murder is not an expression of free speech . "
Eleven UC Irvine and UC Riverside students were arrested and cited for disturbing a public event , but none have been charged .
The student group maintained that the disruptions were done by individuals and not organized by their group , but the report cited internal Muslim Student Union e-mails and meeting agendas that indicated they planned a disturbance .
The group 's attorney Reem Salahi emphasized that a suspension has not yet been implemented but was still disheartened by the report ’s recommendations .
“ It ’s collective punishment , ” she said .
“ You have an entire Muslim student body that ’s being punished for the actions of a few . "

MUMBAI : The Kurla police arrested a 20 - year - old youth for allegedly attacking a 23 - year - old man with a chopper at Indira Nagar in Kurla West early on Thursday morning .
Cops have launched a manhunt to find his two accomplices .
According to the police , the accused , Mohammed Dawood Khan , chopped off both the arms and one leg of the victim , Mohammed Wasim Khan .
The accused reportedly committed the crime after learning that the victim planned to marry his 19 - year - old sister .
Investigators said that the accused was against the relationship and would frequently engage in fights with the victim over it .
A week ago , he had even warned the victim to stop meeting his sister .
His sister , though , continued to see Wasim .
On Thursday , at around 2 am , Dawood asked his accomplices to call on Wasim who resides at Kasaiwada in Kurla East and ask Wasim to meet him .
Wasim , in his complaint , said , “ When I reached the spot , Dawood immediately started abusing me and and the next moment , he attacked me with a chopper and then fled from the spot . ”
Neighbours who witnessed the crime rushed Wasim to Sion hospital where he is recuperating from the grievous injuries that he has sustained .
“ The accused has been booked for attempt to murder .
The accused claimed that he had warned the victim in the past and since he did not obey him , he committed the offence , ” said Kurla police senior inspector Vijay Bagwe .
A recent post that was highly ranked on Hacker News complained about common git workflows causing him serious pain .
While I wo n't get into the merit of his user experience complaints , I do want to talk about his specific use - case and how I personally work with it in git .
Best I can tell , Mike Taylor ( the guy in the post ) either tried to figure out a standard git workflow on his own , or he followed poor instructions that tried to bootstrap someone from an svn background while intentionally leaving out important information .
In any event , I 'll step through my personal workflow for his scenario , contrasting with subversion as I go .
Cloning the Repository
The very first step when working with a repository is to clone it .
In subversion , this is accomplished via svn checkout svn://url / to / repo/trunk .
This retrieves the most recent revision of the trunk branch of the repository .
In git , this is accomplished via git clone git:// url / to/repo ( the http protocol is also possible ) .
This retrieves the entire repository , including other branches and tags .
Making the Change
In both git and subversion , you make the change using a normal text editor .
After Making the Change
In git , you make a local commit , marking the difference between the most recent pulled version ( master ) and the changes you made .
In subversion , the normal workflow does not involve making a change , but apparently some people make manual diffs in order to have a local copy of the changes before updating from the remote .
Here 's an example comment from the Hacker News post :
I 'll tell you what happens when I use svn and there 's been an upstream change : I never update my local tree with local modifications .
Instead , I extract all my local changes into a diff , then I update my local tree , and then I merge my diff back into the updated tree and commit .
When I need three - way merging , which is n't often - usually patch can resync simple things like line offsets - it 's handled by a file comparison tool .
I have a simple script which handles this
My personal process for making the commit in git almost always involves the gitx GUI , which lets me see the changes for each individual file , select the files ( or chunks in the files ) to commit , and then commit the whole thing .
I sometimes break up the changes into several granular commits , if appropriate .
Updating from the remote
Now that we have our local changes , the next step is to update from the remote .
In subversion , you would run svn up .
Here , subversion will apply a merge strategy to attempt to merge the remote changes with the local ones that you made .
If a merge was unsuccessful , subversion will tell you that a conflict has occurred .
If you did not manually save off a diff file , there is no way to get back to the status from before you made the change .
In git , you would run git pull .
By default , git applies the " recursive " strategy , which tries to merge your current files with the remote files at the most recent revision .
As with subversion , this can result in a conflict .
You can also pass the -- rebase flag to pull , which is how I usually work .
This tells git to stash away your commits , pull the remote changes , and then reapply your changes on top one at a time .
If you use -- rebase , you may get a conflict for each of your local commits , which is usually easier to handle than a bunch of conflicts all at once .
I definitely recommend using -- rebase which also provides instructions for dealing with conflicts as they arise .
In either case , in my experience , git 's merging capabilities are more advanced than subversion's .
This will result in many fewer cases where conflicts occur .
Resolving Conflicts
From here on , I am assuming you followed my advice and used git pull -- rebase .
If a conflict has occurred , you will find that if you run git status , all of the non-conflicting files are already listed as " staged " , while the conflicting files are listed outside the staging area .
This means that the non-conflicting files are already considered " added " to the current commit .
To resolve the conflicts , fix up the files listed outside the staging area and git add them .
Again , I normally use gitx to move the resolved files into the staging area .
Once you have resolved the conflict , run git rebase -- continue .
This tells git to use the fixed up changes you just made instead of the original commit it was trying to put on top of the changes you got from the remote .
In subversion , if you got a conflict , subversion will create three files for you : file .
mine , file .
rOLD , and file .
rNEW .
You are responsible for fixing up the conflicts and getting back a working file .
Once you are done , you run svn resolved .
NOTE : If you had not used git pull -- rebase , but instead did raw git pull , you would fix up the files , add the files using git add or gitx , and the run git commit to seal the deal
Yikes !
Something went wrong !
In git , if something goes wrong , you just run git reset -- hard , which will bring you back to your last local commit .
In subversion , it 's not always possible unless you manually stored off a diff before you started .
Pushing
Now that you 're in sync with the remote server , you push your changes .
In git , you run git push .
In subversion , you run svn commit .
One Glossed - Over Difference
Subversion allows you to commit changes even if you have n't svn up ed and there have been changes to the remote , as long as there are no conflicts between your local files and the remote files .
Git never allows you to push changes to the remote if there have been remote changes .
I personally prefer the git behavior , but I could see why someone might prefer the subversion behavior .
However , I glossed over this difference because every subversion reference I 've found advises running svn up before a commit , and I personally always did that in my years using subversion .
Comparison
Here 's a workflow comparison between git and subversion :
Operation git svn Clone a repository git clone git://github.com/rails/rails.git svn checkout
http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk
Preparing changes git commit ( using gitx ) nothing or create a manual diff Update from the remote git pull -- rebase svn up Resolving conflicts git add then git rebase -- continue svn resolve Resolving conflicts without -- rebase git add then git commit N/ A Yikes !
Rolling back git reset -- hard svn up - rOLD then apply diff ( only if you manually made a diff first )
Pushing git push svn commit
Note that I am not attempting to provide an exhaustive guide to git here ; there are many more git features that are quite useful .
Additionally , I personally do a lot of local branching , and prefer to be able to think about git in terms of cheap branches , but the original poster explicitly said that he'd rather not .
As a result , I did n't address that here .
I also do n't believe that thinking of git in terms of subversion is a good idea .
That said , the point of this post ( and the point of the original poster ) is that there are a set of high - level version control operations that you 'd expect git to be able to handle in simple cases without a lot of fuss .
There ’s a bunch of edifying new articles in the Israeli press this morning about the Flotilla incident earlier this week .
But I think the most apt may be Gideon Levy ’s column in today ’s Ha’aretz , not because it sheds any new particular light on the raid itself but because of what it says about the big picture which is basically that Netanyahu ’s vision of Israel living in an ‘ everybody ’s against us ’ world is drawing the country closer and closer to a world in which that ’s the reality .
In truth it goes beyond Netanyahu .
There are a painfully large number of core divisions within Israel — between hawks and doves ( though that one ’s become pretty imbalanced ) , between secular and religious , somewhat still between Ashkenazi and Mizrahi / Sephardi Jews .
But for these purposes , they overlap in another divide between those who see Israel and actually Jewry writ large as living in a fundamentally hostile world in which safety and security is only in their hands .
That ’s ‘ everyone is against us ’ .
And it ’s powerful because it ’s got a vast storehouse of history behind it .
This overlaps , albeit very imperfectly with the religious / secular divide , the Israel of Jerusalem versus the Israel of Tel Aviv .
In some way it is the mentality that allowed the ben Gurion generation to bring Israel improbably into existence ( though I would argue — and I like to discuss in greater detail at another point — that it was then much more in tune with and appropriate to the reality of the moment ) .
Then there ’s the other Israel , the other Jewry too , that recognizes enemies but sees Israel as not only a strong country in itself ( which is undeniable ) but one with powerful friends and vibrant economic ties — based on some of the most dynamic parts of the global economy .
This is why , to me , the precise circumstances of the raid on this flotilla are n’t really the issue .
It seems to me murkier than a lot of the accounts suggest .
But again , that ’s not the point .
The whole policy that it is a part of is simply flawed and deeply damaging to Israel ’s security , just as the continuation of the occupation itself is the biggest threat to Israel ’s security , bigger even than an Iranian bomb , I would say .
This is the strategic decision that Livni ’s Kadima party has made — that Israel ’s security is threatened fundamentally by the occupation and the mounting international isolation that it brings in its wake .
( It ’s in some ways also the decision Labor has made , though they ’ve perhaps unmade it contingently to be part of Netanyahu ’s coalition . )
Getting caught up on the details of this raid misses the point .
It ’s simply part of this larger story .
Netanyahu ’s policies are on their way to creating the world he imagines to be living in .
It ’s very sad for all involved .
Hamas will not allow goods from an aid flotilla raided by Israel to enter the blockaded Gaza Strip , a spokesman for the Islamist organization said Thursday .
Ahmed al - Kurd , Social Welfare Minister in the Hamas government which rules Gaza , said Hamas would block the aid cargo until Israel met all of the group 's conditions .
Israel must release all of the activists detained after Israel 's interception of the Gaza - bound convoy and transfer all , not just part , of the seized cargo , Kurd said .
He added that since the convoy was organized in Turkey , it was up to Ankara to decide whether to allow the goods to enter the Strip .
Israel said on Wednesday that it had released activists who traveled aboard the six - ship flotilla seized by Israeli commandos before dawn on Monday .
Several wounded in the raid , in which nine were killed , are still in hospital , however , while another three - an Irishman , an Australian woman and an Italian man - remain in Israeli custody .
An Israeli spokesman said eight trucks packed with goods taken from the flotilla are stuck at the Kerem Shalom crossing point , waiting to enter the Strip .
He denied Kurd 's claim that Israel has confiscated goods , saying Israel had not yet finished unloading containers from the flotilla .
Before the Israel Navy raid on Monday , Israel had vowed to transfer the flotilla 's aid cargo of to Gaza if the boats abandoned the attempt to reach Hamas - controlled territory and docked at the Israeli port of Ashdod for inspection .
When activists rejected the offer , Israel intercepted the convoy in international waters some 60 miles offshore .
Please sell me your car for cheap because it is not a very good one .
I quite liked my vehicle and was not overly happy about selling it .
To ensure a quick sale , I advertised it for $ 5200 - around half its market value .
Recently , I saw a used Bose Acoustimass subwoofer and speaker system , which retails for well over a grand , advertised for $ 200 ono .
I contacted the guy and wrote " excellent price , I will take it . "
I actually paid $ 250 because he threw in speaker stands and I had budgeted twice that amount for a system half as good .
I did not offer him $ 75 for it or haggle because selling an item , at a low price , for whatever reason you have , is trying enough without squirrels , like Brian , offering peanuts for it .
Squirrel Facts :
While squirrels have a varied diet , which includes nuts and corn , their favourite meal is the cheese quesadilla from Applebee 's for $ 6.69 .
Due to the fact that squirrels do not require oxygen and can withstand extreme pressures , they can often be found searching the ocean floor for their second favourite food , krill .
These deep sea abilities make the squirrel a perfect companion for skin divers as part of the buddy system .
Squirrels can also be taught to weld .
Squirrels are extremely territorial and protect their nests by attending neighbourhood watch meetings .
Squirrels prefer contemporary furniture over traditional .
A pile of empty flatpack IKEA boxes at the base of a tree is a sure sign that a squirrel nest is present .
There are approximately eighteen thousand varieties of squirrels but most fall into one of three categories : the red squirrel , the grey squirrel and the black bear .
As the chart below shows , there is a squirrel in the United States , one in what looks like Japan and a really big one in Africa .

Dear Brian ,
Thank you for your enticing offer .
I was moments away from swapping the vehicle for three magic beans so your timing is impeccable .
When I was about ten , I swapped my Standish Selecta 12 racing bike for a broken microwave oven .
Planning to construct a mind control ray , I connected the innards of the dismantled microwave unit to a tape recorder ( which repeated the words " Let David paint his bedroom walls black " ) and plugged it into the mains .
Unfortunately , the only results were being thrown across the room , receiving third degree burns to my hands and arms and forgetting how to do long division .
Disheartened that there have been only eighteen enquiries for the vehicle , despite it being advertised over an hour ago , I am not only prepared to deliberate your offer , but willing to throw in a pair of pants ( beige , size 32L ) and 4 kg bag of squirrel food to sweeten the deal .

Dear Brian ,
They are quite nice pants .
Squirrel food enables you to entice squirrels into your garden .
I often sit on my back deck watching them run back and forth excitedly like Ricky Lee at an ' all you can eat ' buffet .
I wish I was a squirrel .
Sometimes I talk to them and promise that if they speak to me I will not tell anyone else that they can do so .
They have n't yet .
I doubt I would be able to keep their secret anyway so it is probably for the best .
I have named one Brian .
Being an ugly squirrel , he was ridiculed by the others until I tied a shiny ribbon around his neck .
Now , as he passes , the squirrels point and declare " Look at that squirrel , he must be rich or a secret agent . "
In regards to fuel type , the vehicle runs on a special blend of 9000 octane rocket fuel and plutonium .
The tachometer reads 179,300 but has clocked several times due to the vehicle being capable of covering distances in excess of twenty thousand kilometres per second .
The advantage of this is that due to relativity , I always arrive several minutes before I leave .
Often , if I am very late for work , I simply drive around the block a few times and arrive before anyone else .
Once , when I misjudged the accelerator pedal for the brake while entering the carpark , I arrived at work the previous day and helped myself finish a project .
We then went for a beer together but having nothing much to say , we went our separate ways , promising to catch up sometime but probably wo n't .
If truth be told , he was kind of annoying and smoked all my cigarettes .
The address is Top of the Forest ( High Ground ) , 100 Aker Wood East .
It has a green door .
You can't miss it .

Dear Brian ,
The vehicle employs the same paint technology as the stealth bomber .
Sometimes it appears white and other times like a small shrubbery .
This has proven quite handy during police chases , especially in garden centres .
The interior boasts a myriad of colours thanks to hand quilted Mennonite seat covers while the ceiling features an eighteen by twelve metre mediaeval tapestry of some guy in armour stabbing a fat peasant for offering threepence for his horse .
I do have a CD player , thanks for asking , and although the vehicle does not , it does feature a Rank Arena record player in the boot .
As long as you do not exceed ten kilometres per hour and avoid speed bumps , the sound reproduction far surpasses that of compact disc technology .
Along with the pants ( beige , size 32L ) and 4kg bag of squirrel food , I will throw in the Boney M Christmas LP .

Dear Brian ,
I do apologise , I assumed from your initial offer that wasting each other 's time was the premise of our relationship .
The vehicle has been sold , at the asking price , but the pants ( beige , size 32L ) and 4kg bag of squirrel food are still available if you want them .
When I was young , I had an Auntie named Phyllis who owned a glue gun and believed home made presents were far superior to store bought ones - despite her artistic level being just below that of a blind quadriplegic monkey .
I once received , inside a large box with a shiny ribbon , a Christmas tree snowman ornament consisting of a foam ball with plastic hat , sequins for buttons and face drawn on with a Bic pen .
For my birthday .
In February .
Her presents were quietly refered to as " shit in a shiny ribbon . "
I 'm sure you will be much happier in your BMW .
As you drive down the street people will probably point and declare " Look at that guy , he must be rich or a secret agent . "

Dan Ariely , a professor of behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of a new book , “ The Upside of Irrationality , ” has studied why earlier adopters do what they do .
“ It ’s not about the cost - benefit analysis , ” he says .
And rarely is it a successful calculation of higher productivity , though many a person has tried to justify purchases of expensive toys that way .
It can be more about cementing one ’s identity .
Although people who want to be first with a product are n’t making a direct calculation —
“ I ’d pay $ 100 for my ego ” — they may derive value from showing off a new product or being perceived as being at technology ’s forefront .
“ I realized years ago that I derive great pleasure from buying a new gadget , ” said Professor Ariely .
“ I bought a Segway . ”
And public awareness may matter .
Professor Ariely says the behavior is akin to how we can be more willing to do something good if the public knows about it .
People will pay extra for a Prius , whose ecological benefits may be debatable , but be more circumspect about buying extra home insulation , which is one of the best ways to save energy .
Your friends will see you cruising in the Prius .
( Indeed , no car has driven so far on sanctimony . )
No one will ever see the extra two inches of R - 38 in your attic .
But even if you would never be the first in your neighborhood to buy a gadget , do n’t scorn the early adopters .
They are working for you .
“ They , in a sense , provide valuable services to other consumers by their willingness to serve as a guinea pig , ” said Jay Pil Choi , a professor of economics at Michigan State University , who wrote a much - quoted paper on herd behavior and the “ penguin effect . ”
On FOX News Sunday , Brit Hume , the reliable conservative voice , said that the massive oil spill in the Gulf validated environmentalists ' claims that drilling for oil off shore is dangerous and a catastrophe was just waiting to happen .
Wallace : Does this accident at the Gulf change your mind about the wisdom of offshore drilling and especially more offshore drilling ?
Hume :
No it does n't , but I think this .
Think about what the environmentalists have always said about this -- is , is it 's not a matter of if they 'll be a disaster of some kind resulting of this kind of offshore drilling , it 's only a matter of when .
This verifies that argument and becomes a powerful factor in the debate over what to do next .
I do n't see any way around the political reality that this will set back the cause of offshore drilling in the United States and it will set back the cause of making us less dependent of oil brought in from overseas for which we pay out of our national treasure , tons of money of to foreign countries .
We 're happy that Hume did n't try and denounce our complaints as if it was mere chance that this disaster happened .
Offshore drilling projects will do nothing about our energy crisis as we move forward and it's always been short sighted thinking even when Obama sets his eyes on it as well .
Brit even makes Kristol look more foolish than he usually is for saying we should be drilling closer to land .
If the reports are accurate , the oil is going to keep flowing for a long time and even the solutions they propose are no guarantees .
But the biggest leak , at the end of the riser pipe , which Fryar said was the source of most of the spewing oil , cannot be shut off in this way .
The company intends to address that leak by lowering a containment dome over it , and then pumping the oil to the surface .
That effort is at least six days away , Fryar said .
Another containment dome , for the third leak , on the riser near the wellhead , would follow two to four days after the first . --
" This is like doing open - heart surgery at 5,000 feet in the dark with robot - controlled submarines , " Lamar McKay , chairman and president of BP America , said on ABC's " This Week .
And as if our economy is n't bad enough , many jobs could be lost because of the spill as well as unconscionable damage to the ... environment .
Over the next two days , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said , the spill appeared likely to move toward the Mississippi and Alabama coasts and engulf the Chandeleur Islands off Louisiana 's southeast tip .
" The oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our Gulf states , and it could extend for a long time , " Obama said .
" It could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home . "

Given information has been taken from the broshure “ What changes and what does n’t change under the HST ” which the Government of Ontario sent to ontarians .
We ’ve spent many breaths detailing how your “ private data ” is n’t so private when it comes to social networks like Facebook and Twitter .
But despite your best efforts to thwart Mark Zuckerberg ’s attempt to make all your base belong to him , sometimes it ’s human error that ’ll be the end of you .
Like “ Joe , ” a closeted fella in a same - sex relationship who was outed by a friend on Twitter .
Newsweek ‘s Joshua Alston , in a responsible story about homosexuals that might undo a smidge of Ramin Setoodeh ’s damage to the brand , retells the foibles of his anonymous pal :
Several weeks ago , a friend — whom for these purposes we ’ll call Joe — came to me with a woebegone expression on his face .
When I asked him what was wrong , he confessed a digital dilemma .
A mutual friend had casually left a comment in Joe ’s boyfriend ’s Twitter feed that exposed their relationship .
Neither Joe nor his boyfriend is openly gay , and the pair had n’t planned on having that conversation with friends and family any time soon — if at all .
The fallout was relatively mild : a friend contacted Joe ’s boyfriend and asked for confirmation , which he reluctantly gave .
The offending tweet was quickly removed , so either no one else saw it , or whoever did chose to ignore it .
Joe was upset with our friend for sending the tweet , the content of which was a bit careless but totally benign , and my response to him was a combination of devil ’s advocacy and good old - fashioned tough love .
I told him that he and his boyfriend have the right to keep their relationship and their sexuality a secret , but there ’s only so much contortion they can expect from others in keeping up appearances .
The other bit of my advice was more immediate : if you want to be in the closet , you ca n’t be on Facebook and Twitter .
It ’s true .
The era of information overload means that no matter how much privacy to try to maintain , or how hard you try to keep your personal life personal , there will inevitably come a time when you simply do n’t have control over it .
It may come in the form of a Facebook wall post or tweet , or strangers viewing all the gay headlines ( from Queerty ! ) in your Google Buzz feed .
Funny that just two years ago the biggest problem with being gay on Facebook was not being able to join .
What ’s ironic , then , is that services like Facebook and Twitter are actually also fantastic for closeted queers .
They are lifelines to other people like you , with the same fears and anxiety you ’re facing living a double life .
So I would n’t recommend completely quitting the services , but a pseudonym here and there could n’t hurt — especially since your own network of friends can out you via algorithm .
Just remember : Nothing on the Internet is ever deleted .
And the CIA is spying on you .
I complained this morning about the Washington Post ’s disinterest in Bob Etheridge ’s altercation , but a reader shows me the New York City CBS affiliate has an innovative way of handling a news story that depicts a Democratic lawmaker in a bad light :

On the developer side of things , expect some more open source code be unleashed , including most importantly the rich text editor .
Ca n't say we 've really dug around in the service ourselves since its beta launched , but co-creator Lars Rasmussen tells us we should be giving it another go .
He further acknowledged that they 've got some work to do on educating users on the best ways to use the service , which at this point seems to be mid- and small - scale collaboration .
To that end , expect some new tutorial videos , and with any luck , some amusing animation .
WIMBLEDON , England --
Even the scoreboard could n't keep up .
The electronic sign keeping track courtside as the points passed and the game totals rose went blank while 23rd - seeded John Isner of Tampa , Fla. , and qualifier Nicolas Mahut of France played -- and played and played -- the longest match in tennis history , until action was suspended because of darkness at 59 - 59 in the fifth set Wednesday night at Wimbledon .
" Nothing like this will ever happen again .
Ever , " Isner said in a courtside TV interview .
The first - round match had already been suspended because of fading light Tuesday night after the fourth set .
They have been playing each other for exactly 10 hours -- 7 hours , 6 minutes in the fifth set alone , enough to break the full - match record of 6:33 , set at the 2004 French Open .
Never before in the history of Wimbledon , which was first contested in 1877 , had any match -- singles or doubles , men or women -- lasted more than 112 games , a mark set in 1969 .
Isner and Mahut have played more games than that in their fifth set , without a victor , although the American came close :
He had four match points but Mahut saved each one .
" He 's serving fantastic .
I 'm serving fantastic .
That 's really all there is to it , " Isner said .
" I 'd like to see the stats and see what the ace count looks like for both of us . "
Well , here they are : Isner has 98 aces , Mahut 95 -- both eclipsing the previous high in a match at any tournament , 78 .
All the numbers are truly astounding :
There have been 881 points , 612 in the fifth set .
Isner has compiled 218 winners , Mahut 217 .
Isner has only 44 unforced errors , Mahut 37 .
And this cannot be emphasized enough :
They are not finished .
No one won yet .
The match will continue , stretching into a third day .
" He 's just a champ .
We 're just fighting like we never did before , " Mahut said .
" Someone has to win , so we 'll come back tomorrow and see who is going to win the match . "
At 58 - all , more than 6 ½ hours into Wednesday 's action , both players took a bathroom break .
Not much later , shortly after 9 p.m. , Mahut and Isner approached the net to discuss with a Grand Slam supervisor , Soeren Friemel , whether to keep going Wednesday .
" I want to play , " Mahut said , " but I ca n 't see . "
Fans began chanting , " We want more !
We want more ! "
Then they proposed an idea to organizers , screaming in unison , " Centre Court ! Centre Court ! " -- the only stadium at the All England Club equipped with artificial lights and therefore the only place play could continue at that hour .
When Friemel decided they would stop at that moment and resume Thursday , spectators saluted Isner and Mahut with a standing ovation .
" I have almost no words anymore watching this .
It 's beyond anything I 've ever seen and could imagine .
I do n't know how their bodies must feel the next day , the next week , the next month .
This is incredible tennis , " defending champion Roger Federer said .
" For them to serve the aces they served and stay there mentally is a heroic effort .
As we know , we have no draws in tennis , so there will be a loser .
But I guess in this match , both will be winners because this is just absolutely amazing . "
Not that anyone will ever remember , because of what happened Wednesday , but for the record , Tuesday 's portion of the match went this way : Isner won the first set 6 - 4 ; Mahut took the next two 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 ( 7 ) ; and Isner claimed the fourth 7 - 6 ( 3 ) .
That portion lasted 2:54 , longer than many entire matches , but these guys were just getting started .
The first four sets encompassed a total of 45 games , less than half of the fifth set alone .
To put it in some more perspective :
The 2009 Wimbledon final between Federer and Andy Roddick was the longest Grand Slam championship match in history , running 77 games in all .
Mahut actually has some recent experience in such matters :
He won a four - hour match in the second round of qualifying last week that ended 24 - 22 in the third set .
Other Wimbledon competitors were glued to locker - room TVs , while some headed out to the court to see if they could catch a glimpse .
That was easier said than done , because the stands at the relatively tiny court -- its official capacity is 782 -- were full , and people packed in three - or - more deep along a railing overlooking the action .
" I do n't think I 'd move .
I think if you moved , you lose your seat , " Venus Williams said .
" It 's a marathon , " she added , then corrected herself : " It 's longer than a marathon . "
Roddick tweeted that it was " unreal . "
Isner and Mahut began Wednesday at 2:04 p.m. , with Court 18 bathed in sunlight and in heat that topped 80 degrees .
As play carried on shadows crept across the court , and the well - manicured blades of green grass along both baselines eroded away , leaving patches of beige dirt in their place .
Organizers moved other matches that were supposed to be played on Court 18 , and they also postponed Isner 's doubles match that happened to be on Wednesday 's schedule .
Because Isner served first in the fifth set , Mahut was faced with the difficult task of always trailing while serving , knowing that if he were to get broken he would lose .
Both players did show momentary signs of fatigue and frustration .
Know this :
Isner lost his only previous match at Wimbledon , exiting in the first round in 2008 , while Mahut lost in the first round at the All England Club each of the past two years .
Seeking some extra energy , Isner wolfed down a sandwich and sipped from a plastic bottle of water during one changeover , and he scarfed down a banana at another .
By the end of Wednesday , he was gritting his teeth on serves , rubbing his back between points and occasionally deciding not to chase shots .
During one break , Mahut was visited by a tournament doctor and given some pills to swallow and later had a finger taped .
After missing one shot , Mahut dropped to his knees and covered his head with both hands .
Even chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani , sitting in his perch long enough to have taken a trans -Atlantic flight , showed signs of fatigue .
He tried to stay loose by massing his neck or stretching his legs , and as the match dragged on , Lahyani paused while reciting the score , as if to make sure he had the count correct .
" This is one of the few times where I feel bad for the umpire , " noted official - berater John McEnroe joked on BBC 's TV coverage .
It might not necessarily have been the most scintillating tennis , given that so many points were so brief , often consisting of merely an unreturned serve , followed by both players shuffling along the baseline to get in position for the next point .
What the match was , without a doubt , was riveting from this standpoint :
Who would falter , even for a split - second , on a solitary stroke -- enough to finally turn control of things one way or the other ?
Who would wilt first physically or mentally ?
" Maybe they should agree to play a tiebreak , " 2008 Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic mused .
In sum , it was a test of wills , and of a sort tough to compare to another individual sport -- unless , perhaps , a golf tournament 's playoff extended for , say , 36 holes .
In team sports , which do n't really offer a true analogy , think of it as a baseball game that lasts 50 innings or a basketball game with 15 overtimes .
The longest Major League Baseball game in history lasted 8 hours , 6 minutes , with the Chicago White Sox beating the Milwaukee Brewers 7 - 6 in 25 innings on May 9 , 1984 .
And to think : Isner vs .
Mahut could have concluded much , much earlier in the day .
Isner held a match point all the way back in the 20th game of the fifth set , when he was ahead 10 - 9 with Mahut serving .
Mahut double - faulted twice to give Isner a break point and match point , but the Frenchman erased it with an ace .
10 - 10 .
Hard to believe , perhaps , but there was n't another break point or match point for either player until the 66th game of the set , with Isner ahead 33 - 32 .
Isner smacked a backhand return winner down the line to go ahead 15 - 40 , earning two match points , and then waved his right hand to signal to the overflowing crowd to cheer louder .
But he could n't convert either chance .
Mahut delivered a volley winner to erase the first and then a service winner on the second .
Two points later , Isner ceded the game by putting a forehand return into the net , prompting some fans backing Mahut to chant , " Nico ! Nico ! Nico ! "
33 -33 .
In the 71st game , with Isner serving , he faced a deuce .
Two more points for Mahut would have allowed the Frenchman to serve for the match .
But Isner delivered a second - serve ace at 124 mph , followed by a service winner .
36 -35 for Isner .
Mahut earned his first break points of the fifth set in -- believe it or not -- the 101st game , when Isner missed a forehand wide to fall behind 15 - 40 .
Isner saved the first with a service winner at 132 mph .
On the second , Mahut tried a lob -- perhaps not the ideal strategy against the 6 - foot - 9 Isner -- and the American hit an overhead winner .
Two more service winners ended the game .
51 - 50 for Isner .
An opening for Isner came in the 108th game , when Mahut missed a backhand , then a forehand , to fall behind 0 - 30 , putting the American two points away from victory .
But Mahut came up with a volley winner and then three consecutive aces .
54 - 54 .
In what would wind up being the final game of the day , with Isner ahead 59 - 58 , Mahut 's double - fault -- his 21st -- afforded the American one more match point .
Mahut delivered again , smacking an ace to get to deuce .
Isner then shanked a return long , crouched and bit his white T - shirt .
On the next point , Isner 's backhand return sailed wide .
59 - 59 .
And that 's where they will resume , once more , the 25 - year - old Isner and the 28 - year - old Mahut , striving to be better than the other just long enough to win .

I have obtained a copy of the almost - 600 - page BP Regional Oil Spill Response Plan for the Gulf of Mexico as of June , 2009 , thanks to an insider .
Some material has been redacted , but these are the three main takeaways from an initial read .
The name of the well has been redacted , but if it 's not Deepwater Horizon , then there 's another rig still out there pumping oil and aimed at Plaquemines Parish .
The three big takeaways , excerpted from Beninato 's blog post :
1 ) In the worst case discharge scenario ( on chart below ) , an oil leak was expected to come ashore with highest probability in Plaquemines Parish within 30 days
2 ) Spokespersons were advised never to assure the public that an ecosystem would be back to normal after the worst case scenario , which we are now living through .
3 ) Corexit oil dispersant toxicity has not been tested on ecosystems , according to the Oil Spill Response Plan .

Did anyone else write on these when you were a kid ?
I still do .
Remember the nineties ?
Remember Project Star ?
This program , and others like it , were put in place to cut class sizes and hire more educators to better educate California students .
Now , it seems that the more education - oriented people of the nineties who put Project Star and others like it in place are long gone .
Maybe they never existed .
Last year , our school – Torrance High – let go 21 teachers out of a total staff of about 130 teachers and administrative staff .
At the end of this year , we ’re told our school will drop from 111 teachers and administrators to 66 for next school year .
Several of our favorite teachers – in math , science , and English – have told us privately that they will be among the cuts .
Because our school makes these cuts strictly on seniority , it ’s always the newer teachers who go , the ones who connect so much better with us students .
Although we like and respect our older , more experienced teachers , these younger ones are more flexible in their teaching plans and are closer to us in age .
They understand us so much better .
So we ’re terribly sad to see their teaching careers end , at least for now .
Is n’t it just great that today ’s students will be left with a massive debt and without the proper mathematical skills to solve tomorrow ’s problems ?
You of the older generation , do n’t you think you ’re being a little selfish ?
You on the Left will say it ’s the Right ’s fault and the Right will say it ’s the Left ’s fault .
But you would both be wrong — and pointing fingers wo n’t fix anything anyway .
With the massive war expenses headed by the Right and the ever - expanding social programs of the Left , you are giving us difficult challenges and inadequate tools to fix them .
As you throw all of this money at unnecessary things , you also take our voices away .
You are setting us up to fail .
First , you ’re giving us impossible problems to solve — the war , the debt , and so forth .
Then you tie our hands by taking away the tools that would enable us to solve those problems , namely our best and most favorite teachers .
And finally you give us no say in the cuts .
Dude !
Really ?
We ’re not saying that students should have the right to fire teachers , but when there are mandatory layoffs , students should help in the decision - making .
As high school students , we have direct insight into this situation .
Last year , our high school lost so many teachers that one of us did not even have an English teacher for over a month .
Next school year , to accommodate these drastic staff cuts , the school plans to take class sizes from an average of 30 all the way to 43 .
Many of our classrooms are cut in half by dividers with a class taught on each side of the divider .
Now , with so many fewer teachers , they will have to take down those dividers to accommodate the larger number of students in each class .
We would much rather that teacher layoffs not be made solely on seniority .
We would much rather have teachers who have earned the student body ’s respect and who make campus life and our educations better .
Better yet , we would like you to find a way to keep these teachers , both for us and for the kids who will follow us .
Give us a voice .

California Proposition 14 may refer to three different and unrelated propositions proposed in California :
Ecuador President Rafael Correa says he has recalled the country 's ambassador to Israel for consultations in Quito following the deadly Israeli Navy raid against on a Gaza –bound flotilla .
In a statement released Wednesday night , the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry said the ambassador would leave Tel Aviv immediately , " as an act of protest against the attack which left civilians killed and injured . "
More Criticism UN's Ban : Israel must lift Gaza blockade immediately Yitzhak Benhorin Israeli authorities must provide ' full and detailed account ' of commando raid on Gaza - bound flotilla , UN chief tells reporters , adding that incident would have been avoided had siege been lifted .
Ambassador Shalev promises thorough investigation UN's Ban : Israel must lift Gaza blockade immediately
cut off its diplomatic ties with Israel .
" Nicaragua suspends from today its diplomatic relations with the government of Israel , " President Daniel Ortega 's communications chief Rosario Murillo said in a statement read on Radio Ya .
Managua " underscored the illegal nature of the attack on a humanitarian mission in clear violation of international and humanitarian law , " added Murillo , who doubles as poetess and first lady .
Nicaragua reiterated its support for the Palestinian people and urged an end to the blockade on the Gaza Strip .
Another attack on Israel came Wednesday night from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , who blasted the Navy operation with harsh words during a speech on local television : " Israel is a damned , terrorist and murderous country .
Long live the Palestinian people ! "
Chavez slammed the American response to the events , which he said was too gentle .
" The Obama administration condemns terror , as long as it's not committed by the US or Israel , " he said .
SC Green candidate David Kulma attends a meet - n- greet .
Three Democratic candidates address Rock Hill Rising .
Green Party candidate David Kulma attended a forum where retired Goldman Sachs executive Archie Parnell and two other Democrats addressed Rock Hill Rising .
March 15th in Rock Hill South Carolina a group of citizens took their virtual community to the “ real world ” by hosting a gathering of three contenders for the Democratic Party nomination in SC Congressional District 5 .
The seat will be decided in a special election to be held June 20th .
The opening was created when Mick Mulvaney resigned the seat to take a place in the Trump administration .
The event was sponsored by Rock Hill Rising at a local outlet of a small regional coffee house chain , Amelie ’s Bakery .
The three Democrats had been invited to address the group , one of dozens of Internet based activist groups across the state which sprung up in response to the Trump victory last November .
Three Democratic candidates , Les Murphy , Alexis Frank and Archie Parnell were invited to offer the group their views .
David Kulma , The South Carolina Green Party nominee , attended after securing a ticket to the event .
Kulma , a Winthrop University Adjunct Professor of Music for the past five years , will address Rock Hill Rising at their next regularly scheduled meeting at their invitation .
Kulma listened , took notes , and spoke with organizers of the event .
Parnell , the best financed of the three , served twenty years as an executive at Goldman Sachs as well as a ten year stint as a tax attorney for Exxon Mobil .
“ When I listened to Alexis Frank I thought she was fired up and ready to go . ” Kulma said .
“ She was n’t getting into many specifics but she was passionate and a good speaker . ”
Les Murphy , a former Marine who discussed the difficulties of returning to civilian life after service also spoke .
But Parnell was the person of the moment in that room tonight .
“ He seemed to project confidence .
He had more applause and laugh lines .
It was clear that he had spent a good deal of time being coached .
He presented himself well . ” said Kulma .
Liz Smith - Anderson of Rock Hill had submitted a question which was rejected by the sponsors .
“ I just wanted to know if the candidates think this is a Christian nation , why or why not .
A big part of the Trump agenda is driven by fanatical people who do n’t understand our nation ’s history . ” she said .
The Kulma campaign was launched only a week and a half ago , but the campaign is said to be building steam already .
In most Democratic and Republican congressional races $ 2500 checks are common .
But this “ people powered ” campaign has just broken past it ’s first $ 1000 fundraising barrier .
“ We do n’t take PAC money , we do n’t take corporate money , so we must ask for worker ’s money , as painful as that is . ” Kulma concluded .
A total of 15 candidates from of South Carolina ’s ballot qualified parties have filed .
Seven Republicans , three Democrats , an equal number of Libertarians , and a single candidate each have filed for the Green and American Party nominations .
One of the Libertarians has also filed to seek the Constitution Party nod .

Rhubarb , I ca n’t think of anything that brings me back to my childhood more .
It may sound a little strange , but I have extremely fond memories of our cabin in the Adirondacks and my Great Aunt Joe whenever I eat it .
It always seemed that when we visited my Aunt Joe , she had a fresh , homemade rhubarb pie ready for us , and I loved it .
This Sour Cream Rhubarb Dessert is an awesome way to use , eat , and enjoy this unique vegetable .
Rhubarb is a vegetable with a unique taste that makes it a favorite in many pies and desserts .
It originated in Asia over 2,000 years ago .
It was initially cultivated for its medicinal qualities , it was not until the 18th century that rhubarb was grown for culinary purposes in Britain and America .
It is often commonly mistaken to be a fruit but is actually a close relative of garden sorrel , and is therefore a member of the vegetable family .
Rhubarb is also rich in vitamin C and dietary fiber .
It is a cool season , perennial plant that is very winter hardy and resistant to drought .
Be sure to serve Sour Cream Rhubarb Dessert warm and topped with whipped cream .

Like everyone else on the frigin ' planet , I 've been watching the World Cup and going insane listening to the vuvuzela horns .
There 's been a couple articles lately about how to filter out the sounds - first this German article using a Mac and then this other article about how to do it using JACK and QJackCtl .
I did n't feel like installing anything overly complex on my Ubuntu box and figured it * must * be possible to do using just the basic sound tools that come with Linux .
It took me a little while , but using SoX ( Sound eXchange ) I was able to pipe sound from the default recording device ( my laptop 's mic / line - in ) , filter it , and then stream it immediately through the speakers .
( Just apt - get sox if you do n't have it on your box already ) .
Here 's the command :
rec -d vol .5 equalizer 233 .1o - 48 equalizer 466 .03o - 48 equalizer 932 .02o - 48 equalizer 1864 .2o - 24 | play -
[ Update : Yusuf Kaka responded in a post with a much more accurate set of arguments . :
rec -d | play -d vol 0.9 bandreject 116.56 3.4 q bandreject 233.12 3.4q bandreject 466.24 3.4q bandreject 932.48 3.4q bandreject 1864 3.4q
Very cool ! ]
Now , it seems to work , but after listening to it over and over again , I 'm starting to wonder how much of a real difference it makes .
In theory , it should be completely filtering out those frequencies ( 233 Hz , 466 Hz , 932Hz , and 1864 Hz ) at various bandwidths .
In practice it sounds more like it 's dulling those frequencies rather than removing them all together - you can still hear horn blasts - but you can hear the crowd and whistles as well .
rec and play just call the main sox binary , so you can use the same params to play back a sound file .
For testing , I recorded a bit of the Italy / Paraguay match into a .wav file using rec , and then used play like this to test the various filter settings :
play -v .5 gamesound.wav equalizer 233 .1o - 48 equalizer 466 .03o - 48 equalizer 932 .02o - 48 equalizer 1864 .2o - 24
The main problem is that I 'm just copying stuff I see on other sites , and not really technically understanding how audio works at all .
What 's bandwidth ?
Gain ?
What does it mean by clipping ?
And who the hell is Butterworth ?
Anyways , the command above is definitely filtering the sound , but I feel like it could be doing it * more * , I just can't figure out which numbers to tweak .
If you have some ideas , email or send me a tweet !

With the industry 's single biggest event of the year , and the event at which the next year or so of games gets announced - E3 just around the corner ( the event kicks off next week ) , the new game announcements are starting to come in thick and fast .
With Ubisoft confirming a few days ago that a new Driver game would be being unveiled at the event , our appetites were already thoroughly whet - but now our anticipation 's been put into fifth gear with the release of a new teaser trailer .
As is the way with all teaser trailers , this one certainly raises a few questions - not least of which being , will the new game be a remake of the 1999 PlayStation original ?
While the trailer does n't confirm it either way , we 've got our fingers crossed that it will be .
Those who 've played the original game will recognise the numerous references to the almost - impossible - at - the - time introductory training mission , which saw you performing a large number of stunts in sixty seconds , in order to impress your gangster would - be employers and earn the role of The Driver .
Taking it 's cues from 60's and 70's cop films , the game then put you in the role of an undercover cop , as you try to bring down a crime syndicate from the inside - completing missions for them as their getaway driver in order to prevent your cover from being blown .
The start of the trailer allows you to get a look at the driver 's driving license , naming him as " John Tanner " ( the hero of Driver 1 - 3 ) again hinting at the new game being a remake of the original , as he was written out of the series in Driv3r .
We 're hoping it 'll be a remake , as the first Driver was one of the finest ( and probably our favourite ) driving games ever , with the more recent instalments being slightly spoilt by the introduction of third person shooting sections .
Although , we still maintain that Driv3r was an amazing game .
We 'll have more info come E3 in a few day 's time , so check back then .
Crystals at the Crystal Palace :
The Mineralogical Display at the 1853
Crystal Palace Exhibit in New York City
by Daniel E Russell
the value and importance of our mines and ores can be most advantageously show by a series or suite of specimens of moderate size , taken from veins or deposits , so as to exhibit their average quality or richness .
This will be effected by taking specimens of the poor or lean ores , as well as those of unusual richness .
The series of specimens from each mine should include specimens of the minerals or associates found with the ore , and specimens of each wall - rock of the vein or bed .
To make the collection more instructive , it is desirable to have drawings exhibiting the geological formation of the localities from which the ores are taken .
It is important that all the specimens be uniform in size and shape , and distinctly characteristic of the part of the vein they are intended to represent …
In addition , the Association invites the exhibition of choice American minerals , possessing peculiar beauty or interest , which may be in public colleges or private collections .
Such specimens will be carefully handled and arranged by competent mineralogists , so as to insure their safe return .
( New York Times , 2 Feb 1853 )
One department , at least of the World ’s Fair will not be devoid of interest or value .
Measures have been taken for the establishment of a Class in the Exhibition which shall provide a perfect collection of the Mineral and Metallic productions of this country , arranged under the eye of experienced scientific men , and classified in such a manner as to be a daguerreotype of the resources of every State in the Union .
The enterprise is just making its way into public notice , and we have received copies of numerous circulars relating to its management .
The promise of the Exhibition is fair , and its results are no doubt destined to achieve important in the popular knowledge of such matters .
The vast mineral resources of the United States are not generally appreciated as they should be .
Our industrious population is half unaware of the riches that yet lie undeveloped .
The hand of Science is invoked to bring out the secret , and the approaching Exhibition will afford the first fitting opportunity to accomplish the work .
The World ’s fair Association , deeming it an important subject of inquiry to institute investigations into the quality and amount of the yield of the Mines scattered through the country , some time since made arrangements for the exhibition of such products , in a separate department of the Fair .
It will be known as Class I of the Exhibition , and is placed in charge of Professor Benjamin Silliman , Jr. , and Mr. William P. Blake – two gentlemen well known to the scientific world , and whose names are a sufficient guaranty that the classification and conduct of the Department will reflect credit upon the work .
To have placed a Department of this character in incompetent hands would have been but a farcical performance .
As it is , we may hope for a satisfactory exposition of an interesting subject .
The requisite completeness of the enterprise has appeared to indicate the necessity of a geographical arrangement of the specimens furnished for exhibition .
A purely scientific classification , it was thought , would scarcely impart so satisfactory an impression .
The specimens will accordingly be placed that the mines of each State shall be represented , and when a vein intersects two adjoining States , a similar arrangement will be observed at the Fair .
The specimens should be of uniform dimensions , as nearly as may be – say five or six inches square , and two inches in thickness – each representing the distinctive characteristics of the vein whence it is taken .
The cooperation of directors of mines , of private individuals who possess cabinets , and of scientific Societies is invited .
It is very desirable that this department should be very well filled and carefully arranged at as early a day as possible .
We understand that several valuable specimens of precious metals are already amoung the contributions … ( New York Times 29 March 1853 )
The ascribed cause has no connection with the condition of the cabinets .
Professor Silliman has been ill , but I am happy to stay is now in a state of well - established convalescence .
But his sickness did not , and could not , retard the preparation of the cabinet …
Professor Silliman , from an ample knowledge of the whole subject , and of the scientific ability necessary to develop it , has selected a gentleman to make this development , who , within my acquaintance with the scientific men of the country , has no equal .
I allude to Mr George J Brush , of Brooklyn .
His selection for the arduous duty of arranging the mineral cabinets , on the proper plan , proposed by Professor Silliman , is an abundant testimony to his merits …
Professor Silliman has no more thought of interfering with the labors he has assigned to Mr. Brush , than of showing him how to drive a nail ; and Dr Silliman ’s sickness has not had the slightest bearing on the labors of Mr. Brush .
… The room in which the cabinet is to be arranged was not even partially ready for Mr Brush until last Monday night ; and even now the painters are at work upon it .
The fault of the backwardness of the preparation of the cabinet of minerals is not , therefore , due to the illness of Professor Silliman , but exclusively belongs to the managers of the Exhibition .
( New York Times , 26 Aug 1853 )
the visitor will see many large and splendid specimens from some of our mines and coal fields , a great number of rich pieces of ore , rare minerals , and petrifactions ; also a display of gold ores and bars of a value of more than $ 28,000 under glass cases , but he will seek in vain for particulars to enable him to form an idea of the geological formations and mineral resources of the different States of our Union .
He will see the glass cases with cards attached , bearing the names of “ Pennsylvania ” , “ Maryland ” , “ New York ” etc. , and a number of specimens are labelled with the names of mining companies and private individuals , and here and there we were happy to find a mineral with its own name attached .
Simple rocks , pieces of the great bulk of our globe , " samples of the country , " which the geologist is always looking for in addition to those mineralogical fruits and flowers in the shape of ores and crystals , seem in general to be considered of too little importance to find a place in the collection .
What we expected to find was a systematically arranged collection of all minerals of our country , each one bearing its name upon it , for the purpose of information to t lie people and to serve as contributions to science .
But what we found was a “ fine show ” , a splendid display of valuable ores and “ rarities ” .
As to the arrangement , the German collection would have served as an admirable guide to a scientific method .
After all , our judgment of the Exhibition may be premature .
It was not surprising that nearly all visitors to the Mineralogical Cabinet , should be curious to see the gold of California , of which the world has heard so much of late years .
Fortunately , the enlightened zeal of the well known commercial and financial agents , Adams & Co. , enabled this inquiry to be answered in the most satisfactory manner .
Their collection from the California gold washings embraced not only several nuggets of a remarkable size and great variety of form and complexion , but it included ounce specimens from nearly every washing or place of any note , to the number of over two hundred .
It was very curious and instructive to observe the characteristic differences which these samples of diluvial gold presented , both in color , form , and the size of the grains , a difference so marked and constant , as to guide the eye of an experienced person in deciding the origin of the samples .
Among the larger specimens , were a few which were remarkable for the beauty of their crystalline structure .
One large mass especially , containing about $ 900 in value , had its gold disposed in large and well formed skeleton octahedra , joined in symmetrical forms by their apexes , the whole sustained on a gangue of clean quartz , and wonderfully well preserved from the wearing effects of water , usually so prominent in all nuggets …
Including the ingots and coins , ( all struck in California , and mostly by private assayers ) , the value of this collection of gold was declared at over $ 80,000 .
The region of northern New York , including especially the counties of Jefferson , St. Lawrence , and Essex , has long been remarkable for the very fine crystallized minerals which it produces .
It is believed that the collection of the species there found was more completely represented in the Crystal Palace , than ever before in any one cabinet .
The selections from the cabinet of Hamilton College , by Professor O. Root , that from the cabinet of Mr. Wilder , at Hoosick Falls , that from the cabinet of Judge Dodge of Gouverneur , and many unique specimens from the cabinets of Mr. Vaux and others , gave great beauty and completeness to this portion of the display .
The species shown from this region were chiefly apatite , green hexagonal crystals in white limestones , two were over eight inches long , and one doubly terminated , and one fragment of a crystal , believed to be the largest individual of this species ever found , which measured eighteen inches in length , by over six inches in diameter , and when entire , was estimated to have weighed over fifty pounds ; large and distinct crystals of phlogopite ( one of the mica family ) ; calcite , of rare form , size , and transparency ; zircon , in large hair brown transparent crystals ; tourmaline , in highly complex forms of brown color ; fluorspar , in gigantic cubes ; celestine , in clear blue crystals on calc - par ; Millerite ( sulphuret of nickel ) , in capillary crystals : and among more common species , but remarkably well crystallized , may be named galena ; iron pyrites , highly modified ; yellow copper ; specular iron , etc. , etc .
From the region of Lake Champlain , a large mass of finely crystalline graphite is worthy of remark , from Ticonderoga ; several large crystals of allanite , from Crown Point , both exhibited by Mr. W. P. Blake .
The allanite is in crystals of unexampled size , and this hitherto rare mineral promises to be abundantly furnished by this locality .
The metallurgical resources of the State of New York were represented by the iron ores and furnace products from Orange county , etc. , as may be seen more particularly by reference to the Catalogue .
The lead region of St. Lawrence county has been again brought into notice , and the ores from several of the mines were collected , or sent in by their proprietors .
The " Ulster Mining Company " exhibited a notable mass of galena , specked with yellow copper ( in the Yard ) , weighing several tons , and some showy specimens of the yellow copper of this mine , in huge well formed crystals , standing upon tables of large and transparent quartz crystals , were shown by Mr. Vaux and others .
The specimens of sphene and scapolite , from Lewis county , shown by Mr. Bourue , Mr. Vaux , Mr. Wilder , and others , are among the most memorable mineralogical products of New York , but are certainly surpassed in interest by the monster spinels of Monroe , Warwick , and other neighboring towns of Orange county , which have been brought to light by the exertions of Messrs .
Horton and Jenkins , of Monroe .
Some perfect and well modified black octahedra have been found , and were exhibited over 4 inches in diameter , and groups of a much larger size .
The well known species hornblende , Biotite , and many others , for which this county is so celebrated , were also fully represented .
These species were included in the selections from the cabinets already named .
The copper veins of this State have lately attracted much attention , and were fully represented by the collections of Mr. Blake and Dr. Genth , as well as by the larger specimens sent on by proprietors .
The copper exists almost solely as yellow pyrites ( double sulphuret of copper and iron ) , in veins of quartz .
Dr. Genth states the interesting fact that , in all the cases in which he has examined this ore , it is auriferous ; and the circumstance is well known , that nearly all , if not all , the North Carolina copper veins were formerly worked as gold veins .
Above water level , the decomposing influences of air , water , frost , etc. , have removed the sulphurets , leaving the gold in the oxide of iron , or gossans .
The same fact holds true in Virginia , that , in many mines , the gold has apparently run out in depth , being replaced by copper pyrites .
The truth is , probably , in all these cases , that the quantity of gold is as great in depth as it was at the surface ; but it is in a form not to be procured by washing and amalgamation , and in which it can only be obtained by a circuitous method , involving a furnace process .
In North Carolina , the region productive in copper , etc. , appears to be confined chiefly to the counties of Guildford and Mecklenburg . .
The crystalline slags from Easton , exhibited by Dr. Swift , and by Professor Silliman , have not yet received a chemical examination , such as they demand .
Their beautiful distinctness as crystals , often transparent , produced by art , excites our admiration and invites an extended investigation into the circumstances of their origin .
It is worthy of remark in this connection , upon the statement of Dr. Swift , that of two furnaces , in different sections of the same district , but supplied with the same materials and ores , the one produces crystalline , and the other amorphous slags .
These furnaces are represented in the Exhibition by the proprietors , Messrs .
Cooper & Hewitt , Dr Wetherill , in his researches among the slags of a great number of iron furnaces in Pennsylvania , found but few which furnished distinct crystals , and but one among them all that showed the red oxide of titanium ( as it has been erroneously called ) so common among the slags of some Welsh furnaces .
The Foreign Exhibits
“ The mineralogical portion of the foreign department was … chiefly indebted for its beauty and attractiveness , in the eyes of scientific mineralogists and collectors , to a brilliant suite of well chosen crystallized minerals , selected from all the great mineral and mining districts of Europe by Dr. Augustus Krantz , of Bonn on the Rhine , who is well known as a dealer in minerals .
This suite embraced specimens from Prussia , Saxony , the Hartz , Thuringia , Baden , Hanover , Nassau , Transylvania , Hungary , Bohemia , Tyrol , Switzerland , Italy , France , Scandinavia , and Russia .
Many of the specimens were such as are rarely seen even in Europe in such fine condition , and the whole offered much pleasure to mineralogical collectors .
More useful , probably , because within the reach of young students and of teachers , were the select cabinets of well characterized minerals and rocks , designed for instruction .
It is one proof of the utility of the Exhibition , that several of these latter collections were sold to students and teachers from those exhibited , the price being moderate and the specimens excellent .
Saxony –
This ancient and almost hereditary seat of mining was admirably represented by a well chosen suite of characteristic specimens , selected by authority of the Royal Saxon Mining College in Freiberg .
It embraced the ores of silver , lead , antimony , copper , bismuth , and their associate minerals .
The specimens were , many of them , large , showing the character of the entire vein from which they were taken ; and these were selected from several of the best known mines .
As a suite calculated to convey accurate ideas to the student , with regard to the distribution and character of metallic veins , nothing could be better .
The Royal Bavarian Director General of Mines , at Munich , also sent a large suite of specimens , both mineralogical and geological , illustrative of the mineral resources of that kingdom .
Especially worthy of mention in this collection , was that part which embraced the rock salt , gypsum , and anhydrite , from the saliferous region ; and the whole series was put up and ticketed with characteristic German exact neatness .

In July , 1853 , the New York Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations ( better know as the “ New York Crystal Palace ” ) opened its doors to an eager public .
The Exhibition contained a dizzying array of objects , ranging from fine European paintings to house paint , from the newest farm implements to precision steam engines , from .
Goverments from around the globe used the exhibition to showcase the best their nation had to offer , be it raw resource of finished product .
Manufacturers also displayed their wares .
The Crystal Palace Exhibition was , more than anything else , a celebration of the fruits of the Industrial Revolution .
One of the key areas of the exhibition was to be a large mineralogical display which would showcase the rich resources possessed by the United States .
The display would consist of specimens of ores and minerals from the four corners of the nation to create a detailed catalog of America ’s wealth .
It was intended that the “ mineralogical department ” of the fair would also show examples of foreign minerals .
The New York Exhibition was closely , almost slavishly , patterned after the Crystal Palace Exhibition held in London in two years previously .
The London Exhibition is usually marked as the first World ’s Fair .
Formally known as “ Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations ” , it became better known in the minds of the public as the “ Crystal Palace ” after the enormous , iron - and - glass building in which the exhibition was housed .
The London Exhibition was stunningly successful .
Envious American investors wanted the prestige ( and profits ) of such an event on US soil .
Before the London Exhibition had even closed its doors , newspapers were carrying demands that a second World ’s Fair be erected in America , with New York City suggested as the likely host .
A Boston carriage manufacturer named Edward Riddle created a coalition of New York City bankers and investors ( the “ Association for the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations ” ) to finance the effort .
Theodore Sedgwick was elected its President .
After successfully negotiating with New York City for the use of a parcel of land known as “ Reservoir Square ” ( today , the site of Bryant Park and the New York Public Library in midtown Manhattan , at the corner of 42nd Street and 5th Avenue ) , construction began on a huge cast iron and glass building that closely mimicked the Crystal Palace of London .
Sedgwick declared that the New York Crystal Palace would open to the public on May 1st , 1853 .
More than 15,000 panes of glass and 1,800 tons of iron would be assembled into an gargantuan cross - shaped structure , dominated at the center by a 100 foot diameter dome that that towered 123 feet above the City .
On January 20th , 1853 , Sedgwick issued a formal statement to the newspapers that “ it is the wish of this Association , in furtherance of the general desire … to render their Exhibition not a mere display of various and attractive objects , ” but instead offer a “ full representation of the varied and extensive Mineral resources of the United States .
” Calling on the “ Proprietors of Mines , Metallurgists , Chemical Manufacturers , Coal Companies and Owners of Cabinets ” ( mineral collections ) to assist with the effort of the New York Exhibition ’s mineralogical department , Sedgwick observed that Only five months remained to accomplish such a sweeping proposal .
In mid-March , the “ Mineralogical Department ” was placed under the management of , a 37 year old chemistry professor and mineralogist at Yale University .
It was an extremely politic choice , as his father was one of the foremost scientists in America , and Benjamin Jr. had strong ties to the eastern US mining industry .
Second in command wasa prominent New York City mineralogist and mining geologist .
Regretfully , Blake ’s tireless services were lost when he was tapped to serve as mineralogist and map - maker for an expedition under the command of Lt. R S Williamson , one of four by the US government charged with finding a path for the proposed trans - continental railroad .
Blake composed a circular which was mailed to mining companies and foundries across the United States , explaining the needs of the Exhibition ’s mineral display and asking them to forward appropriate specimens .
Silliman later complained “ … that the only way in which specimens were got at all , was by going or sending for them in person , or by special agents .
Not one in a hundred of all the circulars of invitation addressed to mine owners and collectors ever received so much as an answer .
One who has not himself attempted it , has any idea of the labor , delay , and vexation attendant upon the accumulation of such a collection .
The most powerful of all inducements ( self interest ) was wanting , in a majority of cases in this department , to tempt people to forward their specimens .
” Scrambling to gather the required specimens for display , Silliman asked a former Yale student , , to accompany him on a trip to the “ lead and copper mines ” of Chester County , Pennsylvania .
This was the famous Phoenixville Mining District , the source of fine specimens of pyromorphite , and the French Creek Mines , which produced a host of large , well crystallized chalcopyrite crystals .
There they were permitted to select specimens from the cabinet of Charles M. Wheatley , owner of the Wheatley Mine in Pheoenixville , whose personal mineral collection would eventually number more than 6,000 specimens .
Brush also paid a call on John Ehlers , a Hoboken , NJ mineral collector , and was permitted to select a “ suite of Mexican silver ores which that gentleman 's long residence in Mexico had enabled him to collect from fourteen of the most remarkable of the Mexican mines . ”
Brush would eventually replace Blake as Silliman ’s assistant , charged with the critical duty of actually arranging the exhibit .
Before heading west , Blake went to the “ iron regions of Lake Champlain , and the phosphorite deposits of the same region ; the zinc deposits of New Jersey , and of Bethlehem , Pennsylvania ; the chrome and copper works at Baltimore , and a portion of the gold regions of Virginia .
Subsequently ( in company with J. D. Whitney , Esq. ) , Mr. Blake made a special journey to the copper regions of North Carolina , and that of the Haiwasse , in Tennessee ” ( “ the Haiwasse ” would later become better known as the Ducktown Copper District .)
Other period luminaries who Silliman deputized as official “ special agents ” of the Great Exhibition to help assemble the collection of ores and minerals included : , noted analytic chemist and botanist of Amherst College , who visited numerous persons and mines in Massachusetts , Rhode Island , and Vermont on behalf of the Great Exhibition . , the analytical chemist of Philadelphia who would , a few years after the exhibition closed , become professor of mineralogy at the University of Pennsylvania , traveled through northern New York , Maryland , Virginia , and North Carolina , in an effort to secure exhibits .
“ The cabinet is indebted to him for specimens … with great judgment and care ; for suites illustrative of the metallurgic processes of the iron , lead , and copper smelting works of the same regions ; and also for the assiduity and tact with which he induced the proprietors of valuable cabinets to loan from them to the Association such specimens as he selected , and often such as could be procured in no other way . ” , M. D. , professor of chemistry , pharmacy , and mineralogy at Dartmouth College , New Hampshire ( and who has assisted Charles Goodyear in the discovery of the rubber vulcanization process in the 1830’s ) , was commissioned to make a collection of New Hampshire ’s minerals . •
Dr. , of Philadelphia was a member of the Academy of Science and analytical chemist who , in addition to mineralogy , possessed an interest in agriculture .
In later years he would be appointed as chemist to the US Department of Agriculture by President Lincoln and found the laboratory that would evolve into the Food and Drug Administration .
Because time was growing short , Wetherill was asked to visit only the mines of the eastern part of Pennsylvania , but enabled the Great Exhibition to display examples of the “ ore , fuel , flux , slags , and manufactured products ” of 54 different iron furnaces from that state . , a Bavarian immigrant who served as staff assayer at the Bristol Copper mine in Connecticut , was asked to visit the iron region which overlapped the boundary between New York and Connecticut , the copper , lead and cobalt mines of Connecticut , and the lead mine of Northampton , Massachusetts , “ selecting and forwarding specimens from numerous proprietors , and some private cabinets .
He also visited and collected the ores of the copper region of the Blue Ridge in Virginia , sixty miles from Alexandria , at Manassas Gap Meanwhile , the New York Times reported : Major construction delays resulted in the opening of the Crystal Palace Exhibition being postponed more than two months .
Faced with either breaking the mineralogical exhibit up onto fragments displayed in different areas of the building , it was decided to relocate the mineral section to the Machine Arcade .
Problematically , the construction of the Machine Arcade was not yet complete , effectively derailing the schedule for installing the exhibit .
The bulk of the Crystal Palace Exhibition was ready to open to the public on July 14th , 1853 .
On that day , President of the United States Franklin Pierce was on hand to formally inaugurate the New York Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations .
Poets sang psalms and philosophers waxed eloquent about the grand accomplishments of the human race as demonstrated by the might of industry .
The glass cathedral known as the Crystal Palace was heralded as “ The Temple of National Industry . ”
A single - day admission to the Exhibition cost 50 ¢ for an adult , and 25 ¢ for a child ; season tickets were $ 10.00 .
The Mineralogical Department was a noteworthy absence , crippled by the incomplete construction in the Machine Arcade .
Towards the end of August , a letter appeared in the New York Herald noting that the mineral exhibit still had not opened , and stating that the reason was that Silliman was “ lying dangerously ill ” in his home at Yale .
One of Silliman ’s colleagues – possible Blake – wrote a response in the New York Times , signed only “ Veritas , ” describing the situation more fully : Workmen were still putting the finishing touches on the Mineralogy Department as of September 6th .
Silliman lamented “ had this long delay been foreseen at the outset , the collections might have been rendered more complete from the remote sections of the United States , as it would have been practicable to have sent special agents to the most distant mining districts in the Eastern United States , to collect specimens .
This system of sending special agents was adopted from the outset in all the Atlantic States , the Association having liberally placed means at the disposal of the Director to employ the services of gentlemen eminent in this department to act for the Association in the collection of facts and specimens illustrating the mineral resources and industry of the United States .
” It was not until late September , more than two months after the inauguration of the Exhibition , that the Mineralogy Department was finally opened to the public .
One visitor complained that while the exhibit was finally opened , “ at the end of the first week , and even at the end of the first three weeks afterwards the collection still remained unarranged , and no catalogue was to be had .
” The Mining Magazine for November , 1853 reported : Clearly stung by the comments , Silliman responded that “ all the most interesting and important specimens had their names attached to cards , placed in front of each specimen , before the 10th of October , or within a fortnight after the room was thrown open to the public .
” After the dust settled , Silliman had the opportunity to note some of the highlights of the State - level displays at the Great Exhibition :
The display for California contained “ two masses of cinnabar from the New Almaden Mines , near San Jose , Alta California , weighing many hundred pounds , were remarkable for their great purity and size giving promise , from what we already know of the surprising extent of the deposits , of an inexhaustible supply of quicksilver , where it is much wanted , and at a point whence it can be easily supplied to the whole Pacific coast . ”
While the New Almaden mines were , in fact exhaustible , their enormous outpouring of mercury helped fuel the US gold recovery industry for many decades .
The exhibit of California gold , however , excited the greatest attention .
This display was coordinated by Adams & Co. , a San Francisco company .
The company had started in 1840 ’s Boston as an express company , carrying small parcels and other valuables between that city and New York .
They expanded to California in 1849 , offering a secure way of transmitting gold from San Francisco to New York City via Panama .
The company created subsidiary offices in more than 50 different mining districts in California .
They were the perfect choice to speak as the common voice of the gold districts of California .
In addition to the gold specimens , Adams and Co. offered “ a specimen of eight or ten ounces of iridosmine , so much valued from its hardness in pointing gold pens , was shown with the gold of Messrs .
Adams & Co. , being obtained as an insoluble residue at the US Mint , in the process of refining the gold .
It was easy to select from among the grains those which retained the hexagonal form and tin white color belonging to this rare mineral . ” [ “ Iridosmine ” is today classified as simply an iridium rich variety of osmium ]
The highlight of this state ’s display was , of course the chalcocites ( “ copper glance ” ) from the Bristol Copper Mine .
A suite of specimens were on provided by the mine agent , Mr. H. H. Sheldon .
But even more spectacular were specimens from the cabinet of Union College , in Schenectady NY .
“ These remarkable crystallized forms of glance copper are now well known by mineralogists , the world over , but such large and fine specimens were never before shown publicly . ”
The amazing loan from Union College was not surprising , since the school ’s President , Eliphalet Nott , was also President of the Bristol Mining Company .
An enormous crystal of columbite , weighing over 2 ½ pounds , was displayed from Haddam , Connecticut .
Silliman noted it was “ tabular in form from the extension of the plane M. Most of the lateral planes are preserved , while the lustre and metallic tarnish of the surface are well displayed . ”
Also from Haddam were two crystals of beryl , “ such as have been found only there , with the terminal plane , so perfect in surface and polish , that when one crystal is , placed upon the other the exclusion of air is so complete , that the one crystal lifts the other .
These terminal planes are of a transparent light green color , veneered , as it were , upon the summit of the prism , whose shaft is of a milky pale green color ; the lateral planes are distinct , and strongly marked with rhombic lines .
These specimens were also from the cabinet of Professor B. Silliman , Jr. , and fine examples from the same planes were shown by Mr. Vaux and Messrs .
Clay of Philadelphia .
” Apparent , the only specimens of note from Delaware were of the “ fine cleavable feldspar , from New Castle , Delaware ( exhibited by Mr. J. Jones ) … well known from the use which has been made of it as a porcelain material .
” As could be expected , Maine ’s exhibit highlighted the state ’s gem elbaite .
Centerpiece of the display were “ three crystals of green and red toumaline , discovered many years since at Paris , by Professor C. U. Shepard , and exhibited by him , are probably the most unique specimens of this species ever seen .
The color is lively grass green to ruby red , the opposite ends of one and the same crystal presenting these two colors ; perfectly transparent in some parts , and again , filled with cracks .
The crystals are nearly two inches in diameter , and before being cut , nearly three inches long , and terminated with the rhombic planes .
Portions from these crystals have been cut , and form gems of rare beauty and value .
These crystals were found loose in the soil , more than twenty five years since , by the exhibitor .
” The products of greatest economical interest ” from Maryland “ were the chrome ores and manufactured products , and the copper and cobalt ores of the Patapsco Company , as well as the copper ores from Carroll and Frederick counties ( and ) the iron ores …
” “ One of the remarkable mineralogical novelties of the collection ” were examples of the spodumene from “ Norwich , Massachusetts ” ( the town later changed its name to Huntington ) .
This is the famous Walnut Hill Pegmatite locality , which produced exceptionally large and well crystallized spodumene crystals – one of which was 16 ½ inches long and 10 inches wide .
“ This mineral was first observed in crystals at this locality , by Messrs .
Hitchcock , Jr. , and Hartwell , in 1850 .
The former of these gentlemen exhibited several very large crystals of this spodumene , and Professor B. Silliman , Jr. , showed the two most interesting forms which have hitherto been observed , one , the same figured in Dana 's Mineralogy , 3d ed. p. 693 , and another hemitroped [ twinned ] on the plane M. ”
The same locality provided “ crystallized alluaudite ” ( triphylite ) commonly associated with the spodumene crystals .
In 1850 ’s America , Michigan was virtually synonymous with copper .
It was one of the few states to directly fund their representation at the Great Exhibition .
Centerpiece of their contribution was “ a mass of native copper , cut from the lode of one the North American Mining Company 's mines , weighing 6,300 pounds .
This mass was cut into a rectangular form .
Portions of the epidotic gangue or veinstone were adhered to the upper surface , but the sides were clean cut surfaces of pure copper , upon one of which was engraved the locality and weight .
Many other very large masses of copper were exhibited by different miners in the Lake Superior region , of which that from the Minnesota Mining Company weighed over 5,000 pounds . ” Missouri offered “ an extensive suite of the ores of copper , lead , and iron , cobalt , and zinc , and specimens of coal , marble , glass sands , soils , limestones , etc. , in which that State is so productive .
Portions of these collections were prepared in a very skilful manner , and did much credit to those by whom they were made .
Among the most remarkable specimens from Missouri , were six masses of the specular and magnetic iron ores ( weighing many tons ) , from the well known " Iron Mountain " and " Pilot Knob " of that State .
The pegmatite quarries of New Hampshire generated considerable interest from the mineralogical community .
“ The mica plates , from Grafton and South Ackworth , exhibited by George H. Ruggles of Boston , and J. and J. S. Bowers of Ackworth , are well known now the world over , for their size , clearness and strength .
An important branch of industry has grown up from the employment of this mica to fill the openings in .
the doors of stoves for the combustion of anthracite .
The mica of Grafton is remarkable for having compressed in its luminal crystals of black tourmaline , flattened in the longer axis , and often so thin as to permit the passage of light .
Two specimens of these natural polarizers were shown among selections from the cabinet of Professor Silliman , Jr. ” A sample of cassiterite the represented “ the only example of tin ore in the United States is also from New Hampshire , town of Jackson , and specimens of the ore and metallic tin and bronze made from it were shown by their original discoverer , Dr. Charles T. Jackson of Boston . ”
This sits is known today as the Eastman Hill Tin prospects
Also on display was a “mass of smoky quartz crystal , penetrated by delicate hair like crystals of transparent red brown rutile ” on loan from the personal cabinet of Professor Oliver Payson Hubbard .
“ This appears to have been part of a larger crystal , and was picked up as a bowlder in New Hampshire .
Its sides have been cut so as to illuminate the interior , which exhibits a sight of rare beauty , the dark , but perfectly transparent quartz , being everywhere interpenetrated with the countless fibrous crystals of rutile .
Some of the rutile crystals project in points beyond the surface of the quartz , seeming to indicate that they were formed first across a cavity , and surrounded by the quartz in a state of solution at a later period .
There is another similar specimen in the cabinet of a private collector in New York , which also came from New Hampshire , and is quite probably part of the same original mass .
” The marbles of Sussex County , New Jersey have excited considerable attention from both mineralogists and mineral collectors since about 1800 .
“ From New Jersey , the zinc ores of Sussex ( Franklinite and red oxide zinc ) are well known , and were abundantly represented .
Some masses of the red oxide , shown by Mr. Blake , were of great purity , and the red corundum crystals , also from Sussex , Shown by the same gentleman , are worthy of notice for their color and size .
” Also on exhibit were masses of brucite from the type locality of Castle Point , Hoboken
These were displayed by Mr. Stone , of Brooklyn , New York and were “ of unequalled size , being in veins three to four inches in thickness , and in masses weighing many pounds – perfectly pearly .
” Peter Cooper and Abram S Hewitt , two of the leading iron industrialists of that age , also exhibited “ iron ores , pig , ( and ) slags ” from Andover , New Jersey .
It is apparent that the display of the Great Exhibition ’s “ host state ” – New York – was the most diverse of all the state offerings .
Silliman wrote : Opened in 1839 , the Washington Mine , Davidson county , was “ very fully represented by specimens of argentiferous galena , bars of silver , and numerous crystallized salts of lead , particularly pyromorphite and cerucite ( sic ) .
Mr. Roswell A. King , the former proprietor , deposited in the cabinet a large collection of the various products of this mine , obtained some years back , when it yielded superb specimens and made its name memorable with American collectors .
” Silliman wrote that “ the district of Pennsylvania … has been a rich field to the mineralogist , and has furnished a number of new species to his science within the last few years , e. g. , emerald nickel , euphyllite , pennite , clinochrore , and others , which , although not new , are not elsewhere found in the United States .
In addition to these are found there a long list of more common species , often of rare beauty .
” The premier display pieces of the Pennsylvania display were , of course , the suite of minerals from Charles M. Wheatley ’s cabinet .
The vibrant green pyromorphites were certain to attract the eye of even the least mineralogical inclined spectator .
Justifiably , much of this state ’s exhibit was devoted to coal and iron , celebrating the vast reserves that Pennsylvania possessed of both .
It was coal and iron that had propelled the United States into the Industrial Age , celebrated by the Great Exhibition .
But Pennsylvania offered even more .
A suite of nickel minerals from the Wood ’s Chrome Mine , in Texas , Lancaster County , were on hand for inspection .
He especially noted the “ beautiful emerald green , transparent crust ” of a hydrated chromium hydroxy - carbonate ( which , of course , Silliamn had himself described in 1847 and which would later be called “ zaratite ” by Spanish mineralogist Martin Alcibar Casares in 1851 .
Corundum specimens from both Delaware County ( at Mineral Hill and Chester County ( the “ Corundum Hill ” locality ) were placed in the display .
Silliman noted that it “ has been found in masses sufficiently compact and abundant to dress into emery for manufacturing purposes , although it is doubtful whether the existence of the cleavage of the mineral is sufficiently obliterated to give it the requisite strength and toughness as a polishing agent ” Specimens of rutile ( also apparently from Chester County ) “ found loose in the soil , has a considerable commercial value , from its use in giving the yellowish gray tint to artificial teeth .
The collection contained remarkably fine examples of this species , in large geniculated crystals of great perfection .
We notice especially two crystals from the cabinet of Thomas A. Scale , of Minersville , which are esteemed the finest examples of this species in existence . ” From a metallurgical perspective , Silliman noted : The display from South Carolina was underwhelming .
Outside , in the yard , was “ the massive black oxide of manganese , from Edgefield District , South Carolina , exhibited by Mr. Lane , was remarkable for the large size of the blocks ( seen in the Yard ) , and for its freedom from foreign associated minerals .
” There was also a sample of gold from the same district offered by “ Mr. Dorn of Oakland Grove
” The display of Tennessee minerals concenjtrated heavily on the newly - discovered Ducktown district , then known as the “ Hiwassee region . ”
“ This deposit ( for it is a mass conformable to the adjacent strata ) offers a singular and interesting example of the fermentation on a large scale of magnetic pyrites , poor in copper , and the separation of the sulphuret of copper from the oxide of iron , resulting from the decomposition of the magnetic pyrites . ”
Wrote Silliman .
“ This process is still in operation at the depth of eighty or ninety feet from the surface , where an accumulation of sulphuret of copper , a few feet in thickness , rests upon the bed of unchanged pyrites , while above is a loosely aggregated mass of oxide of iron ( gossan ) , which forms the outcrop of the bed and is entirely free from copper .
The temperature in the adits at the bottom of the shaft is said to be about 80° , and the odor of sulphydric acid very decided .
The extent of this mass ( which is intercalated between beds of gneissic rocks ) is the most remarkable feature of the case , being , it is said , forty to fifty feet in width , and traced by exploration between two and three miles .
”
“ The large crystals of pale colored , smoky quartz , penetrated by rutile , which were found in great numbers a few years since in cutting for a railway in Waterbury , Vermont , were also represented in the collection among the specimens from the cabinets of W. S. Vaux of Philadelphia , and of B. Silliman , Jr. , of New Haven . ” Virginia was clearly one of the many states which suffered greatly from the lack of available time to aquire specimens .
The gold mines of Virginia were at least partially represented Dr. Genth displayed a specimen of gold associated with “ telluret of bismuth ” ( tetradymite ) , “ in which the gold presented a surface of the most perfect polish , being evidently the cast , or pseudomorph , in gold , of some other species ( probably of spathic iron ) .
The rare telluret of bismuth , from Commodore Stockton 's mine in Louisa county , was fully represented . ”
[ This may be an error ; none of the Louisa County mines seem to have tetradymite . ]
And “ from Goochland and Buckingham counties were some ores of gold of a remarkable character , especially that from Garnet 's Mine , which was associated with garnets .
” A specimen of barite from the Eldridge Mine was “ remarkable for the form and finish of its crystals .
” Weyer ’s Cave ( called “ Weir 's Cave ” ) , “ celebrated for the beauty of its crystalline stalactites , was represented by a large mass of crystals of dogtooth spar , of a delicate yellow color , exhibited by Mr. Robert L. Coote , of Bloomfield , New Jersey .
” General , participation from foreign governments at the Great Exhibition was markedly poor .
The one saving grace was the exhibit from Augustus Krantz , the leading German mineral dealer : Silliman complained that “ there was no systematic collection ” offered by Great Britain .
The Duke of Buccleuch , owner of many mines in Wanloch Head ( today , Wanlockhead ) “ sent a fine suite of argentiferous galena and its products , illustrating the various stages of the Pattinson process applied to the ores from Wanloch Head .
The ingot of silver accompanying this suite was of the value of £ 100 … ” The Mining Company of Ireland , a company founded in the early 1800 ’s ( and which still exists today ! ) to mine the rich lead ore of the Ballycorus lead mine also showed ore an intermediary products from their lead smelting operation .
The Lowmoor Iron Company , a prominent Yorkshire , England , iron furnace and colliery , “ sent a remarkably fine suite of specimens , illustrating the manufacture of iron in all its stages , the fullest and most instructive series of the sort that was exhibited .
” Finally Mr Cowper , of Alston , loaned a “ huge crystal of heavy spar , with other minerals ” .
This is probably the J Cowper who made a similar loan of barite to the Crystal Palace exhibit on London , 1851 .
The sundry states which eventually coalesced into modern Germany sent exhibits to New York City .
The Directors of the Public Iron Depot , at Gottenburg , in Sweden , sent an instructive suite of the iron ores , pig , and bar iron for which the country had become famous .
The “ Great Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations ” was , in the end , a financial disaster of epic proportion .
By the time Sedgwick resigned in March 1854 , a debt of $ 100,000 had already accrued .
The financial backers of the Exhibition took the desperate step of bringing in huckster - showman P T Barnum as the new President .
Barnum had accepted the post in hopes that he would achieve the one thing that had eluded him throughout his career – credibility .
Instead , handing the helm of the Great Exhibition to the world ’s premier hoaxster and master of humbug simply demeaned the exhibit .
Barnum was the man who had turned the bogus “ Feejee Mermaid ” into New York City ’s Number One spectacle .
Certainly , the man who was unable to understand the difference between a carnival freakshow and a museum was a poor choice to attempt to salvage the New York Crystal Palace .
And by the time Barnum retreated back to his Connecticut mansion “ weary , fagged , tired , and almost sick ” he admitted “ I was an ass for having anything to do with the Crystal Palace .
” When Great Exhibition closed , officially , on 1 November 1854 , it was more than $ 300,000 in debt .
The Crystal Palace building itself remained standing , at least for awhile , serving as a convention center and concert hallOn October 5th , 1858 , at 5:10 pm , fire broke out in a storeroom in the northern vestibule , where the wood patterns used by the workmen in construction of the building had been archived .
It took only 21 minutes for the iron and glass building – ostensibly fireproof – to be destroyed .
Amazingly , no one was badly injured , although hundreds of thousand of dollars of merchandize and machinery then on exhibit at the annual American Institute fair were lost .

June 21 , 1948 : Columbia ’s Microgroove LP
Makes Albums Sound GoodColumbia
Records introduced the first successful microgroove long - playing phonographs way back in June 1948 .
But it took decades before album cover artwork came into its own .
To celebrate the LP 's birthday , Wired.com 's staff compiled the following list of stellar albums featuring mind - bending graphics and kick - ass inserts .
Got your own favorites ?
School us on unforgettable cover art in the comments section .
The Beatles : Revolver , Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , Abbey Road — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
As with pretty much everything the band did , The Beatles set a trend , this time for LP covers , with the release of 1966 's Revolver .
Employing the illustrations of their pal Klaus Voorman and the photography of Robert Whitaker , Revolver ushered in the psychedelic era with force .
Its name was even agreed upon while all four members worked on a psychedelic painting .
But The Beatles ' influential 1967 record Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band blew minds wide open .
The Grammy - winning cover was created by art champion and director Robert Fraser , and married the work of designers Peter Blake and Jann Haworth with more than 70 artists , writers , thinkers and figures influential to The Beatles .
The Beatles themselves appeared alongside simulations of themselves , a nod to the death of Hard Day 's Night–fueled Beatlemania .
The cover , which included cutouts for mustaches and badges , eventually warranted its own legend for disciples who just love to Geek The Beatles .
The whole epochal art project proved about 100 times more expensive than any cover made before .
Its influence has been immeasurable .
By the time The Beatles got to their last proper album , 1969's Abbey Road , they stripped themselves entirely of simulations and presented four friends parting at the road responsible for pop music 's most memorable sonics .
And even that self - referential maneuver started a trend : Bands , including the naked Red Hot Chili Peppers , similarly walked across roads in ironic homage .
Baby , that 's art .
The Rolling Stones : Sticky Fingers , Exile on Main St. , Some Girls — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
Speaking of simulations , The Rolling Stones spent much of the '60s copying their friends The Beatles .
But once the Fab Four fragmented in 1970 , the Stones kicked into overdrive , especially in the cover - art department .
Masterful 1971 rocker Sticky Fingers featured a crotch - shot cover – conceived by Andy Warhol – that boasted a real zipper .
The Stones ' 1972 double album Exile on Main St. employed a gatefold cover and a series of 12 perforated postcards with inserted images from photographer Norman Seeff .
The band 's last great release , 1978 's Some Girls , showed off the Stones in drag in a heavily detailed die - cut package with varying color sleeves .
It even scored copyfights from Lucille Ball , Farrah Fawcett , Liza Minelli and more starlets .
Pink Floyd : A Saucerful of Secrets , Meddle , Dark Side of the Moon ... OK , Everything From Hipgnosis — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
Shortly after The Beatles blew out LP cover art on Sgt. Pepper , Pink Floyd commissioned art pals Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell , later known as design gods Hipgnosis ( a name they took from graffiti ) , to draft up the dizzying graphics for 1968 effort A Saucerful of Secrets .
After that illustrious pairing , Pink Floyd and Hipgnosis collaborated together on every major album the band made , including Dark Side of the Moon , Wired 's choice for best concept album ever .
Thorgerson and Powell summarily became the best - known cover artists of all time .
As Hipgnosis or alone , they eventually created brain - teasing graphics for old - school heavyweights like Led Zeppelin , The Who and Genesis , and new - school noisemakers like The Mars Volta and Muse .
Visualize that .
The Moody Blues : Days of Future Passed , and Well , Everything Else They Did — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
In late 1967 , The Moody Blues abandoned their early R&B roots and released the successful Days of Future Passed , a head - tripping concept album about the life cycle that seamlessly married psychedelic pop and classical music .
Its intertwining cover painting from David Anstey , which could be viewed with thematic coherence from all angles , set the arty standard for all of The Moody Blues ' subsequent albums .
Pick any record from the band 's career , and you 'll find some complicated art demanding analysis .
The Velvet Underground and Nico : The Velvet Underground and Nico — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
Not all album art from the '60s was a visually and intertextually complex exercise .
Andy Warhol 's cover for the 1967 classic The Velvet Underground and Nico shows nothing but a banal yellow banana .
It was a clever example of his merge of art and marketing – what are album covers , anyway , but kick - ass marketing for music ?
Warhol skewed the art critique strange by printing instructions for readers to peel the banana , which then gave way to a flesh - colored one .
What a dirty boy .
That trick demanded special machines to build the cover , which contributed to the album 's delayed release .
At first , the LP art showed Warhol 's signature but did n't feature the band 's name at all .
The group 's name was added on later pressings , and early copies became extremely rare collectors ' items .
What a dirty genius .
Led Zeppelin : I , II , III , IV , Physical Graffiti and So On — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
Right from the start , Led Zeppelin 's album art was godlike .
The band 's self - titled 1969 debut bore a cover image of the flaming Hindenburg airship .
The untitled fourth Led Zep album burst with iconic city - country collages and mystic runes .
Physical Graffiti intrigued with art - conscious photo - sleeves of a New York tenement .
Led Zeppelin III 's gatefold sleeve even featured a rotating volvelle of images .
Zeppelin eventually hooked up with Hipgnosis ' Aubrey Powell , whose cover for Houses of the Holy was a nod to Arthur C. Clarke 's sci-fi classic Childhood 's End .
Storm Thorgerson 's cover for the underrated Presence was a nearly deliberate homage to Clarke and Kubrick 's 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
Zeppelin 's epic full - lengths remain testaments to ferocious riffage and cerebral graphics .
The Who : The Who Sell Out , Tommy , Quadrophenia — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ———-
Like Pink Floyd ,
The Who mastered the merge of concept albums and art , creating timeless work buttressed by seeking brains and ferocious musicianship .
The quartet 's 1967 effort The Who Sell Out was a stab at commercialism emblazoned with fake ads for deodorant and beans .
The resilient 1969 double - album rock opera Tommy unfolded into a triptych with spanning graphics that recalled the arty math of M.C. Escher .
Incendiary 1973 concept album Quadrophenia psychoanalyzed The Who using field recordings , unhinged rock and butterfly packaging that , like Tommy before it , contained an image - studded minibook that explained the story and showed off the lyrics .
Throw in the controversial piss party of Who 's Next as a chaser , and you 've got a band with album imagery that remains as powerful as its music .
Small Faces : Ogden 's Nut Gone Flake — — — — — — — — — —— —-
This 1968 effort from British standout Small Faces topped the British charts with heavy rock and soul tracks anchored in a conceptual quest for a missing half of the moon .
The release 's novel early packaging – which replicated a tobacco tin and was rounded out by an enclosed poster created by assembling five paper circles – thoroughly hooked the public .
Like other work from the ' 60s , Small Faces ' Ogden 's Nut Gone
Flake combined modern art and music in ways that revolutionized not just LP graphics and packaging , but also the industry .
By the time the ' 70s arrived , mind - wiping cover art had become practically mandatory .
Miles Davis : Bitches Brew — — — — — — — ——
Called the Picasso of jazz by Duke Ellington , Miles Davis had already sequenced the genes for cool and modal jazz by the time he got to 1970 effort Bitches Brew , which smashed jazz through an electronic rock grinder .
Celebrating its 40th birthday this year , Bitches Brew continues to be one of the most celebrated musical efforts in history of any genre , at least partially because of its stunning gatefold cover .
Created by acclaimed artist Mati Klarwein , who studied with Salvador Dali and Ernst Fuchs , Bitches Brew 's spacious , surreal cover art folded out into a stunning mural .
Klarwein also designed covers for Santana , Last Poets , Brian Eno and more .
He died in 2002 .
Yes : Fragile , Close to the Edge and Anything by Roger Dean — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
English artist and designer Roger Dean is synonymous with fantastically swirling dreamscapes .
Like most other icons on this list , he made art in the late ' 60s , but blew up like an acid trip in the '70s .
Dean worked on almost all albums by prog-rock legend Yes , designing instantly recognizable , shimmering tableaux that seemingly merged Dali and Dr. Seuss .
In the end , Dean 's fluid sci - fi visuals proved inextricable from prog 's infamous indulgence , and he has since worked chiefly on Yes - related projects .
But he redesigned the Tetris logo .
So , there .
Emerson , Lake & Palmer : Brain Salad Surgery and Everything from H.R. Giger — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
H.R. Giger 's singular , sexualized cyborgs reached an apotheosis in Ridley Scott 's 1979 sci- fi movie Alien .
But the Swiss artist has also lent his distinctively destabilizing art to bands like Danzig , Celtic Frost , Deborah Harry and Emerson , Lake & Palmer , whose 1973 prog-rock classic Brain Salad Surgery helped make Giger an international art star .
Speaking of Giger , music and sexual perversity ...
The Dead Kennedys ' Frankenchrist , The Buzzcocks ' Orgasm Addict , The Minutemen , Minor Threat and Other Punk Eye- Poppers — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
What could be more punk than H.R. Giger , The Dead Kennedys and graphically rendered , but ultimately dehumanized , sexual intercourse ?
That 's right , nothing .
Which is why Kennedys front man Jello Biafra wanted Giger 's colloquially named " Penis Landscape " as the cover of his band 's 1985 burner , Frankenchrist .
" I was totally blown away the minute I saw it , " Biafra told Wired.com in an interview timed to celebrate Giger 's 70th birthday .
" I thought : ' Wow !
That is the Reagan era on parade .
Right there !
That shows how Americans treat each other now . '
He captured it in a nutshell . "
But Giger 's phallic satire was too punk for Biafra 's bandmates , and the artwork was summarily relegated to a poster inside the sleeve .
Instead , Frankenchrist 's cover art depicted a hilariously banal Shriners parade .
Yet other punks would carry the torch for rough , tough cover art .
The Minutemen , Sonic Youth and other smart upstarts employed the deranged comic art of Raymond Pettibon to help communicate their musical mayhem .
The DIY collage art for The Buzzcocks ' single " Orgasm Addict " was a magazine cut - up just begging for a copyfight .
Ironically enough , punks ended up leveling the copyfight against shoe titan Nike , which blatantly lifted Minor Threat 's self - titled LP cover for an obviously referential ad campaign designed to sell its crappy sneaker to a skateboarding demographic that grew up on the genre .
It was Nike 's most recent epic fail , and proof of good punk 's resilient DIY aesthetic .
Simple , powerful cover art can often be as influential as dizzying visuals crafted by painters trained by Dali .
Motorhead 's No Remorse , Iron Maiden 's Number of the Beast , Tool 's Lateralus and Other Metal Phantasmagoria — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
Heavy metal has been particularly ambitious when it comes to cover art , churning out LPs emblazoned with nightmarish hellscapes , unforgettable characters and conceptual coolness .
Motorhead 's No Remorse came with a faux leather sleeve , which is the only faux thing the band has probably ever done .
Iron Maiden built a career , and a massive stage show , on the back of a monstrous mascot named Eddie the Head , created by artist Derek Riggs .
Even Wired 's battle - hardened censors might bang their heads at the thought of including any of the variously garish , ultraviolent LP covers from bands like Cannibal Corpse .
Which , of course , is exactly what bands like Cannibal Corpse want .
But other metalheads aimed straight for the brain – literally , in the case of Tool 's stellar 2001 release Lateralus .
Featuring a translucent insert that opened to reveal different layers of the human body , with the word " God " imposed over the brain , Tool carried the torch for cerebral , complex metal into the new millennium .
We 're still waiting for that torch to get passed .
Pixies : Come On Pilgrim , Surfer Rosa , Doolittle — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
Just as with The Velvet Underground , more bands ( including Nirvana and Radiohead ) were probably influenced by the Pixies than actually heard or saw the group during its ferociously productive heyday in the late ' 80s and early '90s .
Those of us who did follow the Pixies around the country in those days were captivated by the brutal but beautiful music and art .
That graphically sonic merge was most capably illustrated on the Pixies ' EP Come On Pilgrim , full - length debut Surfer Rosa and crossover classic Doolittle , which featured deep and arty design and photography from Vaughan Oliver and Simon Larbalestier .
Like other stunning artwork produced for albums from the influential 4AD label , the imagery of the Pixies ' first three albums propelled alternative rock into the mainstream , where less talented bands like Nirvana built upon the group 's foundational artistry to achieve stratospheric fame .
So - called alt - rock has sucked ever since .
Hip -Hop : Public Enemy's
It Takes a Nation of Millions , GZA 's Liquid Swords , DJ Shadow 's Private Press and More — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — ——
–
A reminder : Hip - hop is a vinyl - based culture , and it's also geeked on graphics .
Public Enemy 's in - your - face 1988 classic
It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back grew out of Chuck D's fiery oratory and design skills , culminating in an instantly familiar artistic and sonic branding .
No other hip - hop band has so successfully merged cover art and cacophonous protest .
Wu - Tang genius GZA parleyed the Clan 's deep love for comics and street knowledge into the critically acclaimed 1995 release Liquid Swords , riding Marvel and DC Comics artist Denys Cowan 's vivid cover art into the record books .
Meanwhile , DJ Shadow 's seriously underrated 2002 effort , The Private Press , was a love letter to vinyl from a crate - digging obsessive who specializes in atmospheric , synesthetic recombinations of familiar and discarded sonics .
Its defiant cover art of densely interwoven designs and surreal art flipped a middle finger at those who would bypass the LP for the compact disc .
DJ Shadow and other disciples of the LP can take solace in the fact that CD sales continue to tank while vinyl is on the rise .
In fact , you can thank hip - hop and similarly inclined vinyl lovers for keeping the format , and its arresting visuals , alive for generations to come .

Have you ever wondered how to make Shrinky Dinks ?
You know , shrinky dinks , the thin plastic that shrinks in the oven .
To make DIY shrinky dinks you need to save your # 6 plastic containers ( like the clear containers from the salad bar ) .
DIY Shrinky Dinks
Save the whole container , even the textured sides , and bottoms .
It all works and flattens out nicely .
The ridges on the sides give a nice space to color !
We burned up most of the afternoon making DIY shrink plastic and used every bit of my large stash of # 6 containers and were left wanting more !
When your plastic runs out you might be interested in this huge list of kids crafts and activities , this summer bucket list and these free coloring pages .
So many ideas to keep kids busy and engaged !
What is a Shrinky Dink ?
Shrinky Dinks are children ’s activity that was hugely popular in the 80’s .
Special plastic sheets when heated in an oven , shrink to small hard pieces without altering their color or shape .
How do you make Shrinky Dinks ?
You can purchase the special plastic sheets ( affiliate link ) and follow manufacturer instructions .
Typically , shrinky dink plastic if first colored on with permanent markers or colored pencils .
Next cut out the shapes and bake at 325 degrees Fahrenheit for about 1 - 3 minutes .
At first , the Shrinky Dinks will curl up , but then they will flatten back out .
Once they flatten back out , bake for 30 more seconds .
Homemade Shrinky Dinks Supplies
It is really an easy activity .
All you need is :
permanent markers
regular hole punch
# 6 plastic
oven
cookie sheet covered with aluminum foil or parchment paper
scissors to cut the plastic
How to make Shrinky Dinks
Here is the shrinky dink instruction you need !
Cut a shape out of the plastic ( plastic shrinks about 1/3 of the original size ) .
Our 2 ″ circle became about 3/4 ″ when shrunk .
Color one side of the shape with a permanent marker .
The color becomes more intense once it shrinks .
If you are wanting to attach your shape to something do n’t forget to punch a hole before placing in the oven .
Place the plastic on a thin cookie sheet ( not the insulated type ) covered with parchment paper or aluminum foil .
Bake plastic at 350 degrees for 2 - 3 minutes .
Each oven is different so watch closely .
You will see the plastic curl up and then it will flatten back out .
It does give off some fumes so we left a window open for ventilation !
We added a jump ring to some of our shapes and strung on cording along with beads to make necklaces .
Some of the small shapes we placed on id wire rings along with some beads to make beverage markers .
Ball started as a 2 ″ circle , finished size was about 3 / 4 ″
Tag started 3 ″ long by 1 3/4 ″ wide , finished size was about 1 1/4 ″ long by just under 3/4 ″ wide
On a larger shaped tag ( starting size 4 ″ long by 2 3/4 ″ wide ) we placed a clip so it could be a zipper pull .
Punch two holes side by side to make the finished hole big enough for the clip .
I think these zipper pulls would make the cutest Valentine ’s - attach a note that says “ You pull at my heart ! ”
How do you make a shrinky dink ring ?
Then we really got rolling and made rings .
Our shrinky dink rings are a bit sloppy but we are still wearing them .
It took some trial and error to find the right size .
For my size , I started with a strip 5 ″ long by about 1 ″ to 1 1/2 ″ wide .
Pull it immediately from the oven and quickly while it is still very hot wrap it around a Chap - stick tube .
My son needed to make his 5 1/2 inches long and I ( an adult must do this part–it is hot and you must work fast ! ) wrapped it around a child ’s chunky marker .
If you make a mistake and get a miss - shaped ring or it is too long just send it back into the oven .
Once it is warm it can be trimmed with scissors , it will also flatten back out and you can give it another go .
For more information on making shrinky dink rings you will want to visit Planet June .
Here rings are lovely !
After we had used every piece of plastic my son said — — — bracelets !
We could make bracelets .
So we are now saving more plastic !
Homemade Shrinky Dinks Tips :
I was able to use a regular ink pad and stamp designs on the plain plastic with great results !
Look for the # 6 stamp on the bottom of the clear containers
# 6 – PS : polystyrene is used in takeout food containers .
It has been found to leach styrene–a neurotoxin and possible human carcinogen–and has been banned in cities like Portland , Ore. and San Francisco .
Okay , so there is a downside to the craft !
Using a toaster oven outside might be the best thing to do !
I remember my grandmother melting white Styrofoam cups in the oven enough to make them look like hats .
I think she did something for Mother ’s Day with them !
I did think the melting plastic left a lingering odor in my oven .
Before using my oven for food I turned it on to 400 degrees and let it bake for about 20 minutes to get rid of the smell .
Again , a small toaster oven reserved for craft projects and used in a well - ventilated area ( like outside ) is the safest way to make homemade shrinky dinks !
What do you use to color on Shrinky Drink Plastic ?
To color the recycled plastic , it is best to use sharpie permanent markers .
The colors darken as the plastic shrinks .
Colored pencils work great on store bought sheets .
The commercial sheets have a rough surface .
Clear smooth sheets or the recycled # 6 plastic will need to be sanded lightly in order for the color stick onto the plastic .

One - day cricket in its familiar form could soon become a thing of the past after the Cricket Australia board gave the green light to a trial of split - innings state games next summer .
If the new format is successful , Cricket Australia will take the idea to the ICC as a plan to keep ODIs alive , meaning the 2015 World Cup could feature a split - innings format .
Although there has been no decision on how many overs each innings would be - four innings of either 20 or 25 overs are the most likely - CA will finalise their concept in the coming weeks .
The first four rounds of the FR Cup will be played under the existing rules before the new format is introduced for the remaining six rounds , which will start in February .
By then , Australia 's World Cup squad will have departed , so their preparations will not be affected .
James Sutherland , the CA chief executive , said the innovation was intended as a way to retain all three formats of the game , with the middle portion of 50 - over innings having become largely predictable .
" It provides a mechanism by which in the eyes of the consumer we can distinguish the one - day game a little bit more from the Twenty20 format of the game , " Sutherland said .
" There 's no doubt that there 's some feedback there that suggests that parts of the one - day game are a little bit predictable .
That 's certainly something that we are looking to address .
" One of the things that 's come back as the feedback from fans and also from a television audience perspective is that by having a split innings , after the dinner break , no matter , you will get to see both teams bat in the evening .
That is something that people who might be going to the game after work or coming home after work see as being a very significant plus for this format . "
The popularity of Twenty20 cricket has left ODIs in a difficult position , somewhere between the dynamic shortest format and the traditional Test matches .
England and South Africa have already reduced their one - day domestic competitions to 40 overs a side , in an effort to eliminate some of the less exciting middle overs .
The ICC has been searching for ways to keep 50 - over cricket relevant , and next year 's World Cup on the subcontinent could feasibly be the last one played in the existing format .
Sutherland said it was hard to predict how one - day cricket would look by the time of the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand .
" If you 're suggesting that the current playing conditions that one - day international cricket is being played under today is going to be the same in 2015 , then I would suggest that it 's probably not the case , " Sutherland said .
" There 's a question there about how radically the playing conditions may have developed or changed .
I honestly do n't know the answer to that but what we at Cricket Australia are looking to do is to find a landing spot with a new format .
" We have also been encouraged to innovate through the ICC cricket committee , who met not long ago .
They were very , very encouraging of full members looking to explore innovations within the playing conditions and certainly that 's been raised at chief executive committee level in recent times . "
Cricket Australia will now move to finalise the details , although it seems certain that teams will resume their second innings from the point where their first innings concluded .
Sutherland said feedback from fans had played a major role in the split - innings concept , which has also been trialled this year in England 's county 2nd XI competition .
You can always rely on Sarah Palin to provide a sophisticated and thoughtful response to the world 's latest tragedy and , in the case of the Gulf oil spill , she has n't disappointed us .
With the clarity of expression for which she is renowned , Palin took to Twitter and declared :
Extreme Greenies : see now why we push " drill , baby , drill " of known reserves &promising finds in safe onshore places like ANWR ?
Now do you get it ?
For those left unenlightened by this tweet , Palin helpfully published a Facebook note elaborating on her thesis that environmentalists were to blame for the spill .
Here is an extract :
Your hypocrisy is showing .
You 're not preventing environmental hazards ; you 're outsourcing them and making drilling more dangerous .
Extreme deep water drilling is not the preferred choice to meet our country 's energy needs , but your protests and lawsuits and lies about onshore and shallow water drilling have locked up safer areas .
It 's catching up with you .
The tragic , unprecedented deep water Gulf oil spill proves it .
The answer , as ever , is not to tighten lax regulation but to allow onshore drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , often described as " America 's Serengeti " , and disregard the inevitable damage to the area 's wildlife .
But compared to those of some of her ideological compatriots , Palin 's remarks are far from exceptional .
Rush Limbaugh has suggested that the Obama administration blew up the rig in an attempt to bolster support for the president 's cap - and - trade bill .
He said :
Now , lest we forget , ladies and gentlemen , the carbon tax bill , cap and trade , that was scheduled to be announced on Earth Day .
I remember that .
And then it was postponed for a couple of days later after Earth Day , and then of course immigration has now moved in front of it .
But this bill , the cap - and - trade bill , was strongly criticised by hardcore environmentalist wackos because it supposedly allowed more offshore drilling and nuclear plants , nuclear plant investment .
So , since they 're sending SWAT teams down there , folks , since they 're sending SWAT teams to inspect the other rigs , what better way to head off more oil drilling , nuclear plants , than by blowing up a rig ?
I 'm just noting the timing here .
That 's right Rush , just noting the timing .

When children act like adults it 's obnoxious , and maybe even depressing .
Arsène Wenger has had a tough time in front of the media over the last few years .
Arsenal are still playing the high class , crisp passing game everyone loves ( or loves to hate ) , but silverware has not been forthcoming .
Recently the economic figures have been released , revealing that Arsenal ’s turnover is exceeding Premier League records , and this in itself can be seen as a step forward .
However , the harshest critics are those who completely lack perspective .
The easiest way to visualise the project that Arsène Wenger and the back - room staff at Arsenal have been working on is to split it into three stages .
The first stage was the moulding of the club in Arsene ’s image , and the transformation of Arsenal from a good team into a successful , world class team .
This was completed , with many years of silverware , and high achievements .
The Second Stage
From this point the club then required the second stage of development .
This stage involved turning Arsenal into an economic powerhouse , to parallel the achievements on the football field , and maintain sustainable success for the long term .
This second stage began in 2002 with the re-branding of the club , a new logo , and the plans to build Ashburton Grove , or the Emirates .
Stage two is arguably the most difficult transition for any club to undergo .
There is the financial risk surrounding debt accumulation , and the requirement that success be maintained on the field .
This transition was meticulously planned , and the nature of the sustainable growth meant that the squad development would rely more on nurturing talent rather than buying in an overinflated transfer market .
Moving to a new stadium is hard for many clubs , most suffering loss of form , relegations , debts , just look at Valencia or teams such as Leicester , or even the calamitous Wembley project .
Instead of this , Arsenal have maintained a Champions League place , albeit precariously at times , over all the years of hardship , and have managed to mount title challenges in 07/08 and 09/10 .
Not only this but the team have reached the Champions League Final , Semi final , and Quarter finals twice , our best ever record in Europe .
I will accept the arguement that players like Cesc agitating for a move could be partially a result of this transition , but how else should the club be grown ?
There are of course other ways of analysing the economics too .
This record may not equal silverware , but put in perspective it is an impressive achievement .
Now the success is off the pitch .
Arsenal capitalised on their boom years , and now play in arguably the best equipped stadium in Britain .
To top this off Arsenal ’s debt is being paid off very fast , over £ 100 million out of roughly £ 350 million went in early 2010 .
The recent figures though are the greatest vindication of the project that is two thirds into completion .
Arsenal now have a turnover of £ 316 million , a Premier League record , and certain qnly one of the worlds largest .
Debt is not only being paid off quickly , but is sustainable , and is only 8 % of the Premier League total , Man Utd and Liverpool combined represent almost 40 % .
In addition wages are held at an astounding low of 32 % of turnover , which is unheard of in the Premier League .
This is the second stage of Arsenal ’s transformation well into completion .
The club is turning into an economic powerhouse , whilst maintaining consistent ( although a little unsatisfactory ) performance on the pitch as a price for the painful transition .
Once stage two is complete , the third and final stage is to then accelerate the club ’s performance without the hindrance of debts .
Arsenal can then move up a gear as one of the world ’s richest , but also most sustainable clubs , with success on the football field increasing .
The three stages see Arsenal move from successful , to rich , and then to becoming very successful sustainably .
Outside Influences
Do not forget that the most difficult second phase has also come at a time when foreign investors have been loitering , in a time when clubs like Man Utd and Liverpool are saddled with debt , the strains of which finally showed this season .
This type of ownership has also seen teams such as Chelsea and Man City over inflate the transfer market and create extra competition at the top of the Premier League .
Meanwhile Arsenal have been quietly building on a fantastic model , which will deliver the goods in the long term .
Take a team like Liverpool , they have had arguably more success than Arsenal since 2005 – winning the Champions League in 2005 and the FA Cup 2006 , compared to our FA Cup ( 2005 ) , and finishing higher in the league on several occasions .
The difference is , that although Liverpool have achieved a greater triumph than Arsenal ever in the Champions League , they are now mired in debt , with little money for new players , possible mass exodus mooted , no new stadium built as promised , a disappointing year in the League and Champions League , and now finishing 7th .
Arsenal may not have had hands on the Champions League trophy yet , but the club is arguably in a much better position to go on and challenge for it once again , and each year Arsenal do so they do it with improved finances , and improved young talent .
Do n’t forget that the new Premier League rulings on home grown players may also work to our advantage regarding youth players .
The most crucial step now is making sure that key players can keep the faith , specifically I mean Fabregas .
If Cesc leaves then he is replaceable , but the blow will be massive .
Never before has Wenger lost quite such a talent in his prime .
The team needs to be united , and requires continuity to progress into a new era where Arsenal can dominate in competition and economically .
The situation is improving year by year , but there is always pressure to balance this with results , and specifically silverware .

UNITED NATIONS – A few years ago , one would have assumed that today , June 15 , would be a day of celebration across the Korean peninsula .
Exactly ten years ago , the north ’s Kim Jong
Il and the south ’s Kim Dae- jung - in Pyongyang , marking the first time a South Korean head of state ever visited the North - signed the North - South Joint Declaration , which aimed for greater cooperation between the two states - and eventual reunification .
Today that agreement is all but dead , as a war of words - which many fear will escalate into a full - scale war - escalates between the two sides .
The south accused the north of carrying out the March 26 sinking the warship Cheonan , which killed 46 soldiers , and North Korea is threatening military retaliation .
Regional neighbors such as China and Russia , alarmed at the prospects of an escalation in tension , have urged both sides to cool their rhetoric .
Still , at a press conference held here today , Sin Son Ho , North Korea ’s ambassador to the UN said that if the Security Council were to take any action against the North , “ follow up measures will be carried out by our military forces . ”
Like many in South Korea , Sin called into question the legitimacy the Joint Investigation Committee , which was set up by the S. Korean government to look into exactly what happened to the Cheonan .
Its finding , that a North Korean submarine torpedoed the warship , is the basis for South Korea ’s referral of the matter to the UNSC .
Many questions have been raised about the JIC .
The UK , he said , has not answered whether or not its scientists were there as individuals or as state representatives ;
Sweden announced that its scientists had only acted as technical advisers and had no input into assigning blame .
Other countries ’ statements have raised questions as well .
Sin put forward other arguments to bolster the case for the North ’s innocence in the matter :
The Cheonan had anti-submarine capability
The South Korean and U.S. warships in the area , with their state - of - the - art capabilities , should have been able to detect any North Korean submarine
Part of the evidence that the torpedo was North Korean was based upon North Korean script on a recovered part of the torpedo - though , according to some experts , there is no way that the writing should have survived , given that the explosion was big enough to break a huge warship into pieces
Sin further argued that the timing was suspicious .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak announced the findings the same day that local elections were to begin in his country , possibly to strengthen his Grand National Party ’s hand .
Further , around the same time , the U.S. had been leaning on Japan to relocate an unpopular military base on Okinawa .
Also , chair of the south ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff Lee Sang - eui resigned after reports surfaced that he was either drunk or sleeping off a hangover while the Cheonan sunk and then forged documents to show that he was present at the site of the sinking .
Though evidence that the ship was sunk by accidental friendly fire and not the north appears to be mounting , and a large section of the South Korean public seems to agree , North Korea appears to be painting itself into a corner and alienating allies with rigid demands .
North Korea says it will not trust the results of any investigation aside from one done by a team from its Military Defense Commission , though it is highly unlikely that the South would allow northern military officials in .
The north rejected a Chinese proposal , which would likely be accepted by the south , for an investigation headed up by the Military Armistice Commission , set up at the end of the Korean War .
Even those who agree that the North has been unfairly accused , and are opposed to U.S. dominance in the area , have taken umbrage at the north ’s inflammatory rhetoric , as in a May 30 statement on the official Korean Central News Agency ’s website :
“ We will react with rapid retaliatory strike , mercilessly strong physical strike if the puppet group of traitors shows any slightest sign of ‘ punishment ’ and ‘ retaliation ’ … ”
While the MAC had gone dormant over the years , the UN ’s Korean command took up the offer and proposed that China ’s People ’s Liberation Army be brought back in - and that observers from the ( north ) Korean People ’s Army also be invited .
It seems unlikely the UN Security Council , given China ’s and Russia ’s status as veto - wielding members , will do anything more than issue a Presidential Statement .
It also seems unlikely that relations between the two halves of Korea will return to anything akin to those of the thaw during the era of the Sunshine Policy , ushered in by the Joint Declaration , anytime soon .

Germany 's Immigration Debate Politician Demands IQ Tests for Would - Be Immigrants
Many in Germany have long been skeptical of immigration .
Now , a conservative Berlin politician has proposed requiring immigrants to take an intelligence test before being allowed in .
His idea has not been well received .
NEW ORLEANS --
The New Orleans Hornets have a new coach and a new general manager .
But will they have their All - Star point guard ?
A little more than a month after making 38 - year - old Monty Williams the youngest coach in the NBA , the Hornets hired Williams ' longtime friend and former NBA teammate , 40 - year - old Dell Demps , as general manager on Wednesday .
But shortly after Demps was introduced , a report on CBSSports.com -- citing a " person with direct knowledge of his plans -- said that guard Chris Paul has what the story described as " an aggressive exit strategy " to leave the team , possibly prior to the upcoming season .
Paul has said he wants the Hornets to prove their commitment to winning immediately .
The Hornets say they intend to do so , but they have little room under the NBA 's salary cap .
The team is also in the process of transferring ownership from George Shinn to Gary Chouest , though the deal has been stalled .
Paul told ESPN
The Magazine 's Chris Broussard on June 23 that he was open to a trade if the Hornets are n't committed to winning championships .
" My first choice is to be in New Orleans , '' Paul said then , in a telephone interview from London .
" I just want to make sure we 're committed to winning .
If we 're not committed to winning and trying to get better so we can contend with the Lakers , the Celtics and all these other top teams , then I 'm open to being traded . ''
Wednesday 's CBSSports.com report said Paul saw what his friend LeBron James did in signing to play alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh with the Miami Heat , and has designs on doing something similar .
" He wants out , " the person with knowledge of Paul 's plans told CBSSports.com .
" He wants to play with another superstar . "
The New York Knicks , Orlando Magic and Los Angeles Lakers are on Paul 's list of preferred destinations , sources told CBSSports.com .
The sources said members of Paul 's " inner circle " have told the Hornets the guard wants out in part because " he feels like they have n't put the right pieces together . "
Sources told Broussard on Thursday that the Knicks and Magic are on Paul 's list of preferred destinations , but the Lakers are not .
Sources told Broussard that the Portland Trail Blazers and Dallas Mavericks are also in the running if Paul were to be traded .
The Hornets are saddled with expensive contracts this season for role players such as Peja Stojakovic ( $ 15.3 million ) , Emeka Okafor ( $ 11.5 million ) and James Posey ( $ 6.5 million ) , and have little room under the NBA 's luxury tax threshold .
Hornets president Hugh Weber has said the club does not intend to take on any new debt while the sale of the team is pending , and must find creative ways to improve the roster .
Still , when healthy , the Hornets have talent at some key positions , from Paul to power forward David West and promising second - year guards Marcus Thornton and Darren Collison .
Demps takes over for Jeff Bower , who stepped down last week after spending nearly 15 years with the club in various capacities , the past five as general manager .
" Beginning with the hiring of head coach Monty Williams , we 've begun a path of building our basketball operations with people we feel are going to be the best in the business , and Dell Demps certainly fits into that category , " Weber said Wednesday , when the Hornets formally named Demps as the seventh general manager in franchise history .
Bower also served as coach for most of last season after the firing of Byron Scott .
Now the Hornets have a coach and general manager who both showed promise at their recent stops in the NBA , but have no track record in their current posts .
" From the moment I spoke to Hugh and Monty about this opportunity , I could tell something special was building within the organization , " Demps said .
" The Hornets are a great organization with a lot of positive pieces . "
Just as the Hornets liked the way Williams , as an assistant coach , helped mold a young Portland squad into a playoff contender , they also liked that Demps spent the past five years in San Antonio under general manager R.C. Buford , who has helped the small - market Spurs become perennial contenders .
" Dell shined through as a rising star from a program in San Antonio that has a tremendous history of building a franchise into a championship contender , " Weber said .
Buford congratulated the Hornets on hiring Demps , predicting that his style would complement that of Williams , who started his coaching career in San Antonio as an intern under Gregg Popovich during the 2004 - 05 season .
" Having worked closely with both Dell and Monty , I 'm confident that they will provide great leadership to the Hornets franchise , " Buford said .
" Dell has been a trusted confidant and an integral part of our organization . "
Demps and Williams both played for San Antonio during the 1995 - 96 season .
While the Hornets were looking for a new general manager , Demps and Williams had dinner together , although Williams said that was an unofficial meeting between friends .
" We did have dinner , but it was one of those nights where we were talking about San Antonio stuff and talking about when Pop used to rip us a new one back in the day , " Williams said , grinning , the day before Demps was hired .
After the hiring was made offical , Williams was clearly pleased .
" I have been fortunate to know Dell for a long time and we share a lot of the same beliefs , " Williams said .
" He wants and has a great basketball pedigree , learning from some of the best minds in the business .
Dell is a winner , hard worker and does things the right way .
He will be a great asset . "

MORTGAGES
The bill offers a number of new protections , many of which are a bit like closing the barn door after all of the animals escaped .
Lenders , for instance , will have to check borrowers ’ income and assets .
Most lenders have learned that lesson by now or have ceased to exist .
Other rules include a ban on prepayment penalties for people with adjustable rate and other more complex types of mortgages .
Mortgage brokers and bank employees will no longer be able to earn bonuses based on the type of loan they put you in .
That will presumably eliminate any incentive to push high - interest loans on borrowers ( who might otherwise qualify for a better deal ) to inflate bank profits .

Julia Gordon , senior policy counsel for the Center for Responsible Lending , said there will now be a cap limiting mortgage origination fees to 3 percent of the loan .
There are exceptions for required upfront mortgage insurance premiums , say for a Federal Housing Administration loan , and for points that borrowers elect to pay to lower the mortgage interest rate .
CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS
Hate those merchants that wo n’t let you use your credit card unless you spend more than a certain amount ?
Well , now they have Congress ’s blessing , as long as the minimum is not higher than $ 10 .
The Federal Reserve can increase the minimum if it chooses .
As for maximums , only the federal government and colleges and universities can limit what people spend .
So if you are paying tuition on a credit card and earning a couple of free plane tickets each year , that fun may soon end .
Merchants are also free to offer discounts to people who pay cash instead of using cards , or use debit instead of credit cards .
They will not , however , be able to charge one price for people using American Express cards and a lower price for people using Visa and MasterCard credit cards .
Merchants will also not be allowed to give discounts based on which bank issued the debit or credit card you are using .
Why would a merchant want to do that ?
Because the bill gives the Federal Reserve the ability to set a limit on the fees that stores must pay to accept debit cards .
The catch here , though , is that only banks with more than $ 10 billion in assets would be subject to the cap .
As a result , merchants may have to pay more to accept debit cards from smaller banks and credit unions than big banks like Bank of America and Chase .
And if that were to happen , stores might be tempted to offer discounts to people with big bank debit cards .
The commerce department reported that retail sales in May were down by 1.2 % from April .
This surprised most economists who had expected a modest increase .
The media were filled with accounts of economists trying to explain why consumers were still reluctant to open up their wallets and spend in a big way .
It would have been much more interesting to hear accounts of why economists were surprised .
There is always a large random element in month - to - month movements in retail sales or any other economic variable .
Therefore no one is ever going to be able to explain these changes with any precision .
( The data are also subject to large revisions , so it is entirely possible that revised data will look very different from the report released last week ( pdf ) . )
Nonetheless , there is little basis for the surprise shown by so many economic analysts .
With few exceptions these analysts failed to see the $ 8tn housing bubble , the collapse of which sank the economy .
Remarkably , even now they apparently cannot understand its importance .
To put it as simply as possible ( so even an economist can understand it ) , the housing bubble was driving the economy in the period prior to its collapse , beginning in 2007 .
It drove the economy in two ways .
The run up in house prices led to a building boom .
Residential construction , which is typically less than 4 % of GDP , rose to more than 6 % , creating more than $ 300bn in additional annual demand .
A bubble in non-residential real estate added perhaps another $ 150 bn to annual demand .
The bubble also drove the economy through the effect of housing wealth on consumption .
Economists usually estimate that $ 1 of additional housing wealth increases annual consumption by between 5 - 7 cents .
This implies that the $ 8tn of housing bubble wealth would lead increase consumption by $ 400bn to $ 560 bn a year .
With most of the bubble wealth eliminated by the collapse of house prices over the last three years , we should expect a sharp drop in consumption .
Furthermore , stock prices have lost a bit less than a third of their value ( around $ 6tn ) , which we should expect to cause a further decline in consumption .
With the stock wealth effect estimated at 3 - 4 cents on the dollar , the decline in stock prices should have reduced annual consumption by $ 180 bn to $ 240bn .
In total we should expect to see annual consumption have dropped by between $ 600bn and $ 900bn as a result of the loss of housing and stock wealth .
This is all very simple arithmetic and basic economics .
Consumption had been driven by the housing bubble prior to the recession .
Now that the bubble has collapsed and trillions of dollars of wealth has disappeared we should expect much lower levels of consumption .
To flip this around , the savings rate , which had averaged more than 8 % in the decades prior to the 90s , fell to near zero in the years leading up to the recession .
Now that the bubble has collapsed , we should expect consumption to fall and saving to return back to its normal level .
In fact , it might even go higher since the huge cohort of baby boomers is now mostly in their 50s and most have almost nothing saved for retirement .
This might lead savings rates to go above their long - term average .
There seems very little room for argument in this story .
The existence and housing and stock wealth effects are among the least questioned propositions in economics .
Nor is there too much dispute about their size .
How could any economist see the collapse of an $ 8tn housing bubble and the destruction of more than $ 6tn in stock wealth and not expect to see a substantial decline in consumption ?
Yet , we have dozens of economists being cited in newspapers and broadcast news , all saying that they are surprised by weak consumption .
If anything the surprise should be that consumption is still as strong as it is .
The saving rate is still near 4 % , far below its historic average .
Why on earth would any economist expect it to go still lower ?
The reason that consumers are not spending more money has nothing to do with attitudes .
The reason that most consumers are n't spending is the same reason that homeless people do n't spend much money : they do n't have any .
Economists used to be able to understand basic economic concepts .
Apparently , most have lost this ability .
As a result we are likely to see many more surprised economists and much proposed in the way of very bad economic policy .
Son of Kyrgyzstan 's ousted president held in UK as 60,000 Uzbeks flee 'ethnic cleansing '
[ caption ]
The playboy son of Kyrgyzstan 's deposed leader has been arrested in Britain - just as the ethnic violence which have plagued his country reached a new bloody peak .
Maksim Bakiyev fled the crisis - hit former Soviet state two months ago but was arrested on Sunday when his private jet touched down at Farnborough Airport in Hampshire .
The 33 - year - old has been on Interpol 's wanted list ever since his father , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , was forced out as Kyrgyzstan 's president in a violent uprising last April .
When his father was in power , the whisky - loving Maksim controlled all foreign investment into the country : a role he allegedly used to embezzle £ 24 million .
Although the UK Border Agency today refused to confirm the Maksim Bakiyev 's arrest it is understood that he had been planning to apply for asylum in Britain .
[ caption ]
[ caption ]
News of his arrest came as the violent ethic clashes that have followed the change in regime appear to have worsened .
[ caption ]
Today it was claimed that the country 's security forces have been cooperating with ethnic Kyrgz to deliberately target the ethnic
Uzbeks which make up a fifth of the country 's 5.5 million people
One ethnic Uzbek man living in the southern city of Osh said that over a thousand ethnic
Uzbeks have died at the hands of armed gangs which are conducting a campaign of ‘ ethnic cleansing ’
Isamidin Kudbidunov , a 27 - year - old ethnic Uzbek , said : ‘ There are at least 1,000 dead here in Osh .
We have not been able to register them because they turn us away at the hospital and say it is only for Kyrgyz people . ’
One of the 60,000 Uzbek refugees to have fled the country said : ‘ Through Soviet times we lived together in peace , but now we can never stay neighbours .
‘ This is ethnic cleansing - if we do n't run , they will kill us . ’
Western journalists in Osh - which lies on the Kyrgyzstan / Uzbekistan border - saw Uzbek men armed with makeshift weapons standing guard over basements where their loved - ones were cowering for safety .
Other reports from the neighbouring city of Jalalabad said that mobs of around 200 youths were marching the streets threatening to shoot ethnic Uzbeks .

[ caption ]
The claims that thousands have died in the violence is far in excess of official figures released by the country 's interim government which claim that just 124 people have perished .
Though dirt poor , Kyrgyzstan is strategically important because uniquely it hosts both US and Russian military bases , and is also close to China .
The U.S. base is seen as vital for Western efforts to defeat the Taliban in Afghanistan as it is a key resupply point for US personnel and equipment in Afghanistan .
One of the reasons for the April 's coup was popular discontent with the enormous personal fortune acquired by Kurmanbek Bakiyev while he was in power .
[ caption ]
[ caption ]
In a country where the average monthly wage is just £ 45 , revelations about the ‘ Bakiyev millions ’ plus the family 's extravagant lifestyle stirred deep anger .
But while Bakiyev 's five brothers and his two sons all held lucrative Government positions , the most hated family member was Maksim , who lived an ostentatious playboy lifestyle in the capital Bishkek .
Former associates have spoken of Maksim 's love for expensive whisky , his collection of playing cards inlaid with gold and his passion for pretty women .
While he is now thought to be under arrest in Britain , his father is in exile in Belarus .
London hospital boosted its budget – and cheered up a few in - patients – by allowing company to shoot porn on its premises , MP claims
A London hospital hired out one of its wards to the makers of a big budget pornographic movie , a Conservative MP told parliament .
Penny Mordaunt , the newly elected member for Portsmouth North , said she had discovered the irregularity while working as communications director for Kensington and Chelsea council , although she did not name the hospital in question .
Speaking at a Commons debate on improving transparency in government accounting , Ms Mordaunt said : " When I was director of Kensington and Chelsea council , I discovered that one of our local hospitals was hiring out one of its closed – but fully - equipped – wards to a film company to use as a film set .
" To add insult to injury , the movie was a pornographic one .
Although I cannot claim to have seen the final picture – as I understand , these things are no longer claimable on parliamentary expenses – it was a big - budget affair and generated substantial income for the hospital .
But apart from cheering up a few of the in - patients , it can not be said to be contributing to the objectives of the PCT [ primary care trust ] . "
The U.S. mission in Afghanistan centers around swaying locals to its side .
And there 's no better persuasion tool than an invisible pain ray that makes people feel like they 're on fire .
OK , OK .
Maybe that is n't precisely the logic being employed by those segments of the American military who would like to deploy the Active Denial System to Afghanistan .
I 'm sure they 're telling themselves that the generally non-lethal microwave weapon is a better , safer crowd control alternative than an M - 16 .
But those ray - gun advocates better think long and hard about the Taliban 's propaganda bonanza when news leaks of the Americans zapping Afghans until they feel roasted alive .
Because , apparently , the Active Denial System is " in Afghanistan for testing . "
An Air Force military officer and a civilian employee at the Air Force Research Laboratory are just two of the people telling Danger Room co-founder and AOL News ace Sharon Weinberger that the vehicle - mounted " block 2 " version of the pain ray is in the warzone , but has n't been used in combat .
[ Update : " We are currently not testing the Active Denial System in Afghanistan , " Kelley Hughes , spokesperson for the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate , tells Danger Room .
So I ask her :
Has it been tested previously ?
She hems and haws .
" I 'm not gonna get into operational , " Hughes answers .
Hughes also disputes the assertion that Active Denial creates a burning feeling .
" It 's an intolerable heating sensation , " she says .
" Like opening up an oven door . " ]
For years , the military insisted that the Active Denial System – known as the " Holy Grail " of crowd control – was oh - so - close to battlefield deployment .
But a host of technical issues hampered the ray gun : everything from overheating to poor performance in the rain .
Safety concerns lingered ; a test subject had to be airlifted to a burn center after being zapped by the weapon .
( He eventually made a full recovery . )
And then there were concerns about " the atmospherics " – how the locals might react – when they learned that the United States had turned a people - roaster on 'em .
" Not politically tenable , " the Defense Science Board concluded .
I pinged Gen. Stanley McChrystal 's staff about the use of Active Denial in Afghanistan .
I 'll let you know if I hear anything back .
But a few months ago , a source told me that a representative from the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate was in Afghanistan .
Did that mean Active Denial was about to be put into action ?
Nope , the source said .
" She 's just out getting some atmospherics on the use of non-lethals . "
__
Update 2__ : " The active denial system is in the country , " e-mails Lt. Col.
John Dorrian , a spokesman for Gen. McChrystal .
" However , it has not been used operationally and no decision has been made at this time to deploy it . "

The spokesman from the federal prosecutor ’s office told thethat two men appeared in Cologne to apply for a German passport .
He added that the man currently in custody of the Polish authorities works for an intelligence agency and was present during the passport application process .
According to foreign media reports , an Israeli with the name of Michael Bodenheimer secured a German passport in June 2009 from Cologne authorities .
The spokesman said the alleged intelligence agent in Poland was not the individual who traveled with Bodenheimer ’s German passport to Dubai in January .
A man using that name was among the assassins who killed the Hamas operative , according to Dubai police .
Brodsky was arrested in early June upon his arrival in Poland because of a European arrest warrant issued by Germany , which is now seeking his extradition , the spokesman said , declining to be named in line with department policy .
The spokesman had no estimate of how long it could take for Brodsky to be extradited from Poland to Germany , saying “ the matter is now in the hands of the Polish authorities . ”
If Brodsky agrees , the extradition could take a few days , but that is n’t likely , the spokesman said .
Beyond confirming that an Israeli citizen had been arrested at the beginning of the month in Warsaw , and that he had requested consular assistance , the Foreign Ministry refused to say anything else about the matter Saturday night , including whether Israel was trying to stop Brodsky ’s extradition to Germany .
The ministry also refused to discuss the reasons for – or circumstances surrounding – his arrest .
The Prime Minister ’s Office , which has authority for the Mossad , refused to discuss the matter .
In Warsaw , Monika Lewandowska , a spokeswoman for Polish prosecutors , confirmed that the suspect , identified only as Uri B. , was arrested at the city ’s international airport on June 4 .
She told the AP that the arrest warrant was made “ in connection with the murder of a Hamas member in Dubai . ”
The suspect appeared before a Polish court on June 6 , and was ordered to remain in temporary arrest for up to 40 days , she said .
Lewandowska had no information on his possible extradition .
Police in the United Arab Emirates said the elaborate hit squad linked to the Jan. 19 slaying involved some 25 suspects , most of them carrying fake passports from European nations .
Dubai ’s police chief , Lt. - Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim , has said he is nearly “ 100 - percent ” certain that the Mossad masterminded the killing .
The brazen assault in a luxury hotel and its alleged perpetrators were widely captured by security cameras .
Some footage , released by Dubai ’s police , showed alleged members of the hit squad disguised as tourists , wearing baggy shorts , sneakers and baseball caps , and carrying tennis rackets .
At the time , Israel said it did n’t know who was responsible for the killing but welcomed it , claiming Mabhouh was a key link in smuggling weapons to Gaza and a possible middleman with Iran .
Der Spiegel
The German news weeklyreported that the arrest in Poland has already led to some diplomatic friction .
The Israeli Embassy has urged Polish authorities not to extradite Brodsky , the magazine reports in its issue to be published tomorrow .
Cholesterol - Busting Statins : Study Raises New Concerns
The landmark JUPITER study may have serious flaws , researchers say .
June 29 , 2010  --
Nearly two years ago , a study known as the JUPITER trial hinted at a new era in the use of statins -- one in which the cholesterol - busting drugs could be used to stave off heart - related death in many more people than just those with high cholesterol .
Now , however , researchers behind a new review that takes a second look at the findings of the landmark study say that these results are flawed -- and that they do not support the benefits initially reported .
Not only did this second look turn up no evidence of the " striking decrease in coronary heart disease complications " reported by investigators behind JUPITER ( Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention ) , but it has also called into question drug companies ' involvement in such trials , according to an article in the June 28 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine .
Moreover , Dr. Michel de Lorgeril of Joseph Fourier University and the National Center of Scientific Research in Grenoble , France , and coauthors argue that major discrepancies exists between the significant reductions in nonfatal stroke and heart attacks reported in the JUPITER trial and what has been found in other research .
" The JUPITER data set appears biased , " Lorgeril and coauthors wrote in conclusion .
Dr. Paul Ridker of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston dismissed de Lorgeril 's criticisms .
Ridker reported the JUPITER results at the American Heart Association meeting in 2008 .
In an email to MedPage Today , Ridker said that JUPITER data " overwhelmingly stand for themselves .
Among a group of individuals with low levels of cholesterol , we clearly demonstrate that those with elevated levels of [ the inflammation marker ] hsCRP are in fact a high - risk population , and that using statin therapy in this group cuts event rates for [ heart attack ] and stroke in half . "
Ridker also pointed out that the " FDA has extensively reviewed these data , found the trial to be well conducted , and recently provided a new indication for the use of statins in primary prevention on the basis of the JUPITER data . "
AstraZeneca , maker of the popular statin Crestor ( known generically as rosuvastatin ) , also defended the JUPITER results and the way in which the study was conducted .
Donna Huang , an AstraZeneca spokesperson , told MedPage Today in an email that the study " was undertaken with a fully independent steering committee , data and safety monitoring board , and academic study statistician . "
She also said Ridker and his co-investigators controlled all data .
" AstraZeneca played no role in conducting data analyses and had no access to unblinded trial data , " she wrote .
De Lorgeril and coauthors point out that nine of 14 authors of the JUPITER article have financial relationships with AstraZeneca , which sponsored the trial .
Ridker has a patent interest in the assay for C- reactive protein ( CRP ) , an inflammation biomarker evaluated in all JUPITER trial participants .
" The sponsor 's pervasive role is clearly described in the second paragraph of the ' Methods ' section of the report : ' the sponsor collected the trial data and monitored the study sites , ' " the authors wrote .
De Lorgeril and coauthors concluded that " the results of the JUPITER trial are clinically inconsistent and therefore should not change medical practice or clinical guidelines .
The results of the JUPITER trial support concerns that commercially sponsored clinical trials are at risk of poor quality and bias . "
Adding to the controversy , authors of another article in the same issue of Archives reported that a review of 11 large primary - prevention trials showed no effect of statin therapy on deaths in high - risk patients .
The JUPITER trial has stood alone in its finding of a significant benefit in patients with no evidence of coronary heart disease .
The trial examined the effect of rosuvastatin in patients with normal or low cholesterol levels but elevated levels of CRP .
Investigators randomized 17,802 apparently healthy men and women to receive either the statin rosuvastatin or a placebo , and then they studied these groups to compare how many suffered heart attacks , strokes and other heart - related problems .
The trial ended early when an interim analysis showed a 44 percent reduction in these events in the group taking the statins ; with results this positive , the logic went , why continue the study ?
But de Lorgeril and his coauthors cited the early termination as one of several methodologic problems with JUPITER .
Although prespecified early stopping points are a well - accepted feature of clinical trials , the rules for stopping should be clearly described .
That was not the case in the published description of the JUPITER protocol .
" Indeed , we still do not know which endpoint was used to define [ the rules for stopping ] , or which level of benefits ... was required to justify early termination , " de Lorgeril and coauthors wrote .
The authors also expressed concern that the trial ended early despite the fact that the data were not consistent with a large difference between the actual drug and the placebo .
On the basis of their review , de Lorgeril and coauthors concluded that " the time has come for a critical reappraisal of cholesterol - lowering and statin treatments for the prevention of CHD complications .
The emphasis on pharmaceuticals for the prevention of CHD diverts individual and public health attention away from the proven efficacy of adopting a healthy lifestyle , including regular physical activity , not smoking , and a Mediterranean - style diet . "
The meta - analysis reported in the same issue of the journal , led by Dr. Kausik Ray of the University of Cambridge in England , examined the findings of 11 randomized clinical trials involving a total of 65,229 patients to see if statins cut death rates among intermediate and high - risk people with no history of cardiovascular disease .
In this study , too , the support for statin use was lacking .
In an editorial that accompanied the two articles , Dr. Lee Green of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor said the de Lorgeril and Kay studies add fuel to a high - stakes debate .
" In the long term , although sincere advocates on both sides will try to convince us otherwise we really must admit that we do not know , " Green wrote .
" We need good research to find out , and , as de Lorgeril and colleagues point out , that search must be free of incentives to find any particular desired answer . "
As their suffering grows , Gazans increasingly feel they have been abandoned by the international community .
Western aid might alleviate their plight , but it is only foreign pro-Palestinian activists like those who sailed on last week 's flotilla that draw attention to their misery , they believe .
Attempts to break the naval blockade such as the one led by the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish vessel , are therefore seen as more important for the publicity they bring than for the relatively insignificant amount of aid they carry .
Dead animal beer bottles at £ 500 each ' perverse ' Published duration 22 July 2010

The End of History - featuring dead animals - comes at £ 500 a bottle
A beer served in bottles made from stuffed animals has been criticised as " perverse " and " pushing the boundaries of acceptability " .
The End of History , made by BrewDog of Fraserburgh , Aberdeenshire , has 55 % alcohol content and is £ 500 a bottle .
The bottles have been made using seven dead stoats , four squirrels and a hare , said to be roadkill .
However , Advocates for Animals and Alcohol Focus Scotland both condemned the marketing .
BrewDog claims the beer is the world 's strongest and most expensive .
Its co-founder James Watt said : " We want to show people there is an alternative to monolithic corporate beers , introduce them to a completely new approach to beer and elevate the status of beer in our culture . "
Advocates for Animals policy director Libby Anderson told the BBC Scotland news website : " It 's pointless and it 's very negative to use dead animals when we should be celebrating live animals .
" This seems to be a perverse idea .
" It 's just bad thinking about animals , people should learn to respect them , rather than using them for some stupid marketing gimmick . "
She added : " I think the public would not waste £ 500 on something so gruesome and just ignore it . "
Barbara O'Donnell , director of services at Alcohol Focus Scotland , said : " This is another example of this company pushing the boundaries of acceptability all in the pursuit of cheap marketing tactics . "
UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - A United Nations committee that decides which nongovernmental organizations can be accredited to the world body moved on Thursday to keep out the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission .
The group , which had applied for “ consultative status ” at the U.N. Economic and Social Council ( ECOSOC ) three years ago , is an international NGO and advocacy group focusing on protecting the rights of homosexuals and lesbians worldwide .
Diplomats from Western nations that support gay rights complained that Egypt and other developing states that have been criticized by rights groups for discriminating against gays and lesbians prevented the committee from voting on whether to accredit the group , thereby leaving it in limbo .
“ IGLHRC is disappointed by the vote of the Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations to block action on our application , ” Cary Alan Johnson , head of the New York - based group , said in a statement to Reuters .
The U.N. NGO committee has 19 members , among them the United States and Britain , who supported the NGO .
Among those who voted against it were Egypt , Sudan , Qatar , Pakistan , China , Russia , Angola , Burundi and Sudan .
Turkey abstained .
Johnson said it was “ a clear case of discrimination against an organization because it defends the human rights of LGBT people around the world and promotes non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity . ”
LGBT refers to lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people .
The U.S. delegation defended the work of IGLHRC ( www.iglhrc.org).
“ This NGO is committed to combating discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity , ” the U.S. statement said .
“ It has contributed to valuable research on HIV / AIDs and its work is well known to this committee . ”
A Western diplomat told Reuters that “ unfortunately we did n’t have the votes ” on the committee to overcome opposition from countries like Egypt , Qatar , Sudan and others .
The diplomat added that IGLHRC clearly fulfills all the criteria for U.N. accreditation .
The British delegation issued a statement expressing its “ deep regret ” for the decision to reject a U.S. proposal to take action on IGLHRC ’s application for a U.N. accreditation .
The British statement said the move not to accredit the group was proposed by Egypt on behalf of African countries .
“ This act of simple discrimination runs contrary to the principles of the U.N. , of ECOSOC and of the NGO Committee , ” it said .
One envoy told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the United States and Europeans would push for the U.N. Economic and Social Council itself to move to accredit the group , a strategy that he said would have a better chance of success .
Now that the widely - reviewed film 8 : The Mormon Proposition has left the film festival circuit and is available through on - demand cable — with some rumors of technical difficulties in the Salt Lake / Provo areas — reaction is filtering back from Mormon viewers of the film .
LDS Church spokespeople have dismissed the film as blatantly false .
But what I ’m hearing from a number of Mormons deeply familiar with the Proposition 8 campaign is that the film gets it mostly right .
[ See also Holly Welker ’s review here .
– Eds ]
Some take exception to editing choices that sequence events out of context for dramatic effect ; others wish that the filmmakers had not been so cartoonish in their depictions of anti-gay - marriage standpoints , using only notorious bigots like Utah Representative Chris Buttars .
But most of the Mormon folks I ’m hearing from agree : to see this film is to know what we on the inside saw unfolding all around us during election season 2008 .
And since then , we ’ve seen the costs to our community of claiming to work in “ coalition ” with others while in fact shouldering an incredibly disproportionate share of the work and fundraising .
The old Mormon pioneer hymn celebrates the virtue of “ putting our shoulders to the wheel . ”
Hard work is a Mormon tradition of which I am proud .
Insider double - talk is not .
For when institutional ecclesiastical resources were used to leverage “ voluntary ” and “ grassroots ” participation from Church members , the stage was set for the kind of dramas of “ revelation ” and “ exposé ” the Church now finds itself beset with — played out on movie and television screens across the country .
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction .
What you sow you shall reap .
No matter how carefully Mormon political consultants ( some of them paid handsomely by Church members ’ donations ) tried to script a Mormon “ grassroots ” relationship to the Yes on 8 campaign , talking themselves and the members of their insular world into the legitimacy of these arrangements , it was naive and foolish to think that such a campaign could be conducted without significant consequences .
One of these consequences is that the Church has now branded itself as the leading anti-gay - rights religion in the country .
That ’s an expensive bit of turf to hold in an unsustainable legal and political fight .
Every day , I read news stories from across the country about Mormons .
And let me tell you , this movie alone has gotten ten times more coverage than the Church ’s incredible humanitarian efforts in Haiti and the greening of its chapels combined .
Perhaps it is because the leveraging of Mormon “ grassroots ” participation created an environment of double - talk and secrecy that hearkens back to the polygamy days of the late nineteenth century and reaffirms some of the oldest and least favorable public stereotypes of Mormons as an insular , secretive , manipulative people .
During the campaign season , many of us who were Mormon and supported marriage equality found ourselves in the otherworldly situation of trying to communicate to outsiders the magnitude of what we saw happening inside our Church , only to be met — for the most part — with disinterest or disbelief , or a consistent underestimation of Mormon organizational capacity and discipline .
Well - meaning , politically savvy , liberal friends took one look at my wild , puffy eyes during fall 2008 and would say — trying to be comforting —
“ I know , I know , the evangelicals are at it too ” or “ do n’t worry , there just are n’t that many of you Mormons in California . ”
Ignorance .
It is precisely this kind of insularity and ignorance that a progressive public conversation about religion must confront and , finally , demolish .

That people like my own parents who have worked hard all their lives can’t abide the idea that others might get an inside track to special privileges .
Prime Minister Julia Gillard on an ‘ agreed principle ’ she set out while speaking to the Lowy Institute today about immigration
I agree with Gillard .
The big mining companies she cut a rotten deal with have got an inside track to special privileges – special privileges worth between $ 4.5 bn and $ 9.5 bn in forgone tax .
Ah , but Gillard was n’t talking about the rich and powerful in our society , was she ?
She was attacking – nudge nudge , wink wink – refugees , the most powerless and vulnerable people on the planet .
You know – the people fleeing all those special privileges like war , rape , torture , death and risking their life savings and their lives to get here where they can enjoy all those other special privileges like life and liberty .
Here ’s another one of Gillard ’s ‘ agreed principles ’ :
That hardworking Australians who themselves are doing it tough want to know that refugees allowed to settle here are not singled out for special treatment .
What special treatment ?
To live behind razor wire , with the threat of being returned to the country you fled from ?
To be subject to abuse ?
To be condemned by all sides of politics ?
To struggle to survive in Australia ?
As Michelle Grattan puts it the dog whistle has turned into a wolf howl .
Gillard is the destroyer of dreams , the hellfire of hope .
Gillard does , unconsciously , touch on an important point .
Many hard working Australians fear for their future .
The pall of economic insecurity that hangs over working class Sydney , over working class Melbourne and other Australian cities has created concerns about border protection ( whatever that is ) and re-ignited the traditional white Australian fear of the yellow hordes .
This irrational fear of refugees is a reflection of the rational fear of poverty , unemployment , inadequate wages , crap jobs , inadequate housing and the poor schools , hospitals and transport systems that are the hallmarks of capitalism in Australia .
But the solution is not the demonisation of refugees .
That wo n’t improve workers ’ living standards one iota .
It wo n’t create one job .
It wo n’t build one school , hospital or train line .
In fact it weakens the struggle for a better life for Gillard ’s hard working Australians by diverting attention away from the real creators of our misery – the bosses and their governments .
The campaign for refugees is the campaign for jobs , better wages and improved social services .
Processing asylum seekers offshore is a return to John Howard ’s Pacific solution .
It removes the ‘ problem ’ from Australia ’s shores and dumps our refugees on the doorstep of East Timor , a country whose poverty rivals that of the refugees themselves .
We will use our wealth , and our control of the country , to impose this processing centre on East Timor .
Gillard will buy off their acquiescent leadership with aid money , just as Howard bought off Nauru .
Dragging people from Australia and processing them in East Timor is not a solution .
People will continue to flee from the devastation and destruction we have created in Afghanistan and Iraq , from the barbarity in Sri Lanka we support , from the dictatorship in Iran .
What Gillard is creating is hopelessness in refugees .
There is no point in coming .
We will remove you and put you behind bars , in East Timor , a country itself imprisoned for 24 years .
You have no future .
Here is your hell .
Abandon all hope .
We should welcome refugees , not abandon them .
The fight for a just society is the fight for refugees .

All Hope Abandon
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The White House said on Friday Israel ’s blockade of the Gaza Strip was unsustainable and urged a Gaza aid vessel sent by pro-Palestinian activists to divert to an Israeli port to reduce the risk of violence .
“ We are working urgently with Israel , the Palestinian Authority , and other international partners to develop new procedures for delivering more goods and assistance to Gaza , ” said Mike Hammer , spokesman for the White House National Security Council .
“ The current arrangements are unsustainable and must be changed .
For now , we call on all parties to join us in encouraging responsible decisions by all sides to avoid any unnecessary confrontations , ” Hammer said in a statement .
Israel was preparing to intercept the Irish - owned ship the Rachel Corrie , bound for Gaza with aid and activists , after its naval operation on Monday in which nine Turkish activists were killed on another ship when it was boarded by Israeli forces .
“ It remains a U.S. priority to provide assistance to the people of Gaza , ” Hammer said .
“ In the interest of the safety of all involved , and the safe transmission of assistance to the people of Gaza , we strongly encourage those on board the Rachel Corrie and other vessels to sail to Ashdod to deliver their materials to Gaza , ” he said , referring to the Israeli port .
New York 's Jewish community was set to mark four years since the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Gaza militants with what they call the " True Freedom Flotilla . "

The name chosen for the event echoes the name of a recent 8 - ship flotilla that sailed from Turkey toward Gaza to break the Israeli blockade on the Hamas - ruled territory , which was named the Freedom Flotilla .
The flotilla was to encircle the Statue of Liberty and then sail to United Nations building .
The two - hour event was to involve seven vessels :
The Queen of Hearts which can hold up to 600 passengers , another smaller boat and five privately owned yachts .
The flotilla was organized by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations , an umbrella group of American Jewish organizations .
Israel 's mission to the UN has also joined the initiative , as did Israel 's Consulate General in New York .
Boats were scheduled to move north on the East River at 12:00 noon New York time on Thursday , June 24th from Houston Street and West Side Highway .
The flotilla can be viewed from the East River Esplanade .
Entrance to the Esplanade is on the east side of First Avenue at 34th , 35th or 37th Streets .
" For four years , Hamas has denied Gilad Shalit the most basic rights , including visits by international organizations , " Israel 's ambassador to the UN said on Thursday , adding that this was both illegal and immoral .
Joel Lion , the Spokesperson and Consul for Media Affairs at the Consulate General of Israel in New York , has put together a package full of clothing and food which was to be handed to a Red Cross representative to be brought to Shalit though the organization 's international channels .
Character design is paramount to pretty much any kind of comic .
Most comics have things in them , and some of those things are characters , and those characters better be well - designed .
Design allows the artist to communicate essential information to the reader about a character , and a good design allows for versatility independent of minor details .
I ’ll probably write a more specific post later about the mechanics of character design , but for now I ’m just compiling a list of my personal favorite comic character designs .
All of the one I list exhibit all of the key essential design elements :
Silhouette - the outer shape is clear and unique
- the outer shape is clear and unique Value - the lights and darks provide effective contrast
- the lights and darks provide effective contrast Color - meaningful and compelling color choices
- meaningful and compelling color choices Versatility - details of the design are flexible
- details of the design are flexible Iconic - striking , memorable imagery
Here are my favorite designs from the world of comics :
# 10 - Spider Jerusalem
The crotchety protagonist from Warren Ellis ’ spectacular cyberpunk series Transmetropolitan was designed by Darick Robertson .
It ’s a masterful exercise in simplicity ; Spider ’s outfit is mostly black , bisected by a “ band ” of light tone created by his exposed torso .
He ’s a bit of a looming figure , but it ’s broken up nicely by the odd glasses , which are really the most distinct element of the character .
They ’re not only instantly recognizable , but the unusual pairing of shapes suggests a facial expression ( specifically the raising of an eyebrow ) .
This is a great twist on the iconic nature of sunglasses , which are traditionally associated with the hiding of expression .
You can pretty much know it ’s him from any angle , and even from silhouette , Robertson generally maintains the sunglasses as visible .
Clarity of design and the striking shapes makes Spider Jerusalem a visually memorable character .
# 9 - Thor
Designed by the king of superhero comics , Jack Kirby , Thor succeeds in suggesting historical and mythological elements without being bound to them stylistically .
Aside from the hammer , there ’s very little that ’s literally Norse about the details of Thor ’s outfit , but Kirby gets the point across effectively and stylishly .
Wrapped boots , the suggested armor circles and the feathered helmet are there to add to the theme of a near - invincible god , rather than hit us over the head with the premise .
All the primary shapes and colors emphasize
Thor ’s power and build : his exposed arms and wrist bands emphasize his musculature , and the pointed shoulders and raised cape accentuate his already broad frame .
Even the shape of the hair hugs the outline of the head to suggest both a powerful and royal feel .
# 8 - Calvin & Hobbes
I ’m counting these guys as one design , as one really does n’t work without the other .
The beauty of Calvin & Hobbes is that they contrast so well , and their design tell us not only about themselves but about each other .
Calvin ’s diminutive , his scruffed hair and dropped face suggests a child at odds with authority , but only through his own chaos and not through direct malevolence .
Hobbes towers over Calvin , and often hunches a bit to see him , emphasizing that he is often humoring Calvin ’s speeches .
One thing I especially like about Hobbes is that although he ’s very cartoony , he still moves and acts like a cat .
His body coils and stretches , and his fur will often stand on end in appropriate fashion .
It ’s nice to see a character that is n’t just “ generic talking animal # 357 . ”
# 7 - The One Electronic
You did n’t think I would n’t have a robot , did you ?
T.O.E. , the mysterious sometimes - protagonist from Evan Dahm 's Overside stories , is a good example of a character design that is n’t tied to a specific costume .
There ’s definitely a color theme and general silhouette requirements ( purple and white are dominant , with either a cape , poncho or coat ) , but it ’s T.O.E. ’s distinctive head that gives him away .
His face is a television screen that , in each panel , displays a different image from vintage film or television ( despite existing in a completely different universe ) .
It ’s an unusual flourish that is never explained , which is all the better .
This character reeks mystery , and everything about the design emphasizes that : the head is a simple , recognizable shape , the colors are always subdued and T.O.E. can somehow eat and smoke a cigarette with only a glass screen .
When we see T.O.E. we immediately want to know what he ’s thinking .
It ’s a character that draws us into the mystery of Dahm ’s stories .
# 6 - The Elric Brothers
Edward and Alphonse Elric , the beleaguered protagonists from the manga Fullmetal Alchemist , are a wonderful exercise in shape and silhouette dynamics .
Al , the giant suit of armor , plays against visual type and generally behaves very timidly , while Ed is the diminutive hothead .
The designs are largely about shape contrasts ; despite having some spikes and a mean looking head , Al ’s body shape is bulbous , almost like a baby or toddler , hinting at his childlike nature .
The shapes created by Ed ’s red coat and unusual cutoff jacket make him look shorter than he is , and there are some subtle sharp edges created that suggest his prickly personality .
The designs also tell us about the history of the characters , specifically the premise of the show .
Al actually has no body , his soul bound to this suit after their accident .
Ed too has a prosthetic arm and leg , which are sometimes ( but not always ) hidden by his outfit .
They ’re tough kids with a rough history , and it comes through perfectly .
Also I ’d be lying if I said Edward ’s prosthetics were n’t a partial inspiration for my own protagonist .
# 5 - Popeye
Ugly as sin and built like a bag of hammers , Popeye ’s visuals communicate so much about his character .
His head looks like it was caved in , perpetually in a facial expression of mild annoyance .
His limbs look as if they were squashed , emphasizing a scrappy , combative personality , and the second highest contrast area directs us to his bulbous arms , clearly indicating this is a character who does most of his thinking with his fists .
Popeye is one of the best examples of design going beyond just what the characters are wearing and into how the characters are physically built .
# 4 - Hellboy
Mike Mignola is one of my favorite comic artists in general , and nowhere is his solid art sense more evident than in the design of Hellboy .
There are some strong , simple shapes going on here , both in the massive stone right hand and in the two “ circles ” on his head ( which are actually shaved down horns ) .
The big , clear shapes make it possible for the little shapes ( like the details of the belt and coat ) to be very flexible , meaning Hellboy does n’t really need a set “ costume ” for us to know it ’s Hellboy .
Mignola avoids the traditional “ heroic broad shoulders ” design elements for Hellboy , instead pushing the posture and build of a working class man .
Fighting monsters is just his job , and there ’s a tired look in his expression and in the downward sloping shapes created by his coat and body .
He ’s a tough , stoic character , and everything about the design conveys this .
If you did n’t know any better , you ’d think the guy was carved out of rock .
# 3 - Tank Girl
Tank Girl , brainchild of Gorillaz co-creator Jamie Hewlett , is a special case in a couple ways .
For starters , she ’s sadly one of the only dynamically designed female characters in mainstream comics , but also she seemingly breaks some of the rules I put forth at the beginning .
Where are the clear shapes , colors and lines ?
They ’re actually there , but they ’re produced by the chaos of the details .
I mentioned earlier that we do n’t really need to know the details of what ’s on Hellboy ’s belt , just so long as it ’s there and there ’s stuff on it .
This concept is taken to its extreme with Tank Girl , who is generally decked out in all sorts of military and punk - themed paraphernalia .
The designs are anything but generic , and despite what should be clutter in the hands of any other creator , it holds together .
Why ?
There ’s a method to the madness .
There are repeating elements like the helment , her hairstyle ( within a range ) , the types of shapes created by the gear and clothing .
Similar to T.O.E. earlier , certain types of clothing “ fit ” the design , while others do n’t .
It also helps that outside of the clothing , Hewlett designed Tank Girl ’s body and face to resemble a real specific person and not “ generic comic book lady . ”
If you ’ve seen his work on Gorillaz you ’ll know that he does a good job of swapping out costumes on characters without ever losing the iconic “ feel ” of those characters .
You can always tell it ’s Tank Girl .
It ’s also not just style for its own sake .
Tank Girl ’s appearance tells us a lot about the character : crude , chaotic , but pragmatic in her own right .
This also sets the theme very well for the tone of the comic itself .
An absolutely ingenious design that would be a mess in the hands of a lesser artist .
# 2 - Arzach
French comic legend Mobeius ’ comic Arzach has always been near and dear to my heart .
Although many in the US may not know it directly , we ’ve seen its legacy , being the partial inspiration for such great works as Nausicaa and Panzer Dragoon .
Arzach , like Tank Girl , is n’t tied to a specific outfit but rather a style of outfit , the most iconic two elements being his unusually pointy hat and his “ stone pterodactyl ” steed .
However , unlike the intentional chaos of Hewlett ’s design , every element of Arzach ’s outfit is carefully chosen : he is a warrior and traveler , and carries with him only items of absolute necessity ( aside from the ceremonial trinkets ) .
Arzach never speaks a word in the series ( in fact , it ’s virtually wordless ) , flying across a dreamlike landscape in his surreal , partially symbolic adventures .
Not only does everything about the design convey “ weary traveler , ” but it also hints at a culture and world we ’ll never fully know .
His tunics are always wide , emphasizing his broad shoulders , and he is covered from head to toe in hand - stitched garb and gear , reminiscent of both Mesoamerican fashion and Natives of the American West .
With his pterodactyl , he symbolizes a striking , dreamlike freedom that we want to follow , but the weapons on his person also suggest a warlike past .
He is the Odysseus archetype , forever wandering , but also conquering his foes through wits .
Arzach is the ultimate visual oneironaut .
# 1 - Moon Boy
Moon Boy is a naked monkey that rides a dinosaur .
Looking at these sculptures from a distance gives the illusion of pixelated illustrations .
Artist Shawn Smith has managed to make them out of ink , plywood and acrylic paint so they would look computerized in a way .
He is interested in the connection between technology and the real world .
The television gives us a perfect picture of the nature , but all we actually see are pixelated pictures of it .
The unique 3D sculptures Smith creates are mostly of animals like for instance a colorful peacock or a majestic vulture .
Pixels have also been inspiring for another artist that has made 8 - bit illustrations of popular characters and themes from old school video games and movies .
We 've told you about American Apparel 's photo - based hiring standards , its anti-uglies internal policies , and its " natural " employee grooming standards .
Yesterday , the company issued a statement defending itself .
Well then .
Time for AA employees to spill some dirt for you .
All of the following are taken from emails we received from current and former American Apparel employees during the past week .
Yesterday , American Apparel said in its statement that " American Apparel does not hire or retain applicants based on ' beauty .'... The company legitimately reviews current photographs of job applications and employees to consider their sense of style and the way in which they present themselves . "
Now , some employee perspective on that policy :
These [ biases ] based on attractiveness are 100 % accurate .
Throughout my years there , I was repeatedly forced to deal with unprofessional , and unqualified corporate employees .
There 's no way that these 19 year old girls had the foggiest idea how to manage entire districts of retail stores .
I was always confused as to why these was always some overly - sexualized young woman on the arm of every male employee with a job at the factory .
Why did they need " assistants " ?...
At the time of hiring someone new , it 's true , they had to be good looking .
My manager did n't like the policy , but enforced it .
The only girls that were not totally emaciated were forced to work back - stock .
So as not to disgust the customers with their average sized hips .
God forbid .
Photographs had to be taken .
We were told how to dress , down to how we were n't to wear makeup .
If Dov had it his way , every employee at AA would be barely legal , emaciated , and wearing a lace tank - thong with high heels ... Horrible man .
Horrible company .
Horrible quality of clothing .
Horrible everything .
A pithier version :
It 's not only pictures for employees that we need to take pictures of .
We need to submit a photo of ourselves if we are to get a raise to make sure we are on brand .
Even the stock boys .
It is bullshit .
Clothes were n't the only things that could get a potential employee declared " off - brand : "
Dov and Marsha did n't like the idea of band members working at AA .
If the applicant was in a band , we were supposed to take down his / her myspace or website address and that would go into the email being sent in for review .
A résumé would not be sent , though .
Just pictures and some notes we made about the applicants .
There was some sort of " interview sheet " on the intranet , but I never knew a manager who made use of that , nor do I ever remember it being mentioned on the conference call .
Oh , and the same went for blogs and bloggers .
AA wanted to know what their sites looked like and were about .
So to be clear - there was NO outlined rubric for hiring that was ever brought to anyone 's attention .
No point system .
Nothing .
I tried so hard to get numerous interesting , experienced , intelligent employees hired , but they were n't " on- brand " enough .
A recently departed former AA store manager tells of life in Dov 's fast - paced kingdom :
Corporate reps started visiting more and more often .
I use the term " reps " loosely because for the most part , these girls ( and yes , they were nearly almost always hot chicks in their 20's ) resume 's would read like Kelly Bensimon 's interests blurb on facebook ...
" Model , photographer , style icon " etc etc .
Employees were fired for being " off brand " at a moment 's notice , and my staff began to dwindle .
Eventually it reached the point that I was working 7 days a week , every week , for months .
I could count the number of days off I 'd had in 6 months on one hand .
The worst part was that they would n't let me hire anyone .
I kept taking pictures , kept sending in emails to get REALLY AWESOME people approved , and kept being told no , no , no .
Either they did n't like their style , or they looked off .
There were never any concrete reasons for applicants not being approved .
Emails usually came back with one liners " Not approved .
Bad style " .
Even people who had been approved previously were n't safe .
If Dov saw someone he did n't like — they were supposed to be dunzo .
I knew of people within the company who had been fired for refusing to terminate employees Dov wanted gone .
I wo n't go in to the personal hell my life became anytime Dov was in town — that 's a different story for a different time .
This former employee did time at both retail stores and at the company 's factory in Los Angeles :
We were asked to take class photo's constantly .
In one instance we received a mysterious phone call from a girl who would not give her exact position , but said she had heard that we were doing poorly and found us some recruits .
We were then forced to send in a class photo immediately ( so that she could assess the alleged ugly employee situation ) .
Only three of us were working , including myself , and the photo was sent in within five minutes .
A few minutes later we got a call back saying " well you guys look great , I thought you had a staffing issue over there . "
Basically implying that the only plausible reason for not making sales is being unattractive .
To no surprise the store was closed down months later .
I have had my picture taken countless times and if I questioned it I probably would have been fired .
I briefly worked at the factory and discovered how disgusting the company actually is .
My very first day I was greeted with " go upstairs to the second floor , Dov is giving away free shoes to pretty girls . "
My business at the factory was in the " creative " department .
My skills as a graphic designer were dismissed and all that mattered was that I was attractive .
I received the position by having my picture taken , not by resume , portfolio , or degree .
I had encounters with the models , who are by the way , probably the dumbest girls in North America .
On the company 's Grooming Standards :
In regard to the recent article about Grooming , it is 100 % true .
Not only do they have it on paper , they also have a team from " corporate " who come to the stores just to see what we 're wearing .
Just a couple weeks ago , a posse of power tripping nineteen year olds came in ( literally everyone from this corporate fantasy land is a maximum age of 20 ) and made me go to the bathroom and wash my makeup off ( and by makeup I mean a splash of liquid eyeliner and mascara and nothing at all hooker inspired ) .
And then they scolded me for not being on the sales floor .
Also , whenever we get considered for raises / promotions , we 're required to have our photos sent in for approval .
My co-worker was recently denied a spot as Manager because she did n't fit the company image .
I have no idea why we continue to work there .
And more importantly how are none of us involved in a lawsuit ?
And more :
girls have been told to grow out their eyebrows .
formal warnings have been handed out for having chipped nail varnish .
we have been told not to hire guys to work on shopfloor .
to hire someone we have to take their photo ( one close up , one full length ) and send it to work@americanapparel.net requesting that they be " approved . "
Girls with short hair , fringes , heavy make up will not be approved .
guys will only be approved to work in backstock .
interviews / experience / talent is not required .
this goes for manager and visual merchandiser jobs also .
On the racial aspect of the job :
The store in which I work is located in a very racially and class segregated city , and all the people who work in the back are people of color and everyone who works on the floor is a thin white person .
Myself and another black woman who works in the back recently had a conversation regarding this , that it 's not so much that there is a dress code telling us what to wear and not show tattoos ( which is fairly standard , unfortunately , as someone with multiple tats and plugs ) , but that the way in which it is written , interspersed with pictures of thin white models , is condescending and sets forth a very specific message about who they want to work in their stores and , since it tells us we are supposed to " be what our customers aspire to " , who they want to shop there .
My co-worker told me about this moment with our manager when she was looking at the internal AA website at photos of employees at other stores saying how beautiful these girls were ... when my coworker looked at the pictures , all she saw were multiple photographs of very thin and very tall white women who were n't necessarily or particularly more " gorgeous " for any reason .
[ As always , if you 're an AA employee with something to share , email me . ]

Image caption Kenya 's prisons are notoriously overcrowded
A court in Kenya has ruled that prisoners will be allowed to vote in a referendum on a new constitution .
It is the first time that prisoners in the East Africa nation have been given the right to vote .
The ruling applies only to voting in August 's referendum , but correspondents say it may lead to further concessions for future elections .
There will now be a rush to register an estimated 50,000 inmates in time for the referendum .
It is a credible decision KNCHR 's Hassan Omar Hassan
The ruling was made after a petition was filed by convicts at Shimo La Tewa Prison in the coastal town of Mombasa .
The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights ( KNCHR ) welcomed the decision .
" It is a credible decision , " said the commission 's Hassan Omar Hassan .
" The punishment is supposed to be reformative and when people are incarcerated they lose their freedom but other rights should stay . "
Human rights charter
However , the BBC's Will Ross in Nairobi says if the inmates had been hoping to get a day out in order to vote they will be disappointed .
The same ruling stipulated that every prison would become a polling station .
When Kenyan politicians agreed to share power after disputed elections in December 2007 , writing a new constitution was part of the deal to end the violence .
The draft constitution provides for greater checks on presidential powers and more regional devolution .
It also recognises the UN human rights charter and creates a second parliamentary chamber - the Senate .
Research Suggests Water Content of Moon 's Interior Underestimated
NASA - funded scientists estimate from recent research that the volume of water molecules locked inside minerals in the moon ’s interior could exceed the amount of water in the Great Lakes here on Earth .
Scientists at the Carnegie Institution ’s Geophysical Laboratory in Washington , along with other scientists across the nation , determined that the water was likely present very early in the moon ’s formation history as hot magma started to cool and crystallize .
This finding means water is native to the moon .
“ For over 40 years we thought the moon was dry , ” said Francis McCubbin of Carnegie and lead author of the report published in Monday 's Online Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ In our study we looked at hydroxyl , a compound with an oxygen atom bound with hydrogen , and apatite , a water - bearing mineral in the assemblage of minerals we examined in two Apollo samples and a lunar meteorite . ” McCubbin ’s team utilized tests which detect elements in the parts per billion range .
Combining their measurements with models that characterize how the material crystallized as the moon cooled during formation , they found that the minimum water content ranged from 64 parts per billion to 5 parts per million .
The result is at least two orders of magnitude greater than previous results from lunar samples that estimated water content of the moon to be less than 1 parts per billion .
"
In this case , when we talk about water on the moon , we mean water in the structural form hydroxyl , ” said Jim Green , director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
“ This is a very minor component of the rocks that make up the lunar interior .
” The origin of the moon is now commonly believed to be the result of a Mars - sized object that impacted the Earth 4.5 billion years ago .
This impact put a large amount of material into Earth ’s orbit that ultimately compacted to form the moon .
The lunar magma ocean that is thought to have formed at some point during the compacting process , began to cool .
During this cooling , water either escaped or was preserved as hydroxyl molecules in the crystallizing minerals .
Previous studies found evidence of water both on the lunar surface and inside the moon by using respectively , remote sensing data from the Indian spacecraft Chandrayaan - 1 and other lunar sample analysis .
Carnegie researchers looked within crystalline rocks called KREEP ( K for potassium ; REE , for rare Earth elements ; and P for phosphorus ) .
These rocks are a component of some lunar impact melt and basaltic rocks .
“ Since water is insoluble in the main silicates that crystallized , we believed that it should have concentrated in those rocks , ” said Andrew Steele of Carnegie and co-author of the report .
“ That ’s why we selected KREEP to analyze .
” The identification of water from multiple types of lunar rocks that display a range of incompatible trace element signatures indicates that water may be at low concentrations but ubiquitous within the moon 's interior , potentially as early as the time of lunar formation and magma ocean crystallization .
“ It is gratifying to see this proof of the hydroxyl contents in lunar apatite , ” said lunar scientist Bradley Jolliff of Washington University in St. Louis .
“ The concentrations are very low and , accordingly , they have been until recently nearly impossible to detect .
We can now finally begin to consider the implications - and the origin - of water in the interior of the moon .
” The research was funded by the NASA Astrobiology , Mars Fundamental Research , and the Lunar Advanced Science and Exploration Research programs in NASA ’s Planetary Division in Washington .
The X Prize Foundation announced today that it is developing a multimillion - dollar “ oil spill cleanup X challenge ” to come up with solutions to cleaning up shorelines and open water fouled by oil leaking from the BP Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico .
Speaking at the TEDxOilSpill conference in Washington , Frances Beland of the X Prize Foundation asked the audience of 300 , and many more watching the conference ’s videostream , “ What do you prize ? ”
Beland told CNN after his appearance that the oil - related challenge will probably offer about $ 3 million in prize money for a cleanup solution .
The X Prize Foundation gained public attention for its X Prize of $ 10 million awarded for the development of private spacecraft , and the nonprofit foundation has created other prize challenges .
Beland said the foundation wanted to come up with a prize to find a solution to capping the well but found it was unable to obtain enough data to design such a challenge , so it opted to focus on the cleanup .
“ We ’re going to launch a prize for cleanup , and we ’re going to kick ass , ” he said , to applause .
Beland said 35,000 solutions to the Gulf crisis have been proposed to BP , the government and other organizations , including the X Prize Foundation .
“ Every time we have a challenge , you know who wins ?
It ’s not someone from the industry , it ’s a maverick , a freethinker . ”

THE ECHO can exclusively reveal that Rafa Benitez today donated £ 96,000 to the Hillsborough Family Support Group as he gets set to leave Merseyside .
The former Liverpool FC boss , who was today confirmed as the new manager at Inter Milan , handed over the cheque to Margaret Aspinall , chairwoman of the HFSG , as the rest of the committee watched on this afternoon .
In a low key visit to the group 's office , Benitez wished the group well and told them he hoped they would get the justice and the truth they are campaigning for .
Mrs Aspinall said : " It was just nice to know that he wanted to see us before he went . "
Day one | Day two
SPRAWLING through dusty red desert , the ochre - coloured hills of the Larapinta Trail might have suited John Ford as a backdrop for his great Westerns , if he had n't come across the American west 's Monument Valley first .
The road from Alice Springs is breathtaking .
Wild horses graze on grass from recent rains .
Wrecked cars are casualties of the dead - straight road 's mesmerising dangers .
Then , as I pass the boundary leading to Wallace Rockhole , an aboriginal settlement , a big blue sign by the road jolts me back to my journey 's purpose : “ Warning .
Prescribed Area. No Liquor .
No Pornography . ”
My destination is Hermannsburg , a former mission .
The Lutheran church founded it on the Finke River in 1877 in what was , and still is , one of Australia 's most isolated frontiers .
Now home to about 800 Aranda people , who hold title to the land , Hermannsburg is one of 73 aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory that are subject to one of the most dramatic and controversial federal - government takeovers Australia has seen .
Four years ago Nanette Rogers , a court prosecutor in Alice Springs , gave an explosive television interview .
Her interview lifted the lid on a dark world of violence , sexual abuse and alcoholism in some of the territory 's remote aboriginal communities .
She told of two babies being raped .
She spoke of a “ malaise ” , “ entrenched violence ” , and of aboriginal people being “ overwhelmed time and time again by a fresh new tragedy ” .
Once a public defender , Ms Rogers said she became a prosecutor because she was “ sick of acting for violent aboriginal men ” .
Her words sparked a chain of events that has divided Australia ever since .
In June 2007 the conservative government led by John Howard announced a “ Northern Territory Emergency Response ” , which became better known as “ the intervention ” .
Legislation that had banned racial discrimination in the territory was suspended , troops were sent in , and alcohol and pornography were prohibited in the “ prescribed communities ” .
Half of every welfare payment due to the communities ' residents became subject to a kind of quarantine , obliging the state to “ manage ” their income .
Human - rights activists were outraged .
They branded Mr Howard 's action a return to the white paternalism that had prevailed in this territory 34 years ago , before aborigines won their battle for land rights .
Indigenous people comprise about a quarter of the Northern Territory 's population , compared with 2 % in Australia as a whole .
To those critics ' dismay , the Labor government headed by Kevin Rudd has continued with the intervention .
After almost three years in power , it has yet to fulfil its pledge to reinstate the anti-racial discrimination law ( although legislation to do so is now before parliament ) .
Yet the territory 's hidden horrors reflect a perplexing side of the indigenous Australians ' long struggle for self - determination .
Why should violence , as Nanette Rogers maintains , be so entrenched in parts of aboriginal society ?
Some trace it to the nomadic way of life they led thousands of years before white settlers pushed them off their lands .
Others put it down to a burning resentment at that dispossession , and a void filled mainly by booze and drugs .
As the intervention reaches its third year this month , Hermannsburg is a good place to start testing its results , especially among those it was designed to rescue : aboriginal women .
Tourists now swarm through the old mission 's whitewashed buildings .
Hermannsburg was the birthplace of Albert Namatjira , an Aranda tribesman whose brilliant landscape paintings of central Australia 60 years ago brought him fame ( but not fortune ) .
Bob Durnan , a white health worker here , opposed the intervention at first .
Now he supports it .
He has watched Hermannsburg 's school attendance rate climb from 50 % to 80 % in just three years mainly , he reckons , because the community 's women wanted change .
One of them joins us .
Mildred Inkamala climbs down from a four - wheel - drive vehicle talking on her mobile phone .
Ms Inkamala 's own story makes her something of a charismatic figure .
Trained by the Hermannsburg Lutherans , her father was a noted evangelist .
Sixteen years ago she and her husband , Carl , went to Sydney to be cured of alcoholism .
Both are now members of the MacDonnell Shire , the local government body covering their region .
Resisting pressure from some of her own people , Ms Inkamala has worked as a court interpreter , translating between English and the Aranda language in murder trials against men .
She points out a bank of the Finke River where an 18 - year - old youth , high from sniffing petrol , once raped and murdered a young girl ( he is now in prison in Alice ) .
Then she tells me she now supports the intervention , mainly because it has put an end to “ humbugging ” : men putting pressure on women to hand over money for alcohol , drugs and gambling .
Instead , one half of their “ income - managed ” welfare payments are logged to a “ Basics Card ” , which they can use only to buy such items as fresh food and children 's clothes .
Ms Inkamala has her own perspective on the violence .
“ Our ancestors respected each other , ” she says .
“ They looked after kids .
Whitefellas ' grog has made the change . ”
Inevitably , bootleggers are still finding ways of smuggling grog in , despite the prohibition .
With a paid job of her own , working for the Northern Territory 's family agency , Ms Inkamala is not income - managed .
Her friend Kathy Abbott from Wallace Rockhole , who receives a disability pension , is automatically managed .
Is that fair ?
Ms Abbott says if the system helps women more vulnerable than her , she does not mind .
I take a snapshot of Mildred , Carl and Kathy outside the old Lutheran Church , with healthy - looking children playing nearby .
In some quarters at least , the intervention is being embraced as a fresh approach to stubborn problems .
The big test will be where it goes next .
Day two
TODD MALL , the main street of Alice Springs , looks chillingly like a scene lifted from the film “ Samson and Delilah ” .
Warwick Thornton , an aboriginal director , told the story of two aboriginal teenagers from a nearby settlement , one of them a chronic petrol - sniffer .
They came to town in desperation .
But the rich white tourists there , who sip coffee at open - air cafés while planning “ culture tours ” to aboriginal communities , ignore the stricken kids as their lives spiral ever - downwards .
The movie scooped Australia 's film awards and won a prize at Cannes last year .
The Samson and Delilah characters reflect many real lives .
Marcia Langton , a feisty aboriginal activist , describes them all as being “ trapped in a vast aboriginal reality show ” .
But since the film was made , there have been at least two positive changes .
Petrol - sniffing , of the sort that has killed and incapacitated many indigenous youngsters like Samson , has been almost wiped out in the Northern Territory .
All it took was the introduction of Opal , a non-sniffable form of unleaded petrol .
And at long last , the federal government has started committing significant funds to the rescue of 18 aboriginal settlements on the outer fringe of Alice Springs : the Town Camps .
In 1870 a man named Charles Todd built a repeater station here , to join two massive segments of Australia 's first overland telegraph line .
The town of Alice Springs , named for Todd 's wife , sprang from the station .
The camps followed , as Aranda people from the Western Desert region drifted in looking for work on the huge cattle stations ( or ranches ) that white settlers had staked out .
By the time Bob Durnan , a white health worker , arrived in 1977 , the cattle work had dried up .
“ The place was on fire , ” he recalls .
“ Grog was everywhere .
Alcohol had become their way of life , their god . ”
Mr Durnan helped to found the Tangentyere ( “ working together ” ) Council , a body to oversee the camps and steer their young people towards jobs .
Despite its good work the camps have deteriorated in the 33 years since , becoming a national disgrace .
Their fluctuating population , between 2,500 and 3,500 residents at a given time , remains out of sight to most Australians .
Hidden Valley , Little Sisters and other camps have turned into hell - holes of violence , drugs , broken families , sexual abuse and murder .
The very existence of the camps is embarrassing , as it smacks awkwardly of segregation , the kind that was supposed to have ended .
Yet many people still choose to live there ; the camps offer them a form of cultural affinity .
Pam Lynch is one of them .
Larapinta , her camp , has a stunningly peaceful vista taking in the red MacDonnell ranges .
But I had been advised to steer clear of some of Larapinta 's precincts .
Outsiders are not always welcome .
Ms Lynch drives to and from a job in Alice each day .
“ This camp is home , ” she tells me .
“ My uncle told me our dreaming tracks flow from the hills above it , ” dreaming tracks — also called songlines — being an aborigine 's spiritual connection to the contours of the actual land .
Ms Lynch has just moved from her daughter 's crowded house into a new one of her own .
Hers is one of 85 the federal government has undertaken to build in the town camps .
Under its “ emergency response ” programme , also called “ the intervention ” , the government plans to refurbish another 132 homes in these camps and to build more new homes scattered throughout the Northern Territory .
It says a third of the construction jobs are supposed to go to indigenous workers .
On my visit I see only young white workers , rushing to finish a house opposite Ms Lynch's .
Pam Lynch with her granddaughter , and a brand - new house
These projects have created bitter divisions within the Tangentyere Council .
When John Howard 's conservative government launched the intervention three years ago , it wanted to suspend the natives ' title to land .
The federal government would have assumed control under a 99 - year lease .
The council refused .
Kevin Rudd's Labor government , which succeeded Mr Howard 's , asked for a 40 - year lease instead and doubled the money available to clean up the camps .
Reluctantly , the council signed the deal .
William Tilmouth , the council 's director , says the intervention should be should stopped .
A handsome man with thick grey hair , Mr Tilmouth acknowledges that the drinking and violence in the camps is bad .
His answer to these problems is to seek new ways of including indigenous people in the governance of their own society , through education and jobs , rather than taking over their lives once more .
“ The Northern Territory was built on alcohol , ” he says .
“ Aboriginal people learned binge - drinking from non-aboriginal people . ”
“ From a time , ” he adds , “ when men were men and cattle were frightened of them . ”
William Tilmouth thinks enough 's enough
This clash of cultures is no longer a simple matter of black versus white .
The intervention has introduced a male - versus - female dynamic .
Andrea Mason is head of the Alice - based Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Women 's Council ( known as NPY , thank you very much ) , which welcomes tribal women across the Northern Territory , South Australia and Western Australia .
To critics who see the intervention , especially its policy of income - management , as an outright deprivation of civil rights , Ms Mason says that “ women see it more as a way of taking back control over their finances and lives . ”
The intervention is at a turning point as its third year draws to a close .
Next month a “ Stop the Intervention ” rally is planned for Alice .
Aborigines and their liberal white supporters once marched together to demand their rights .
That demand has long been a flashpoint for Australia 's racial grievances .
This time the battle lines are not so easily drawn .
Florida Statute 316.2065
Bicycle regulations .
(5) ( a ) Any person operating a bicycle upon a roadway at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing shall ride as close as practicable to the right - hand curb or edge of the roadway except under any of the following situations :
1 . When overtaking and passing another bicycle or vehicle proceeding in the same direction .
2 . When preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or driveway .
3 . When reasonably necessary to avoid any condition , including , but not limited to , a fixed or moving object , parked or moving vehicle , bicycle , pedestrian , animal , surface hazard , or substandard - width lane , that makes it unsafe to continue along the right - hand curb or edge .
For the purposes of this subsection , a " substandard - width lane " is a lane that is too narrow for a bicycle and another vehicle to travel safely side by side within the lane .
( b) Any person operating a bicycle upon a one - way highway with two or more marked traffic lanes may ride as near the left - hand curb or edge of such roadway as practicable .

In the summer of 2009 the City Of Miami ran a bicycle safety ad campaign on bus shelters throughout the city .
The public service ads informed motorists about the " 3 - Feet Law " , that " Bikes May Use Full Lane " , and for cyclists to " Always Use Lights At Night " .
The campaign was welcomed by cyclists who finally felt acknowledged by the local government .
However , in recent months a few cyclists have received citations for doing exactly what one of those ads advised , using the full lane .
I have obtained a traffic citation which was recently issued in Little Havana for violation of Florida Statute 316.2065 ( 5 ) , during this particular incident the cyclist was instructed to " move to the right or get on the sidewalk " .
Really ?
Using the full lane when allowed is one of the safest practices for cyclists , it prevents too - close in - lane passing and right hook turns .
Also , cyclists riding past parallel - parked cars should maintain a clearance of 4 feet to avoid risk of collision with an opening car door .
Below is an example of the actual road where the ticket was issued with an illustration of where the cyclist was riding .
The cyclist was using the full right lane on a one - way three - lane road with on - street parking and a 30 mph speed limit .
Informing cyclists that " Bikes May Use Full Lane " only to have police berate them can be very disconcerting .
Miami claims it is committed to becoming a Bicycle Friendly City by 2012 , yet in 2010 cyclists are receiving citations and advised to ride on the sidewalk and / or gutter .
Miami will never be a safe place to ride a bicycle if cyclists continue to be wrongfully punished for riding their bicycles by those who uphold the law .
Email Collin Worth at cworth@miamigov.com ( 305 ) 416-1022 and ask him what the City of Miami is doing to educate law enforcement , because if they do n't understand bicycle laws how can we expect motorists to .-------
The Keynesian Cheerleaders have met their moment of truth : gas or brake ?
Geithner went to plea for more stimulus from Europe and Japan , betting that more deficits now will produce growth and future taxes to pay down the debt .
The Europeans have hit their limit and politely told Geithner where to go .
The Government Bubble has just burst .
Hungary is about to join the PIIGS with unsustainable debt , and the Euro has broken below the recent trading range and is below $ 1.20 - down from $ 1.50 not so long ago .
The next support is around $ 1.16 - 1.18 .
It is in a wave 5 down and could easily overshoot these levels .
All the rescue plans have been for naught , as the wolfpack continues to call the bluff of the finance ministers .
Now even the core countries of Europe are seeing spikes in their CDS spreads .
This witty video from Australia gets across the point that investors have figured out : indebted nations cannot bail out the broke nations .
While the sudden surge in core country CDS spreads may abate , it appears we have crossed a very critical threshold : belief in the wisdom of assuming debt for temporary stimulus .
The Illusion of Stimulus has been punctured .
The Keynesians have no clothes .
There is anger brewing over the failure of Keynesianism : people feel like they have been sold down the river with false promises of easy money in order to line the pockets of overpaid public workers , nefarious bankers and corrupt politicians .
There is no one in the blogosphere better at projecting that anger than Karl Denninger , who rants that the attempt to re-ignite private credit growth has failed .
By his calculation , we borrowed 12 % of GDP last fiscal year , and are on track to do it again this year - levels well above the 5 - 6 % of Hoover and FDR in the Great Depression .
With the backlash against this growing , the US may be forced to pull back to a more sustainable 3 - 5 % level .
That drop of around 8 % will come out of GDP by the way it is calculated , whether it is a drop in spending or a massive increase in taxes , icing the coming double - dip recession .
With total government debt at 130 % of GDP in the US ( including State and local debt as well as unfunded future obligations ) , this point was inevitable here as well - our leadership simply has not been prepared to come to grips with the dimensions of the problem , blindly having faith in Keynesian prescriptions .
Obama 's Summer of Disillusionment is upon us .
His cool , collected style is now viewed as a profound failure of leadership .
Already his most visible gushers of support have begun to publicly air their disappointment ( Maureen Dowd , Tom Friedman , Frank Rich , even Chris " I get a tingle down my leg " Matthews ) .
James Carville rebukes him for his failures with the oil spill .
Quietly , his army of true believers are bailing .
What happens now is laid out by Karl : we are entering an Austrian - Economics style debt - deflation spiral , and there is no longer anything the government can do to prevent it .
The size of potential fall in private debt is well beyond the ability of the government to fill ( $ 52T of total debt vs $ 13T of Federal deficit ) .
We were at about half that total amount of debt just a few years ago when the Greenspan Bubble began ( $ 26T vs $ 52T ) , and we may be headed back that far .
Bubbles tend to retrace to their start .
Hang on to your hats .
And wallets .
Alabama gubernatorial candidate Tim James recently created controversy with his political advertisement titled Language .
The advertisement focuses on one of James ’ campaign promises to eliminate driver ’s license exams in all languages except English .
In the ad , James says , “ This is Alabama .
We speak English .
If you want to live here , learn it . ”
Given the diversity of the American citizenry , we decided to take a look at the data on languages spoken in Alabama .
The last census shows that out of almost four million Alabama residents over the age of five , 162,483 , speak languages other than English .
That ’s only about 5 % of Alabama ’s population , but the numbers are most likely dated ; new census data will likely show the number of foreign language speakers in Alabama has grown significantly .
Currently , the state offers driver ’s license tests in Arabic , Chinese , English , French , German , Greek , Japanese , Korean , Persian , Russian , Spanish , Thai , and Vietnamese .
The table below , based on data from the 2000 Census , shows a small sample of the different languages spoken in Alabama .
The languages offered by the driver ’s license tests are highlighted in red :
The candidate is correct .
Alabamians do in fact speak English , but it ’s clear that they speak a number of other languages as well .
James concludes his advertisement saying , “ Maybe it ’s the businessman in me , but we ’ll save money , and it makes sense .
Does it to you ? ”
Alabama has one of the weakest economies in the US .
Recent figures show that the median household income in Alabama is one of the lowest in the country .
It ’s not clear how Alabama will save money by revamping a computer - automated system that ’s efficient and already in place , but the message sent by such an action , that Alabama does not wish to cater to a linguistically diverse population — might work to harm the state ’s economy in the long - term , as that same diversity traditionally helps to spur economic growth .
As political commentater Richard Adams of the Guardian points out :
The employers of Mercedes - Benz , Hyundai and Honda , among others , may be less than enthusiastic about the English - only plan , since they are the variously German , Korean and Japanese - owned companies who have billions of dollars worth of investments in the great state of Alabama .
And who might have employees who want to work there .
And drive cars , since they are car - makers .
The Alabama Supreme Court agrees with Adams with regard to the economics of the driver ’s license question .
A 2007 ruling against “ Pro English ” — an organization seeking to limit the languages offered to English — upheld a lower court ruling in favor of Gov. Bob Riley and other state officials .
Writing for the majority , Chief Justice Sue Bell Cobb cited the governor ’s argument that :
Permitting people with limited English proficiency to take the written portion of the exam in their native language helped them get a license , and the license fostered their assimilation into the community by increasing their access to education , employment and shopping .

WASHINGTON  A Beatle met the president when Sir Paul McCartney performed at the East Room of the White House on Wednesday night .
Accepting the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song , Mr. McCartney used the occasion to applaud President Obama .
“ Getting this prize would be good enough , ” Mr. McCartney said .
“ But getting it from this president ... ” He smiled .
He added that despite “ difficult times ” for the president , “ you have billions of us who are rooting for you . ”
Then , with the first lady in the front row , Mr. McCartney sang “ a song I have been itching to do at the White House , ” he said .
It was “ Michelle . ”
A few minutes after the concert , Mr. McCartney returned to the microphone , thanking the Library of Congress and adding , “ After the last eight years , it ’s great to have a president who knows what a library is . ”
In the court of American public opinion , North Korea has been declared guilty of sinking the Cheonan and the only question is what sentence to impose on the rogue nation that committed this reckless act .
While there is evidence for that perspective , would it be adequate in a court of law ?
And is it adequate to take actions that could lead to a Korean War , especially one that could go nuclear ?
Recent developments , while far from clearing North Korea , would seem to raise at least reasonable doubt .
Mr. S. C. Shin , originally a member of the commission investigating the incident , but replaced at the request of the South Korean Defense Ministry , has published an open letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in which he presents evidence pointing to an accidental grounding of the Cheonan , followed by a collision with another vessel that caused the Cheonan to break in two .
Shin claims :
The first distress call from the Cheonan was that it had run aground .
A chart initially used by the Navy to show victims ’ families what happened showed where the Cheonan had run aground .
Damage to the hull indicates grounding , not a torpedo attack .
The propellers are bent in a way that proves they were in “ full engine astern ” while hitting the bottom , again consistent with grounding but inconsistent with a torpedo attack .
Shin was appointed to the investigative commission at the request of the Korean Democratic Party , the main opposition party to the current administration of President Lee Myung - bak .
One could argue that the Democratic Party is motivated to fabricate evidence of a subterfuge on the part of President Lee in order to advance its own political agenda .
Of course , one could argue – and the Democratic Party has – that Lee was motivated to fabricate evidence to cover up a bungled naval operation and to advance his own , more hawkish approach to North Korea .
If these doubts about North Korea ’s guilt are removed , other factors should also be considered in determining our reaction :
The Northern Limit Line ( NLL ) is not an internationally recognized sea boundary .
It was imposed unilaterally by the US and its allies , has never been recognized by North Korea , and puts North Korean shipping at a disadvantage .
The previous South Korean President had reached agreement with the North to reduce naval tension in the area , but President Lee abrogated those agreements immediately on assuming office .
In a 2009 exchange of fire , a North Korean vessel was set ablaze near the NLL .
In a 2002 exchange of fire , a South Korean ship was sunk near the NLL .
In a 1999 naval encounter , two North Korean vessels were sunk near the NLL .
The above reinforces what I said in my earlier post about the Cheonan : “ Whenever I read accounts with clear cut good guys and bad guys , I try to delve more deeply .
Sometimes confrontations are one sided , but most of the time there is another side to the story that does n’t fit with conventional wisdom . ”
It would behoove us to keep that in mind not only here , but whenever war may be involved .
Notes :
1 . I sat on this story for several days because I had been unable to verify that Shin ’s account was n’t just a hoax – as can happen on the Internet .
An article today from a major Korean newspaper , The JoongAng Daily , confirmed his position on the commission and other key elements of his story .
This article adds a new accusation by Shin : photographs show that the alleged North Korean markings on the recovered torpedo parts were written on the rusted surface , not on the original smooth surface , and hence are faked .
Both Shin ’s letter and this article allege that the South Korean Navy is taking legal action to silence him .
The article also alleges Shin is not the first to be silenced in this manner .
2 . If Shin ’s accusations prove true , but not before faked evidence leads to war , it would not be the first time .
The sinking of the USS Maine set off the Spanish - American War even though little evidence pointed to Spain as the culprit .
The second Gulf of Tonkin Incident that gave Johnson the legal justification for escalating the Viet Nam War probably never happened .
And , in 1962 ’s Operation Northwoods , all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had signed off on a plan for a Remember - the - Maine - type - incident to create public support for an invasion of Castro ’s Cuba .
Among other options , the plan suggested that “ We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba . ”

Reefing the mainsail involves lowering the sail part way to reduce its size when the wind increases .
A reefed sail reduces heeling of the boat and makes the boat easier to manage .
It also reduces the risk of capsizing in a gust .
Reefing the mainsail is like partly furling the jib when your boat has a furling jib .
01 of 04 Why and How to Reef the Mainsail Tom Lochhaas
The classic sailor ’s saying is that if you are asking whether it ’s time to reef the main , it ’s already past that time .
This refers to sailors who are having difficulty controlling a wildly heeling boat because the wind has gotten up and is putting a lot of pressure on too much sail area .
A prudent sailor reefs the main when the wind starts to build before things get wild .
When the wind is blowing more than twelve to fifteen knots , depending on the boat , conservative sailors will start out with a reefed sail .
Over twenty knots on many boats and it can become difficult to control the boat for smooth reefing , especially when short - handed .
When you ’re sailing downwind and the boat is not heeling , you may not notice at first that the wind is increasing .
Since you have to turn up into the wind to do the reefing , things may get dicey if you wait too long to reef .
How to Reef
With the common slab reefing system , reefing is fairly simple , though it ’s a skill that requires some practice .
The basic steps are : Turn the boat toward the wind and ease the mainsheet to reduce pressure on the sail .
While slowly easing the main halyard , take in the reefing control line .
This pulls the bottom of the mainsail down toward the boom .
When the sail reaches the desired reef point , secure the halyard and the reefing line , go back on course , and trim the sail .
02 of 04 Slab Reefing System International Marine
This is a simple slab reefing system you can easily install on your boat if you do not have one .
If you already have a reefing system , be sure you understand how it works before you need it in rough conditions .
The illustration shows a single - line system .
Larger boats often have a double - line system , in which a second reefing line is added on the other side of the boom to the second higher set of reef points .
There are also variations in the use of a hook , or reefing horn , at the forward reefing point on the sail ’s luff .
How the Reefing Line Runs From a fixed point on the port side of the boom , the line rises to the aft grommet in the sail , called a reefing cringle .
The line continues down the sail on the starboard side to a turning block mounted on the boom , then forward along the boom to another turning block .
The line rises up to the cringle on the sail ’s luff edge .
In the illustration , the line passes through a block on a reefing horn and then back down .
Alternatively , the line may pass through the cringle and down on the port side in the same manner as it did through the luff cringle .
The advantage of the horn with a block is reduced friction , and the horn can be raised to a higher reef point as well .
The disadvantage is that a crew has to go forward to position the horn .
Finally , the line comes down to a turning block at the base of the mast and back to the cockpit , where it can be taken in for reefing .
03 of 04 A Reefed Mainsail Tom Lochhaas
A reefed sail using a slab reefing system is illustrated in the photo shown .
On this boat , the reefing line runs through the cringle at the sail ’s luff rather than using a horn .
The position of the aft turning block on the boom is a little back from the cringle when the sail is reefed .
This helps keep the sail taut for better trimming when reefed .
The Second Reef In
This mainsail has the second reef in .
If you look carefully at the leach of the sail where it lies against the boom , you can see the cringle of the first lower reef point .
Depending on the conditions , a boat with two reef points and a double - line system allows you to reef the mainsail in stages from the first to the second reefs .
You can also go all at once to the second reef if needed .
This boat has lazy jacks in place that help hold the lowered part of the sail on the boom .
No additional securing may be needed .
Without lazy jacks , the bottom of the sail can blow about and get in the way .

" We are all philosophers here where I am , and we debate among other things the question of where it is that we live .
On that issue I am a liberal .
I live in the interstice yes , but I live in both the city and the city . "
The closing lines of China Miéville 's The City and the City ( 2009 ) could serve as a summary of the present state of what used to be called science fiction .
Fusing elements from works of fantasy and the pulp literature of horror that descends from H P Lovecraft , much of Miéville 's earlier work was set in an alternative world , a highly coloured realm far removed from any in which human beings have ever lived .
The City and the City presents the actual world subtly altered , coexisting and overlapping with another that is not so different - two cities kept apart by secret police between which the central protagonist , a dogged detective , must travel in order to resolve a murder investigation .
It is a mind - opening conception , realised with enormous skill and panache .
Reading this book , you realise how much of human life - your own and that of others - passes by unseen .
Yet this insight comes without any suggestion that the situation can be changed .
We live not in one world , but indefinitely many ; we never know when we might cross from one to another , or what might then occur .
Neither can we escape .
The blurred and treacherous territories of The City and the City go on for ever .
There is nowhere else to go .
Throughout much of the 20th century , writers imagined alternative worlds in order to enlarge the sense of what was possible .
The rich dystopian literature of the first half of the century was not only an expression of disillusionment .
Novels such as We ( completed in 1921 ) , Brave New World ( 1932 ) and Nineteen Eighty - Four ( 1949 ) were meant as warnings , each depicting a type of society that could not realistically exist , in order to alert readers to dangers that were implicit in the way their contemporaries envisioned the future .
Zamyatin , Huxley and Orwell were doing more than comment on the failure to realise modern ideals , whether the ideals were those of Bentham , Pavlov and H G Wells - Huxley 's targets - or those of Lenin and the Soviet Union .
These writers were pointing to a risk of totalitarian control they believed to be inherent in the ideals themselves , but they believed the horrors they envisioned could be avoided .
Science fiction pursues an inquiry into what it means to be human .
The role of science has been to gauge the limits of the species , with new technologies and extra-planetary environments being used as virtual laboratories for an ongoing thought experiment .
If the mainstream novel employs the lens of the commonplace career - birth and education , marriage and divorce , ambition and failure - SF has pursued the inquiry by abducting the human animal and placing it in alien environments .
In a variant of this strategy , humans are given the power to fashion new species that transcend their creators ' limitations .
In his most disquieting fable , The Island of Dr Moreau ( 1896 ) , Wells showed how such power can breed monsters - the pitiful , tormented Beast Folk , whom the narrator finds unpleasantly reminiscent of ordinary humankind .
In similar vein , Olaf Stapledon 's Sirius ( 1944 ) is the story of a scientifically bred dog that surpasses human beings in intelligence ; the animal ends up an outlaw , hating and being hated by humankind .
If there is a lesson here , it is that the growth of knowledge increases the opportunities for savagery .
Yet neither of these writers gave up believing that human beings can shape the future .
Much of their work - Wells 's stream of utopias , Stapledon 's vistas of human beings merging into a collective super - mind to create a Godlike consciousness - is testimony to this faith .
The best - known works of post - apocalyptic fiction are no different .
John Wyndham 's The Day of the Triffids ( 1951 ) is full of terrifying images of human life under siege from ambulatory plants , but concludes with a handful of survivors emerging from their ordeal essentially unchanged to renew civilisation in the comically improbable environs of the Isle of Wight .
Probably written around the same time , but published for the first time this year , Wyndham 's Plan for Chaos is a potpourri of thriller - style adventures , mysterious doubles of the narrator and Nazi flying saucers , but the final message is much the same : keep calm and carry on .
Once order is restored , all will be well .
Even at its most pessimistic , science fiction has always been a humanist genre .
The consoling assumption has been that while civilisation may be flawed and fragile , it can always be rebuilt , perhaps on a better model , if only humans have the will to do it .
The possibility that it is the species that is flawed has rarely been explored .
Stanislaw Lem was an unyielding rationalist , but some of his most powerful works - such as The Invincible ( 1964 ) , a tale of human beings baffled by alien life forms , and The Chain of Chance ( 1975 ) , a spoof detective story in which a former astronaut investigates what appears to be a series of linked murders , only to find they are the product of random chemical reactions - show human reason failing when confronted by a world that can be understood only in inhuman terms , if at all .
Writing in a seemingly different genre , Mervyn Peake imagined a world without meaning and ruled by impenetrable rituals , echoes of which appear in Miéville and the work of Michael Moorcock and M John Harrison .
Not influenced by Peake but like him shaped by life as a child in China , J G Ballard used post - apocalyptic science fiction to show that individual personality is a conventional makeshift that breaks down when put to the text of extreme experience .
Ballard is the pivotal figure here , and not only because of the intensity of his vision .
His abandonment of science fiction for the experimental novel was more than a shift of genre .
Whether they produced utopian dreams or dystopian nightmares , writers of science fiction renewed the bourgeois notion of fiction as a criticism of life .
Whatever their political perspective - left - progressive like Stapledon and Wells , or right - libertarian like Robert Heinlein - they assumed collective action to direct the course of human life was possible .
Ballard challenged this orthodoxy , not by shifting towards pessimism as is commonly suggested , but instead by looking for personal liberation in conditions where co-operation has irretrievably broken down .
The genres that Ballard later took up and subverted - versions of the crime novel and the dark comedies enacted in his last books - show him continuing this search .
If science fiction is no longer a viable form , it is because the humanist assumptions that underpinned it are no longer credible even as fictions .
The hybrid type of writing that has evolved in recent years is symptomatic .
" Slipstream " , " cyberpunk " and " new weird " blend together influences as diverse as Arthur Machen and Mikhail Bulgakov , Charles Williams and William S Burroughs .
What these styles of writing have in common is an absence of politics .
No world - changing project features in any of them .
Miéville is an active member of the Socialist Workers Party , but his brand of fantastic fiction has as much to do with his political hopes as Wells 's scientific fables did with his utopian schemes .
Wells may have fantasised about a world government using science for the masses , but it was the clairvoyant dreams that appear in The Island of Dr Moreau that expressed his true vision .
During much of the 20th century , speculative fiction served an impulse of world transformation .
Fantasy was understood as an exercise in which alternative worlds were imagined in order to create new possibilities of action .
Today fantasy has the role of enabling us to see more clearly the elusive actualities .
The question of action is left open .
We debate what can be done to change the world , but no one expects an answer .
Whether we like it or not , on this issue we are all liberals .

I received a phone call today from PC Magazine .
They were running a story on the new Apple iPhone 4 , specifically the reports ( PC Mag , Gizmodo , Engadget ) that people are experiencing decreased reception on their cell phone when they hold the phone by the metal frame .
That frame has been touted by Apple , in the keynote address by Jobs , as being part of the antenna system .
Here is a brief summary of what I told the reporter who called me , and a little extra .
( The reporter was Mark Hachman , News Editor , PCMag.com/ExtremeTech.com . )
I saw the photo of the frame of the iPhone in the slideshow at the end of Steve Job 's keynote address at the Developers Conference .
There are three gaps in the stainless steel band which are allegedly part of the antenna system .
I have not had a lot of time to analyze their structure , nor do I have one in my hands yet .
So , either it is public relations hokum , or those slots are really part of the antenna structure .
They do appear to be active , based on observations .
In the first generation iPhone ( which I am currently using ) , the antennas were on the back of the phone , near the bottom .
There was a piece of plastic on the bottom covering the antennas , so you knew where they were .
I developed a way to hold the phone which avoided covering this area with my hand , similar to the Gizmodo article linked above .
It is worth stepping back a moment and asking the question , " Why are the antennas placed where my hand is MOST likely to cover it ? "
It 's a fair question .
The FCC puts strict limits on the amount of energy from a handheld device that may be absorbed by the body .
We call this Specific Absorbtion Rate , or SAR .
In the olden days , when I walked ten miles to school in three feet of snow , uphill in both directions , cell phones had pull - up antennas .
This allowed the designer to use a half - wave antenna variant , and put the point of maximum radiation somewhat away from the user 's cranium .
Of course , most people did not think it was necessary and kept the antenna stowed .
Motorola 's flip phone acutally had a second helical antenna that was switched into place when this was the case .
But , more importantly , SAR rules were not yet in effect .
Flip phones became yesterday 's style , and phones were becoming more monolithic .
Some phones , like the early Treo , kept the antenna in the traditional location at the top of the phone , near one edge , but reduced it to a short stub .
Whips became stubs , stubs became bumps , and finally antennas were embedded into the rectangular volume of the phone .
The trouble was SAR ; if you left the antenna at the top , the user was now pressing it into their head , insuring lots of tissue heating .
Enter the bottom - located cellphone antenna .
Just about every cell phone in current production has the antenna located at the bottom .
This insures that the radiating portion of the antenna is furthest from the head .
Apple was not the first to locate the antenna on the bottom , and certainly wo n't be the last .
The problem is that humans have their hands below their ears , so the most natural position for the hand is covering the antenna .
This can't be a good design decision , can it ?
How can we be stuck with this conundrum ?
It 's the FCC 's fault .
You see , when the FCC tests are run , the head is required to be in the vicinity of the phone .
But , the hand is not !!
And the FCC 's tests are not the only tests that must be passed by a candidate product .
AT&T has their own requirements for devices put on their network , and antenna efficiency is one of them .
I know because I have designed quad - band GSM antennas for the AT&T network .
The AT&T test similarly does not require the hand to be on the phone .
So , naturally , the design evolved to meet requirements - and efficient transmission and reception while being held by a human hand are simply not design requirements !
OK , back to the iPhone 4 .
The antenna structure for the cell phone is still down at the bottom ( I wo n't address the WiFi nor GPS antennas in this blog entry ) .
The iPhone 4 has two symmetrical slots in the stainless frame .
If you short these slots , or cover them with your hand , the antenna performance will suffer ( see this video I found on YouTube ) .
There is no way around this , it 's a design compromise that is forced by the requirements of the FCC , AT&T , Apple 's marketing department and Apple 's industrial designers , to name a few .
One of the questions the intrepid reporter from PC Magazine asked me was , " Will putting the phone in a pocket and using a Bluetooth device help ? "
Good question .
The answer is yes , to a point .
The first generation iPhone clearly had a conductive surface below the antenna ( I hesitate to call it a ground plane , because it is too small ) .
So , putting it in your pocket with the screen toward your body and the antennas facing out while using your Bluetooth earpiece will work better than holding the phone with your hand .
In fact , in my car my iPhone sits forward on the dashboard , under the windshield , screen down while I use my Jawbone .
Works great .
( However , if you put your iPhone in your left back pocket , and your earpiece in your right ear , you may have issues .
This is a failing of the Bluetooth system in dealing with severe body losses at 2.4GHz , not the cellphone 's problem . )
The iPhone 4 , however , moved the antenna action from the back of the phone to the sides .
This probably improves the isotropy of the radiation pattern , but only when the phone is suspended magically in air .
Not too helpful .
Putting this iPhone 4 in your pocket will likely couple more energy into your body ( you bag of salt water , you ) than did the first generation model .
Yep , I predict it will be worse .
So , what 's an iPhone lover to do ?
Well , I voted with my dollars .
I ordered my iPhone 4 to replace my Original .
I already know how to do the Vulcan Antenna Grip on the iPhone , and I am wearing out my current model .
And sometimes an antenna that 's not great , but good enough , is good enough .
Refusing to extend unemployment benefits to 1.2 million Americans by adding to the deficit , Senate Republicans by a 41 to 57 margin on Thursday again filibustered the Democratic $ 112 billion jobs bill .
As it turns out , most of the roughly $ 35 billion still needed to pay for it could largely come from a single source : the estate tax .
But thanks to the same GOP obstructionism , Republicans have chosen a one - year windfall for a handful of billionaires over millions of Americans in the throes of financial crisis .
Already scaled back from its original $ 200 billion price tag , the $ 112 billion jobs package includes tax cuts , critically needed aid to states and the extension of unemployment benefits .
On Sunday , Maine Republican Olympia Snowe wrote to Harry Reid suggesting Democrats cut further by offering a stand - alone unemployment insurance bill .
For a Republican Party which had no problem with deficit spending during times of prosperity , helping struggling Americans during a recession is another matter altogether , As the New York Times reported :
The Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , has insisted that the bill not add to the deficit .
Democrats argued that they had found ways to cover the entire cost of the $ 112 billion measure , with the exception of the $ 35.5 billion extension of unemployment benefits , which some Republicans said they could accept ...
" The only thing Republicans have opposed in this debate are job - killing taxes and adding to the national debt , " Mr. McConnell said .
Anticipating that Democrats would reject his proposal , he added , " Their commitment to deficit spending trumps their desire to help the unemployed . "
Of course , as they made crystal clear with the perpetual effort to kill the estate tax , Republicans ' commitment to the rich trumps everything else .
In 2009 , only 1 in 500 American estates paid taxes .
In 2008 , the tax produced $ 25 billion for the U.S. Treasury even in a year when the stock market was battered .
But barring new legislation in Congress , in 2011 the estate tax rate will jump back up to its pre-2001 level of 55 % , starting at $ 2 million per couple .
In December , the House voted 225-200 to maintain 2009 's rate of 45 % beginning at $ 3.5 million per person or $ 7 million per couple .
But as 2009 ended , Jon Kyl led the successful GOP effort to block the bill , ensuring the temporary one - year expiration of the estate tax on January 1st , 2010 :
" It 's a problem that does n't have to exist if they 'll just leave the existing law alone and let the rate go to zero , which is where everyone wants it to be . "
Well , not everyone .
Just , as the numbers show , the very , very rich .
Under the 2009 rate , 99.8 % of estates owe no estate tax at all .
And as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ( CBPP ) showed , over 62 % of estate tax revenue comes from the " extreme wealthy " with fortunes greater than $ 20 million .
" Only three percent of taxes owed " are paid by estates under $ 5 million .
But as the Washington Post explained in April 2009 , those are precisely the pockets Jon Kyl aided and abetted by Democrat Blanche Lincoln wants to line :
The estate tax is scheduled to disappear in 2010 , only to be resurrected the following year at its 2001 level , when it applied only to estates worth over $ 2 million per couple at a rate of 55 percent .
In fact , no one expects it to return to that level -- although letting it do so would be a far more rational response to the current crisis than the Lincoln - Kyl approach .
Rather , President Obama has proposed holding the tax at this year 's level : an exemption of $ 7 million per couple , with a 45 percent rate for amounts beyond that ; this would cost $ 484 billion over 10 years .
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) has endorsed this solution , with indexing for inflation .
This would hardly be punitive .
At that level , 99.76 percent of estates would incur no tax whatsoever .
Those who owe would pay , on average , $ 2.25 million less than they would have paid at the 2001 exemption level .
Why in the world should these folks get more of a tax cut ?
For their part , Lincoln and Kyl want to start at that $ 5 million individual threshold and adopt a lower 35 % tax rate .
In response , Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders this week sponsored a new estate tax overhaul , which at a time of record income inequality and growing fortunes for the wealthy would provide a richer haul for the Treasury .
As the Wall Street Journal summed up Sanders ' plan :
Mr. Sanders and his co-sponsors said , " It 's time for multi-millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share . "
Under the proposal , as in 2009 , the exemption would be $ 3.5 million for an individual , or as much as $ 7 million for a couple , with a tax rate of 45 % .
But estates with taxable assets between $ 10 million and $ 50 million would pay a 50 % rate , and estates valued above $ 50 million would pay 55 % .
A further 10 % surtax would apply to assets above $ 500 million .
The changes would be retroactive to Jan. 1 of this year .
As Kyl suggested on the Senate floor in December , Republicans want to bury the estate tax once and for all .
And to be sure , The Republican scam over the so - called " death tax " is as bogus now as it was when President Bush first perpetrated it nine years ago .
( The House GOP budget , fittingly unveiled by Rep. Paul Ryan on April Fool 's Day 2009 , would eliminate the estate tax altogether .
CBPP estimated that ending the estate tax would cost the United States Treasury $ 1 trillion over 10 years . )
While Nevada Senator John Ensign griped , " It destroys a lot of small businesses and a lot of family farms and ranches in America , " House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - OH ) groused :
" People who are n't wealthy , who may have built up value in land over generations and many family farms find themselves in situations where they 've got to sell the farm in order the pay the taxes . "
As it turns out , of course , not so much .
While CBPP estimated that only 1 in 500 estates is impacted by the current law , the Tax Policy Center quantified last year just how few family farms or small businesses are actually impacted by the estate tax proposals under consideration :
We estimate that under the Obama proposal , 100 family farms and businesses would owe tax .
( We define such estates as those where farm or business assets are valued at under $ 5 million and comprise the majority of estate assets . )
The Lincoln - Kyl proposal would cut the number to 40 .
Even under current law , fewer than 2,700 family farms and businesses would owe tax .
Sadly , right now no one is paying the estate tax .
And in the case of the heirs of Texas billionaire Dan L. Duncan , a man who passed away in March , that literally means a multi-billion dollar pay day at the expense of everyone else .
Especially the 1.2 million increasingly desperate Americans whose unemployment benefits just came to an end , courtesy of the Republican Party .
As Rhode Island Democratic Senator Sheldon
Whitehouse rightly noted on Friday , with their trade - off Senate Republicans made very clear whose side they are on :
" What 's particularly galling about this is that the Republicans cut this lifeline for middle class families , unemployed through no fault of their own , in the same month the first multi-billion estate passed tax free through to the heirs of a tycoon because of the Bush tax cuts , which were n't paid for .
So , if you are concerned about the deficit , it 's very selective concern about the deficit when you are letting billionaires ' estates go through to their heirs untaxed , and cutting off the lifeline for unemployed families . "
Meanwhile , back in Mitch McConnell 's home state of Kentucky , the GOP 's choice of rich kids over the jobless is having dire consequences .
As his home town paper put it , " Congressional impasse could hit Kentuckians hard . "
( This piece also appears at Perrspectives . )
It ’s been a pretty exciting Emmy campaign , with tons of ads , imaginative mailers ( 3D Big Bang , Peter Griffin as Precious ) , fun stunts ( mannequin displays , free ice cream ) .
The TV Academy needs the excitement as it is just starting its negotiating window with the 4 big broadcast networks for the rights to the Primetime Emmy telecast , which are up after this year ’s show .
It wo n’t be easy .
ATAS probably watched with concern how sister New York TV academy NATAS lost NBC as a rotating host for the Daytime Emmy Awards five years ago and then last year could n’t renew its deal with ABC and CBS for the show , which aired on the CW before returning to CBS this year but on a time - buy basis .
And that ’s for awards dominated by broadcast programs ( albeit some of them losing popularity , like soaps . )
The broadcasters ’ main problem with the Primetime Emmy Awards is that they have evolved into a showcase for smaller critically acclaimed cable series and movies few viewers are familiar with , thus the lower ratings for the telecast and its diminished value as a promotional platform for the broadcast nets that pay for it .
I think the cover of this year ’s 240 - page For Your Consideration issue of Emmy Magazine was symbolic .
It has Fox ’s Glee , a broadcast breakout commercial and critical hit , on the cover .
However , it is not a solid cover but a barn door to an ad for HBO ’s much - lauded miniseries The Pacific underneath .
Besides the odd juxtaposition of teenagers worlds apart – in 2000s high school and on 1940s battlefields – it also displays the reality of the Primetime Emmy Awards in the past few years : broadcast shows get the popularity vote , but when it comes down to awards , cable seems to be the underlying favorite .
And that wo n’t sit well on the negotiating table between the TV Academy and the broadcast networks .
In an attempt to revert the trend , last year the TV Academy expanded the top series categories from five to six ( 7 with ties ) with the intention to get more mainstream shows in the mix .
But in the first nomination cycle under the rule change , it did little to stem the ascend of cable , especially on the drama side .
Last year , only 2 out of the 7 best drama series nominees , or 29 % , were broadcast shows .
In comedy , broadcast landed 4 out of the 7 noms , or 57 % .
Compare that to the year before – 3 out of 6 , or 50 % of the best drama series nominees , were broadcast series , as well as 3 out of 5 , or 60 % , of the comedy contenders .
When it comes to drama series stars , the cable dominance was even more striking last year :
Only 2 out of 6 drama actors and actresses nominated were from broadcast shows : Hugh Laurie , Simon Baker , Sally Field and Mariska Hargitay .
In comedy , the ratio was approximately 50/50 between broadcast and cable .
There are signs broadcasters may be turning the tide this year .
The freshman series with the most buzz this past season are on broadcast , Glee and ABC ’s Modern Family .
And when the TCA Awards nominations came out a week ago , the outstanding new program category was completely dominated by broadcast shows for the first time in a long while : Glee , Modern Family , CBS ’
The Good Wife and NBC ’s Parenthood made the cut , along with FX ’s Justified .
For comparison , last year the field featured 3 cable series and only two broadcast shows , Fringe and The Mentalist .
Broadcasters could use an edge in the series fields because they ’ve long conceded the long - form categories to cable .
That has been a thorny issue between the broadcast networks and the TV Academy as the broadcasters view those categories , which take up almost a third of the teleacast , as an hourlong advertisement for cable .
The TV Academy tried to limit the presence of the movie and miniseries categories in live telecast last year by voting to pre-tape most of them but the plan was scrapped after an outcry by the community .
For now , there are no changes planned for this year ’s ceremony either .
So , just like in the Emmy Magazine cover ad , HBO ’s The Pacific will be lurking to outpace broadcast ’s top shows as the most nominated program this year .
And I bet it wo n’t do too shabby at the August Emmy ceremony either .
More than a year has passed since soldiers within the Bangladesh Rifles ( BDR ) , a paramilitary border force , staged a violent mutiny at their headquarters in the capital , Dhaka .
Yet no one seems to really know why it happened .
On the morning of Feb. 25 , 2009 , BDR soldiers mutilated and killed 57 of their officers , and raped and killed many of the officers ’ wives .
Then , just as suddenly as the carnage began , most of the mutineers slipped into the city , disappearing without a trace .
The attack was the most grievous blow dealt to the Army in Bangladesh ’s history .
A full reckoning has only just begun .
Many of the offending rebels are now well known , their crimes well documented .
In mid-July , Bangladesh charged 824 of them with murder and conspiracy , the single largest charge in the country ’s history .
Formerly East Pakistan , Bangladesh became its own country in 1971 , when the two parts of Pakistan split after a war which also involved its neighbor , India .
In the absence of an accepted explanation
But the leaders of the attack remain unidentified , and it is still not known how many people were actually involved , let alone what their motive was .
Some analysts worry that lack of a satisfactory explanation will threaten the already politically volatile nation .
Others say that further instability in Bangladesh would open up the country to terrorist organizations in the region .
The government finally offered a motive in a report this month :
The mutiny , it said , was a spontaneous outburst caused by longstanding grievances over pay .
BDR soldiers make about $ 70 a month , while their officers are accused of living lavish lifestyles .
But many here are unconvinced , and have sought answers of their own .
In drawing - room conversations , blogs , and Facebook postings , many here have gravitated to the possibility that terrorist groups are to blame .
The mutiny , they speculate , was an attempt to derail a secular democracy emerging under the leadership of a liberal , female prime minister , Sheikh Hasina Wajed , who took office just two months before the mutiny erupted .
It is still a theory – and one that , for now , the government seems to be discounting .
But in this land of conspiratorial politics , many informed observers are not willing to completely rule it out .
The land of conspiratorial politics
Bangladeshis have been here before .
In 1975 , the country ’s first prime minister , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , was killed in another military coup .
In 1981 , the Army chief who took power in that coup , Zia ur Rehman , was himself assassinated .
Ever since , explosions and assassinations have rocked this country with great frequency but little explanation .
Bangladeshis are still putting together the pieces .
This mutiny is no different .
Three official investigations – one by the civilian government , one by the Army , and one by the police – had previously reported little about a motive .
“ I ’ve not seen a situation where people take up arms and kill 57 of their officers .
It defies logic .
It is not a spontaneous outburst , ” says retired Maj.
Gen. Shahid Anam , who spent 35 years in the Army and is now a security analyst in Dhaka .
Anam would not put full stock in the theory that extremists are to blame .
But like many here , he would n’t rule it out either .
Last March , an official charged with coordinating the government ’s inquiries , Commerce Minister Farukh Khan , announced that some of the mutineers had links to Jamat’ul Mujahideen Bangladesh ( JMB ) .
Local media investigations corroborated the notion .
But Mr. Khan later retracted his statement .
He did not explain why .
Others are more adamant about such links .
A possible clue ?
As proof , many have pointed to the story of one of the fallen in the mutiny , Col. Gulzar Uddin Ahmed .
In 2006 , Gulzar , as he is widely known , was appointed the first director of intelligence for Bangladesh ’s Rapid Action Battalion ( RAB ) , a special police force .
Within months , he arrested hundreds of operatives of JMB , the country ’s most lethal terrorist organization .
He then arrested six of the group ’s leaders .
Because of Gulzar ’s police work , all six men were all put to death in 2007 .
Gulzar became a national hero .
Then , in early 2009 , he was transferred to a position of command within the BDR .
He had planned to take his family on a vacation .
But first he went to attend the BDR ’s annual meeting in Dhaka .
That was Feb. 25 , the day of infamous bloodshed .
Gulzar ’s body was found 10 days after the mutiny .
He had been tortured before being killed – a sign , many believe , of retribution .
“ He was the most brilliant officer in the police department , who was totally committed to uproot Islamic militancy , ” says Sharier Kabir , an outspoken activist against Islamic extremism in Bangladesh .
“ That ’s why he has been killed so brutally . ”
Gulzar ’s status as a martyr in the fight against terrorism has risen .
His Facebook page , created posthumously , has more than 22,000 fans .
JMB ’s targeting of Gulzar may be an apocryphal tale .
But there are , analysts say , grounds for extremist groups to target the new prime minister .
In her return to power , Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised to reinstate Bangladesh ’s 1972 Constitution , which would remove Islam as the state religion and posit secularism as the country ’s foundation .
She swore she would try those Bangladeshis who , in siding with Pakistan during Bangladesh ’s war of liberation in 1971 , had killed fellow Bangladeshis in the name of ensuring a more puritan form of Islam .
And she had promised to destroy international terrorist networks operating in her country .
In this quest , Hasina knew she had an ally in the BDR force .
In 2008 , the BDR ’s director general , Shakil Ahmed , publicly vowed to crush militancy in Bangladesh .
He singled out both international operators like Harkut - ul - Jihad ( HUJI ) , a terrorist group founded in Pakistan , and domestic groups like JMB .
Two months after being elected , Hasina stood beside Mr. Ahmed to address soldiers at the BDR ’s headquarters on Feb. 24 , 2009 – the day before the mutiny .
What could the goal of the mutiny have been ?
If the goal of the mutiny was simply for BDR soldiers to secure better pay , that has not yet happened .
The government is still mulling over such reforms .
In the meantime , the government has passed the Border Guard Bangladesh Act 2010 , which makes mutiny an offense subject to capital punishment .
And if it was to deter Hasina from taking on radical groups , the opposite appears true .
Since her election , RAB and BDR have launched a sweeping crackdown on local and international terrorist organizations , making some of their most sensational arrests since Gulzar’s .
In the churn of news and analysis , Bangladeshis continue to grasp at all possibilities .
But whatever the mutiny 's goals , analysts say , it appears not to have gotten far .
“ It ’s a complex scenario .
There has to be more serious research on it , ” says Imtiaz Ahmed , a professor of international relations at Dhaka University and a prominent political analyst here .
He added , with a laugh , “ Maybe in 20 or 30 years we ’ll know . ”

DETROIT -- Detroit Red Wings general manager Ken Holland is happy with the talented core of forwards who comprise his top two lines .
And he 'll be delighted with his top four defensemen if Nicklas Lidstrom returns .
Holland 's focus is shoring up the bottom portion of the roster .
And it wo n't take many moves to do that .
His main goal is acquiring a hard - nosed , physical -- but relatively cheap -- fourth - line grinder in the mold of Dallas Drake , who filled that role well during their Stanley Cup run in 2008 .
" There 's three or four big - name guys , we 're not in that market , '' Holland said .
" We 're looking for support guys .
We 'd like to get a little grittier on the fourth line , get somebody who 's a pain to play against , who 'll get in on the forecheck .
Someone we can put in there in the playoffs and he's got enough skill and he 's a factor because of his physical play .
" But everybody is looking for those guys . ''
If he can't find such a player July 1 , the start of free agency , he will wait until the last two weeks of August to see who is still available .
Holland said , as of now , he plans to make qualifying offers to all his restricted free agents , thereby retaining their rights .
The list includes forwards Darren Helm , Justin Abdelkader , Patrick Eaves , Drew Miller and Mattias Ritola .
That constitutes the bulk of their third and fourth lines .
" Some of the holes we 're plugging are from within , '' Holland said .
" Part of the salary cap world is having players who can push from the bottom .
We got to find players like Eaves and Miller .
" I see us having a similar team , but with four , five changes that will make us a deeper team . ''
Those changes include the additions of forwards Jiri Hudler , Ritola and the gritty , fourth - line player they are seeking , as well as young defenseman Jakub Kindl .
Holland said the team is set for skill up front with Pavel Datsyuk , Henrik Zetterberg , Johan Franzen , Valtteri Filppula , Dan Cleary and Hudler .
" Our core up front is in the prime of their careers and probably will be for a couple of more years , '' Holland said .
Among their unrestricted free agents , net - front specialist and lifelong Red Wing Tomas Holmstrom is certain to return .
Holland had some discussions with Holmstrom 's agent before the playoffs and will resume talks next week .
Holland is interested in re-singing Todd Bertuzzi , who has indicated a desire to stay .
The club might not have the roster space to retain longtime Red Wing Kirk Maltby .
Jason Williams , the odd - man out in the playoffs , wo n't return .
On defense , Holland said he is optimistic that Lidstrom will return and the team will maintain its strong top four ( with Brian Rafalski , Niklas Kronwall and Brad Stuart ) .
" We need Jonathan Ericsson to take a step forward , '' Holland said .
" We 've got to make a decision on a couple of our defensive spots .
Not all will be back . ''
Kindl has the inside track on the sixth spot .
Restricted free agent Derek Meech likely will be re-signed but might be moved if the club does n't have a spot for him .
The team must decide whether to re-sign Andreas Lilja .
Unrestricted free agent Brett Lebda surely wo n't be back .
Holland sees no need to make major alterations to a team that went 17 - 2 - 3 in its last 22 games when it was healthy and the pressure was on to make the playoffs .
" Every game was a playoff game and every team we played needed to win , '' Holland said .
" We were playing under pressure .
If we did n't produce , we were n't going to make the playoffs .
What better way to evaluate your team ? ''
Holland thinks the Red Wings can compete with any team in the Central Division and said if everything goes right , " we 've got as much a chance to win the West as anybody else . ''
His goal is to make the playoffs for the 20th consecutive season , extending the longest current streak in pro sports .
That might seem like a modest objective , but Holland said making the postseason no longer is a given in this day of parity .
" Some people think it 's easy to make the playoffs , '' Holland said .
" Since the lockout , only three teams have made the playoffs every year -- San Jose , New Jersey and Detroit .
We 're the only team to make it past the first round the last four years .
" If you qualify for the playoffs , you got a chance to win the Stanley Cup . ''
Here are the 2009 - 10 grades for the Red Wings .
The grades include players who appeared in Detroit most of the season or at least in one playoff game .
Grades are for the regular season and playoffs .

As many of you may know or even seen via the live feed , the Teva Mountain Games Bouldering Worldcup Finals took place this weekend at Vail , CO .
Something noted by many of the live feed spectators is that it was somewhat basic in comparison to the setup used in other recent events .
Those who watched the live feed of the Battle in the Bubble for example would know of the intense camera setup present in that competition .
Live feed is definitely something that is going to become more advanced and prevalent at future comps .
Ladies first , the top five finishing women were all neck and neck throughout the competition with the only differences being the number of attempts .
The women 's first two problems were fairly straight forward , but the fourth problem was definitely more exciting with it giving way to some thrilling climbing , with the final move of the fourth problem creating trouble for some of the climbers .
Chloé Graftiaux managed to get the edge over Anna Stohr as she landed herself in first place , but not by a great distance .
Women 's Results Chloé Graftiaux ( BEL ) Anna Stohr ( AUT ) Juliane Wurm ( GER ) Alex Puccio ( USA ) Alex Johnson ( USA ) Maud Ansade ( FRA )
For the men's problems it was a trickier situation revolving around a dyno which was met with mixed feelings , with both problem three and four being noticeably difficult , with competitors really struggling with the leap on the third problem as well as the swing on the fourth .
Woods was the only person to complete more than 1 of the men's problems , and managed to take the United States to the top of the podium .
Using the services of a magician for your wedding is usually a daunting endeavor due to the fact that is , after all , 1 with the major days of your existence and finding every thing correct is often a tad overpowering wedding magician .
Also , with yourselves currently being the middle of focus , your minds will likely not normally be within the typical welfare within your guests , primarily in the course of the shots exactly where you may probably be occupied to get a couple of hours .
This is where a magician can phase in to include that added dimension towards your friends wedding ceremony practical experience and give you comfort figuring out that they ’re in excellent fingers .
But how will you go about discovering the proper magician for the special occasion ?
The final factor you desire is usually a scruffy beginner without having persona showing a handful of tricks your grandad after taught you !
I ’ve compiled five things you ’ll want to consider when considering choosing a magician for your major working day .
Pursuing each of these factors you are able to be certain of acquiring the entertainer your guests should have !
one ) Various types of magician
You must first decide the sort of magician you desire and after you want him / her to complete .
The next is actually a record of points to contemplate .
Children / adults
Determine if you need just the kids entertained or adults or possibly a mix of both .
Most marriage ceremony magicians do the job mainly on entertaining your adult friends but would nevertheless be satisfied to indicate the children a little anything .
Magic / Mind Reading
Choose if you prefer just visible magic tips ( cards / coins / ropes ) or intellect reading through .
Most magicians do some both of those however a thoughts reader is an extremely specialist location which can be getting pretty preferred .
So assume , do you want Derren Brown ( head reader ) or David Blaine ( magician ) ?
Mingling / close up
A kind of close - up magic performed although persons are standing in teams , whereby the magician mingles with the crowd performing to modest teams at a time .
This functions very well for that drinks reception and night enjoyment .
Desk hopping
A sort of close - up magic done whilst persons are sitting at tables throughout the marriage ceremony breakfast , whereby the magician entertains a table in a time , between programs .
Cabaret
A magician who performs on stage to an viewers .
This could do the job very well in the course of the evening reception as being a bit of light aid for everybody .
2 ) Cost
It can be possible you have a rigid funds for your wedding ceremony therefore the cost for hiring a magician is obviously a critical variable .
It could be silly , however , to easily go along with the most affordable magician you could find .
There is no expert regulatory physique for magicians so primarily any one can discover a few methods and contact on their own a marriage magician .
In order for you good quality , count on to pay for within the area of £ 300 – £ 500 for 2 hours of close - up magic .
A deposit in the range of 20 % up front with all the balance about the day is standard .
three ) Excellent
You cannot gauge a magician ’s high quality of enjoyment basically via the price he sets .
Similarly
Will not choose a magician by how flashy his / her site is .
Any person will pay an online designer sufficient dollars to create a amazing searching internet site , but that does not imply the magician is a great entertainer .
Also , do n’t be drawn in by lines this kind of as “ The UK ’s best magician … ” , as this is possible to obtain been published via the magician by themselves .
The following details ought to be critically taken into consideration when searching in excess of a website .
Testimonials
Recommendations are vitally significant so have a extensive read of what past purchasers have explained .
Remember , no magician will ever set just about anything but good remarks on his / her web site so pay back specific interest on the way in which a testimonial has become published , ie if many of the responses say “ He was great ” , or “ Brilliant magic ” then be cautious .
On the other hand , much more detailed recommendations which genuinely display the wedding ceremony few have been totally blown away and had their day given that out of the ordinary touch is exactly what you are interested in .
Also , do n’t be shy to question for a phone number of any one around the testimonials web site if you want to be 100 % these are legitimate .
A magician really should be capable to deliver this .
Video / Radio / Pictures
There is n’t any substitute for basically looking at or hearing the magician in action entertaining .
Marketing video or radio clips can be a fantastic way to make this happen .
If a magician has none of these on his / her web page it is best to doubt how long they have got really been undertaking as this should be a single of the optimum priorities for a magician when owning an internet site .
Excellent high quality images can also be a useful device to get a magician to market their provider .
Be certain all pictures plainly display the folks having enjoyment , also that the magician seems to be smartly dressed , you surely never want them turning up in David Blaine design costume have on of jeans as well as a t - shirt – believe me , it transpires .
4 ) Are living effectiveness
There is not any explanation in the least why you cannot request the magician to present a reside demonstration .
It ’s not often necessary but if you really really feel you ought to see the magic happen in front of your own eyes and create a judgment then ask !
If the magician life in 30 miles he should be properly ready to occur to you .
More distances may possibly call for you meet up with halfway within a general public property .
You may also check with about any wedding ceremony fayres they can be exhibiting at and pop together to those people alternatively .
5 ) Email contact / Phone
Lots of individuals shrink back from calling these days along with the simplicity of electronic mail .
While emailing your first request is ok to receive a quote , Normally call ahead of reserving .
Anyone has very first impressions when assembly of conversing with anyone to the initial time .
Does he audio likable and friendly ?
You ’ll instinctively know if he is the correct guy for that job , all other items considered .
WASHINGTON - BP 's estimate that only 5,000
barrels of oil are leaking daily from a well in the Gulf of Mexico ,
which the Obama administration has n't disputed , could save the company
millions of dollars in damages when the financial impact of the spill is
resolved in court , legal experts say .
A month after a surge of gas from the undersea
well engulfed the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig in flames and
triggered the massive leak that now threatens sea life , fisheries and
tourist centers in five Gulf coast states , neither BP nor the federal
government has tried to measure at the source the amount of crude
pouring into the water .
BP and the Obama administration have said
they do n't want to take the measurements for fear of interfering with
efforts to stop the leaks .
That decision , however , runs counter to BP 's own regional plan
for dealing with offshore leaks .
" In the event of a significant release
of oil , " the 583 - page plan says on Page 2 , " an accurate estimation of
the spill 's total volume . . . is essential in providing preliminary
data to plan and initiate cleanup operations . "
Legal experts said
that not having a credible official estimate of the leak 's size
provides another benefit for BP :
The amount of oil spilled is certain to
be key evidence in the court battles that are likely to result from the
disaster .
The size of the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska , for example ,
was a significant factor that the jury considered when it assessed
damages against Exxon .
" If they put off measuring , then it's
going to be a battle of dueling experts after the fact trying to
extrapolate how much spilled after it has all sunk or has been carried
away , " said Lloyd Benton Miller , one of the lead plaintiffs ' lawyers in
the Exxon Valdez spill litigation .
" The ability to measure how much oil
was released will be impossible . "
" It 's always a bottom - line
issue , " said Marilyn Heiman , a former Clinton administration Interior
Department official who now heads the Arctic Program for the Pew
Environment Group .
" Any company would n't have an interest in having this
kind of measurement if they can help it . "
The size of the spill
has become a high stakes political controversy that 's put the Obama
administration and the oil company on the defensive .
In congressional
testimony Wednesday , an engineering professor from Purdue University in
West Lafayette , Ind. , said that based on videos released Tuesday he
estimated that the well was spewing at 95,000 barrels , or 4 million
gallons , of oil a day into the gulf .
The Obama administration
Thursday demanded that BP publicly release all information related to
the disaster .
BP officials had pledged in congressional
testimony to keep the public and government officials informed , Homeland
Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator Lisa Jackson said in a letter to BP chief executive
officer Tony Hayward .
" Those efforts , to date , have fallen short
in both their scope and effectiveness , " they wrote .
That letter
came after members of Congress made similar demands of BP , leading to
the release Tuesday of the new videos .
One showed oil still billowing
from one underwater pipe , despite an insertion tube BP now says is
capturing 5,000 barrels of crude a day _ its entire initial estimate of
the spill .
The other showed a previously unseen leak spewing clouds of
crude from just above the well 's dysfunctional blowout preventer .
The EPA on Thursday ordered BP to switch to a less toxic version of the
chemical mix it 's using to disperse the oil .
The EPA also for the first
time posted on its website BP 's test data of the dispersant 's use in
deep water .
Those orders came days after McClatchy reported doubts about
the dispersant 's safety and members of Congress made a similar demand .
Scientists and environmentalists praised the government for demanding
that more information be made public .
" This is exactly the role
the government needs to be playing - they need to be overseeing BP's
actions to assure that health and natural resources are protected , as
much as possible , and that information is available to the public , " said
Gina Solomon , a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense
Council .
This video , released
Tuesday , shows billowing clouds of oil despite the presence of the
insertion tube , visible to the right of the broken pipe
John Curry , a BP spokesman , said he had n't seen the letter from
Napolitano and Jackson and could n't comment specifically , but added :
" We 're just trying to provide the information people are asking for at
the same time we are trying to position a lot more resources to stop the
flow of oil . "
Curry offered no new estimate of how much oil is
flowing from the leaks , but acknowledged that capturing 5,000 barrels of
oil a day in the insertion tube is evidence that the official
5,000 - barrel per day estimate is low .
" We 've said at best it 's a
highly imprecise estimate , " Curry said .
Curry said he knew of no
efforts by BP to use its robotic equipment on the sea floor to measure
the flow , but said that the efforts were entirely focused on containing
the spill .
BP agreed Thursday to allow the posting of a live feed
of the video of the oil spill , which lawmakers said would help
scientists arrive at independent estimates of the spill .
" I'm
sitting here looking at it right now , and it ain't 5,000 barrels a day ,
I 'll guarantee it , " said Bob Cavnar , a Houston engineer and blogger
who 's been involved in oil and gas exploration and production .
" In Houston , there 's about 125,000 , 150,000 engineers , " he said .
" And
all the engineers can calculate what the flow is . "
The feed
eventually was overwhelmed by the number of people trying to view it and
was removed from congressional websites .
This video , released
Tuesday , provided the first public view of a second leak near the well 's
dysfunctional blowout preventer .
Calling the disaster
site a " crime scene , " Larry Schweiger , the president of the National
Wildlife Federation , accused BP of a cover-up .
" BP can not be
left in charge of assessing the damage or controlling the data from
their spill , " Schweiger said .
" The public deserves sound science , not
sound bites from BP's CEO . "
White House press secretary Robert
Gibbs denied that the government was trying to cover up the size of the
spill .
" The best and brightest minds in all of this government ,
and in the scientific community and in the world of commerce are focused
on this problem .
Everything that can be done is being done , " he said .
Sens. Bill Nelson of Florida and Barbara Boxer of California , both
Democrats , called on the Justice Department to investigate BP 's drilling
permits to determine whether the company had misled the government by
claiming it had the technology needed to handle a big spill .
Since the spill , BP has announced five different approaches to sealing
the leak .
Three of those have been at least partially used : a 78 - ton
containment dome that failed ; a small " top hat " dome that was placed on
the seafloor May 11 but has n't been used , and the insertion tube now
siphoning a fraction of the spill .
Of the two others , the " junk shot , "
which would fire shredded tires and debris into the damaged blowout
preventer , is rarely mentioned , and the " top kill , " which would force
mud into the blowout preventer , may be tried this weekend .
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration head Jane Lubchenco told
reporters on Thursday that a team of government scientists was
assembled this week , a month after the spill began , to try to come up
with a better estimate of the leak 's volume .
She said the
5,000 - barrel estimate was based on visual observations on the surface .
" As the spill increased in size and began to break up it was no longer
possible to use that effort , which is why we have shifted to using
multiple paths to try to get at better estimates , " she said .
Scientists have the instruments and the knowledge needed to figure out
the flow rate , and several have complained publicly that they were
turned down when they offered to help , as McClatchy reported Tuesday .
" The decision was made that the first priority had to be to stop the
flow , " Lubchenco said .
Robotic vehicles were being used for that purpose
and there was limited space for more of them to operate there at the
same time , she said .

Movie fans are being given the chance to watch their choice of blockbusters at home for nothing , as a host of Hollywood studios team up with UK - based technology firm Blinkbox to run a week - long free streaming service in an effort to lure internet users away from pirated material .
As part of the " Full Stream Ahead " campaign , which is backed by the UK Film Council and BFI , and launches tomorrow , anyone accessing the Blinkbox website from fullstreamahead .
co.uk will be offered £ 20 credit to spend on films from studios including Paramount , Sony Pictures , Universal , 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros .
Titles include Avatar , Sherlock Holmes and Up in the Air .
Users will be able to stream their choices over the internet and watch them on their computer or – if they have the right cables – on their television .
Music streaming services such as Spotify have proved a hit , helping to arrest some of the piracy that has affected that industry .
The film studios are hoping video streaming services will do a similar job , attracting people who may otherwise succumb to unlawful filesharing networks .
Many British consumers already use catch - up TV streaming services such as the BBC iPlayer , 4OD and the ITV Player .
" We are doing it much earlier , " says Michael Comish , chief executive and co-founder of Blinkbox .
" By the time the music industry enabled strong and good - quality legal [ streaming ] services it was arguably too late .
We are in the early days of digital retail for movies , and our ambition is to make people aware of the benefits of streaming services before it is too late . "
Research by Global Web Index last year showed that web users were turning to unlawful filesharing sites because the content they wanted was not easily available elsewhere .
The survey showed that 45 % of filesharers said they would consume films legally if the technology allowed them .
Previously unpublished findings by Trendstream , the UK - based consultancy , show that 28 % of those using peer - to - peer filesharing to view unauthorised content do so because it offers instant access .
The movie industry hopes that streaming services , which offer similar access , may bring these people back into the fold .
Blinkbox , backed by venture capital firms Eden Ventures , Nordic Venture Partners and Arts Alliance , already has more than 1.2 million users a month , who between them watch about 5 m streams per month .
While it does not stream content in high - definition , Comish , the former head of new media at Channel 4 , said picture quality was good on the average residential broadband line - which runs at between 3 Mb and 4Mb per second - while anyone with a slower connection can reduce the file size that they are viewing in order to get a reliable service .
" If millions of people take up this offer , yes , it is going to cost us a lot of money , " he said .
" But the cost of not doing it is far larger .
If we do not make people aware that there is good - quality streaming video available , then we will hit a tipping point in online piracy . "

Neal said that Paul 's extreme beliefs have made Kentucky " a laughing stock . "
Rand Paul made the comments during an MSNBC interview .
In it , he criticized the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
Paul said in an MSNBC interview that he did " not like the idea " of telling private business what it should or should not do , including , for example , forcing restaurants to serve minorities .
business owners do n't want to
Later , Paul stated that criticisms that the Obama Administration made of oil giant BP over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill were " un-American . "
This is despite the fact that many Americans are upset over bailouts made to large corporations by both the Bush and Obama administrations , in addition to being upset with BP .
The Chairman of the Republican National Committee , Michael Steele , said the following on Fox News Sunday after Paul 's remarks , " I believe his philosophy is misplaced in these times .
I do n't think it 's where the country is right now . "
Paul received criticism from both sides of the aisle after his statement regarding the Civil Rights Act .
For some , the remark smacked of blatant racism .
For others , it was simply a reflection of Paul 's Libertarian leaning , but made without filtering for the reality of the times .

Are you disgusted with the Catholic Church over their opposition to reproductive rights and all the harm it has caused ?
Is your head still reeling over the latest in what seems like a never - ending series of scandals involving their priests raping children while Church hierarchy covers it up and various spokesmen find creative ways to blame the victims ?
Yeah , me too .
In fact , I 'm not sure " sick " even begins to describe how I feel about it .
It is difficult to comprehend why anyone would want to remain a member of the Catholic Church these days .
If you were ever baptized in the Church , they still count you as a member .
It does not matter that you 've been an atheist for years .
As far as the Catholic Church is concerned , you are still one of them .
It also does not matter whether you were so young at the time you were baptized that you had no idea what was happening .
They 'll keep counting you until you make your " defection " official .
The good news is that it is possible to leave the Catholic Church .
They do not make it easy , but it can be done .
The process involves the following steps :
Complete a declaration of defection .
Send it to your local diocese .
Realize that they may request a meeting to discuss your decision .
You do n't have to comply , but you do need to respond to the request or they may use this as an excuse not to process your request .
Maybe if enough people leave the Church , they will be persuaded to make some necessary changes .
Then again , maybe they 'll just continue to find new victims in Africa and South America .
Perhaps leaving the Catholic Church is one of those things one should do for oneself and one 's own piece - of - mind rather than primarily as an attempt to send a message to an organization that does not seem to be interested in listening .
If nothing else , it would be one way to make sure that one is not complicit in their crimes .
Here is some additional information about how to quit the Catholic Church that seems geared toward atheists and other non-religious types .
If you come across anything else that would be useful , let me know and I 'll be happy to add it .
An early version of this post appeared at Atheist Revolution in 2010 .
It was updated in 2018 and 2020 to fix broken links , improve clarity , and provide additional information for those interested in cutting their ties to this corrupt organization .
The World Cup legend has billed Brazil and Spain to triumph in South Africa ....
As reported by the Daily Mirror , Brazilian footballing legend Pele has expressed his belief that Brazil and Spain are the favourites to win the World Cup , although Pele also spoke of his hope for an African finalist .
" Spain and Brazil have the best teams , but it is difficult to point to a specific team as a favourite , " said the former No. 10 .
" I would love to see Brazil playing one of the African teams in the final .
I have good knowledge of Africa and have no doubts that it will be a great World Cup this summer .
It will be a good tournament , well organised and very exciting .
" As for his home country 's chances , Pele admitted that Brazil will have to work hard .
" Brazil will have to be at their best to win the World Cup this summer .
It will be hard , but they can do it . "
Among others ,
Pele also picked England as a potential candidate , citing Fabio Capello 's ability as a great coach and labelling the England squad as one with " good players , Wayne Rooney being the most dangerous " .

While it 's not usually a good idea to compare your sex life to what sex statistics say about others , it can be interesting to look at how often other couples have sex .
For example , sometimes people believe they 're having less sex than their peers , but scientific study results might prove them wrong .
Other stats can offer insight on married couples ' sexual satisfaction and even relationship satisfaction and how it 's related to sex .
How Often Do Married Couples Have Sex ?
Americans in their 20s ( whether partnered or not ) have sex about 80 times a year , or more than once per week , says a 2017 study .﻿﻿
While that number declines with age , it turns out that there is such a thing as too much sex .
While the frequency of sex is associated with happiness , partnered couples who have sex more than once a week are no happier than those having sex weekly , according to an analysis of three research studies of over 30,000 people .﻿﻿
Having sex once a week might be the ideal , according to science .
But the real ideal is what works for you and your partner .
If you 're happy with the frequency of sex in your marriage , then you 're having the right amount of sex for you .
If you 're not , you can work on the problem through better communication , more experimentation in the bedroom , and / or couples or sex therapy .
More research looking at this sex frequency - happiness connection noted that pushing frequency past once a week might " lead to a decline in wanting for , and enjoyment of , sex . " ﻿﻿
In other words , quality counts as much as quantity .
What 's more , one study of heterosexual couples published in 2017 linked husbands ' " positive behaviors " toward their wives with the frequency of sex .﻿﻿
So if you want more in bed , you might try being more generous and giving outside of the bedroom .
Married Sex and Satisfaction
A survey conducted by Durex ( the condom maker ) in 2013 looked at some of the ways sex can promote connection and satisfaction in couples .
Some results included :
96 % of respondents said being emotionally connected results in the best sex
92 % are turned on by their partner showing vulnerability
90 % believe it is possible for sex to get better after years of being together
61 % of women and 80 % of men say " the sex is pretty good . "
( Another 2013 survey , from iVillage , got the same result . )
Satisfaction and interpersonal warmth matter more in a marriage than the frequency of intercourse , according to sex researchers .
And there is a strong connection between sex , well - being , affection , and positive affect ( or mood ) , according to research published in 2017 .﻿﻿
Mutual respect is also important ; when partners feel respected , they also report being sexually satisfied .
In terms of how their sex life could be improved , people say they 're looking for more love and romance ; more quality time alone with their partner ; more fun ; and less stress .
Married Sex and Communication
Couples also say they could have better communication with their partner .
The answer to " what should we do to make our sex life better / have sex more often / make sex more satisfying " often begins with talking .
One study , published in 2019 , tied better sexual communication with greater sexual satisfaction — and even fewer faked orgasms .﻿﻿
" Women who continued to fake orgasms were more likely to indicate embarrassment talking about sex with their partner in explicit ways , " the study 's authors said .
" More than half of women reported they had wanted to communicate with a partner regarding sex but decided not to ; the most common reasons were not wanting to hurt a partner ’s feelings , not feeling comfortable going into detail , and embarrassment , " the study continued .
A Word From Verywell
Though interesting , what statistics say about other peoples ' sex lives is usually not relevant to your own .
What matters is how you and partner feel about your relationship and sex life — and how well you can discuss it with each other .
Communication is key .
Depending on the underlying issues and emotions you and your partner are experiencing , you might benefit from working with a personal therapist , a couple 's counselor , or a sex therapist .

Chinese workers making energy - saving fluorescent lightbulbs for Western consumers have been sickened by the hundreds due to mercury poisoning .
While poor factory conditions in China shoulder most of the blame , the news does raise serious questions about just how “ green ” the mercury - rich fluorescent lightbulbs actually are .
Without a doubt , fluorescent lightbulbs have the potential to significantly reduce worldwide carbon emissions if they continue to be put into wide use .
In England , for instance , the atmosphere will be saved an estimated 5 m tons of carbon dioxide a year due to the bulbs alone .
When it comes to the bigger issues , such as combating global climate change and reducing energy consumption , energy - efficient fluorescents are clearly the green alternative to traditional incandescents .
And of course , consumers save more on their electricity bill too , a crucial advantage in this global recession as annual energy costs go up over the hot summer months .
In fact , as air conditioners continuously whir throughout the summer and the energy grid strains to meet the demand in the U.S. , it ’s difficult to imagine how it could be done without more efficient bulbs and appliances .
But while the environmental and economic advantages of using fluorescent bulbs are paramount , there are also some costs .
Fluorescent bulbs work by using electricity to excite mercury vapor , and mercury can be a dangerous , toxic pollutant , perhaps most readily vilified due to its prevalence in the ocean food chain .
Thus , proper disposal and care of fluorescent lightbulbs need to come hand in hand with their wide use , otherwise they bring the risk of increased mercury contamination in the environment .
The problem is confounded in the manufacturing process if that mercury is not safely contained and controlled .
And that ’s precisely the concern in China , where most of the world ’s fluorescent lightbulbs are produced , and where factory conditions are poorly regulated and environmentally porous .
In fact , in many cases the factory conditions are downright deplorable , and aside from the long term environmental damage that comes from mercury contamination , hundreds of Chinese workers are exposed to mercury poisoning on a daily basis .
These problems have recently escalated due to a rapid increase in foreign demand , particularly because of the European Union ’s directive making fluorescent bulbs compulsory by 2012 .
The standards for health and safety in the Chinese factories can vary from high tech operations to sweatshops .
Some tests have demonstrated concentrations of mercury in factory workers that were 150 times the accepted standard , and many are frequently hospitalized .
In one Chinese factory , 121 out of 123 employees had excessive mercury levels .
While fluorescent light bulbs are a near necessity moving into the future in combating climate change and saving on energy consumption , conscious consumers need to be more aware of where and how their bulbs are produced .
Furthermore , people need to be better educated about proper handling and disposal of fluorescent bulbs .
Ironically , in China people have actually been aware of mercury ’s toxic properties for over 2,000 years .
Legend has it that China ’s first emperor , Qin , died after swallowing a pill laced with jade and mercury thinking it would bring him eternal life .
But there ’s no imaginable reason , in our modern world , as to why Chinese workers should take on that symbolic burden for the sake of the West in the global battle against climate change .

„ Der Zungenschlag , den wir auch in Kommentaren hören , ist blanker Populismus “ , donnert der SPD - Abgeordnete Heiner Bartling .
Und die Abgeordneten von CDU , FDP und SPD schlagen zum Beifall fast zornig auf ihre Pulte .
Es geht um die Erhöhung der eigenen Bezüge – um 405 Euro auf 6000 Euro monatlich sollen sie zum 1 .
Januar kommenden Jahres angehoben werden .
Bartling wie auch sein CDU - Gegenüber Björn Thümler finden die öffentliche Kritik daran völlig unangebracht , schließlich unterschreite man sogar noch Empfehlungen einer unabhängigen Kommission .
Die Regierungskoalition sowie die SPD haben die Reihen fest geschlossen , um nach etlichen Nullrunden diesmal die Diätenerhöhung durchzupeitschen .
Einige , die in der CDU den Zeitpunkt für nicht richtig halten , fehlen bei der namentlichen Abstimmung über die kräftige Gehaltsaufbesserung , die die Grünen und die Linken kritisieren .
So bleibt der hannoversche CDU - Abgeordnete Max Matthiesen der Abstimmung ebenso fern wie seine Hamelner Parteikollegin Ursula Körtner .
Auch Angelika
Jahns von der CDU fehlt wie die FDP - Abgeordneten Gero Hocker und Hans - Werner Schwarz .
In der FDP , so heißt es , habe es eine ziemlich kontroverse Diskussion gegeben , bevor sich die Fraktion zur Zustimmung entschloss .
Anzeige
„ Was ist hier eigentlich los ? “ , fragt die Grüne Ursula Helmhold die Mehrheit : „ In Berlin wird ein Sparpaket zulasten der Schwachen geschnürt , der Ministerpräsident ist auf der Flucht nach Berlin , und der Landtag hat nichts Besseres zu tun , als in einem Doppelbeschluss die Diäten zu erhöhen . “
Selbstbewusstsein könne man aber weder selbst beschließen noch sich bezahlen lassen .
An das „ Selbstwertgefühl “ , das man sich nicht nehmen lassen sollte , hatte zuvor der CDU - Abgeordnete Thümler appelliert .
„ Wir sind ein Vollzeitparlament , das Mandat steht im Mittelpunkt unserer Arbeit . “
Deshalb sollte die Abgeordnetentätigkeit auch angemessen entlohnt werden .
Die Beschlüsse hätten mit Transparenz und Bescheidenheit nichts zu tun , meint demgegenüber der Linke Manfred Sohn : „ Bei CDU und FDP ist pränatal doch das Dollar - Zeichen schon im Auge “ , sagt der Linke – und erntet empörte Zwischenrufe .
Viele Abgeordnete schauen nach oben zur Pressetribüne , von der sie an diesem selbst festgesetzten Zahltag auch nichts Gutes erwarten .
Sie fühlen sich unverstanden .
Vom Argument , die Diätenerhöhung passe nicht zur aktuellen Kassenlage des Landes , hält der SPD - Abgeordnete Bartling wenig .
In der gesamten Geschichte des Landes Niedersachsen , sagt er , „ haben wir nicht einen Haushalt beschlossen , mit dem nicht neue Schulden verbunden waren “ .
Niemand geht an diesem
Tag auf diesen Satz ein , der selbst eine Art Offenbarungseid darstellt .
Die namentliche Abstimmung wird durchgezogen : 122 Jas , 21 Neins .
Grüne und Linke werden die Diätenerhöhung , die sie nicht haben wollen , spenden .
Die Großzügigkeit des Landtages macht auch vor seinen Kritikern nicht halt .
Rogue Generals
[ Update : On June 22 , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan was summoned to the White House to explain remarks he made in a Rolling Stone profile in which disparaged and questioned the competence of senior Obama administration officials . ]
Retired Thai General Khattiya Sawatdipho was dramatically shot in the head on May 17 while giving an interview to a reporter on the street in Bangkok .
Khattiya was once one of the most prominent commanders in the Thai military , and claims to have worked closely with the CIA in the 1980s to root out communist rebels in the country ’s south .
But after his friend , former Prime Minsiter Thaksin Shinawatra was deposed , he defected to join the country ’s anti-government “ red- shirt ” protesters .
This case of a government losing control over a prominent military commander is hardly an isolated incident .
Governments may derive their power from the “ legitimate use of physical force , ” as sociologist Max Weber argued , but there ’s a natural tension between the leaders who directly command that force — the generals — and the political leaders to whom they report in civilian governments .
Even the United States is not immune from civil military tensions — consider Alexander Hamilton ’s feud with John Adams over the fate of the Continental Army , or the highly public feud between President Harry Truman and Gen.
Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War , for instance — but the problem is far more serious in countries where political institutions are weaker .
Here are five cases in which military commanders have , for better or worse , threatened the stability of the very governments they pledged to serve .
LAURENT NKUNDA
Country : Democratic Republic of the Congo
Current status :
Under house arrest in Rwanda , on trial
Rebellion :
Few military commanders can say they ’ve fought in as many wars , armies , sides , and countries as the warlord Laurent Nkunda .
An ethnic Tutsi from Eastern Congo , Nkunda studied psychology at university before heading off to Rwanda to fight with the Tutsi rebels who eventually overthrew the country ’s Hutu - dominated government during the 1993 genocide .
Afterwards , Nkunda returned home and fought with Rwandan - backed Tutsi rebel armies in the first and second Congo civil wars .
After his group , the Rally for Congolese Democracy , joined the government in 2003 , Nkunda joined the national army as a colonel and was soon promoted to general .
But Nkunda chafed under Kinshasha ’s leadership and formed his own militia to hunt down Hutu rebels in Eastern Congo .
Nkunda ’s forces now stand accused of killing thousands , displacing hundreds of thousands , conscripting child soldiers , and using rape as a weapon of war during what has become known as the Kivu Conflict in Eastern Congo .
Despite this , the current Tutsi government in Rwanda is believed to have supported Nkunda as protection against the return of the Hutu militias who perpetrated the genocide .
In late 2008 , however , Kigali shifted positions , agreeing to hunt down the Hutus in cooperation with the Congolese government .
This made Nkunda , who categorically rejected cooperation with Kinshasha — a liability , and he was arrested in a joint Rwandan - Congolese operation in January 2009 .
SARATH FONSEKA
Country : Sri Lanka
Current Status :
In military custody .
On trial for inciting violence , dabbling in politics while in uniform , and corruption
Rebellion : Fonseka spent nearly four decades fighting the Tamil Tiger insurgency as an officer in the Sri Lankan army and was one of the conflict ’s most distinguished and recognized military leaders .
In May 2009 , as Sri Lanka ’s top military commander , Fonseka led the brutal final assault that crushed the final remnants of the rebel group and killed its notorious leader Velupillai Prabakharan .
Rather than basking in the glory of his victory , Fonseka resigned from the government over a dispute with President Mahinda Rajapaksa , whom he accused of trying to sideline him within the military and hog the spotlight for the victory .
Fonseka ran against Rajapaksa in this January ’s presidential election and , in a bizarre twist , won the support of the country ’s Tamil minority .
Fonseka was crushed in the election , then complained of fraud and accused the government of trying to assassinate him .
He also threatened to testify in an international war crimes tribunal against the president .
Fonseka was arrested in February on charges of having tried to overthrow the government as a military commander .
HAMID GUL
Country : Pakistan
Current status :
At large in Pakistan .
Designated a terrorist by India and the United States
Rebellion : Gul is emblematic of the murky historical ties that link U.S. and Pakistani intelligence services and South Asia ’s most dangerous militant groups .
A protégé of former military leader Zia ul - Haq , Gul was director of Pakistan ’s powerful Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency in the late 1980s and worked closely with the CIA and Saudi intelligence to support the mujahideen uprising against the Soviet Union .
After the end of the Afghan war , Gul became staunchly anti-American when the United States condemned Pakistan ’s clandestine nuclear program .
As ISI chief , Gul was the godfather of Pakistan ’s strategy of waging proxy war against India by supporting militant groups in Kashmir and Punjab .
Among the groups he reportedly nurtured is Lashkar - e - Taiba , the jihadist outfit blamed for the 2008 Mumbai attacks .
Since leaving the ISI , Gul has emerged a prominent pundit and provocateur , offering vocal ( and according to India , material ) support for al Qaeda , the Taliban , and other militant groups .
He has publicly admitted membership in Ummah Tameer - e- Nau , a group of former ISI members designated a terrorist group by the United States and linked to Osama bin Laden ’s quest for nuclear weapons .
Gul has repeatedly expressed his belief that the 9/11 attacks were an “ inside job ” perpetrated by the U.S. government .
Gul has also been a dangerous irritation for several Pakistani governments .
Former President Benazir Bhutto accused him of trying to assassinate her ( when she was eventually assassinated in 2007 , he predictably blamed it on the United States ) , participated in demonstrations against Gen.
Pervez Musharraf , and was briefly arrested for his efforts .
Gul has been described as a “ political ideologue of terror ” by current President Asif Ali Zardari .
RAUL BADUEL
Country : Venezuela
Current status : Jailed
Rebellion : Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez , who was himself a rogue colonel who attempted to overthrow the government in a failed military coup in 1992 and was elected president in 1999 , has his own troublesome military commander in former defense secretary Raul Baduel .
Baduel was once one a core supporter of Chávez ’s Bolivarian Revolution and came to his aid when the president was briefly overthrown in a coup attempt in 2002 .
Baduel rose to become Chávez ’s defense minister , but broke with the president in 2007 , accusing him of abuse of power over his attempts to change the constitution to keep himself in office .
Baduel ’s forceful opposition was one of the main factors cited for Chávez ’s loss in a referendum on the constitutional changes that year .
In 2008 , Baduel was arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison on corruption charges that his supporters claim are trumped up and barred from ever holding political office again .
Undeterred , Baduel continues to assail Chávez from prison using Twitter .
CETIN DOGAN
Country : Turkey
Current status : Hospitalized for high blood pressure , awaiting trial
Rebellion :
The Turkish military has traditionally considered itself the guardian of the country ’s stability and secular traditions and has stepped in to overthrow civilian governments four times since the founding of the modern republic in 1920 .
The so - called “ sledgehammer plot ” of 2003 was , depending on whom you ask , either the latest of these interventions , or a trumped - up charge by the country ’s Islamist civilian government to intimidate its secularist opponents .
According to documents published by the Turkish media that were reportedly written by Dogan , a now - retired four - star general , during a training conference in 2003 , the Turkish military was planning a series of covert actions to provoke a crisis and set the stage for a military coup .
These included downing a Turkish fighter jet and making it look like Greece had shot it down and faking attacks by Islamist groups in mosques , military posts , and other sites in Istanbul .
In the documents , the plotters lay out their supposed aim to “ remove once and for all , all causes that prevent the functioning of the secular democratic state . ”
Let 's say you 're advising BP .
What would you tell them to do ?
I 'd advise them to explore the option of bankruptcy .
I only know BP from public information .
BP has a lot of cash and the ability to generate huge amounts of cash .
But remember , just because BP can pay claims does n't mean they should , or that they will , given that their primary obligation is to their shareholders .
Bankruptcy laws are designed to help companies rehabilitate themselves .
What I 'm suggesting here is that BP is or ought to be analyzing the possibility of insolvency proceedings , and the pros and cons of doing so .
Now understand , this would be an absolute horror for the U.S. government .
If BP succeeds in putting a wall around its Gulf liabilities , payment on those claims fall to the U.S. government or they 're not paid .
What would a BP bankruptcy look like ?
It could work a lot of different ways .
They could cut loose BP America and it could be BP America that files for bankruptcy .
My presumption is that it 's BP America that 's responsible for the spill .
They can wall off the non-BP America assets from the Gulf -- which is about 50 % of the company 's net value -- and try to reorganize BP America .
That 's likely to take a very long time , and BP would not make good on its promise for the 20 billion [ in the escrow fund ] .
Or they could file all of BP , and do so in London .
Wonder how well - received our government and legitimate Gulf claimants would fare in a British insolvency court ?
Now let 's say you 're advising the U.S. government on dealing with BP .
What actions do you take now to keep BP from filing for bankruptcy to limit its exposure to liabilities ?
I would start with the same analysis BP is undertaking .
Perform the same analyses BP is performing about various bankruptcy strategies and figuring out how its assets and liabilities match up structurally , and how to shift assets from one entity to another .
Develop judgments about potential outcomes from those bankruptcy strategies .
Develop views on total costs that BP might face .
We need to be able to anticipate where and how BP is going and then plan courses of action designed both to blunt and address BP 's potential strategies .
In short , I would want to have a very good understanding of what BP could do .
My thinking now is that BP America could file here or they could file the whole thing in London .
Why should they continue to get berated by this country , pay $ 20 billion [ via the escrow fund ] and still face an unlimited liability for not only civil , but also for criminal charges , if there 's a better way for the company ?
It would be a mistake , in my judgment , to view BP as a political piñata that can be beat around the head repeatedly without consequences .
It 's not reasonable to expect BP to pay unlimited liabilities and face criminal charges , and the United States needs to understand the size of the gun BP can pull .

Tang cares about his privacy and takes elaborate steps to protect it .
Your privacy is another matter .
Tang , 27 , is co-founder of a “ people search ” website called Spokeo , which serves up extraordinarily detailed profiles of pretty much everyone -- including you -- gleaned from online directories , databases and social networks .
Do n’t take my word for it .
Do a search for your name at Spokeo ’s website .
“ The Web is becoming more and more people - centric , ” Tang told me over coffee the other day .
“ We ’re just aggregating what ’s already out there . ”
I ’d love to say that we met at his Pasadena office , where I was able to get a sense of what this company was about and who works there .
But Tang wanted to get together instead at a Starbucks outlet .
It was the first hint that privacy is very much on his mind -- his own , that is .
Tang said Spokeo -- rhymes with Tokyo -- began as a lark in a Stanford University dorm room .
A rudimentary version of the site ’s service was unveiled in 2006 .
But it was n’t until a new and improved version was introduced in March , after a move to Southern California , that things really took off .
Suddenly the number of daily searches by users topped 1 million .
About 100,000 people signed up for full access to Spokeo ’s resources at a cost of $ 14.85 for three months or $ 35.40 for a year of people searches .
A free search will likely turn up the street someone lives on and their phone number , even if it ’s unlisted .
You ’ll see that person ’s age ( or a close approximation ) , ethnicity , occupation , education , hobbies , relationship status , Zodiac sign , whether he or she has kids , even the quality of their neighborhood .
Not all the info is on target .
My listing , for example , said my home has a swimming pool ( I wish ! ) .
But in Spokeo searches performed by about a dozen colleagues here at the paper , I ’d have to say that the site ’s information was accurate ( or close to it ) more often than not .
Paying customers can get people ’s full address , including street number , and more detailed information about who others are and what kind of life they lead .
It ’s not that Spokeo and similar sites are rooting around in our trash and revealing our deepest secrets .
But by compiling free dossiers of our digital doings , they make it easier than ever before for others to peek into our lives and learn who we are and how we behave .
And Spokeo seems to serve up more info , more easily , than all the rest , according to privacy watchdogs .
“ We get calls every day about this , ” said Rainey Reitman , spokeswoman for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , a San Diego advocacy group .
“ People go to Spokeo and are utterly flabbergasted by what ’s available .
It ’s incredibly invasive . ”
Invasive -- but not illegal .
Since all the information is essentially up for grabs , Spokeo is guilty of nothing more than building a better mousetrap .
Tang said the privately held site pools data from about 80 sources , including LinkedIn , MySpace , Twitter and Yelp .
Facebook is the most prominent exception to Spokeo ’s digital reach .
“ We ’re still working on that , ” Tang said .
“ We ’re talking to them about it . ”
Yet even without access to Facebook ’s voluminous user pages , Spokeo might strike some as a Christmas present for stalkers , spouse abusers and others with ill intent .
Tang said he ’s sensitive to such perceptions , but believes his site offers nothing that could n’t be found elsewhere , albeit with perhaps a bit more hunting and gathering .
“ Stalkers already know how to get this information , ” he said .
Tang noted that Spokeo allows people to opt out from being included in its searches .
To do so , though , you have give the company your e-mail address and then confirm it ’s a working address by clicking on a link the company will send you .
Those are two data points most privacy - minded people may not want to provide , especially to a website that ’s already eager to know more about you .
Spokeo is also affiliated with a business called ReputationDefender Inc. , which for $ 9.95 a month or $ 95.40 a year promises to erase your information from , yes , Spokeo and other people - search services .
Because Spokeo gets a cut of the action any time a user signs up through its site with ReputationDefender , it finds itself in the interesting position of profiting from a solution to the problem it helped cause .
Tang repeatedly stressed that Spokeo does n’t represent a greater threat to people ’s privacy .
But it ’s noteworthy that he ’s opted out from inclusion on his own site .
“ I was getting a lot of e-mails and threats , ” Tang explained .
“ It was decided by others at the company , and by lawyers , that it would be better if I opted out . ”
Moreover , it turns out that the business address the company lists online and with state authorities is actually a small mailbox at a UPS Store in a Pasadena strip mall .
No phone number is provided .
Tang said this is because it ’s more convenient to have a fixed mailbox , and because Spokeo is n’t equipped to handle a large volume of calls .
In any case , a little sifting of publicly available information reveals that Spokeo Inc. is based on the second floor of a nondescript office building at 1010 E. Union St. , not far from Pasadena City College .
The company ’s phone number is ( 626 ) 396-9496 .
Tang said he appreciated the privacy issues that I raised during our chat at Starbucks , and that he intends to put some thought to addressing them .
“ There ’s still a lot that we need to do , ” he said .
“ We ’ve created a sizable user community .
We have to be more socially responsible . ”
He could start by asking people in advance if they want their personal information included in Spokeo searches , rather than making us go to the trouble of opting out .
But something tells me the company ’s profit would vanish quickly .
In the digital age , let ’s face it , there ’s no money in doing the right thing .

South Carolina Republican gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley may or may not have had an affair with two dudes .
Regardless , a South Carolina state senator said on a talk show that South Carolina does n't need a " raghead " for a governor .
Republican state Senator Jake Knotts said on a radio talk show :
We already got one raghead in the White House , we do n't need a raghead in the governor 's mansion .
( Haley is of Indian descent and was raised Sikh . )
In response to this , Democratic state senator Boy Brown — who was also on the show — told CNN
He said some things he should n't have said .
That 's Jakey .
There goes Jakey with his vile racism again .
Haw haw , you should have seen him at the Lincoln High Football benefit BBQ last year — he had a couple funny things to say about Mexicans !
South Carolina is clearly jealous of Alabama for getting all the attention for its ridiculous politics .

Middle East Brief 84 ( Summary ) —
The uprisings that swept the Arab world in 2011 - 2012 were sparked by many catalysts .
Not least among them was the desire to put an end to arbitrary rule and install what political analysts call “ the rule of law . ”
For countries in the region that face the prospect of failed ( or failing ) states , such as Libya , Syria , and Iraq , the goal of building accountable governance is a luxury of secondary priority .
But for other countries where the integrity of the state is not in doubt , building rule of law is a reasonable ambition .
In this Brief , Eva Bellin examines the question of how the Arab world can achieve this objective and the specific challenges they face by drawing on the experience of other regions that have wrestled with this ambition .
By focusing on four crucial institutions — the judiciary , the police , the military , and regulatory agencies — Prof .
Bellin identifies some of the best practices and evaluates key obstacles to the reforms required .
This Brief is based on the introduction to the forthcoming book “ Building Rule of Law in the Arab World , ” edited by Eva Bellin and Heidi Lane .

So the pilot episode of Pioneer One became available for download this morning .
I scored a backstage pass to a sneak preview on Vimeo last night , but you can get your very own copy of the groundbreaking “ made - for - torrent ” series through their savvy distributor Vodo.net
As you might expect it ’s not as slick as your typical big media TV drama — at least not yet .
My film school snobbery is showing here but it seems to me that there are enough long takes in the first half of the episode to mess with the overall pacing .
And likewise for this Linux snob , there are just way too many Macs lying around — what , is this FBI made of money or something ?!
There are some impressive visual effects , though — thanks no doubt to director Bracey Smith ‘s expertise in that particular area .
The way I see it the biggest challenge facing Bracey and executive producer Josh Bernhard is something that they never had to worry about with The Lionshare — that is , deliberately stringing their audience along with meager helpings of plot only every so often .
With the big revelation at the end of this first episode , it looks like they can deliver .
I should point out my rather obvious bias here ; Josh and Bracey have honoured me with a mention in the end credits for some reason .
If nothing else it ’s comforting to know that 50 or 100 years from now someone will see my gravestone and say : “ Hey , did n’t this dude get a credit on Pioneer One ?
I wonder why … ”
All self - depreciation aside , you must understand that this project is very big deal , whether you ’re a fan of the subject matter or not .
If it ’s successful Pioneer One could pave the way for a golden age of video storytelling — funded by fans , delivered by BitTorrent , all without any meddling by big media .
What a wonderful thing that would be .

A recreational boater glides along the Chicago River in late June .
In 1900 , Chicago reversed the flow of the river so its sewage would no longer flow into Lake Michigan and contaminate its main source of drinking water .

By of the
First of two parts .
Chicago likes to think of the filth flowing in its namesake river as nobody 's business but its own , and for most of the last century that might have been true .
But today that dirty water has become a problem for all the Great Lakes - the world 's largest freshwater system and a drinking water source for 40 million people .
Blame the Asian carp .
More than a century ago , the city reversed the Chicago River to carry its sewage away from Lake Michigan and into a Mississippi River - bound canal system .
Today , those canals have become a flashpoint in the battle to protect the Great Lakes from the leaping carp that can devastate prized fish populations and inflict brutal blows on unsuspecting boaters .
With the invaders finning their way up the canal waters toward the Lake Michigan shoreline , a push is on to reconstruct the natural barrier between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi basins that the Chicago canals destroyed so long ago .
It is a project that would almost surely mean that Chicago 's river - and some of the city 's wastewater - would again flow into Lake Michigan .
This itself would be an ecological disaster - if Chicago sewage officials can't figure out how to clean up sewage discharges that are among the nastiest in the nation .
Chicago has a rare distinction among major American cities :
It does not employ a disinfection stage at its three main sewage treatment plants .
The result is a river and canal system running so thick with fecal coliform that signs along the banks warn that the contents below are not suitable for " any human body contact . "
It is poison , basically .
Even before the carp arrived , conservationists had been pushing the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago to not just do basic sewage treatment , but also to disinfect its discharges , a step nearly every other major American city takes .
That 's something the district boss dismisses as not worth the expense , which would be no more than $ 2 to $ 3 per household per month according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
The reclamation district shows no signs of budging on the issue , even as pressure mounts to do whatever it will take to safeguard the Great Lakes - and its $ 7 billion fishing industry - from what biologists call a menacing invader .
That 's not what reclamation district boss Richard Lanyon calls the fish .
He calls them " these stupid Asian carp . "
The big flush
Chicago has been treating Lake Michigan like a giant toilet tank since it engineered a crude sewer system to suck from the lake about 6 billion gallons of water per day , a flow big enough to drain a body of water the size of Lake Winnebago in a single summer .
You can think of that colossal water grab as a super - size flush , inside a continent - sized commode .
Chicagoland 's raw sewage once plunged into the man-made Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal , and that canal whooshed the Windy City stew into the Mississippi River and down to the Gulf of Mexico , Chicago 's toilet bowl .
Before canal construction in 1900 , the city simply dumped its feces into the Chicago River , a fetid dribble that flowed into Lake Michigan - Chicago 's drinking water source .
This was n't just gross , it was deadly ; about 2,000 Chicagoans a year succumbed to typhoid .
" It was a matter of survival , " Lanyon says of channeling the polluted river so it flowed away from the lake .
The city 's decision to blast a canal through the continental divide that separates the waters of the Great Lakes and Mississippi guaranteed Chicago a boundless supply of safe freshwater , fueling its growth and development for decades to come .
It also ignited courtroom battles .
Neighboring Great Lakes states claimed Chicago stole their water and permanently lowered Lake Michigan ; St. Louis was revolted that Chicago sewage flowed from its faucets , diluted as it was by the time it got to town .
In a 1930 ruling , the U.S. Supreme Court allowed reduced flows in the canal to protect Chicagoans from " possible pestilence and ruin " had they continued to drink what they flushed .
Since then , the Midwest has tolerated Chicago 's crap , but politicians are now lining up to do something about its carp - and its canal system .
First a fix , then a mess
Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley convened a summit seven years ago that drew scientists , engineers and invasive species experts to figure out how to stop the inexorable advance of invading carp toward the Great Lakes .
The canal had indeed been a forceful solution to the city 's 19th century sewage problem .
But by the beginning of the 21st century , the true costs of destroying a continental divide - which some conservationists refer to as Chicago 's " original sin " - were finally coming into focus as water , waste and noxious species mixed in a manner nature never intended .
Pipe - clogging invasive mussels from the Caspian Sea region - which have shredded the Great Lakes ' food web and cost billions of dollars to industries and municipalities - rode Chicago 's canal waters out of Lake Michigan and into the rest of America .
They were followed by round gobies , a prolific predator of native fish species ' eggs .
Today a fish - killing , ebola - like virus is threatening to spill inland from southern Lake Michigan , an invasion that could have dire consequences for fish farmers in the South .
With Asian carp on the way north , Daley knew by 2003 that it was time to do something " bold " to deal with the economic and ecological consequences of linking America 's two grand drainage basins .
" The longer you put off solving a problem , the more it costs you in the long run , " Daley told the group .
" An aggressive solution to a problem is almost always cheaper than repairing the damage later . "
The group brainstormed for two days and concluded it was time to atone for the destruction ; it was time to reconstruct the continental divide by putting a barrier in the canal .
But the solution Daley had asked for was widely dismissed as outlandish .
Tilting river flows back toward Lake Michigan in dinner plate - flat Chicago would likely require costly upgrades in the city 's sewage system because it would no longer have the luxury of flushing its bacteria - laden waste downstream .
Damming the canals also would mean trouble for the barge industry that relies on free - flowing water to float industrial goods such as coal , salt , cement and chemicals .
Then came the carp .
In November , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers acknowledged that new environmental DNA sampling revealed the fish had breached the lake 's last line of defense on the canal , an electric barrier system about 35 miles downstream from Lake Michigan .
Government agencies have since dumped about $ 4.5 million worth of fish poison into the Chicago waterways as an emergency dose of chemotherapy to try to knock back the spreading ecological malignancy .
The poisoning is part of a $ 78 million federal emergency plan to buy the Great Lakes some more time .
It includes three electric fish barriers in the canal and research into beating back the invaders with bubbles , lights and even noise .
Criticized as more desperate and disparate than directed , few believe these quirky schemes offer the Great Lakes any long - term protection .
Yet the seeds planted at Daley 's summit seven years ago are finally beginning to sprout , and it's not just Illinois ' neighbors who are pushing for big changes on the 110 year - old canal .
In late June - just three days after a 3 - foot long Asian carp was found six miles downstream from Lake Michigan - Illinois Democratic Sen .
Dick Durbin proposed legislation forcing the Army Corps to expedite a study of what it will take to separate the canals from Lake Michigan .
Even canal operators realize the days of a free flow to the Gulf of Mexico may be numbered .
" Could it happen ? " says reclamation district executive director Lanyon .
" Sure .
It would be challenging , but it could happen . "
And one reason it could happen is that remarkable progress has been made since 1900 in technologies to disinfect waste discharged from sewage treatment plants .
Arteries and intestines
The 1972 Clean Water
Act led to a universal push by environmental regulators to try to force cities everywhere to treat their rivers as the vital arteries that they are .
Except in Chicago .
It still treats its river like an intestine .
" What 's happening here is insane , " John Quail of the conservation group Friends of the Chicago River says on a steamy mid-May day in the northern suburb of Evanston .
Quail is standing on a floating dock in a canal carved a century ago through Chicago 's tony north shore suburbs to flush their waste downstream .
At the end of the dock a team of middle - aged moms lowers a crew boat into waters so filthy with fecal coliform - an indicator of the presence of human waste - that it would be illegal in Wisconsin and almost anywhere else .
But not here .
Not on the North Shore Channel .
Not downstream on the Sanitary and Ship Canal .
And not on the Cal - Sag Channel , south of downtown , which also flows into the Sanitary and Ship Canal .
Built primarily to float waste - and therefore given a pass on the normal disinfection requirements - these three canals are thick with bacteria at levels that can be more than 1,000 times higher than what is discharged at Milwaukee 's Jones Island sewage treatment plant .
It signals the presence of human - borne viruses , bacteria and even worms that can cause everything from hepatitis to respiratory infections to dysentery .
Cities typically have strict limits on how much fecal coliform they can discharge ; Jones Island discharged an average of 29 fecal colony forming units per 100 milliliters of water in 2008 .
Records from the Chicago Reclamation District show the North Side treatment plant averaged 12,279 , with daily spikes as high as 170,000 .
At Chicago 's big three reclamation treatment plants , there is no cap .
The reason , essentially , is Chicago treatment plants discharge into a sanitary canal , giving wastewater a chance to dilute and be cleansed naturally before it reaches a river .
Chicago now caring
The sewage situation does n't fit with the self - image of a city led by a mayor whose goal is to make it the " most environmentally friendly city in the nation . "
When people realize what the reclamation district is putting into the picturesque river , Friends of the Chicago River executive director Margaret Frisbie says , people are " shocked and disgusted . "
The Natural Resources Defense Council 's Henry Henderson still shakes his head at an episode last year during the heat of the failed push to land the 2016 Summer Olympics .
Chicago 's hope was to host the world 's first " Blue - Green Games , " focusing on environmental protection and showcasing its urban shoreline and waterways .
As part of the campaign , the bid committee 's Environment Advisory Council wanted to take a visiting international delegation on a boat ride down the Chicago River .
Henderson suggested the event might be an appropriate time to announce that , in the spirt of the Blue - Green motto , Chicago was going to begin disinfecting the sewage discharges that account for the majority of the water in the Chicago canal system .
The environment advisory council members were stunned that such filth flows daily through the heart of their city .
" You could just see their faces as they tried to figure it out , " says Frisbie , also an environment advisory council member .
" They were saying : What ?
What ?
They did n't believe it . "
So how does Chicago get away with it ?
" It 's a good question , " says Linda Holst , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's regional water quality branch chief .
" Well , Mr. Mayor ? "
Mayor Daley wants the reclamation district to start disinfecting its discharges .
So does Governor Pat Quinn , as does Attorney General Lisa Madigan , as well as a bipartisan group of congressmen from the region .
But they do n't run the sewer system that serves most all of Cook County - including about 125 communities outside Chicago city limits .
Lanyon and his elected board do , and they do n't want to pay for it .
Lanyon says even if the district did raise the money to install disinfection systems , a state tax cap means the district could not afford to run them at its three major plants , Stickney , North Side and Calumet .
His response to Daley 's push for disinfection ?
" Well , Mr. Mayor , write me a check , " he says .
" Put your pocketbook where your mouth is . "
Lanyon points to a soon - to - be released epidemiological study his district commissioned that will show the canal water is n't getting people sick at any higher rate than other water bodies .
Critics say the study does n't prove people are n't contracting bugs and passing them along to others .
They also contend the study does n't take into account that many people do n't use the canals the same way they use other bodies of water , precisely because of the dangers .
Many of those who do venture onto the canals do so with great caution .
The leafy North Shore channel is a training ground for college crew teams , as well as high school rowers , many of whom see the dirty water as the best route to a varsity letter , and perhaps college scholarship .
Space for all rowers is tight on busy training days , and on weekends they have to dodge droves of kayakers and canoeists .
All of them float past the warning signs lining the banks that caution against any body contact at all .
Only a fool - or an unsupervised child trying to beat the heat on a hot summer day - would purposely take a dip in the North Shore Channel , but that does n't mean people are n't getting wet .
New Trier Township High School assistant crew coach Hope Poor says her kids are schooled to wash well after practice , scrub popped blisters and keep their heads above water on the rare occasion someone takes an accidental plunge .
" All of the kids are aware of how dirty the water is , " Poor says .
Sometimes that 's not enough .
Poor remembers one student who was forced to drop out of the sport .
" She got two staph infections from cuts on her leg and her mother would n't let her row anymore , " she says .
The girl , she says , was n't part of the reclamation district 's epidemiological study .
' Not your babbling brook '
Lanyon says people should know what they 're getting into when they go on the water .
" This is not your babbling brook .
. . .
It 's an open channel or a pipe , " he says .
And that characterization has made all the difference .
In the years just after passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 , the district was disinfecting its wastewater , but beginning in the mid-1980s it convinced state regulators it was n't worth the expense because nobody was fishing or swimming in the waters .
The reclamation district also argued the chlorine it was putting into the water was doing more harm than good to fish , though that problem is easily solved with a dechlorination stage , as is done in Milwaukee .
The state of Illinois responded by giving the district a pass on disinfection .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , which commonly delegates Clean Water
Act enforcement to individual states , could have stepped in and put the hammer down .
Instead it let it slide , and the dirty water has been flowing since .
" The river was n't used that much for recreation and the U.S. EPA basically said , ' We 're not going to take on the state of Illinois and the ( reclamation ) district and fight them over this , ' " says Dale Bryson , former director of U.S. EPA 's regional water division , and also a former board chairman for the Alliance for the Great Lakes .
" It was just a decision we made because we had other things that were a higher priority . "
Disinfection issues aside , Bryson says the reclamation district has made big strides in cleaning canal waters in recent decades .
He points to Chicago 's deep tunnel and reservoir project that already has reduced overflows from about once every three days to about once a month .
Overflows typically happen in big rains when treatment plants are overwhelmed and raw sewage gets dumped in the canals .
Once the reservoir system is finished , sometime in the 2020s , it will ratchet overflows down to one to three per year , and perhaps zero , says Illinois EPA 's Rob Sulski .
The overflow reduction already has caused fish populations in the canal system to explode and , ironically , may have opened the door to the Asian carp .
In previous decades they might not have been able to survive in the canal .
Still , the waterway will never be safe for humans until discharges coming out of the treatment plants are disinfected .
" The district is a pretty progressive outfit other than the last few years , when they decided to say no to everything , " says Bryson .
Illinois EPA is now recommending that the district begin disinfecting , and the Illinois Pollution Control Board , which sets environmental rules for the state , is weighing the matter .
While the U.S. EPA has deferred to the state on the matter for decades , that could soon change .
" At some point , if we feel like it 's dragging on and on and on , we 'll have to decide whether or not we need to step in , " says U.S. EPA 's Holst .
The carp might well force the issue .
The Natural Resources Defense Council 's Henderson is n't surprised the reclamation district has dug in its heels on disinfection and is dismissing the threat the carp pose .
" It has a long history of being a very insular institution , " he says .
" The only public input they want is when you flush your toilet . "
In the district 's hands
The reclamation district has been taking issues into its own hands since canal builders slipped out of town on a train under the cover of darkness on Jan. 17 , 1900 , racing 30 miles downstream to open the canal and beat a feared U.S. Supreme Court injunction sought by Missouri .
That chilly morning , a dam was opened for the first time and a green sheet of water tumbled forth .
Lake Michigan and the Mississippi basin were wed in a ceremony the New York Times characterized as one of " undignified haste . "
More than 100 years later , the fight sparked by that late - night raid on the continent 's circulatory system continues .
This winter , Wisconsin and several other states hoped the threat of Asian carp would persuade the Supreme Court to re-open an ongoing case over the canal that was initially filed in the 1920s .
The Supreme Court justices declined , but Great Lakes politicians outside Illinois are pushing for a new law that would require the U.S. Army Corps to immediately shut down two navigation locks on the canal system as an emergency - and crude - attempt to once again separate the lake from the Mississippi .
Illinois politicians and business leaders have argued against an emergency lock closure .
They say the lock gates are n't entirely waterproof so they might still allow fish to pass through .
Shutting them with essentially no notice would also deal a brutal blow to a barge industry that is largely a byproduct of the sewage canals .
And closing the locks permanently at this point likely would also cause severe flooding because the canal system is designed to flow backwards into the lake if big rains overwhelm the treatment plants .
Operators respond by diverting straight sewage into the canal and gates are opened so the waste can tumble into Lake Michigan .
But it 's possible that separation might be accomplished in a way that would not force flooding and still accommodate , if not enhance , regional barge traffic .
Yet it will take planning and time - time the Great Lakes might not have .
Biologists say this is a bigger issue than just Asian carp .
It is about the biological integrity of the Great Lakes , home to about 20 % of the globe 's fresh surface water , a geographic phenomenon every bit as unique as the Himalayas .
The freshwater seas evolved essentially isolated from the rest of the aquatic world .
They were protected on the east by the towering Niagara Falls and on the west by the continental divide that separated them from the Mississippi River basin .
Canada 's Welland Canal , first constructed in the 1800s , allowed oceangoing vessels - and the ruinous critters they unintentionally carry - to bypass Niagara Falls , and the front door to the Great Lakes swung wide open .
The back door opened wide when Chicagoans blasted their way into the Mississippi basin .
The result is that today the Great Lakes are home to more than 185 non-native species , and a delicate balance established over 10,000 years has been destroyed in a matter of decades .
That does n't mean the lakes have seen everything the globe can send them .
The reviled northern snakehead , for example , is already loose in the Mississippi basin .
The razor - toothed fish that can breathe air and slither short distances across land is a prime candidate to follow the carp north toward the lakes .
" This whole issue should not be framed in terms of carp .
It 's about lots of other species , " says David Lodge , the University of Notre Dame professor who pioneered the DNA testing in the canals .
There is another reason Chicago needs to rethink its 19th century approach to managing its water , says Josh Ellis , a water supply specialist for the area 's nonprofit Metropolitan Planning Council .
He looks down the road and sees a congested megalopolis going dry if it does n't figure out how to better use the 2.1 billion gallon per day cap of lake water that was imposed by the Supreme Court as a result of the decades - old lawsuit .
Soon enough , he says , the foolishness of using much of its precious water budget to flush the city 's waste is going to become apparent .
Under the Supreme Court ruling , every drop the city returns to Lake Michigan is a drop Chicago can use to slake its thirst and fuel its businesses .
" Over the next 100 years Chicago will be at a disadvantage in terms of water supply , " says Ellis .
" And I think that 's the real reason to build a separation - it's about the water . "
And the money that goes with it .

Berlin - „ Das Thema hat uns überrascht “ , heißt es beim Marktführer Eon .
Und zwar unangenehm überrascht .
Seit Monaten sprechen Vertreter der großen Energiekonzerne – Eon , RWE , Vattenfall und EnBW – mit der Regierung über eine Verlängerung der Laufzeiten von Atomkraftwerken .
Das Thema Brennelementesteuer hat dabei nie eine Rolle gespielt .
Anders vor einem Jahr .
Damals schlug Bundesumweltminister Sigmar Gabriel ( SPD ) vor , die AKW - Konzerne an der Müllentsorgung zu beteiligen .
„ Ich bin mir sicher , dass auch die Haushaltspolitiker der Union nicht wollen , dass wir über vier Milliarden Euro aus dem Bundeshaushalt brauchen , um mit Steuergeldern die Billigentsorgung der Atomwirtschaft zu bezahlen “ , argumentierte Gabriel vor einem Jahr .
Doch daraus wurde nichts .
Bis heute .
„ Durch die Einführung einer steuerlichen Beteiligung der Kernenergiewirtschaft an den Sanierungskosten sowie Reduktion der Zusatzgewinne könnten jährlich 2,3 Milliarden an zusätzlichen Einnahmen für den Bundeshaushalt generiert werden “ , heißt es in dem Papier der Bundesregierung zu den Ergebnissen der Sparklausur .
Einen Zusammenhang mit der Verlängerung der Laufzeiten der Atomkraftwerke gibt es nicht , jedenfalls nicht unmittelbar .
Und die Anleger und Spekulanten hatten das schnell verstanden : Eon und RWE waren am Dienstag die größten Verlierer an der deutschen Börse .
Die neue Steuer , gewissermaßen erfunden vom heutigen Oppositionsführer Gabriel , funktioniert ganz einfach : Auf jede Kilowattstunde Strom , die aus einem AKW stammt , wird eine Abgabe fällig .
So ergibt sich auch der Name Brennelementesteuer .
„ Wir nehmen das zur Kenntnis “ , heißt es dazu am Dienstag säuerlich bei Eon .
Da werde eine Steuer vorgeschlagen , ohne dass dabei ein Konzept erkennbar würde .
Und der europäische Strommarkt bleibe heterogen , wenn Deutschland eine Energieform diskriminiere .
„ Wir halten den vorgeschlagenen Weg einer Brennelementesteuer für falsch “ , sagte ein RWE - Sprecher , und bei der Berliner Zentrale von Vattenfall heißt es , man könne nichts sagen , weil keine Details bekannt seien .
Man warte auf das Energiekonzept der Regierung , das im Juli vorgelegt werden soll und in dem dann neben den Laufzeiten auch Festlegungen zum künftigen Energiemix und zur CO2 - Speicherung stehen dürften .
Indes hat die Branche den Termin intern schon abgehakt .
Das nationale Energiekonzept wird nun im Herbst erwartet .
Frühestens .
Das hängt vor allem auch mit Konflikten innerhalb der Regierung zusammen .
Umweltminister Norbert Röttgen ( CDU ) präferiert eine Verlängerung der AKW - Laufzeiten um vier bis maximal acht Jahre , andere Koalitionspolitiker können sich auch 28 Jahre vorstellen .
Zu einer Verlängerung der Laufzeiten wird es vermutlich kommen – darauf deutet auch die geplante Einführung der Brennelementesteuer hin .
Denn in der großen Koalition , also mit einem Umweltminister Gabriel , war so eine Steuer auch deshalb nicht eingeführt worden , weil vor zehn Jahren im Rahmen des sogenannten Atomkonsens zwei Dinge beschlossen wurden : Spätestens 2022 soll hierzulande das letzte AKW vom Netz gehen .
Bis dahin aber wird der Atomstrom gegenüber anderen Energieträgern nicht diskriminiert .
Anders gesagt : Solange der Ausstieg steht , gibt es keine Atom- oder Brennelementesteuer .
Die Verhältnisse haben sich geändert , Schwarz - Gelb wird einige AKW länger laufen lassen – sofern ein Weg dahin am Bundesrat vorbeiführt .
Und das wird dann auch die vier Konzerne besänftigen , bei denen der Schock über die neue Steuer am Tag nach der Verkündung dennoch tief saß .
„ Das haben wir von dieser Regierung nicht erwartet “ , hieß es in einer Unternehmenszentrale .
Image caption Polar is a battleground in Hugo Chavez 's ' economic war '
Venezuela 's biggest beer producer , food and drink giant Polar , is also the country 's largest company still in private hands after President Hugo Chavez 's nationalisation drive .
But that may not be the case for long .
Last week , Mr Chavez stepped up his attacks on Polar 's billionaire owner , Lorenzo Mendoza , whom he has previously accused of pushing up food prices by hoarding products to cause artificial shortages .
For its part , Polar has called the allegations " absurd " and " senseless " .
But that did not stop the authorities seizing 114 tonnes of food which they said had been illegally stored in Polar warehouses in the city of Barquisimeto last month .
In his latest broadside , Mr Chavez said he was declaring an " economic war " on Venezuela 's " stateless bourgeoisie " and made it clear that Mr Mendoza was in the firing line .
" I 'm not afraid to nationalise Polar , Mendoza , so be careful , " he said .
" Let 's see who lasts longer - you , with your Polar and your riches , or me , with my people and the dignity of a revolutionary soldier . "
National reach
One of Polar 's business associates recently described the firm 's products as " icons of Venezuelan society " , and no -one who has spent time in Venezuela could disagree with that .
Image caption The Pepsi globe has been a landmark in Caracas since 1999
Harina PAN maize flour , Chiffon margarine , Efe ice creams and Toddy chocolate milk are just some of the brands produced by Mr Mendoza 's conglomerate .
Polar also has distribution rights for Pepsi-Cola products in Venezuela , ensuring that Pepsi is easier to find and a bigger sales success in the country than its global rival , Coca - Cola .
In another sign of growing government pressure on Polar , the company was ordered last month to remove a giant globe - shaped Pepsi sign from the top of a skyscraper that it owns in the centre of the capital , Caracas .
The mayor of the Libertador municipality in which the building stands , Jorge Rodriguez , who formerly served as vice - president under Mr Chavez , fined the firm 77,000 bolivares ( $ 18,000 ; £ 12,400 ) , saying it had no permits for the sign and had breached city planning rules .
The authorities also swiftly sent workmen in to begin dismantling the globe .
However , Polar said it had all the necessary permits for the sign and vowed to fight the decision , which it described as " arbitrary " .
Ice - cold icon
But of course , of all Polar 's products , it is their eponymous beer that most deserves the status of national icon .
For me , just seeing the label brings back memories of a scorching evening in Venezuela 's oil capital , Maracaibo .
After a taxi ride from the airport through the parched outskirts of one of the hottest cities on earth , I was extremely grateful when my hotel 's barman produced endless semi-frozen bottles of the stuff from an enormous refrigerator .
Image caption Polar is a beer best served cold
It has to be said , though , that Polar is a beer that does not travel well outside Venezuela 's borders , as the country 's immediate neighbours can attest .
Colombia is the only major Latin American export market in which Polar beer has managed to gain a foothold , despite trade pacts that link Venezuela with the region 's other big economies .
Efforts to sell it in nearby Trinidad and Tobago were undermined by a local " spoiler " product called Pola Beer , while in Guyana , its public image was tarnished last year when 15 people , including former Customs employees , were charged in connection with a fraudulent multi-million dollar scheme to import it without paying duty .
Means of production
If Mr Chavez does fulfil his threat to nationalise Polar , he will be extending his already significant control over Venezuela 's food production .
Venezuelan economist Angel Alayon , of food industry body Cavidea , says that the government now controls 75 % of coffee production , 42 % of maize flour , 40 % of rice , 25 % of cooking oil , 52 % of sugar and 25 % of milk .
The government says it has a duty to secure food supplies and to prevent what it sees as " economic sabotage " by private companies .

But so much of the economy is now in state hands that businessmen such as Fernando Morgado , head of the National Council of Commerce and Services ( Consecomercio ) , have called on the government to take responsibility for Venezuela 's economic decline and stop blaming the private sector .
The country 's economy contracted 5.8 % in the first quarter of this year compared with a year earlier .
The International Monetary Fund predicts that its GDP will shrink by 2.6 % in 2010 , making it the only Latin American economy , and the world 's only oil exporter , to see a contraction for this year .
Mr Chavez believes that a bigger economic role for the state is the only way to ensure the effectiveness of his price controls and stave off stagflation - the deadly combination of economic stagnation and high inflation that is currently assailing the country .
Venezuela 's consumer inflation rate is currently the worst in Latin America , reaching an annual rate of 27 % last year and expected to rise to 29.7 % in 2010 , according to the IMF .
However , there are doubts over the government 's effectiveness in securing food supplies after the discovery last week of thousands of tonnes of rotting food that had been imported by state - run retailer Pdval , but never distributed .
And Ismael Perez Vigil , executive president of the Conindustria employers ' organisation , points out that most of the companies nationalised by the government have seen no improvements in productivity .
Coffee crisis
The coffee industry is certainly a case in point .
At the start of the 20th Century , Venezuela was the world 's second - biggest coffee exporter , but it is now importing significant amounts of the stuff for the first time in its history .
Coffee producers say price controls imposed by Mr Chavez meant the price they were getting for their crop did not cover production costs .

There 's not an awful lot of coffee in Venezuela these days
They found they could get twice as much for their crop in neighbouring Colombia , giving some of them the incentive to smuggle out as much as they could .
At the same time , those price controls took away the incentive to invest in the industry , so new trees were not planted in response to the shortage .
In August last year , the government acted by taking over the coffee roasting plants of Fama de America , which had a 30 % share of the market .
However , the plants do not have enough locally - grown raw material to operate at full capacity , so imports are still necessary .
Venezuela 's beer drinkers are doubtless hoping that a nationalised Polar would not lead to a comparable shortage of their favourite national beverage .
Mr Chavez is proud of his Bolivarian revolution .
But if the beer ever ran out , he might have a real uprising on his hands .

I think of myself as an average sort of Englishman , a little to the left of centre politically but within the moderate middle ground .
I like good beer and country walks .
My tastes are boringly average .
So why do I , so far away and so much a product of my own country , take such an interest in the Israel - Palestine conflict ?
Where does my disproportionate interest come from , considering that other conflicts around the world are equal or worse in their unpleasantness ?
I devour articles about Israel - Palestine on Cif ; I look at Haaretz , the Jerusalem Post , al - Jazeera and other commentaries .
When things heat up , it is close to an addiction .
Why am I not so worked up about Zimbabwe ?
North Korea ?
Sudan ?
Tibet ?
Burma ?
I am not alone .
Comments posted on the internet by Israel supporters , by Palestinian supporters and by trolls on each side show that there are millions of us around the world , millions upon millions , picking away at this one conflict like it's a giant scab .
What are the implications of such a level of passionate interest ?
Perhaps I am an antisemite ?
Seen from Zionist eyes , where Israel does little that is not justified , this has to be the first and most likely explanation for why I follow their affairs so closely .
Restricting the word to its definition in the Concise Oxford dictionary , and ignoring all the meanings to which " antisemitism " is being irresponsibly stretched nowadays , it is fair that I ask myself the simple question : does my interest in Israel spring from hostility to Jews ?
Does some horrid antipathy towards them rise to the surface from my European bones whenever Israel is mentioned ?
I am obliged to entertain the thought .
But delving into my deepest heart , I cannot honestly say that I am more hostile to Jews than I am towards Scotsmen and Welshmen .
And since normally , far from being hostile , I rather like the Scots , Welsh and Jews that I meet , antisemitism can hardly be the reason for my interest in the Israel - Palestine conflict .
That one is out of the window before we start .
Sorry .
There is another aspect to my relationship to Jews , however , which does significantly affect the interest I take in Israel .
I have many Jewish friends , I went to school with boys from Jewish backgrounds and consequently I do not think of Jews as being foreign .
It would be as absurd for me to call my Jewish friends foreign as it would to call my Quaker friends foreign ; they are as English as I am .
It is a religious category for me and nothing more , and quite rightly so .
The trouble is that Israel promotes itself as the state for all Jews , including – despite themselves – my friends .
And because some of my friends are Jews and it is therefore their country , it is in some subliminal sense my country too .
This produces a particular attitude towards Israel – it means that I do not think of Israel as truly foreign either .
It is foreign , of course , but not emotionally , not like Thailand or Uzbekistan , and I do not respond to it as I do to most other foreign states .
It is , emotionally , almost an English county planted on the Mediterranean shores .
Israel 's non-foreign status is amplified by the extraordinary support it enjoys in the corridors of power in Britain .
As many as 80 % of Tory MPs are members of Conservative Friends of Israel .
The same cannot be said for Conservative friends of Thailand or Uzbekistan .
So not only is it in effect an English county , but many of my rulers appear to be its devoted citizens , subjectively speaking .
All those shrill arguments over water or settlements , all that killing , all that fear and loathing , are not far away from me at all , no further away than Belfast .
So I judge this by domestic standards , not foreign ones .
I do not expect Israelis to behave like Burmese generals ; I expect them to behave like Englishmen , like my friends .
Supporters of Israel complain frequently and loudly that they are singled out for special attention and criticism .
What about your own country 's misdeeds , or China 's , they say ?
And they are right .
Israel is singled out for special attention .
The Tibetans scarcely get a look - in compared to the Palestinians .
The number of news items about Israel - Palestine has created a self - reinforcing cycle – my appetite for yet more items is whetted by each new article or drama .
All of which would appear to vindicate the complaints of the pro-Israel lobby – except that they should consider how they themselves contribute to this .
One reason why Israel is singled out for so much attention is because its supporters are so very vociferous , pushing their agenda at every opportunity .
As a consumer of news , the speed of their responses and their sheer ubiquity inflames my interest and my antipathy .
Why do they persist in trying to defend the indefensible ?
Another reason for my disproportionate interest in this conflict is that I feel I have been lied to , and I feel that people are still trying to lie to me and I do n't like it .
Why try to convince me that those Turkish activists on board the Mavi Marmara were terrorists ?
Whatever else they were , they patently were not that .
If the word " terrorist " is to have any meaning at all it must refer to those who attack innocent civilians .
From an Israeli propaganda perspective , silence would be better than lies .
I can remember a time back in the 1960s when I accepted a view of Israel as a plucky little state full of kibutzes busily taming the desert .
At that time I had scarcely heard of the Palestinians .
Then I discovered the other narrative .
My purpose here is not to go into the rights or wrongs , but to point out that if Israel had been described to me from the start as the product of remorseless expropriation of some else 's land ( not the full story , I know ) , I might well have lost interest by now .
But having been told how heroic and wonderful it was and then to find out that , at the very least , there is a different and more troubling story running in parallel , that affects me emotionally .
When I see Binyamin Netanyahu and his colleagues putting their side of some event , I do not see honest men and my emotions are the same as those I experience when I see burglars and con-men – distaste and disapproval .
And yet they wo n't shut up .
I am not sure where all this leads , all these millions of us from both sides picking away at this particular scab .
The sheer number taking so much passionate interest is in itself dangerous .
Dogs must bark before they can bite .
This relatively small conflict has the potential to destroy on a colossal scale .

The economic downturn has left more Americans with the daunting prospect of fighting court battles without a lawyer .
A growing number of people have found themselves in court facing costly financial proceedings such as declaring bankruptcy , fighting foreclosure and litigating employment fights .
Adding to the challenge , for many :
The high cost of legal representation often prompts them to go it alone .
Jillian Edgar of Brooklyn , N.Y. , is one example .
The 32 - year - old , who says she has been unsuccessfully looking for work since October , is fighting an eviction notice that claims she owes more than $ 2,800 .
Last week in Kings Country Housing Court , she said she did n't know the steps to take to qualify for free legal aid .
Still , she said , " I think I can handle myself . "
Her plan : to say that she withheld rent because her apartment had fallen into disrepair .
Legal experts say many people are likely losing claims and paying penalties they could have avoided with a lawyer at their side .
Litigants often do n't understand the sort of evidence they need to present in legal proceedings , said Florida state Judge Claudia Isom .
The UK Border Agency is to set up a £ 4 m " reintegration centre " in Afghanistan so that it can start deporting unaccompanied child asylum seekers to Kabul from Britain , the Guardian can disclose .
The terms of the official tender for the centre show that immigration officials initially hope to forcibly return 12 boys a month aged under 18 to Afghanistan and provide " reintegration assistance " for 120 adults a month .
Home Office figures show there are more than 4,200 unaccompanied child asylum seekers in Britain , with most being supported in local authority social services homes .
Those from Afghanistan are the largest group .
Of the 400 minors claiming asylum in the first three months of this year , almost half were Afghans .
A decision to start deporting Afghan child asylum seekers who arrive in Britain alone would amount to a major shift in policy .
Up until now , child protection issues and an undertaking that failed child asylum seekers would be returned only if adequate reception and care arrangements were in place for them on arrival have blocked returns .
The British plans form part of a wider European move to plan the return of unaccompanied migrant children to Afghanistan .
Norway has also announced plans to open a reception centre in Kabul .
Sweden , Denmark and the Netherlands are also reported to be preparing to return Afghan children to Kabul .
Home Office ministers backed a new EU action plan on unaccompanied minors last Thursday when justice and home affairs ministers met in Luxembourg .
The plan included support for countries of origin " creating reception centres that can provide care for minors when the family cannot be found " .
The development has sounded the alarm among refugee welfare and human rights organisations that the EU has given a green light to move ahead with deportations with too little being done to guarantee the safety of the children sent back .
Simone Troller of Human Rights
Watch said : " Before deporting vulnerable kids to places like Afghanistan , EU governments need to make sure it is in the children 's best interests . "
She said that the British government had circulated a policy paper on unaccompanied minors in February during a Brussels workshop that called for an " EU - wide presumption " that a child 's best interest was to return .
It also argued against formal safeguards such as guardianship as " immensely expensive to put in place " .
The details of the UK Border Agency tender document issued in March say the £ 4 m contract is intended to " provide reintegration assistance for Afghans whose return home is being enforced by the UK government because they have no right to remain in the UK " .
The terms of the contract say that 12 young Afghan males aged 16 and 17 are to be sent back a month .
They will be accommodated until they are 18 , with adults providing supervisory care .
The numbers imply that up to 150 teenagers would be sent back in the first year .
The centre will also provide reintegration assistance , including vocational training , business start - up grants and short - term accommodation for 120 deported adults each month .
A decision to start sending back 16 - and 17 - year - old asylum seekers to Afghanistan would also render academic many " age disputed " cases in which the UKBA claims adults are posing as children to avoid removal .
The immigration minister , Damian Green , said tonight : " No one should be encouraging children to make dangerous journeys across the world .
Therefore we are looking to work with other European countries , such as Norway , and valued international partners , such as Unicef , as well as the Afghan government , to find ways to help these young men and women in their home countries and to return those who are in the UK safely to their home nations with appropriate support once they arrive . "
The Refugee Council said ministers should urgently review the plans to start removing unaccompanied minors to countries that are not safe .
Its chief executive , Donna Covey , said : " There has been little said about how these children would be kept safe … if they have no family to whom they can be returned safely , should they be returned at all ?
There are serious questions to be raised about the quality of decision - making on the cases of unaccompanied children .
The money would be better spent improving the way that children 's claims are assessed , so that we can be sure we never put them in danger . "
Tattoonomics , Part I
According to a 2006 survey conducted by Pew Research , 40 percent of Americans between the ages of 26 and 40 have at least one tattoo ; 36 percent of those age 18 - 25 report having a tattoo .?
Only 1 in 10 people older people have a tattoo .?
( Only one person has a Freakonomics tattoo , as far as I know . )
These numbers are shocking to my economist brain .
Economists tend to like choices that are reversible .?
Whatever my preferences might be today , who knows what they will be a week , a year , or a decade later ??
I loved Adam
Ant when I was in high school , but I sure am glad that I did n’t tattoo his name on my forearm .?
The same would certainly hold with respect to tattooing the names of any of my ex-girlfriends on my chest .
So what makes tattoos so popular ?
One possibility is that people just enjoy them for their intrinsic beauty , just as they might enjoy a work of art in a museum .?
The frequency with which people get tattoos in places they can’t easily see ( in particular the lower back ) , makes me think this is n’t the primary answer .
Rather , it would seem that the irreversibility of tattoos must be at the heart of their popularity .?
The fact that tattoos are ( essentially ) permanent makes them very powerful signaling devices : the more costly it is to take an action , the more powerful the signal that action carries .?
If I get tattoos on my face that look like the ones that Mike Tyson has , it sends a strong message to society about me .
Who are tattoo - getters trying to signal to ??
Because tattoos are painful to get and close off some legitimate job - market opportunities , it is n’t hard to see why tattoos serve a purpose for people engaged in activities that make it likely they will eventually end up in prison .?
Most of the young people getting tattoos , however , are n’t on that path .?
Presumably they are mostly trying to signal something about themselves to potential mates .?
But it seems strange that a University of Chicago undergrad would want to signal , via a tattoo , that they are like the tough guy who ends up in jail .?
( An acquaintance of mine had a caduceus – the symbol of medicine – tattooed on his chest .?
He definitely felt it sent the right kind of message to girls at the beach .?
Just in case , though , he had it done all in blue ink , which is easier to remove . )
Maybe a tattoo is a signal that a person is wild , impulsive , and likes risk .?
I suppose those are traits I once would have sought in a woman , although they certainly would n’t be at the top of my list now !
Blog readers – tell me what I am missing .?
Is there a reason I should want a tattoo , or want my wife to have a tattoo ?
The U.S. Customs officer eyed Sang 's well - traveled South Korean passport .
" What is your purpose in the United States ? " she asked .
Sang said he was " on holiday " and would be going back to Korea in two weeks , yet agents still pulled him aside from the rest of the arrivals at Chicago 's O'Hare International Airport last November .
Bogged down with suitcases and jet lag , they filed into two lines , one for citizens and residents , one for foreigners — the chasm between " Welcome home " and " How long are you planning to stay ? "
Sang 's passport had five United States stamps in it from the last three years , and the airport interaction had become routine .
Sang would say he was on holiday , the officer would give him three to six months , and that would be that .
This time , however , he was led into a room with other travelers singled out for further interrogation , and , as two hours ticked by , Sang contemplated what he'd say .
Would he tell the truth ?
That his life forever changed when he chatted up Mark D. , a vacationing San Francisco bank executive , outside a restaurant in his native Seoul three years back ?
The encounter kicked off a series of trips between South Korea and San Francisco , chronicled in the photo albums Mark custom - designed online , each printed in a hardback book with its own message on the back cover : " It took 39 years to find you and now that I have , I will do everything and anything I can to make you smile everyday . "
The photos show Mark ( a graying ringer for Supervisor Bevan Dufty when wearing sunglasses ) next to a buff Korean who could pass for 15 years Mark 's junior instead of three .
You see them smile in Union Square .
At a spa in Marin .
At Caesar 's Palace in Vegas .
In June 2008 , they donned their best suits and married at San Francisco 's City Hall , something unfathomable in Korea , where Sang 's family still thought he was living in the United States with a woman .
So would Sang tell the immigration officer that Mark was back in their Richmond District apartment at that very moment , ready to pick him up at the airport for their latest spin around the leaving and re-entering carousel of the last two years ?
No , telling the truth would be self - sabotage .
So when the stern officer walked into the room and loosed a barrage of questions , Sang did the worst thing he could possibly do .
He lied .
" Are you married or are you single ? "
" Single . "
" According to our records and your crossings , you have spent 19 1/2 months in the United States out of the last 22 months , and less than three months outside of the United States , is that correct ? "
" Yes . "
" Why do you spend so much time in the United States ? "
" Traveling . "
" Where do you stay in the United States ? "
" At my friend 's place . "
" What 's your friend 's name ? "
" Mark D. " ( Mark 's and Sang 's names have been changed for this story . )
" Is Mark D. married ? "
" No , he 's not married . "
Sang provided the officer with Mark 's cell number , and the woman left the room .
She called Mark and continued the interrogation :
Where does Sang stay ?
What does he do ?
Are you married ?
Mark said he was .
He did n't think twice about answering truthfully .
He thought they 'd followed the law to the letter ;
Sang always left the country before the deadline Customs allotted him .
The officer hung up and returned to Sang .
After more questions , she left the room a second time to call Mark .
" Sang says you 're not married , so who 's lying ? "
Mark recalls her asking .
Mark realized there was a big problem .
Still , he saw it as a situation in which neither of the men was lying .
" My marriage is not recognized by the federal government , " he replied .
" Excuse me ? "
" My marriage is not recognized by the government . "
" Are you married to Sang ? "
" Yes . "
" That 's all I needed to know , " the officer said , hanging up and returning to the room where Sang was sitting with his nerves fraying .
Sang was trapped .
" Just a few minutes ago , I spoke with Mark and he admitted you were his husband .
Is this correct ? " the officer asked .
" Yes . "
After Sang said he lied because he was scared , the agent revoked his tourist visa for misrepresenting himself to a federal immigration officer and for being an immigrant ( which technically means someone intending to stay in the country ) not in possession of an immigrant visa .
To reapply for a visa in the future , he would have to apply for a waiver for fraud .
What she did n't say is the only way to get a waiver is to prove his absence would cause " extreme hardship " for his spouse in this country — and , of course , in the eyes of the U.S. government , Sang does not have a spouse .
" Is there anyone you 'd like to call ? " she asked .
" Just Mark . "
When Mark answered , Sang wept .
He spent the night in a holding area and boarded a flight back to South Korea the next day .
U.S. immigration law prioritizes family unity .
Marrying a citizen is still the most common way to get residency , and everyone knows there are more than a few scam marriages squeaking through .
Yet for gays , it 's a very different story .
Since federal law only recognizes marriages between men and women , gay partners are left with no way to sponsor each other to stay in the country .
Now that Arizona 's " papers please " law has pushed immigration reform to Washington 's front burner , Democrats propose allowing " permanent partners " to be treated the same as spouses under immigration law .
While 19 countries have similar policies , it wo n't be an easy sell :
The gay lobby fears they 'll be sacrificed as a bargaining chip to get Republicans on board , while pro-immigrant groups worry that adding in gays will ruin any chance for reform for everyone else .
While critics say letting permanent partners through the gate invites fraud — how do you validate the relationship without a marriage license ? — others say the current system is what encourages people to cheat .
So what do you do when the law wo n't permit you to be with the most meaningful person in your life ?
Is transhumanism taking over television ?
Amidst the usual glut of talent shows and procedural dramas , we ’ve seen a growing number of shows that explore the boundaries of science , artificial intelligence , and human advancement .
We recap the past season ’s forward - looking TV shows so you can get caught up on Hulu or DVD , and which ones you ’ll be seeing more of in the fall .
Battlestar Galactica ( Sci -Fi )
The popular post - apocalyptic series about humans on the run after their homeworlds are destroyed by the Cylons – mechanical and biological androids created by humans – has addressed sociopolitical issues aplenty : warfare , religion , classism , the role of the democratic process in times of crisis , and the paranoia that results when enemy looks just like you .
But the Cylons are more than a metaphor for terrorism .
Their ability to download themselves into fresh bodies allows them to experience and learn from death .
And since most Cylon models exist as multiple copies with the same appearance and base programming , many humans question their capacity to act as individuals .
Finally , while some Cylons seek to bridge the gap between man and machine , others resent and resist taking on human qualities , believing biology is their only obstacle to transcendence .
Status :
It ’s over .
After four seasons , the battle between Cylons and humans came to a close , but we have n’t seen the last of their struggle .
Sci-Fi has greenlit Caprica , a prequel series that details the creation of the Cylon race .
Better Off Ted ( ABC )
In this corporate satire , Ted Crisp ( Jay Harrington ) heads up the research and development department at international megacorporation Veridian Dynamics , acting as a liaison between Veridian ’s brilliant but socially awkward researchers and its shadowy executives .
Though the executives often abuse their research staff to an absurd degree , they earnestly believe that science can accomplish just about anything .
Need to cryogenically freeze one of your employees ?
Grow meat in a lab ?
Weaponize a pumpkin ?
At Veridian Dynamics , no innovation is impossible .
Status : Renewed .
Better Off
Ted ’s first seven episodes did n’t fare well in the ratings , but critical buzz will keep us in jet packs and octochickens for at least another season .
Chuck ( NBC )
Chuck Bartowski ( Zachary Levi ) is an underachieving college dropout until his former roommate encodes his brain with the US government ’s greatest secrets , transforming Chuck into the Intersect , a human spy computer .
Most of the technology in Chuck has been one - note .
Chuck uses the information from the Intersect to protect US interests .
Or rival spy agencies try to find the Intersect or create one of their own .
But the second season finale saw Chuck encoded with an upgraded version of the Intersect , one that not only contains factual information , but also has imbued the formerly bumbling computer geek with superspy skills and abilities .
Status : Renewed .
Floundering ratings and a big production budget had NBC dragging its feet in deciding whether to renew Chuck .
Fan support helped secure a third season , albeit a stripped - down one ; NBC only ordered 13 episodes and wants to cut the series ’ supporting cast .
Dollhouse ( Fox )
Attractive young people who have run afoul of the mysterious Rossum Corporation sign themselves over to become “ actives , ” programmable servants of the Dollhouse .
While the actives ’ original personalities and memories sit in a hard drive on the shelf , their bodies are programmed with new memories , personalities , and abilities to serve the Dollhouse and its clients .
But when Echo ( Eliza Dushku ) , the Dollhouse ’s most popular active , begins to become self - aware , it raises questions as to whether even the Dollhouse can truly erase a person .
Dollhouse creator Joss Whedon wants us to consider whether the actives are any more exploited than anyone else in our society , but the most fascinating aspect of the series is how the Dollhouse uses its actives .
The dolls frequently provide companionship or perform illegal activities for Dollhouse clients ..
And with the actives infused with other people ’s memories , the possibilities are endless .
In one episode , a deceased woman has her consciousness posthumously downloaded into Echo ’s body so that she can witness her own funeral and solve her own murder .
In another , a troubled girl meets an older version of herself so she can see a better possible future .
And since the brain can be programmed with traits like loyalty and discretion , anyone may be an active , even the Dollhouse ’s own employees .
Status : Renewed .
A rocky first few episodes combined with a Friday night timeslot contributed to dismal ratings , but strong streaming and DVR numbers convinced Fox that Dollhouse was worth another second go - round .
Plus , it turns out Fox executives themselves are rather fond of the high - concept drama .
Eleventh Hour ( CBS )
In this remake of the British series of the same name , Jacob Hood ( Rufus Sewell ) is a special science adviser to the FBI who investigates abuses of science that have stumped other authorities .
He discovers illicit experiments in human cloning , neurological and physiological enhancement , genetically modified organisms , and cryogenic preservation .
Unfortunately , the researchers in these fields are generally portrayed as unscrupulous at best and Mengelian at worst , and their experiments frequently result in widespread death and destruction .
In response , the Biotech Industry Organization has set up EleventhHourFacts.com , a blog that demystifies the so - called “ mad science ” so overly dramatized in the show .
Status : Canceled .
CBS has never been terribly thrilled with its anti-science show , and it has n’t helped that Eleventh Hour scored only average ratings , despite a prime time slot right after CSI .
Fringe ( Fox )
After her partner and lover is killed by a skin- melting bioagent , FBI agent Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) begins investigating the Pattern .
It ’s a series of bizarre occurrences that can only be explained by “ fringe ” sciences – such as teleportation , psychic abilities , pyrokinetics , and supersoldier programs .
( Fringe , in fact , employs a mix of far out , fringe " science " and real radical scientific developments , reflected in the buzzwords that flash across the screen during the opening credits : " Science .
Psychokinesis .
Transmogrification .
Teleportation .
Precognition .
Dark matter .
Nanotechnology .
Genetic Engineering . " )
Need to cryogenically freeze one of your employees ?
Grow meat in a lab ?
Weaponize a pumpkin ?
Agent Dunham teams up with Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) , a mentally unstable scientist who did pioneering work in many fringe fields , and his brilliant estranged son Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) to determine who is behind the experiments .
It ’s all apparently linked to a secret bioterrorist society that believes technological advancement will lead to our destruction , a leading research company , and a brewing interdimensional war — but like X Files , which seems to be something of a reference point here — things are not always what they seem .
For Fringe , fringe science is the cause of these crimes , but it ’s also often the only way to solve them and prevent more people from coming to harm .
Olivia and Peter are often willing subjects of Walter ’s experiments , temporarily enhancing themselves with machines and / or hallucinogens to get to the truth .
Status : Renewed .
Although it initially drew mixed reviews and inconsistent ratings , singularity - fearing biohackers proved a big audience draw making Fringe the top rated new series among adults .
This guaranteed a second season , which will feature Leonard Nimoy as a dimension - hopping scientist .
Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ( Fox )
Sarah ( Lena Headey ) and John Connor ( Thomas Dekker ) try to prevent the development of Skynet — the artificial intelligence that will some day declare war against humanity — and even scarier , propel Arnold Schwarzenegger into superstardom .
With the help of Cameron ( Summer Glau ) , a reprogrammed Terminator , Sarah , John , and their allies try to determine and halt the events that lead to Skynet ’s creation while fending off Terminators , the killer robots sent back in time to stop them .
While never skimping on the action and mysteries , The Sarah Connor Chronicles also explores the fine line between humans and artificial intelligence .
When a malfunction causes Cameron to lose her memories of her life as a Terminator , she believes that she is , in fact , the human resistance fighter she was modeled after .
And she seems to be developing warm fuzzy feelings for John .
A fearsome T - 1001 apparently overseeing the creation of Skynet ends up learning far more than she ever wanted .
And when the first AI comes online , he ’s not a cold and murderous computer system ; instead , he ’s a curious and childlike creature — an eager student of human nature .
At the same time , John Connor is affected by his experiences with machines ; his increasing dependence on Cameron will convince him to make Terminators a significant part of the future resistance .
Status : Canceled .
Fox paired Sarah Connor with Dollhouse in the ratings Siberia that is Friday nights , but come renewal time , the Terminator series did n’t fare as well as its dance partner .
So , for the time being , the only place we ’ll see John Connor battle the machines is on the big screen .

Health - care reform getting more , not less , popular
I got an e-mail from the House minority leader 's office this morning linking me to their new report , " Obamacare : Three Months of Broken Promises . "
" Three things are abundantly clear about President Obama ’s new health care law three months after it became law , " explained Michael Steel , a spokesperson for John Boehner .
" First , the American people remain squarely opposed to it .
Second , it is off to a rocky start , having failed to live up to specific promises made by President Obama and Washington Democrats .
Third , Republicans have listened to the American people , heard the rising public backlash against the new law , and offered better solutions . "
I have n't read the report closely yet , so I 'll reserve comment on it .
But by coincidence , I had been looking at some of the polling on health - care reform moments before the report landed in my inbox .
A USA Today / Gallup poll that came out this morning showed that 49 percent of Americans think the Affordable Care Act is a " good thing , " while 46 percent think it 's a " bad thing . "
This poll comes on the heels of an Associated Press - GfK poll showing the same movement .
So that 's two recent polls showing a lift in the bill 's popularity , taking it from a slight plurality in opposition to a slight plurality in favor .
Two polls is enough to make me curious , so I headed over to Pollster.com , and it does seem we 're looking at a trend .
The site 's aggregate chart of recent polls does n't yet show support overwhelming opposition , but it does show support rising and opposition falling .
In fact , the bill 's spread looks better than at any point in the past year .
Check it out :
I 'll take a longer look at Boehner 's report later today , but it does n't seem , at this point , that the American people " remain squarely opposed " to the bill , or that there 's " a rising backlash . "
Public opinion remains mixed , and the trend is toward support , not opposition .
Image caption Stella Rekiec later admitted she fed the baby the frankfurter
A woman who fed a nine - month - old baby a piece of sausage , despite being told not to by the boy 's mother , has been jailed after he choked to death .
Patryk Bialek died at Westgate Crescent , Slough , Berkshire , after being given the piece of frankfurter by Stella Rekiec in May 2008 .
She was at a party at the house when the boy 's mother went out .
When the mother returned her son was choking .
Rekiec was convicted of manslaughter and jailed for 18 months .
Lying motionless
The 28 - year - old , who used to reside at the address but now lives in New Malden , south - west London , was sentenced at Reading Crown Court .
Police said on the evening of Patryk 's death , the four occupants of the house , including Rekiec and the boy 's parents , held a small party in Rekiec 's room .
The boy 's mother left to go to the shops but returned about 15 minutes later to find her son lying motionless on the bed and choking .
She attempted to resuscitate him , but he died later in hospital .
Rekiec later admitted that she had fed Patryk the sausage , despite being previously warned not to by his mother .
Det Sgt Emma Brown , of Thames Valley Police , said : " Any loss of life is sad , but the death of a young child in such circumstances is particularly tragic .
" Our thoughts remain with Patryk 's parents . "
I enjoyed drawing this herd of food scientists .
If you want to blow your mind regarding crazy food ingredients , read this book .
You will never look at snack cakes the same way again .
Inspired by my love of Cuban foods , I make this steak often , and its robust flavor is like a predator with your tongue as its prey .
I do n’t mean to imply that it is overpowering , but the strong lime flavor blends with the beefiness of the skirt steak , and the combination announces itself clearly upon arrival .
Skirt steak is a particularly fatty and flavorful cut , so it holds up well to the lime , and remains juicy even after an assault on the grill and then the pan ( if you choose to finish the steak the way I do ) .
This is perhaps the best way to serve this cut of meat and anyone who tells you otherwise is probably a vegetarian .
Ingredients
1 lb skirt steak
3 limes
3 garlic cloves , pressed or grated
N.B. Limes can be difficult to juice so one thing I have been known to do is buy bottled lime juice and use 6 tablespoons of that instead .
With the garlic and meatiness of the steak , no one will notice the difference .
Directions
1 . Cut the skirt steak into pieces small enough to easily fit in a bowl or plastic bag .
2. Combine all ingredients in a covered bowl or plastic bag and allow the steak to marinate for at least 2 hours ( I marinate as long as 8 hours with no problems ) , moving the pieces around occasionally to ensure that the lime juice gets to all the sides of the steak .
3 . Remove the pieces of steak , however there is no need to scrape any of the garlic pieces that stick to them , they are very flavorful when cooked .
The meat is then preferably cooked on a grill for maximum flavor , however I just as easily broil the meat in the oven .
For those who are not interested in adding to the work load , the cooked meat can be served .
However I like to take one additional step .
4. ( Optional )
Cut the steak into strips and quickly fry them in a pan with a little bit of oil to make them nice and crispy on the edges and then serve .
Serves 2 and goes really well with yuca , garlic mashed potatoes , or plantains ( sweet or savory ) .
This dish goes so well with a Cuban Mojo sauce that it ’s just mean not to try it .
It ’s so good , I sometimes pretend we ’re related .
The capstone of the program , and its most controversial element , came in eight three - hour seminars devoted to “ Ulysses . ”
The novel , published in 1922 , had been banned as obscene in the United States until 1933 and its reputation for difficulty outlived the ban .
The Bell students “ found it a challenging , and often exasperating , experience , ” Baltzell wrote .
But , prepared by months of reading that had ranged from the Bhagavad Gita to “ Babbitt , ” the men rose to the challenge , surprising themselves with the emotional and intellectual resources they brought to bear on Joyce ’s novel .
It was clear as the students cheered one another through their final reports that reading a book as challenging as “ Ulysses ” was both a liberating intellectual experience and a measure of how much they had been enriched by their time at the institute .
At the end of the 10 - month course , an anonymous questionnaire was circulated among the Bell students ; their answers revealed that they were reading more widely than they had before  if they had read at all  and they were more curious about the world around them .
At a time when the country was divided by McCarthyism , they tended to see more than one side to any given argument .
What ’s more , the graduates were no longer content to let the machinery of business determine the course of their lives .
One man told Baltzell that before the program he had been “ like a straw floating with the current down the stream ” and added : “ The stream was the Bell Telephone Company .
I do n’t think I will ever be that straw again . ”
The institute was judged a success by Morris S. Viteles , one of the pioneers of industrial psychology , who evaluated its graduates .
But Bell gradually withdrew its support after yet another positive assessment found that while executives came out of the program more confident and more intellectually engaged , they were also less interested in putting the company ’s bottom line ahead of their commitments to their families and communities .
By 1960 , the Institute of Humanistic Studies for Executives was finished .
As the worst economic crisis since the Depression continues and the deepening rift in the nation ’s political fabric threatens to forestall economic reform , the values the program instilled would certainly come in handy today .
We need fewer drifting straws on the stream of American business , and more discontented thinkers who listen thoughtfully to both sides of our national debates .
Reading “ Ulysses ” this Bloomsday may be more than just a literary observance .
Think of it as an act of fiscal responsibility .
NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana ( AFP ) Ã¢â‚¬â€ œ BP faced a broadening crisis Tuesday with tar balls from the Gulf oil spill turning up on Texas beaches , as the firm ’s clean - up costs soared and British officials reportedly mulled a possible BP collapse .
A giant Taiwanese ship deployed to boost the clean - up meanwhile remained in testing , with initial results inconclusive because of choppy waters , and bad weather on the horizon threatened to further disrupt clean - up efforts .

The A Whale tanker cruised near the Deepwater Horizon oil spill but Bob Grantham , a spokesman for the super - skimmer ’s owner , TMT Shipping , said results were “ inconclusive in light of the rough sea state we are encountering . ”
Grantham said the company , working with the US Coast Guard , would continue testing the ship “ to make operational and technological adjustments ” for the supertanker .
The ship is believed to be able to suck up to 500,000 barrels ( 21 million gallons ) of oily water a day through its “ jaws ” , a series of vents on the side of the ship .
By comparison , more than 500 smaller vessels in 10 weeks have only managed to collect some 31.3 million gallons of oil - water mix between them .
The tar balls found in the surf in Galveston , Texas , were tested and determined to be from the BP spill .

But officials stressed in a statement it was not clear if they drifted hundreds of miles from the site of the well that ruptured April 20 , triggering the disaster , or if they fell or leaked from a ship carrying collected oil to Texas for processing .
Some 492 miles ( 792 kilometers ) of US shoreline across the five Gulf states — Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , Florida and now Texas — have been oiled by the disaster .
Oil sheen and tar balls were spotted Monday near the mouth of Lake Pontchartrain , the lake near New Orleans that flooded disastrously during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .

The oiling prompted response crews to unfurl 600 feet ( 200 meters ) of boom to prevent more oil from sullying the estuary .
BP said its latest estimate showed the costs to the British energy firm had risen in the past week .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The cost of the response to date amounts to approximately 3.12 billion dollars , including the cost of the spill response , containment , relief well drilling , grants to the Gulf states , claims paid , and federal costs , ” BP said .
BP ’s share price has collapsed more than 50 percent since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig it leased sank on April 22 , two days after a blast that killed 11 workers .
After intense pressure from President Barack Obama over the worst ever US environmental disaster , BP agreed last month to suspend its shareholder dividend and create a 20 - billion - dollar fund for costs arising from the spill .
ADVERTISEMENT
BP is also selling non-core assets to raise 10 billion dollars , while international ratings agencies have downgraded the company ’s credit worthiness .
Britain was also reported to be working on crisis action in case BP is ruined by the costs of coping with the spill .
Talks with officials from the British government ’s Department for Business and the Treasury show mounting concern that the company could collapse , according to a report Tuesday in The Times , which did not cite its sources .
“ It is not clear how bad this will get , but the government needs to be prepared for any eventuality , ” said a person familiar with the talks quoted by The Times .

Nearly a week after Hurricane Alex swept through the region , bad weather continued to hamper the clean - up .
But the National Hurricane Center warned Tuesday that a new low - pressure system over the Yucatan peninsula and the Caribbean Sea and heading into the Gulf of Mexico had a 30 - percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours .
Although there was no direct hit from Alex , this year ’s first major Atlantic storm provided a reminder of the urgent need to clean up an oil disaster surpassed only by Iraqi troops ’ deliberate release of crude in Kuwait during the 1991 Gulf War .
The ruptured well a mile ( 1,600 meters ) down on the seafloor has now spewed somewhere between two and four million barrels of oil into the Gulf .
ADVERTISEMENT
The current containment systems can only capture or flare some 25,000 barrels of oil a day , a number set to double when a third vessel is expected to be in place on Thursday .
It will likely be mid-August at the earliest before the ruptured well is permanently capped by injecting mud and cement with the aid of relief wells .
Real News Network report of police violence against peaceful protesters on June 26 , 2010 .
By Judy Rebick
June 27 , 2010 -- Rabble --
For people sitting at home and watching TV news last night , Toronto was burning .
The same police car on Queen St West burned and blew up over and over again .
The same image of a young man very violently smashing Starbucks windows appeared over and over again .
Windows smashed all along Yonge Street .
None of us had ever seen Toronto like this .
It was shocking .
Most of the 400 protesters arrested last night and others who may have avoided arrest did n't see that violence .
From their perspective , they were facing a violent police state .
These demonstrations , militant but overwhelming peaceful , were resisting the right of the police to hold them to Queen Street .
They think the people have a right to protest in a place where political leaders can hear them .
They had nothing to do with torching police cars or trashing windows .
TVO host Steve Paiken was down at the Novotel last night with peaceful protesters .
He tweeted his experiences , " Shame on those that ordered peaceful protesters attacked and arrested .
That is not consistent with democracy in Toronto , G20 or no G20 . "
I was on Queen West and Spadina when the trouble started .
David Fernandez has written an excellent report on what happened on his facebook page .
Rewind to just before the riot happened , thousands of us marched in a very briskly moving group until we hit the intersection of Spadina and Queen .
Folks from the labour movement tried in vain to encourage the march to move back up towards queens park , but the mood was clear .
Many thousands of protestors were interested in being closer to the summit and letting the police know that we could n't be intimidated .
But nothing official was planned .
Labour walked back up the street leaving thousands to mill about in the confusion of what to do next .
And in that confusion , several hundred people changed their clothes and took off together running down queen street while thousands of riot cops picked their noses .
In full police view , they let a mob destroy banks and trash Yonge Street .
And while riot cops had shields AND bikes and thousands of dollars in body armor to protect them from the remaining peaceful protestors , somehow they were so scared of us that they abandoned police cars .
The police spokesperson told Metro Morning today that they waited until later when it was safer to make arrests but that can not be true .
I was there and like David I believe the cops could have arrested the Black Bloc right at the beginning of the action but they abandoned their police cars and allowed them to burn , not even calling the fire department until the media had lots of time to photograph them .
They had a water cannon but they did n't even use a fire extinguisher .
Why ?
A comment released to a media outlet last night from official police spokesperson tells some of the story , " We have never tried to curtail people 's rights to lawfully protest .
All you have to do is turn on the TV and see what 's happening now .
Police cars are getting torched , buildings are being vandalised , people are getting beat up and the so - called ' intimidating ' police presence is essential to restoring order .
That is the reality on the ground . "
Police playing politics , justifying the expense and responding to the critiques building all week about excessive and arbitrary police powers .
A politicised police force is unacceptable in a democratic society .
There are serious questions that must be answered and they have not been satisfactory answered .
People were shocked last night by a city out of control but the Toronto police -- without all the huge expenditures , extra police from across the country and sophisticated new toys -- have kept the peace in riots with a lot more people and in hundreds of demonstrations much larger and often angry .
I disagree with torching police cars and breaking windows and I have been debating these tactics for decades with people who think they accomplish something .
But the bigger question here is why the police let it happen and make no mistake the police did let it happen .
Why did the police let the city get out of control ?
And they did let it get out of control .
The police knew exactly what would happen and how .
Christopher
Watt was there when the first police car was torched ,
The officers clustered and formed a line .
A second picket of officers lined up behind them , facing the crowd where I stood .
They started to move , but they were n't clearing the street ; they were clearing out and abandoning two police cars , including the one with the shattered windshield ...
In moments like this , someone needs to make a decision .
This time it was a man in dreadlocks and no shirt , red paint all over his torso .
He moved towards the police car , grabbing the squawking police radio ...
Following the lead of the dreadlocked man , someone else pulled what looked like a leather folder from inside the car and spread its contents over the trunk .
A kid wearing sunglasses , his face covered by a scarf , inspected the paperwork .
Soon after , the squad cars would be on fire .
( The gas cap appeared to have been removed from one of them even before the crowd moved in . )
It was a perfect storm .
A massive police presence who were primed for " dangerous anarchists " after a week of peaceful protests .
No more than one hundred , probably fewer , young men who think violent confrontations with the police will create a radicalisation and expose the violence of the state .
A new generation of young people who are becoming activists believing they live in a democratic society and are shocked by the degree of police violence arrayed to stop them .
But it is the police that let the handful of people using Black Bloc tactics run wild and then used the burning police cars and violent images as a media campaign to convince the people of Toronto that the cost and the excessive police presence was necessary .
They knew what would happen and they knew how it would happen .
It is the police that bear the responsibility for what happened last night .
They were responsible for keeping the peace and they failed to do it .
G20 police let rioters run amok and then struck back hard at all activists
By David Langille
June 27 , 2010 -- Rabble --
Alongside my neighbours from the Danforth area , I joined the large march on Saturday afternoon [ June 26 ] on the first day of the G20 Summit in Toronto .
We felt proud to be there alongside more than 10,000 other Canadians -- women , trade unionists , students , teachers , people of all ethnicities and backgrounds -- demonstrating our commitment to peace and social justice .
We passed by hundreds and hundreds of police without an incident .
Soon afterwards , while catching a meal on the patio at Fran 's Restaurant on College Street , we heard glass breaking on Yonge Street , and saw a mob of about 150 coming around the corner , hurling chairs into windows .
Someone threw a bottle through a window showering me in broken glass .
What was most striking was that there were not any police in sight .
Evidently this group had started rioting on Queen Street over half an hour earlier -- where the police drove one of their cars into the middle of the group then abandoned it .
It was soon set on fire -- making a great photo op .
The group proceeded up Yonge Street smashing windows all the way up Yonge Street , at least eight blocks , without being stopped by police .
There were reported to be 19,000 security people on duty , and a senior officer told me they had 7000 police .
As an academic and an activist , I have participated in numerous demonstrations in Canada , the United States , Europe and South America , and I have never seen such a dereliction of duty .
Normally , there are buses full of riot police right in the downtown core , ready to move at a moment 's notice .
The police knew that they should focus their energies on the Black Bloc , especially so late on Saturday afternoon .
But when the rioters came smashing their way up the main street of Toronto , the police disappeared for half an hour .
It would appear that the security forces allowed this riot to happen in order to justify the $ 1 billion which appeared to have been wasted on security measures in Huntsville and Toronto .
They must not be allowed to discredit those of us who protested peacefully .
We must hold this government responsible for wasting $ 1 billion dollars on security measures , and then trying to justify it by allowing people to riot .

Mass arrests , the security state and the Toronto G20 summit
By Socialist Project
June 28 , 2010 -- The Bullet --
The massive police presence in Toronto this week has been officially justified on the basis of protecting the leaders of the G8 and G20 countries meeting in Huntsville and Toronto .
We were told that the creation of the fenced - in fortress , the massive mobilisation of police ( estimates ranging from 10,000 - 20,000 ) from across Canada , and even the passing of a secret law on policing ( by the executive of the Ontario government without reference to the Legislative Assembly and the opposition parties ) that made it a crime to appear within five metres of the security fence would protect our right to protest as well .
This is not what has unfolded in Toronto over the June 25 - 27 weekend .
Thousands of protesters marched peacefully on June 25 , challenging the purpose and agenda of the G20 , although completely hemmed on all sides by thousands of heavily armed police over the entire march ( and severely hampering the freedom of assembly ) .
On June 26 , in the midst of a larger demonstration ( estimated at between 10 - 25,000 ) , organised by the labour , anti-privatisation and peace movements , a series of unwarranted acts of vandalism by a small number of protesters against stores , vehicles and buildings , was used as an excuse for a massive unleashing of repression and attacks by police against the democratic rights of both protesters , and Torontonians as a whole .
( Like what happened at the Montebello Summit of North American leaders in August 2007 , it will come out over the next weeks how widely the police had infiltrated some of the key groups – especially the so - called Black Bloc , knew the planning and participated as agent provocateurs . )
There seemed to be no real efforts on the part of the police to stop the attacks on the stores .
As well , none of the massive police contingents tried to stop some of this small group from burning three of their police vehicles .
It was as if the police were n't all that concerned with these actions .
Reporters from European broadcasters and newspapers reported that this was totally out of keeping with any real concern to prevent violence .
The police then unleashed waves of repression against the legitimate protesters , those who wished to push toward the security fence – in an effort to challenge the militarisation of the streets and demand that the G20 leaders respond to concerns about austerity and attacks on poor and working people – those who were simply voicing their concerns about the G20 agenda ( with its radical austerity agenda of having the public sector and the poor pay for the bailout of the banks ) , journalists and even innocent and curious bystanders .
In one attack on a “ free protest ” zone ( previously negotiated with the police ) rubber bullets and tear gas was used , and people were indiscriminately taken down , beaten and arrested .
In all , by June 27 estimates were that some 500 people were arrested ( and there have been hundreds more over the course of June 28 ) ; it is impossible for anyone to know how many of these were the instigators of violence and how many were people simply exercising their right to protest .
But clearly the mass majority were only protesting and exercising their rights to assembly and free speech , which the Toronto police and the wider security forces have been systematically violating .
The temporary jail that protesters have been placed in is located at the old Toronto Film Studios on Eastern Avenue in the eastern edge of the downtown , converted into a series of cages in essentially a huge warehouse .
The jail is described by inmates as a kind of Guantanamo North : cold , dirty and especially humiliating for those who were said to have refused arrest .
People have been held for hours without recourse to legal representation , of which there has been a large legal team at hand .
Protesters hoping to provide some type of support for those incarcerated , have themselves been attacked , tear - gassed and dispersed by police violence .
Listening to the mass media and the interviews with the police and security spokespeople for Toronto and the Canadian state , one would have thought that there was full scale rioting , and that the massive , billion dollar spending spree on security for the summit – that angered people across the country – was somehow worth it .
As part of this , all protesters are being demonised and the police are being portrayed as heroes , notably by the political leadership and the Mayor of Toronto , David Miller .
The message of the protests ( and of the thousands who protested across the week at hundreds of talks , meetings , protests , cultural events ) – that the G20 meeting reflected the underlying agenda of the corporations and the political elites , to make sharp cutbacks across the public sector , to impose wage cuts , to not raise significant ( or any ) new taxes on financial capital and to impose new forms of hardship in the form of higher taxes and cuts in benefits for working people and the poor – was to be drowned out in a demonising of the entire project of the protest .
That is , that the ruling classes in the G20 were doing everything in their power to have the working classes pay for the crisis and their project of re-constructing neoliberalism and the political hegemony of the banks and financial capital .
The police and much of Toronto 's political and economic establishment , sought to use the incidents to change the entire discourse of the G20 week .
Socialists , of course , take their distance from the foolish acts of the few who confuse violent attacks and trashing with revolutionary politics .
This is to substitute individual acts of dissent for the working class and the mass movement as a whole .
It is the adventurism that calls forth the most violent features of the security and policing apparatuses of the state , catching hundreds of innocents in the wake , and helps justify to the endless expansion of the security state .
To challenge the neoliberal globalisation agenda of the G20 , and overturn all the undemocratic exploitative relations of capitalism , we need to build a political movement in Canada , based among the working classes who do n't earn their income from capital ownership , and who also are oppressed by the unequal relations of race , gender , sexuality and nationality .
At this moment , it is a point of fundamental solidarity to denounce , as forcefully as possible , the police repression being unleashed against G20 protesters .
We insist that those incarcerated on Eastern Avenue have their full civil rights restored and that civilian authorities take control from the Toronto Police Services of oversight of these proceedings .
They have proven incapable of protecting – and understanding – basic civil rights ( starting from the special emergency powers asked for by Police Chief Blair , and granted by stealth by Premier Dalton McGuinty ) .
The accused should immediately be released without charge , or be freed on bail and given the right to defend themselves in open courts ( not the kangaroo courts with limited or no public access that have been operating over this week ) .
The police occupation of Toronto should end immediately , and our full civil rights – and especially our rights to our city and streets – be restored .
There clearly will need to be a full and independent investigation about the role of the police in the violence of the last few days , the role of agent provocateurs and plants in the planning of these events and the astonishing violation of the rights of ordinary people and protesters alike on the streets of Toronto over the last week .
There ’s a reason why that anti-gravity hallway effect in Inception looks so amazing .
It ’s because that shit is real .
No CGI .
It ’s a giant rig that rotates 360 degrees and it must have cost a fortune .
It ’s another example of how and why Christopher Nolan is this generation ’s James Cameron .
Like Cameron , Nolan insists on spending millions of the studio ’s money on creating real , physical spectacles , sometimes for only a single shot .
This is why those aerial IMAX shots in The Dark Knight looked so amazing ; those were n’t sets , they were real skyscrapers in Chicago and Hong Kong .
When we see Batman riding his batpod motorcycle …it ’s real .
They did n’t just hand off the scene to a bunch of animators .
A team of engineers spent months ( and a batload of Warner Brothers ’ cash ) designing and building a new vehicle that a stuntman could actually drive .
Let ’s be clear : they invented a vehicle .
For .. one scene ?
Yes , for one scene ( okay , two and a half scenes , geeks ) .
That ’s dedication .
And vision .
And obsession .
And hubris .
The same qualities that the truly great filmmakers possess .
In a summer movie season filled with under - performing sequels , remakes and reboots , there ’s a strong lesson here for the bean counters .
A dedication to excellence and veracity is the kind of thing that builds trust in an audience and , over time , will sustain the career of Christopher Nolan while the directors of the assembly lines that pump out the sequels and remakes and reboots fade into obscurity .
You will always know that when you go to a Christopher Nolan movie , you ’re getting a big ride , unlike any other , made with tons of smarts and passion and no skimping on budget or scale .
Just like James Cameron or Steven Spielberg , at their best .
That ’s why the latest featurette ( UPDATE : EMBED BELOW ) on the making of Inception rocks my world .
Still , always dreaming ,

A sobering report circulating in the Kremlin today from President Medvedev ’s meeting with other World leaders at the G8 summit in Muskoka , Ontario states that President Obama has warned his counterparts that the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster “ will most likely kill millions , perhaps tens of millions ” of people during the coming year .
Fueling Obama ’s dire assessment of this “ Gulf Apocalypse ” , this report says , are the oil and toxic rains now being reported to be falling throughout the US Gulf Coast region due to the fracturing of the Gulf of Mexico seafloor allowing untold millions of gallons of oil and millions of cubic feet of methane gas to escape unchecked into our World ’s seventh largest body of water , not to mention the millions of gallons of dangerous disbursements being used that is poisoning everything in its path .
So dangerous has the Gulf Coast environment become to human beings the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) issued a warning that , in part , says : “ People , including pregnant women , can be exposed to these chemicals by breathing them ( air ) , by swallowing them ( water , food ) , or by touching them ( skin ) .
If possible , everyone , including pregnant women , should avoid the oil and spill - affected areas . ”
With nearly 20 million American ’s living along the affected Gulf Coast region one wonders where they could all go and leaving many to speculate a massive evacuation is being planned by the US Government of the entire region .
This view , however , is not shared by a Louisiana woman named Kindra Arnesen who was allowed unprecedented access to the BP Operations Center overseeing this catastrophe and reported to the Gulf Emergency Summit this past week that along with millions of fish dying because of this disaster people are falling ill all over the region .
Even worse is Arnesen ’s incredibly reporting that even as this oil disaster grows BP is being allowed the US government to begin cutting costs in their cleanup and oil containment efforts .
Important to note about in this report is that Obama ’s warning that “ millions could die ” from this disaster has been further confirmed by the American engineer who helped lead the team to put out the Persian Gulf oil fires set by Saddam Hussein in the first Iraq war and had warned a full 12 months before the April sinking of the Deepwater Horizon that BP was drilling into a huge methane deposit that if released would be beyond catastrophic , it would be biblical in its scale of destruction .
Note : Along with the unprecedented danger facing the Americans due to this oil spill catastrophe it is important to remember the billions of dollars being made from it by some of the most powerful people and corporations in the West , and as we had reported on in our June 16th report titled “ Obama To Earn Nearly $ 85 Million From Gulf Oil Disaster ” .
Interesting to note too is that one of the World ’s top oil and gas industry experts Matthew Simmons is calling for the evacuation of the entire US Gulf Coast , and as we can read as quoted by him in an interview with the Washington Post News Service : “ We ’re going to have to evacuate the Gulf States .
Can you imagine evacuating 20 million people ?
. . .
This story is 80 times worse than I thought . ”
Now the “ 80 times worse than I thought ” comment by Simmons is one of the most vitally important points to understand in this unfolding historic disaster due to the findings of the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) high - tech research ship Thomas Jefferson , and as we can read as reported by the Los Angeles Times News Service :
“ The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Monday released new data from the agency ’s latest research trip through the Gulf of Mexico , showing concentrations of oil below the surface at more than 3,600 feet below the surface , about 7.5 nautical miles southwest of the BP ’s blown - out well .
The Thomas Jefferson research ship found evidence of depleted oxygen , a potential sign of microbes digesting oil , in the area .
Acoustic and fluorometric instruments likewise indicated the presence of oil .
Water samples taken on the trip have not been analyzed .
Since the leak began April 20 , attention has been focused on surface oil washing up on environmentally fragile shoreline ecosystems .
But “ plumes ” or “ clouds ” of oil hovering in the water column below the surface , where myriad marine life eat , breed and swim , has as much or more potential to cause ecological damage to the Gulf , scientists have warned . ”
Not being explained to the American people about NOAA ’s findings is that the live video feed of this spill being shown to them of this spill contains oil and methane gas being expelled at pressures estimated to be at 100,000 pounds per square inch ( psi ) and cannot in any way being associated with the massive underwater oil plumes found by the Thomas Jefferson nearly 8 kilometers away .
To where these massive underwater oil plumes are coming from , Simmons stated during an interview on the US television network MSNBC that the release point was “ 5 to 6 miles away ” from where the Deepwater Horizon sunk .
In our June 10th report “ Scientists Warn Gulf Of Mexico Sea Floor Fractured “ Beyond Repair ” we reported that Russian scientists ( the only scientists to have actually viewed this disaster in their deep submersible submarines ) had likewise confirmed Simmons dire assessment of this catastrophe ; reports , mind you , that not only have we seen , but Simmons has undoubtedly seen too .
Most incredibly in all of these events is that Obama has issued what many experts are calling a “ get out of jail free card ” to BP in the setting up of a $ 20 Billion “ sham ” cleanup fund paid for by this British oil giant that allowed them to borrow from Goldman Sachs the entire amount and not affecting their bottom line for years , if not decades to come .
To the greatest consequence of this catastrophe upon the American people , an FSB appendix to this report warns that the US Soldiers currently deployed throughout their island territory of Puerto Rico are in fact being trained in how to “ suppress and contain ” large concentrations of people and being “ recycled ” to military bases throughout the State of Florida where they will soon be joined by an estimated 28,000 NATO allied troops where both will join up with an estimated 7,000 pre-positioned UN marked vehicles for purposes “ still not known or clearly stated by the US ” .
To the greatest danger facing the American people it comes from the founder of the psychoanalytic school of psychiatry Sigmund Freud ’s nephew Edward Bernays , the father of the field of “ public relations ” and propaganda , who said that news was made “ when reality is distilled down to the most simplified and dramatized form and it appeals to the instincts of the public mind . ”
Unfortunately , the “ instincts ” being instilled in these Americans “ public mind ” is going to kill them as there is NOTHING to be simplified about this catastrophe , and what they are n’t being told by their so called mainstream media , or what they are n’t willing to find out for themselves , is going to kill them .
Just like all of those who cleaned up the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill disaster , ALMOST ALL OF WHOM ARE NOW DEAD .

So be still , Pikmin fans .
Your day is coming .
It 's just not today .
Before the world of television and the internet … before SpongeBob Squarepants , Facebook , and Twitter shaped our lives , there were things called “ books ” and they were arguably the most influential form of entertainment around .
They taught children lifelong lessons about cultural mores , right and wrong and were one of the most important tools in shaping a young person ’s mind .
But for all today ’s handwringing of overexposure to violence and sex , we tend to ignore the amount of antiquated ignorance contained in books that are still categorized as classics and are still on current reading lists for young people .
Some racist depictions from the classics were included deliberately to evince outrage and empathy .
But we ’d argue that these characters , some over 100 years old , have since had the opposite effect on society of what the author intended and instead , are the inspiration for many of today ’s stereotypes .
5. Little Black Sambo
Appears in : The Story of Little Black Sambo by Helen Bannerman
What ’s the plot ?
A black - skinned little boy outwits a pack of tigers , and turns them into butter .
Why all the fuss ?
While the story is n’t overtly racist , the title character ’s name “ Sambo ” was turned into a racial slur that many find just as offensive as the N - word .
The character is actually a dark - skinned Indian , not an African - American .
However , the illustrations that accompanied the story looked a lot like blackface minstrel show performers .
In 1932 Langston Hughes criticized Little Black Sambo as a typical “ pickaninny ” storybook which was hurtful to black children .
4. N*gger Jim
Appears in : The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain
What ’s the plot ?
Huck Finn runs away from home and befriends Jim , an escaped slave .
Why all the fuss ?
Well , Jim is sometimes called “ N*gger Jim ” in the book .
While he is actually a well - formed character , some schools have banned the book for using the N - word .
“ The people whom Huck and Jim encounter on the Mississippi ” — Russell Baker wrote in the New York Times in 1982 — “ are drunkards , murderers , bullies , swindlers , lynchers , thieves , liars , frauds , child abusers , numskulls , hypocrites , windbags and traders in human flesh .
All are white .
The one man of honor in this phantasmagoria is ‘ Nigger Jim , ’ as Twain called him , to emphasize the irony of a society in which the only true gentleman was held beneath contempt . ”
3. The Africans
Appears in : Tintin in the Congo by Hergé
What ’s the plot ?
Tintin , a young Belgian reporter , visits the Congo where he meets native Africans who are amazed by his “ magical ” powers .
And then Tintin blows up a rhino with a stick of dynamite .
Why all the fuss ?
“ It makes people think that blacks have not evolved , ” said Bienvenu Mbutu , a Congolese man living in Belgium who wants the book to be banned in Belgium , home of Tintin ’s creator .
Meanwhile , English bookstores are required to sell the book with a warning sticker after the Commission for Racial Equality condemned the book .
In the book , Africans are depicted as monkey - like and are shown treating Tintin , who is white , like a god .
Tied for 1st place : The Uncle Tom , and The “ Happy ” ( aka Lazy , Carefree ) Darky
Both appear in : Uncle Tom ’s Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe
What ’s the plot ?
A long - suffering slave is sold , meets new people on his journey through life , and is savagely murdered .
Basically one of the most depressing as well as offensive stories ever written .
Why all the fuss ?
Many people argue that nearly every negative black stereotype can be found in this book , and that it even was the original source for several of them .
Today , an Uncle Tom is now one of the most offensive terms you can call an African - American in today ’s world .
It implies that a person has no self - respect as they would do anything to get in the good graces of the white folks .
The “ happy darky ” depiction of blacks being lazy and carefree has , in my opinion , done more damage to our race than any other stereotype that can be brought to mind .
Believing that a person is lazy and having no worries about the future is somehow due to the natural inclination of their culture or a race is nefarious .
I have no doubt that it ’s one of the single most damaging labels that have been put on black people .
Even in “ post - racial ” 2010 and with a black US President , we still ca n’t seem to shed it fully .
In the meantime , it can be argued that well - developed and fairly portrayed characters from African - American books abound but for whatever reason they have never reached cultural meme status .
The old question , ironically , seems more pertinent than ever :
When will we overcome ?
Caracas , Venezuela , June 24 , 2010 ( venezuelanalysis.com ) -- The President of the General Assembly of the United Nations , Ali Abdessalam Treki , heaped praise on Venezuela on Wednesday for the progress it has made in reaching the UN Millennium Development Goals .
Speaking about the report he received from the Venezuelan National Institute for Statistics regarding the progress the country has made on the goals , Treki said : “ What Venezuela has achieved with regards to the Millennium Development Goals should serve as a model for all other countries . ”
The report from the institute states that Venezuela has already achieved a great majority of the goals with five years to spare .
Treki added : “ We appreciate very much the leading role Venezuela has played ” in “ promoting the Millennium Development goals . ”
Venezuela signed up to the Millennium Development Goals at a UN summit in 2002 along with 188 other countries , according to which each nation would do all it could to reach eight social goals by 2015 .
The goals are to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality and empower women , reduce child mortality , improve maternal health , combat HIV / AIDS , malaria , tuberculosis and other diseases , ensure environmental sustainability , and develop a global partnership for development .
All signatories to the agreement were obliged to develop policies to achieve the objectives .
Venezuela ’s health and education programmes , known as “ missions , ” which the Chavez government began to introduce in 2003 , have virtually wiped out illiteracy and improved health indicators across the board and this has made the government untroubled by the challenge of reaching the development goals .
Back in 2005 , then Venezuelan vice - president Vicente Rangel said the country would reach the targets three years early , that is , in 2012 .
This year , almost 46 percent of the government ’s budget is allocated to social spending such as health and education .
Treki also praised Venezuela for its progress in fighting the illegal narcotics industry and for its efforts to build relationships between Latin America and Africa .
UN General Assembly President meets President Chavez
Treki also met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez where they discussed the democratisation of the United Nations , an issue central to the Venezuelan president ’s objective of a fairer and more multilateral international system .
Treki said that they had worked on the “ necessity to introduce democratic change in the international organization and in the Security Council . ”
“ We both agree that the UN General Assembly has to be given an important role in order to change the world . ”
“ We will continue with our efforts and dialogue to try and achieve a just and free world without misery and need , ” he said .
In a speech to the United Nations in September 2006 , Chavez criticized the UN system and called for its “ re-establishment . ”
He said that the General Assembly was a mere “ deliberative organ ” where the leaders of nations came once a year to listen to each others ’ speeches , but that it had no power because the real power is in the security council and the vetoes of its six permanent members .

Though Guanajuato officials say that “ no woman in Guanajuato has been jailed for an abortion ” , an activist in Mexico says that 6 women are currently serving 25 - 30 years for murder because they had abortions .
The 6 women are three to eight years into their sentences and all poor and uneducated .
Veronica Cruz , director of a women ’s rights center , El Universal , says that another 160 women are facing the exact same murder of a family member charge , and that out of the 6 women serving their sentence , 2 were raped and that “ All the men that got them pregnant abandoned and accused them . ”
Though Guanajuato is very conservative , it leads the country in teen pregnancies .
And in 2000 officials tried to rid the country of the rape exemption for abortion .
And a recent profile of Cruz in More notes that in Guanajuato :
“ A woman who ’s been impregnated by a rapist and cannot afford a private abortion must petition the state for a publicly funded one — and it has denied every request since 2001 .
One woman was told by an attorney that although she was within her rights to obtain an abortion , no one would perform it ; often hospitals send rape victims away .
And some women who ’ve given birth to stillborn babies have been imprisoned because officials charge them with a failed abortion . ”
Which forces the question , what ’s going on in ?
Most of the indicted women are n’t just back - woods US teens that hump , get knocked up , lose the kid and move on .
These women are being forced to have sex and the consequence is not only emotional , physical and mental brutality , but they will have to live with losing the child they decide to abort .
Do n’t you think it is too much then to add jail time in excess of 30 years .
It is a very sad situation these women are put in , and most of it is because of sick , sick men who not only control them in sex , but control the outcome of jail and abortion rights .

The images can be found after the jump here on Elder - Geek.com or on the GameInformer website .
Though many of the images were published earlier or had been featured in the GameInformer magazine , the images show many of the new features and changes that have been made with regard to the previous installment in the series from 2008 .
Most importantly , several images of the new types of enemies that will be found in the game are shown .
The images also feature several new weapons , such as the sawed - off shotgun and a more classic rendition of the Lancer - rifle .
This rifle is also shown as being used in a mounted turret .
Additionally , several new in - game characters are depicted , such as Anya Stroud and a character known as Jace , who was introduced in one of the graphic novels associated with the series .
All of the main characters from the previous Gears of War- installment have received a new look , which is also shown on the images .
Gears of War 3 is expected to be released in April 2011 .
When I 'm talking to people from outside Washington , one question inevitably comes up :
Why is the media so liberal ?
The question often reflects a suspicion that members of the press get together and decide on a story line that favors liberals and Democrats and denigrates conservatives and Republicans .
My response has usually been to say , yes , there 's liberal bias in the media , but there 's no conspiracy .
The liberal tilt is an accident of nature .
The media disproportionately attracts people from a liberal arts background who ...

INTRODUCTION
There have been lots of excitement about the Nexus One ’s OLED display .
In this series of articles Dr. Raymond Soneira , President of DisplayMate Technologies , and I dive into a scientific analysis of the Nexus One display .
First , let ’s go through some of the major websites touting the OLED display on the Nexus One :
The Nexus One is slim and curvaceous , and the OLED display is just stunning .
–cnet The 3.7 - inch , 800×480 AMOLED screen is undoubtedly the best we ’ve seen on an Android phone yet , delivering crisp and bright colours and much less glare than the LCD efforts found on HTC ’s older Android handsets and , of course , the iPhone .
As a result , your eyes wo n’t start going squiffy after a few hours squinting at it .
– Electricpig
Even though the screen is the same size and same resolution as the Droid , it ’s noticeably better .
The colors are much more vibrant and the blacks are blacker , as evidenced by putting both side by side and hitting up various websites and loading various games .
The pinks on Perez Hilton and the blues on Gizmodo just popped a lot more on the N1 , and made the Droid ( which was actually considered to have a great screen ) seem washed out .
The same feeling carries over when you compare the Nexus with the iPhone 3GS .
And it ’s pretty damn bright , compared to the other two phones .
This is probably the best screen we ’ve seen on a smartphone so far .
– Gizmodo Different users may have different initial impressions on placing the AMOLED side - by - side with a more traditional backlit LCD screen– Ars Deputy Editor Jon Stokes found the AMOLED to be a striking improvement , but to me it first came off as dark and underwhelming .
However , upon extended use , I have to say , this is better . …
The brightness gamut is excellent . …
The OLED screen also has a much better viewing angle than a traditional LCD screen ; this could be important for some car dock setups .
Overall , I do n’t think I ’d trade this screen for the brighter Droid screen , or any other non-OLED screen .
– Ars Technica
Although the Motorola Milestone has a screen with the same size as the Google Nexus One ’s – 3.7 inches – and a few extra pixels ( 854×480 , to the Nexus One ’s 800×480 ) too , the Nexus One ’s panel still outclasses it .
That ’s because it uses a different type of display , AMOLED , which many tip to be the next big thing in mobile .
We ’re not going to argue with them : it makes the Google Nexus One ’s screen look absolutely glorious .
Photos do n’t quite do it justice , but take our word when we say the colours the screen produces are deeper and richer than on any previous Android phone .
– Fonehome The OLED screen on the Nexus One is spectacular–blacks looked inky black .
Next to an iPhone and Motorola Droid , the colors on the Nexus One were vivid .
– PCMag
As you can see everybody loves the OLED display in the Nexus One .
This particular OLED display makes use of a special PenTile Matrix sub - pixel structure developed by Clairvoyante and now Nouvoyance .
I had the pleasure of meeting Candice Brown Elliott , Founder and CEO of Nouvoyance , Joel Pollack , Sr. VP of Strategic Sales and Marketing , and Tony Botzas , Director of System Apps and Engineering , at their Cupertino location on February 3rd .
The meeting was prompted by my post Nexus One Pentile Matrix OLED Display where I argued that the 3.7 - inch OLED display in the Nexus One did not have a “ resolution ” of 800×480 but rather a much less 533×480 .
After two and a half hours I came out with a new - found appreciation for what Nouvoyance has achieved : Â Candice and her team have developed a deceptively elegant display system based on a deep understanding of human biology and psychology as they relate to vision .
And in doing so has enabled a high - resolution OLED display requiring a simpler manufacturing process and lower costs .
Let ’s get to the issue of whether the PenTile Matrix used in the Nexus One has a pixel format of 800×480 or not .
The answer is complicated .
And the reason is because we are dealing with the human visual system , which involves not just the biological functions of the eyes but the connections they have with the brain and how the two interact .
I do not pretend to be an expert in this regard but the one thing I do know is that our visual system is brilliantly complex .
We wo n’t get into that here .
What 800×480 really means is 800xRGBx480 and that in turn means there are 800 horizontal pixels and 400 vertical pixels and within each pixel there is a Red , Green , Blue sub - pixel .
But how does 800×480 apply to a sub - pixel structure that is different ?
Therein lies the difficulty .
Now we have to move away from discrete hardware specifications to vision .
The Video Electronics Standards Association ( VESA ) has a method to measure resolution especially when comparing displays with different sub-pixels .
The VESA Display Metrology Committee has a definition for resolution in Section 303 - 7 of Flat Panel Display Measurements Standard Version 2.0 :
… the number of alternate black and white lines that can be displayed with a stated minimum contrast modulation .
I would include : … that can be displayed and viewed …
The minimum contrast modulation is 50 % , but what in the world is contrast modulation ?
… the difference between the white - line luminance and black - line luminance divided by the sum of the white - line luminance and the black - line luminance .
Hmm …
I think the easiest way to think about this thing called resolution is this : the resolution is dependent on the number of black and white lines , either horizontal or vertical , with a certain level of contrast , meaning you need to be able to visually differentiate the black and white lines .
So , let ’s move from vision back to hardware specification : does the Nexus One ’s PenTile Matrix OLED display have a resolution equivalent to a 800xRGBx480 ?
The answer is : yes , it does .
The PenTile Matrix OLED display is the result of combining our understanding of vision biology and psychology .
The result enables the manufacture of an OLED display sporting a resolution equivalent to the very best that LCD technology can offer and does not cost much more to manufacture .
Unfortunately technology ’s first generation is almost always wrought with imperfections .
Samsung Mobile Displays ( SMD ) takes the brilliance of PenTile and makes it into a 3.7 - inch OLED display .
But that ’s just the display .
In the case of the Nexus One the SMD - manufactured OLED display is then integrated by HTC .
Google ’s Android smartphone OS is then mated to that hardware with software running on top of the OS .
So how did Nouvoyance , SMD , HTC and Google do with the Nexus One ?
Let ’s find out .
COLOR & IMAGE QUALITY
The PenTile Matrix OLED display used in the Nexus One uses 16 - bit color .
Most high - end smartphone displays make use of 18 - bit color plus dithering to emulate 24 - bit .
The red and blue on the Nexus One have only have 32 possible intensity levels ; the green has 64 .
Because screen colors are the result of mixing the red , green , blue the colors on the Nexus One are coarse , inaccurate , exhibit noticeable false contouring , and have a green & magenta tints in images .
The iPhone ’s TFT LCD makes use of 18 - bit color plus dithering with 256 possible intensity levels for all three red , green , blue colors , resulting in smooth images and photographs .
The Nexus One has a high resolution , equivalent to a 3.7 - inch 800xRGBx480 TFT LCD .
Although resolution ( pixel density ) is much higher on the Nexus One compared to the 3.5 - inch 480xRGBx320 pixel format on the iPhone 3GS , colors are over - saturated , grayscale was inaccurate and there are display artifacts , probably resulting from processing errors in hardware , firmware , software or all of them .
Google and HTC decided to incorporate a fairly high - pixel count image sensor for the camera and it seems something was n’t finely tuned enough .
The Android OS seems to be employing some sort of pixel scaling to fit the entire OLED display resulting in poor image quality .
As I have often said in previous posts any type of scaling , even when done well , deteriorates quality , but the initial scaling algorithm used in the Nexus One produces dropped pixel content , color fringing , and moirÃ©s .
The Nexus One was compared to a calibrated professional Sony studio monitor using a large set of DisplayMate Calibration and Test Photographs .
All of the photos on the Nexus One exhibited gaudy color especially in common objects such as fruits , vegetables , flowers , grass and even a can of Coca - Cola .
Color and intensity false contouring and noise from excessive processing were present in many of the photographs .
Initially , the over - saturated images on the Nexus One might look punchy and vibrant but over time these images will certainly become unpleasant .
A recommendation might be to make use of the ambient light sensor to control gamma , color gamut , color saturation , and edge enhancement in addition to display brightness .
If the OLED display was judged in comparison to LCDs used in smartphones , it would rank among the worst we have ever seen in a shipping product .
The poor integration among display hardware , the Android OS and software in addition to sub-standard factory color and grayscale calibration are to blame .
For a high - end smartphone like the Nexus One that require high performance in regards to rendering photographs , video and web content this lack of quality control is surprising and not acceptable .
The OLED display in the Nexus One looks like a prototype and these are the reasons why :
Rough edges
Buggy display drivers
Poor image processing
Poor system integration
Low quality factory display calibration
Google , HTC , and Samsung Mobile Display has delivered a high - end “ superphone ” with the Nexus One incorporating an unique display using the PenTile Matrix OLED display system .
But they have a lot of work ahead of them to make sure the next version ( the Nexus Two ? ) addresses all of these problems in the display .
DISPLAY TEST RESULTS
This section explains all of the measurements incorporated in the article .
All measurements were made using DisplayMate Multimedia Edition for Mobile Displays to generate the analytical test patterns together with a Konica Minolta CS - 200 ChromaMeter , which is a Spectroradiometer .
All measurements were made in a perfectly dark lab to avoid light contamination .
All devices were tested with their backlight set for maximum brightness with the light sensor - based automatic brightness control turned off , and running on their AC power adapter with a fully charged battery , so that the battery performance and state was not a factor in the results .
For further in - depth discussions and explanations of the tests , measurements , and their interpretation refer to earlier articles in the DisplayMate Multimedia Display Technology Shoot - Out article series and the DisplayMate Mobile Display Shoot - Out article series .
Peak Brightness : 229 cd/mÂ²
Peak white luminance is the maximum brightness of the display .
In the case of the Nexus One it was 229 cd/ mÂ² .
This level is adequate for normal indoor ambient light settings but will make it difficult to read outdoors .
Black Level Brightness : 0.0035 cd/mÂ²
Almost all displays exhibit a dark gray instead of true black and LCDs are especially prone to this .
Since OLED is an emissive technology the display on the Nexus One produces black that is very close to true black and was too low to measure with the CS - 200 , so Konica Minolta loaned us its flagship CS - 2000 Spectroradiometer , which measured the black level brightness at just 0.0035 cd/mÂ² .
In a dark ambient setting the Nexus One ’s OLED display looks ridiculously amazing .
Contrast Ratio : >45,800:1
At greater than 45,800: 1 the Nexus One ’s OLED display exhibited an incredible contrast ratio , the highest DisplayMate has ever measured .
Any contrast ratio over 5,000: 1 is only visually significant with dark image content in dark ambient light settings .
Screen Reflectance : 15.5 %
The screen reflectance on the Nexus One was a relatively high 15.5 % and among the highest that we ’ve measured for mobile devices .
This is not good .
Screen reflectance is the most important specifications for a mobile display .
The display reflects a certain percentage of the surrounding ambient light that adds to the screen background and washes out the display .
The higher the screen reflectance the harder it is to see the display .
This becomes more problematic in high ambient light environments .
The screen reflectance measurements were done in accordance with VESA FPDM 308-1 , Reflectance with Diffuse Illumination , using an integrating hemispherical dome and a calibrated diffuse white reflectance standard .
High Ambient Light Contrast Rating : 15
Contrast rating measures display contrast in high ambient environments and is the ratio of peak brightness to screen reflectance .
Higher values mean the display is easier to see in bright environments .
The Nexus One ’s contrast rating is a low 15 , which means the OLED display is difficult to see in high ambient light environments .
Dynamic Color and Dynamic Contrast : Colors Blown by 28 %
Dynamically adjusting color and contrast based on an internal automatic image processing algorithm is a good idea but extremely difficult to do right .
Dynamic color and contrast control frequently distorts images and at the least this should be an option that can be turned off if the results are not satisfying .
On the Nexus One dynamic color and contrast control seems to be implemented and blows out color by 28 % .
WHAT ’S UP NEXT
In the next several days Dr. Raymond Soneira and I will be adding more interesting results from the Measurements and Test Pattern Tests for the Nexus One :
Part Ib : Color Temperature and Chromaticity , Color Gamut , Intensity Scale and Gamma
Part Ic : Brightness Decrease with Viewing Angle , Contrast Ratio Shift with Viewing Angle , Color Shift with Viewing Angle
Part Id : RGB Display Power Consumption , OLED and LCD Spectra

NETHERLANDS 2-1 SLOVAKIA , Durban , 28/06/10
Robben 18 , Sneijder 84 ; Vittek 90+4 ( pen )
The Netherlands bided their time before doing enough to dispose of Slovakia , and potentially set up a Quarter - Final clash with Brazil .
Slovakia started the game brightly , with Erik Jendrisek firing just over the bar only 66 seconds into the game .
However it was one of Slovakia ’s only good chances of the half , as the Netherlands ’ tactics consisted of holding the ball and patiently waiting to break down the defence , while snuffing out any infrequent Slovakian attempts .
Although it was a tactic that was not very exciting for the neutral , it proved effective in the 18th minute when the Netherlands took the lead .
Arjen Robben , starting his first game since picking up an injury against Hungary over three weeks ago , was on the end of a long ball from midfield , cut inside two defenders and fired the ball into the bottom corner from outside the box , giving the Netherlands a great advantage : in each of the Last 16 matches at this World Cup so far , the team that scored first has ended up going through to the Quarter Finals .
Despite both teams ’ efforts to score there were very few decent efforts on goal from either team in the first 45 minutes , as both teams went in at half - time knowing that the result was far from set in stone .
Both teams started the second half much better with Robben nearly scoring again from a nearly identical position , and Robert Vittek trying to pull one back for Slovakia .
But it was the Netherlands who should have scored next , as a shot from 8 yards away was blocked by the face of Slovakian goalkeeper Jan Mucha .
And the Dutch goalkeeper , Martan Stekelenburg , was n’t having an easy time either .
In the 67th minute a Miroslav Stoch effort was aimed full speed towards for the roof of the net , only for Stekelenburg to tip it over , followed shortly by another great save , this time from a Vittek shot from the edge of the box .
But despite all of Slovakia ’s chances to equalize they could n’t get the ball in the net , and they paid for it in the 84th minute .
Martin Skrtel conceded a free kick on the half - way line , which was taken quickly and hit forward for Dirk Kuyt .
Mucha misjudged the pass and found himself in no man ’s land when it found Kuyt , who laid it off to Wesley Sneijder to fire into an empty net , and ensure a Dutch victory .
However Slovakia had the chance to score a consolation goal in extra time when Stekelenburg was judged to have brought Martin Jakubko in the box , which he received a yellow card for .
Vittek stood up to take the penalty and converted it confidentally , his shot on goal being the last kick of the game .
The Netherlands are now one more victory away from equaling the all - time record for consecutive UFWC title defences , curently held by Scotland with 20 .
Their next title match will be on July 2nd , where they will face either Brazil or Chile in the World Cup Quarter Finals .
( CNN ) --
A representative for Natalee Holloway 's mother who paid $ 25,000 for information on the whereabouts of her remains last month was an undercover FBI agent , a federal law enforcement official told CNN .
However , the FBI and the U.S. attorney 's office in Birmingham , Alabama , said Wednesday that the FBI did not supply the money .
" Some news accounts have suggested that the FBI provided $ 25,000 in funds that were transmitted to van der Sloot .
This is incorrect .
The funds involved were private funds , " the FBI and U.S. attorney 's office said in a statement .
An Interpol document says van der Sloot faces criminal charges in Alabama because he allegedly tried to extort money from Holloway 's mother .
U.S. authorities filed extortion and wire fraud charges against van der Sloot this week .
The FBI and U.S. attorney 's office in Birmingham arranged for a meeting where van der Sloot was paid $ 10,000 in cash and another $ 15,000 in a wire transfer for information van der Sloot allegedly promised would lead to Holloway 's body in Aruba , a source familiar with the case said .
The meeting took place in May , according to the U.S. attorney 's office in Birmingham .
Interpol documents show that the $ 15,000 was transferred to a personal bank account in the Netherlands .
The information van der Sloot provided to the FBI was not true , according to the documents .
It 's unclear if that money funded van der Sloot 's trip to Colombia and into Peru , where authorities said he confessed this week to killing 21 - year - old Stephany Flores Ramirez .
Members of Flores ' family told CNN they knew days ago that the FBI had paid van der Sloot .
" We really do n't have anything to say about it or what could have happened if we knew this information , " said brother Enrique Flores , speaking by phone from Peru .
" It wo n't make any change today .
Her mom is praying every day .
We are not having contact with a lot of people .
We want to be left alone . "
Although the investigation involving alleged extortion had been in motion for several weeks at the time of Flores ' death , " it was not sufficiently developed to bring charges prior to the time van der Sloot left Aruba , " the FBI statement said .
" This is not due to any fault on the part of the FBI or the U.S. attorney 's office , where agents and prosecutors were working as hard as possible to bring the case to fruition when they learned of the murder .
A case based on events outside of the United States is a complex matter , and work was proceeding with all deliberate speed to prepare the evidence , the charges and the necessary procedures to obtain custody of van der Sloot , " the statement said .
Van der Sloot , a Dutch citizen , was twice arrested in connection with the 2005 disappearance of Holloway but was released for lack of evidence .
This week Alabama authorities filed extortion and wire fraud charges against van der Sloot .
On or about March 29 , van der Sloot contacted a representative of Holloway 's mother , Beth Holloway , say Intepol documents .
That came as a shock to Natalee Holloway 's father Dave Holloway .
CNN spoke with his attorney Vinda de Sousa in Aruba Wednesday .
" He did n't know about it ... and he just did n't have very much to say about it because he was not involved , " the attorney said .
In exchange for payment , van der Sloot showed a person -- described in Interpol documents as Beth Holloway 's representative -- a house in Aruba where supposedly Holloway 's remains were located .
When records showed that the house was n't even built at the time of her disappearance , van der Sloot admitted he lied , Interpol said .
Aruban authorities were involved in the FBI 's undercover investigation , Aruban government spokesman Taco Stein said .
" We did some technical work " and " worked together , " Stein said .

There are 230 varieties of peaches grown in California , freestone and clingstone , heirloom and newly developed , flavorful and bland , but when you go to the grocery store and even many farmers markets , they ’re usually sold just as “ peaches . ”
The identification of a fruit ’s variety is the single most important piece of information consumers have in deciding what it will taste like and whether to buy , but the era in which consumers could look for distinctive varieties by name — Fantasia nectarine , O’Henry peach , Santa Rosa plum — is rapidly passing .
Aside from apples and pears , most fruits are typically not identified by variety at markets , and have not been for years .
This is a problem not just for fruit connoisseurs but also for all consumers .
To give just one example , buyers often have no way to distinguish between yellow peaches with a traditional balance of sweetness and acidity and the low - acid varieties ; the latter may be preferred by some for eating out of hand , but they are virtually useless for cooking .
Until 2006 , the California Tree Fruit Agreement , the organization that sets standards for the state ’s shippers of peaches , nectarines and plums , required the specific variety to be identified on the carton .
But some growers and shippers found that they could not readily market certain varieties perceived by buyers as inferior , and so the CTFA now allows fruit to be shipped under generic designations such as “ yellow peach . ”
Dale Janzen , the organization ’s director of industry relations , estimates that only 30 % of shipments today name the variety on the carton .

There was a time when many of the stone fruit varieties grown around the nation had long lives and distinctive identities .
In recent decades , however , the interval between stone fruit variety generations has contracted to just 20 years , or even 10 , after which growers replace their trees with newer varieties .
Plus , supermarket produce managers , who now mostly have little in - depth knowledge of fruit , do n’t want to be bothered segregating batches by name .
Variety names could easily be printed on produce stickers , which instead have recently been filled with bar codes ; this may be convenient for self - checkout , but it gives a creepy industrial feel to the product .
For many fruit varieties , the true cultivar name , such as Cripps Pink apple , has been overshadowed by the same variety ’s marketing name , the Pink Lady .
Part of the reason is that patent protection of fruit varieties extends for only 17 to 20 years , but names used for marketing are protected indefinitely under trademark law .
Moreover , large growers and marketers are increasingly moving to a system that subsumes individual varieties in a series of cultivars that are marketed under the same name .
For example , Sun World has a line of plums of different varieties that all share purple - black skin and red flesh and are all marketed as Black Diamonds , from May to October .

This commercial nomenclature is convenient for marketers , but something has also been lost — the feedback mechanism that allows consumers to identify varieties that they like , and ask for them by name .
Both philosophically and practically , it ’s crucial to capitalism that good products be rewarded with increased demand and higher prices , and inferior ones fall by the wayside .
When a named variety delights consumers , they buy more , even if they have to wait until the following year ; the produce manager orders more from the wholesaler , who increases his order from the grower , who buys more trees from the nursery , who pays greater royalties to the breeder for devising the variety to begin with and is encouraged to come up with more such superior fruit .
Conversely , when inferior varieties are marketed generically , producers of inferior varieties piggyback on producers of better varieties .
In a pomological version of Gresham ’s law , bad fruit drives out good .
So why do n’t marketers sell by variety ?
All too often today , new varieties are bred to appeal to the lowest common denominator , to be inoffensive to the greatest number of people , so it suits the industrial distribution system when fruit is marketed anonymously .
When fruit quality is homogenized , variety is less significant ; in turn , anonymity deprives consumers of their main weapon to resist homogenization .

It does n’t have to be so .
The European Community requires that grapes , oranges , apples and pears be identified by variety at the point of sale , and the practice is common there for other fruits too .
There ’s no reason why American retailers should not respect consumers by empowering them to select by variety .
There is a downside to varietal transparency , however :
When shoppers become smitten with a superior variety , such as the Tulameen raspberry , they may demand it to the exclusion of others , even early or late in its season , when other varieties would actually taste better , notes Chad Finn , a berry breeder with the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
It can be difficult for consumers to make a fully informed decision , juggling the typical season for a variety , the geographical area where a batch is grown , the earliness or lateness of crops that year , etc .
Growers and marketers do n’t want consumers to get too attached to a variety by name , particularly for stone fruit varieties , which are often in season for just a week or two , before a new variety takes its place .
Similarly , they want to be free to replace obsolete varieties in the orchard and store , without consumers saying , “ Oh , you do n’t have Fantasia nectarines anymore , phooey on you . ”
You ’d think that farmers markets , celebrated for keeping alive unusual produce varieties , would offer a different dynamic , but all too often when vendors are asked for the name of the fruit they ’re displaying , they just say something like “ white peach . ”
Duh !
Occasionally , the farmer may not know the variety of an item because the trees were unnamed when he bought the farm , but more often the vendor is an employee who is uninvolved in farming or who ca n’t be bothered to list varieties .

Fitzgerald Kelly , a highly regarded vendor at the Santa Monica farmers market , takes an idiosyncratic approach to stone fruit nomenclature , bestowing his own whimsical monikers on series of similar varieties , such as Carmen Miranda for low - acid yellow - fleshed nectarines .
In some cases , he offers experimental selections from breeders and does n’t want to tip off competitors to what he ’s growing ; for all except old - fashioned high - acid varieties , customers do n’t care to know the specific name , he says .
Another high - quality grower , John Hurley , has sometimes sold intensely flavorful , hard - to - grow Snow Queen white nectarines ( in season now ) as generic white nectarines , which is like mixing Ferraris and Yugos .
When I pointed this out , he said , “ Oh , you ’re right , but I ’m so exhausted by harvest and driving down here that I often lose track of the varieties . ”
The culture is much different at upscale markets in the Bay Area , such as the Ferry Plaza and Berkeley markets , where most vendors make a point of identifying varieties — not because regulations require them to do so , but because it is seen as a shrewd marketing move .
Varietal identification is also indispensable to farmers market integrity .
A small but increasing minority of vendors are obtaining certified production certificates that state the number of trees they ’re growing but without naming specific varieties , making it much easier for those who are dishonest to buy or supplement their offerings with little fear of being caught .

What can be done to reverse the trend to anonymity , to return to a model in which fruits have names and people know and care about them ?
Here are three proposals .
Consumers can ask store managers and farmers market vendors to name produce varieties .
You do n’t have to boycott anonymous fruit , just favor vendors who do identify varieties .
Growers , packers and shippers should retract the veil of anonymity .
In the long term , it ’s to their economic advantage if consumers are informed and have a choice .
The cost is nugatory , and a satisfied customer is likely to buy more .
Finally , fruit industry leaders , regulators and politicians can pass and enforce regulations that require produce to be identified by variety at markets .
That ’s not so far - fetched , since a similar law went into effect last year requiring stores to identify the country where produce was grown .

Then we can finally let the best fruit win , and when it does , we ’ll know how to ask for it .

Batteries might gain a boost in power capacity as a result of a new finding from researchers at MIT .
They found that using carbon nanotubes for one of the battery ’s electrodes produced a significant increase — up to tenfold — in the amount of power it could deliver from a given weight of material , compared to a conventional lithium - ion battery .
Such electrodes might find applications in small portable devices , and with further research might also lead to improved batteries for larger , more power - hungry applications .
To produce the powerful new electrode material , the team used a layer - by - layer fabrication method , in which a base material is alternately dipped in solutions containing carbon nanotubes that have been treated with simple organic compounds that give them either a positive or negative net charge .
When these layers are alternated on a surface , they bond tightly together because of the complementary charges , making a stable and durable film .
The findings , by a team led by Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering Yang Shao - Horn , in collaboration with Bayer Chair Professor of Chemical Engineering Paula Hammond , are reported in a paper published June 20 in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
The lead authors are chemical engineering student Seung Woo Lee PhD ’10 and postdoctoral researcher Naoaki Yabuuchi .
Batteries , such as the lithium - ion batteries widely used in portable electronics , are made up of three basic components : two electrodes ( called the anode , or negative electrode , and the cathode , or positive electrode ) separated by an electrolyte , an electrically conductive material through which charged particles , or ions , can move easily .
When these batteries are in use , positively charged lithium ions travel across the electrolyte to the cathode , producing an electric current ; when they are recharged , an external current causes these ions to move the opposite way , so they become embedded in the spaces in the porous material of the anode .
In the new battery electrode , carbon nanotubes — a form of pure carbon in which sheets of carbon atoms are rolled up into tiny tubes — “ self - assemble ” into a tightly bound structure that is porous at the nanometer scale ( billionths of a meter ) .
In addition , the carbon nanotubes have many oxygen groups on their surfaces , which can store a large number of lithium ions ; this enables carbon nanotubes for the first time to serve as the positive electrode in lithium batteries , instead of just the negative electrode .
This “ electrostatic self - assembly ” process is important , Hammond explains , because ordinarily carbon nanotubes on a surface tend to clump together in bundles , leaving fewer exposed surfaces to undergo reactions .
By incorporating organic molecules on the nanotubes , they assemble in a way that “ has a high degree of porosity while having a great number of nanotubes present , ” she says .
Powerful and stable
Lithium batteries with the new material demonstrate some of the advantages of both capacitors , which can produce very high power outputs in short bursts , and lithium batteries , which can provide lower power steadily for long periods , Lee says .
The energy output for a given weight of this new electrode material was shown to be five times greater than for conventional capacitors , and the total power delivery rate was 10 times that of lithium - ion batteries , the team says .
This performance can be attributed to good conduction of ions and electrons in the electrode , and efficient lithium storage on the surface of the nanotubes .
In addition to their high power output , the carbon - nanotube electrodes showed very good stability over time .
After 1,000 cycles of charging and discharging a test battery , there was no detectable change in the material ’s performance .
The electrodes the team produced had thicknesses up to a few microns , and the improvements in energy delivery only were seen at high - power output levels .
In future work , the team aims to produce thicker electrodes and extend the improved performance to low - power outputs as well , they say .
In its present form , the material might have applications for small , portable electronic devices , says Shao - Horn , but if the reported high - power capability were demonstrated in a much thicker form — with thicknesses of hundreds of microns rather than just a few — it might eventually be suitable for other applications such as hybrid cars .
While the electrode material was produced by alternately dipping a substrate into two different solutions — a relatively time - consuming process —
Hammond suggests that the process could be modified by instead spraying the alternate layers onto a moving ribbon of material , a technique now being developed in her lab .
This could eventually open the possibility of a continuous manufacturing process that could be scaled up to high volumes for commercial production , and could also be used to produce thicker electrodes with a greater power capacity .
“ There is n’t a real limit ” on the potential thickness , Hammond says .
“ The only limit is the time it takes to make the layers , ” and the spraying technique can be up to 100 times faster than dipping , she says .
Lee says that while carbon nanotubes have been produced in limited quantities so far , a number of companies are currently gearing up for mass production of the material , which could help to make it viable for large - scale battery manufacturing .
Yury Gogotsi , professor of materials science at Drexel University , says , “ This is an important achievement , because there is a need for energy storage in a thin - film format for powering portable electronic devices and for flexible , wearable electronics .
Bridging the performance gap between batteries and electrochemical capacitors is an important task , and the MIT group has made an important step in this direction . ”
Some uncertainties remain , however .
“ The electrochemical performance data presented in the article may only be valid for relatively thin films with no packaging , ” Gogotsi says , pointing out that the measured results were for just the individual electrode , and results might be different for a whole battery with its multiple parts and outer container .
“ The question remains whether the proposed approach will work for much thicker conventional electrodes , used in devices that are used in hybrid and electric cars , wind power generators , etc . ”
But , he adds , if it does turn out that this new system works for such thicker electrodes , “ the significance of this work will increase dramatically . ”

A raid at the headquarters of the Catholic Church in Belgium by police investigating child abuse was " deplorable , " Pope Benedict XVI said Sunday .
The pope expressed his " closeness and solidarity in this moment of sadness , in which , with certain surprising and deplorable methods , the searches were carried out " in a letter to the head of the Belgian Bishops Conference , Andre Joseph Leonard .
Police were searching for documents related to allegations of child abuse , a spokesman for the Brussels prosecutor said Thursday .
The Vatican said Friday it was shocked by the raids , alleging that two cardinals ' tombs were violated in the raids in the town of Mechelen .
" We also express our regret at some of the infringement of confidentiality , that those victims on whose name the raid were conducted have the right to , " the Vatican said in its statement Friday .
The Vatican also reaffirmed its " strong condemnation of any sinful and criminal abuse of minors by members of the Church " and cited " the need to repair and confront such acts in conformity with the law and teachings of the Gospel . "
Police raided the headquarters of the Belgian Catholic Church and searched for important documents in relation to their
investigation into the abuse of children by church figures , prosecutor 's spokesman Jean Marc Meilleur said on Thursday .
The Catholic Church faces allegations of child abuse by clergy across at least half a dozen countries , including the pope 's native Germany , as well as Belgium , Ireland , Austria , the Netherlands and the United States .

Posted by John , May 23rd , 2010 - under Mining , Resource Super Profits tax , Tax .
Guess how much income tax BHP and Rio Tinto pay as a percentage of their accounting profit .
13 percent according to Treasurer Wayne Swan .
Workers on the average wage pay 30 percent tax on their earnings over $ 34,000 .
For workers earning more than $ 80,000 it is 40 percent on that extra income .
It ’s not as if BHP and Rio Tinto are alone .
According to Wayne Swan , the Treasurer , citing independent analysis for the Henry Tax Review , other miners , like Fortescue and Newcrest , pay only 17 percent .
This is because business get a huge number of tax concessions .
The finance industry pays for example only 20 percent .
Miners get even more concessions than the other tax rent seekers .
It ’s time the Rudd Labor Government forced big business ( 40 percent of whom pay no income tax ) to really begin contributing to society .
A super profits tax is a start ; inadequate ( as you would expect from a Labor Party ruling for the rich ) , but a start nevertheless .
What could Labor do ?
Tax all monopoly profits ( the big 4 banks come to mind ) .
Impose a minimum company tax regime so that companies pay some tax even in artificial loss situations .
Soak the rich through a progressive tax system .
Attack tax expenditures ( disguised grants ) which cost $ 100 billion a year and mainly benefit business and the rich .
Imposing death and gift duties on the bourgeoisie and their middle class apparatchiks .
Tax the houses of the filthy rich .
Beef up the Tax Office to attack the rich avoiders and evaders .
Remove the handcuffs that business has imposed on the ATO .
These are just some of the issues that would be on the agenda of any left wing Government .
A carbon tax on the big polluters with the money collected returned to workers and price control on energy prices would be an option .
Of course Rudd Labor is not left wing .
Its resource super profits tax for example is about redistributing monopoly profits ( out of value workers create ) to those sectors of the economy open to more competition , including other big businesses and small business .
Rudd Labor rejected increasing the tax free threshold .
This would have benefited workers ( and could have been structured to phase out so the rich do n’t benefit . )
Labor rejected slight modifications to negative gearing .
It rejected abolishing the capital gains tax concessions which benefit the very well off disproportionately .
It rejected a bequest tax .
Tax policy in Australia is a debate among the capitalist class about what is best for it and for individual sectors within it .
The rent seekers have taken over tax policy and Ken Henry ’s Tax Review was an attempt in small part to rein them in for the benefit of the class and the capital accumulation process as a whole .
The fact that Labor has rejected many of the Henry Tax Review ’s recommendations and put others in the too hard basket shows that , apart from the Resource Super Profits Tax , it is a slave of the tax rent seekers and the particular narrow ruling class interests they represent .
A socialist program would tax the bourgeoisie and their accumulation process .
Even then other policies would need to be in place to address the captial strike the bourgeoisie would undertake and to control the prices of their goods and services .
None this will happen in times of social peace .
It would be a consequence of the developing revolutionary situation and the democratic revolutionary transfer of power from the minority class to the majority class .
Until then the left can continue to push a simple revenue message .
Tax the rich .
FIGURING out what to do with leftover grilled meat is not exactly a bewildering conundrum .
Slice it thinly , stack it onto some good bread with a smear of mustard and a gloss of mayonnaise , and last night ’s London broil becomes today ’s deluxe lunch  no recipe required .
But some occasions demand more than a simple sandwich .
It might be friends coming over to dinner , the desire to open a bottle of wine that ’s more special than usual , or just a hankering for something more substantial than meat , condiments and bread .

Central district prosecutors presented a letter of indictment on Tuesday against border guard Omri Abu for the charge of causing death by negligence in the shooting of a 10 - year - old Palestinian boy in the West Bank village on Na'alin in 2008 .
The prosecutors accused Abu of violating IDF guidelines by firing live ammunition towards demonstrators " without any justification or approval . "
10 - year - old Ahmed Moussa was killed on July 29 , 2008 during clashes between protesters and Israeli security forces at a demonstration against the security barrier in Na'alin .
According to eyewitness statements to the B'tselem human rights organization , a Border Patrol jeep arrived at the scene of the protest and shots as well as a stun grenade were fired at demonstrators , who were dispersed in a grove of olive trees .
An IDF investigation of the incident found that Moussa had been killed by security forces .
Abu claimed that he fired two shots in the air in an attempt to disperse the demonstrators .
Another border guard testified that Abu fired into the air during the incident .
Abu was released from the Border Guard after the incident .
Abu 's attorney , David Halevi , said in response to the indictment letter that his client denied that the Palestinians boy had died as a result of his fire , adding that there was n't " any evidence showing that a boy was killed in that event at all . "
" The Palestinians , " Halevi claimed , " had been suspiciously unwilling , to the point of tempering with evidence , to allow any examination of the body by an Israeli medical official , with all of the findings relying on Palestinian reports , who are a side to the matter . "
Halevi also said that the findings of the Palestinian autopsy did not fit the claim that his client had opened fire , adding that he was confident that his innocence would be proven in court .
Admittedly , if you yourself are n't a flight sim junkie this may not be the most attractive controller in the world , but there 's something to be said about a company spending three years studying , crafting , and refining a controller to make it virtually indistinguishable from the real thing .
The A - 10 C 's controls were laser - scanned , its button and trigger movements measured to a tenth of a millimeter , and even the force required to depress them was determined to a fraction of a newton / meter .
The result is a perfectly balanced , perfectly weighted , and , at nearly 15 lbs , perfectly serious piece of kit .
The main stick uses magnetic sensors inside , not potentiometers that will lose accuracy , and has a resolution of 65,536 x 65,536 .
The separate throttle is split to control both engines individually , and offers detents that tell you when you 're about to idle the engines and when you 're about to light the afterburner ( which can be removed if you 're in a non-afterburning jet -- like indeed the A - 10C is ) .
There are 51 " action points " including buttons , tophats , rockers , and even a sort of trackball for moving targeting reticules .
The whole package is quite a thing to behold , and holding it back - to - back with the real thing ( of which a few were thoughtfully available at this event ) proves it has the dimensions and the feel down -- if not quite the heft of the real deal .
We took it for a quick flight through some canyons in an F - 16 and , though we nearly blacked out a few times and came close to losing our cookies thanks to the over - sensitive head tracking setup , we have to admit the HOTAS was quite a joy to use .
Smooth and precise -- but perhaps too serious a weapon for our amateur inputs .
The switches can only be said to be military quality , requiring solid force to engage and responding with a positive click -- and yes , they even measured the volume of the click to make sure that matches the real thing .
Thrustmaster will be releasing the HOTAS Warthog this September , just in time for the release of perhaps the most advanced A - 10 simulator yet : DCS A - 10C ( shown in the video above ) .
The company has n't decided just how much they 're going to charge for the thing , but you can be sure that this sort of precision wo n't come cheap .
It is , however , cheaper than getting out early from a six year minimum service obligation .
Unfortunately for lovers of fantasy epics , hairy feet and stories where dwarves are packed into barrels , Guillermo Del Toro has announced that he 's not going to direct the movie version of The Hobbit after all .
This is tragic .
Upon leaving the theater after seeing The Return of the King for the first time , I imagine everyone was thinking the same thing : " Man , that was a freakingly long ending . "
But after that they thought , " I ca n't wait to see The Hobbit . "
It seemed inevitable , and if Peter Jackson was n't going to direct it , then Del Toro was arguably the best alternative .
And now Del Toro has left the project .
While the movie is n't cancelled , it 's wandering aimlessly without a captain , like an abandoned ship or a poorly organized volleyball team .
Where will we find a director capable of bringing J.R.R.
Tolkien 's vision to life ?
Let 's consider the possibilities .
What would happen if one of these well - known directors were hired to helm The Hobbit ?
Tim Burton — — —-
Tim Burton 's grasp of magic and high weirdness is initially encouraging to fans , but doubt sets in when Johnny Depp is brought on to play Gandalf and decides to base his portrayal on eccentric celebrity Ozzy Osbourne .
When Helena Bonham Carter is tapped to play Gollum , hopes take a dive , and the final product is praised for its bold use of color and shapes , but criticized for introducing a 10 - minute dream sequence in which Bilbo is chased by a giant ring in a clown suit .
Terry Gilliam — — — —-
The first stills to come out of the production are very promising , but Terry Gilliam 's famed bad luck comes into play when , over the course of a single week , a fire destroys the Smaug set , a flash flood wipes out Lake Town , Thorin Oakenshield develops spasmodic dysphonia , and the special - effects budget is cut to about half that of Big Momma 's House 3 .
The movie as released , while flawed and a commercial failure , nonetheless becomes a cult favorite among film students and fisheye lens salesmen .
George Lucas — — ——
George Lucas decides that this Lord of the Rings prequel is lacking a certain something , and changes the plot to be about Sauron 's early life as an adorable toddler caught in the middle of a continent - spanning dispute over water rights .
Also , Sauron 's best friend is an orc with an exaggerated Mexican accent named Boopily Boodily Moop .
The resulting film is a failure on every conceivable level , although somehow this does n't prevent Lucas from producing a related Cartoon Network series called Ultimate Ring Force .
Michael Bay — — —
–
While the film is visually impressive , most viewers can't recall Middle - earth being quite so explosion - prone in the books .
In particular , the opening scene – in which Bilbo , instead of providing food and drinks for 13 dwarves , must escape from his shuddering , collapsing hobbit hole , diving from the exit just as Bag End goes up in a massive eruption of lava and stone – is singled out as being " somewhat over the top . "
Every geek goes to see it , every geek hates it , and every geek goes to see it again just in case they did n't hate it enough the first time .
Uwe Boll — — –
The movie garners less criticism than any previous Uwe Boll film , mostly because at this point everyone 's given up on even watching Uwe Boll films .
However , Uwe Boll himself goes to see it , and posts some minor criticisms on a web forum .
When he reads his own comments , Uwe Boll becomes enraged and challenges himself to a bare - knuckled MMA match .
The resulting video of Uwe Boll spending two hours beating himself up is a critical and commercial hit , providing Uwe Boll with his first and only Oscar , for Best Concussion Based on an Original Screenplay .

The commandos were surprised by the activists ' violent response , and after seven of them - half the initial boarding party - had been wounded , they were ordered to open fire .
The IDF plans to investigate the operation 's planning , including the decision to use naval commandos only rather than forces experienced in violent crowd control .

At about 10 P.M. Sunday night , a sizable portion of Israel 's navy was sent out to meet the approaching flotilla .
Adm. Eliezer Marom , commander of the navy , was in charge of the operation .
At 10:45 P.M. , the navy made initial contact with the flotilla and urged it to turn around , warning that the ships would be boarded if they continued .
The flotilla ignored the order , and at 4 A.M. yesterday , the boarding began .
According to the flotilla 's organizers , the ships were still on the high seas at the time , and had not yet entered territorial waters .
The IDF refused to say where the boarding took place .
The boarding party had real - time photographs of the ships from IDF helicopters hovering overhead , and a decision was made to board the Marmara with 14 commandos , some of whom rappeled from a helicopter .
They carried rifles loaded with paint balls for crowd control , as well as loaded pistols , but the latter were not supposed to be used .

The violence began immediately , when the activists tied the helicopter 's rappelling rope to the ship 's antenna in an effort to down the chopper .
Then , as each commando landed on deck , he was mobbed by activists who beat him with clubs and tried to stab him .
The first seven commandos were wounded and overcome within seconds .
Efforts to suppress the mob with stun grenades failed .
One soldier was flung from the upper deck to the lower and suffered a serious head injury ; two others were stabbed by knife - wielding rioters ; the remainder were clubbed to the ground .
The rioters then seized two of the downed soldiers ' pistols .
" It felt like the Ramallah lynching , " one soldier said afterward .
" They came to wage war .
They stormed us and threw some of the fighters down a level ; some of the fighters jumped into the sea for fear of being attacked again . "
Additional soldiers soon joined the first seven , both from helicopters and via ladders from naval ships alongside .
At that point , Marom and Col. A. , who commands the naval commandos , concluded that the soldiers ' lives were in danger and gave the order to open fire .
Senior IDF officers said afterward that the breaking point occurred when the mob began beating a fallen commando with iron bars , causing his comrades to fear for his life .
The entire IDF chain of command subsequently backed the decision to open fire .
When the shooting began , the Marmara 's captain urged the passengers to return to their cabins .
But according to the soldiers , some of the passengers stayed and returned fire - apparently from both the two seized pistols and from arms that were already on board .
A later search of the ship found rifle cartridges , but the rifle itself was apparently thrown overboard .
" We had planned on dealing with peace activists , not a battle , " a senior naval officer said afterward .
" This was not spontaneous , but premeditated violence .
They said they came on a humanitarian mission , but they came to fight . "
Altogether , it took the commandos about 90 minutes to subdue the ship and sail it toward Ashdod Port .
The more seriously wounded - both soldiers and passengers - were evacuated by helicopter to Israeli hospitals ; the lightly wounded were treated on board the Marmara and then by ambulance crews after reaching shore .
Two of the soldiers were initially defined as seriously wounded , but their condition has since stabilized and is now defined as moderate .
Two others were moderately wounded and three lightly ; two of the latter have already been released from hospital .
Of the passengers , about 30 were either seriously or moderately wounded .
In contrast to the Marmara , there was no resistance at all on three of the other ships and only mild resistance on the other two .
At a press conference yesterday afternoon , Defense Minister Ehud Barak said he regretted the casualties , " but responsibility for them rests entirely on the flotilla 's organizers and participants . "
IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi said he was convinced the soldiers had acted properly , charging that the flotilla " bore no relationship to humanitarian aid ; there was extremist activity from the first moment . "
After the ships finally arrived in Ashdod yesterday afternoon , the passengers were debarked and preparations for their deportation began .
Image caption Mr Russell said he felt humiliated when asked to leave the flight
A man who wanted to fly to Canada to see his dying aunt says he was taken off the plane because he was too large .
Sandy Russell , from Wolverhampton , who weighs 32 stone , was asked to leave the Air Transat flight to Toronto because the arm -rest would not go down .
He was told he could travel on the next available flight from Gatwick but would have to pay for two seats .
Mr Russell did not travel and his aunt died two days later .
Air Transat said he took up a third of the next seat .
Mr Russell said he asked if there were extra seats at check - in .
I felt like a criminal or a terrorist or something ... the emotion got too much for me and I broke down Sandy Russell
" I always ask , ( at check - in ) if it 's a big flight , if there are any more seats that are available and she said it 's a full flight . "
The stewardess said she would look for another seat for him as he did not look comfortable , he said .
" She came back and said ' follow me ' so I grabbed my hand luggage and she took me off the flight and said , basically , that I could n't fly with them , that I was too big and that it was unfair for someone paying for a seat next to me not to get a full seat .
" I felt like a criminal or a terrorist or something ... the emotion got too much for me and I broke down .
' Breach of rights '
" A lot of people are saying to me , well , you should have known before you went on , but I have never , ever had a problem with any airlines , until now .
" Airlines need to be sorted .
" They need to make it plain to people before they board ... even when they are booking tickets ... if you 're a certain size , this may happen . "
An Air Transat spokesman said : " We ca n't ask people their measurements before they book a flight - it's a breach of their human rights , " a spokesman said .
" In this case , the arm - rest would not go down and separate Mr Russell from the lady beside him - and he was taking up more than a third of her seat . "

Only 13 groups have the SPLC 's ' anti - gay hate group ' label .
Here 's NOM applauding one of them ...
by Jeremy Hooper
A new height of eyebrow - raising for the National Organization For Marriage .
They 're now quoting ( and emboldening ) the Traditional Values Coalition , one of only thirteen groups to have met an extreme enough bar to earn an " anti- gay hate group " label from the Southern Poverty Law Center :
Yea , NOM ?
What else was TVC right about ?
Were they right when they painted DADT repeal as a " Memorial Day Massacre " ?
Was TVC founder Lou Sheldon right when he served as the E.D. of the gay teacher - banning Briggs Initiative ( something even Ronald Reagan opposed ) ?
Was TVC right when they called an important piece of legislation the " Barney Frank She - Male Shower Bill , " or when they referred to a congressional hearing dealing with transgender protections as a " freak show " ?
What about when they put Jesus on Wanted posters as a way to pit that particular religious figure against gays who support hate crime protections ?
Or how about the many times they have lied about sexual orientation , claiming there are over 30 of them ( including having sex with a soldier 's amputation ) ?
Oh , or when they Photoshopped a smiling Barack Obama in front of the burning WTC towers and onto a Nazi propaganda poster ?
Or maybe when they completely flipped a Congressional transcript so that it became more convenient for their self - serving purposes ?
Etc , etc .
Sorry , Brian and Maggie , but we really do n't think TVC is in the position to " slam " anyone or anything .
Except , of course , the credibility of those who present them as valid voices of love , compassion , and / or truth !

, the much - lauded stove - side creative dynamo at
will open his second restaurant , Little Bird , later this year .
Little Bird will land on Southwest Sixth Avenue between Oak and Pine Streets across from the U.S. Bancorp building in long - vacant space owned by Downtown Development Company , an arm of the parking lot - owning Goodman family .
The new location will be co-owned by Rucker and
's front - of - the - house and business manager , Andy Fortgang .
Le Pigeon ,
, is known for French - focused dishes often involving offal and other off cuts of meat and delivering layers of complex , intense flavors .
Beef cheek bourguignon and a pig tail soup spring to mind .
While Little Bird will also have its heart in France , it will focus on simple bistro meals , inevitably with the kinds of imaginative twists that have earned Rucker
national
for last three years running .
Rucker , a northern California native , will draw inspiration from his favorite restaurant ,
, in Yountville , Calif. , which he characterizes as " homey , simple and classic . "
Though Rucker will be the culinary force overseeing Little Bird , the chef de cuisine charged with running the show day - to - day will be Le Pigeon 's even - keeled , long - time second - in - command , Erik Van Kley .
Rucker and Van Kley have been busy developing the Little Bird menu , and Rucker expects that collaborative effort to continue .
" We work so well together that we do n't want to lose that , " Rucker says .
The menu is still a work - in - process , but diners should expect minimal overlap between the two restaurants .
The exception , Fortgang says , is that " the Le Pigeon burger will be available at Little Bird without any limitations . "
For those in search of something to sip with their meal , Little Bird will have a full bar serving classic cocktails and will offer a wine list of predominantly French provenance with a nod to Oregon .
Second restaurants can be difficult for even successful operators , but Rucker says , " After four years doing Le Pigeon with mostly the same crew , we were ready to do something a little different and I wanted to reward my longtime employees . "
The idea behind Little Bird , according to Fortgang , is to provide Portlanders with an eatery that is " bigger and simpler than Le Pigeon , with longer hours and lower prices . "
Rucker echoes the sentiment , saying that he intends Little Bird to be " more accessible " to a broader segment of diners .
The current plan is for service from the lunch hour through late night seven days a week .
Though the opening is not expected until sometime in early winter , Mark Annen of
-- whose food service portfolio includes layouts for
, and the
restaurants -- has already sketched out a 50 - seat space , 10 at the bar and the balance at tables .
Fortgang says Little Bird plans to accommodate both reservations and walk - ins .
Mark Goodman , one of Downtown Development 's principals and a food enthusiast in his own right , says he " could n't be more thrilled " to provide a roost for Little Bird " given Rucker ' s cooking skills and huge following . "

A
Pennsylvania Senate panel
approved a measure Wednesday that would prohibit someone from forcing an individual to have an identification chip implanted under their skin .
The panel amended the proposal to give parents the authority to have an ID chip implanted in their child .
A ban on forcing convicts to have a chip implanted under their skin was also added .
The measure by state Rep. Babette Josephs
, D - Philadelphia , was approved without opposition by the state House last June .
The bill now heads to the Senate floor .
Welcome to the latest installment of Production Tips , our new monthly feature offering , well , production tips , hosted by Simon Langford .
Whether you record live bands and real drum kits or use synthetic drum sounds , quite often you want to add some weight to the kick drum sound without making it sound “ flabby ” or overloaded .
There are a few different ways of doing this , so let ’s get started on really making your kick “ kick ” !
Narrow Band EQ
The easiest way to fatten up a kick drum is using EQ .
But rather than just applying a simple “ low shelf ” type EQ , it is much better to apply a narrow band of EQ boost to the “ fundamental ” frequency of the kick .
First , choose a fully parametric band in your EQ of choice .
Ideally , this should be one which is capable of narrow bandwidth settings ( up to 100 is good ! ) .
Then , make the bandwidth ( or “ Q ” ) as narrow as it can go and set the gain to maximum .
It is a good idea to turn your monitors down while doing this , as this technique can easily give some very loud signals while you are working on the first stage .
Set the frequency to around 500 Hz or so and then , slowly , turn down the frequency .
As you do this , you will hear certain frequencies which sound much louder .
These are the harmonics or overtones .
As you keep going lower , you will eventually get to the fundamental frequency ; as a general rule this is somewhere between 50 Hz and 100 Hz .
Once you have found this frequency you can pull the gain down to zero and open up the bandwidth a little and then gradually raise the gain control again until you have the required amount of “ oomph ” .
By using this technique you are boosting only the most important and dominant frequency while leaving everything else intact .
Distorted Reality
Another option you can use in some situations is to create of copy of the kick drum track ( audio or synth / sampler ) and then , on this copy , add some distortion ( perhaps using the free Camel Audio Camel Crusher ) and a low - pass filter with the cutoff frequency set pretty low ( maybe around 100 Hz or so to start with ) and then gradually raise the level of this distorted sound under the main kick .
You will probably need to adjust the distortion settings and the cutoff frequency of the filter to get a good balance .
This effect does n’t boost frequencies in the same way as the EQ method above does , but it works by adding in another layer which is only low frequencies , thereby effectively increasing the “ weight . ”
Also , by adding some distortion you are actually increasing the harmonic density of the low and lower - mid frequencies which helps to give more “ body ” to the sound .
Mellow Sub Machine
Finally , you can always use that most simple ( and often neglected ) of synth waveforms , the humble sine wave .
Find a synth with a sine wave option ( I often use the Logic EXS - 24 but any synth or plugin with a sine wave will work .
There are even free ones that you can download ) , and then set up an amplitude envelope with appropriate settings ( fast attack and short to medium decay and release , zero sustain ) and then bring up the volume under the main kick .
At this point you will need to adjust the tuning of the sine wave until you get the two sounds “ in tune ” .
This really is a matter of trial and error , but you will know when it ’s “ right ” because there will be a really warm and round emphasis of the “ thump ” of the kick .
You may possibly have to remove a little of the real low end from the original kick as well to help things blend but that really depends on the original sound .
Deep Water Oil The Final Frontier
BP 's disaster in the Gulf of Mexico , leading to accusation by Obama himself of corporate recklessness , and to huge numbers of lawsuits for damages and loss of earnings , is also capable of leaving very long - term ecological damage .
This disaster however underlines the basic problem facing all the major Western oil corporations , and most national oil companies - outside the OPEC states , Russia and a few other oil producer countries with large or relatively low cost , onshore and shallow offshore oil reserves and an export surplus .
The five - largest international oil corporations ( IOCs ) - shrunken from their previous Seven Sisters number and status - produce less and less oil and face ever - rising exploration and production ( E&P ) costs to find more oil , and cover their annual capacity loss from geological depletion .
The five remaining majors , ExxonMobil , Royal Dutch Shell , BP , Total and Chevron now control less than 10 % of remaining world oil reserves , and less than 15 % of current total production capacity - in addition they have to give high returns on capital to their institutional and private shareholders .
This requirement is often much weaker for the national oil companies ( NOCs ) : of the top 20 oil and gas producers worldwide , 14 are now NOCs or newly privatized national oil companies , according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly .
The most important are : Saudi Aramco , Gazprom , Iran's NIOC , Mexico's Pemex , Algeria 's Sonatrach , PetroChina , Kuwait 's KPC , India 's ONGC , Brazil 's Petrobras , Malaysia 's Petronas , Russia 's Yukos and Lukoil , and PDVSA of Venezuela .
Within this group of NOCs , Saudi Aramco , PDVSA , NIOC , Pemex and PetroChina are now equal rank with the Western IOCs , either in terms of oil production capacity or refining , shipping and other transport capacities , or all three .
The role and strategy of the NOCs in the big importer nations - notably China , and increasingly India - is not only return on capital and shareholder performance , but basic supply of oil and gas for national needs .
To be sure , profit and loss are important , but oil resource supply commands the prime role , for NOCs of the major oil importer nations outside the OECD group .
This itself reflects the underlying problem of oil resource scarcity in the face of continuing high demand on a worldwide basis .
DEEPWATER SALVATION
Deep offshore oil is an apparent solution for the Western IOCs .
Reserves , although very expensive to find and slow to develop , can bolster declining onshore and shallow offshore reserves and production capacity .
Potential deep water oil resources , usually exaggerated and only a low fraction of which ( generally 5 % - 15 % ) can be recovered and extracted , may be more than 70 billion barrels , worldwide .
Developing this " last frontier " resource , and accelerating development and production of shale gas reserves , is the stated strategy of several IOCs , which like BP have identified deep water oil as their new frontier - in fact their Last Frontier .
In a context dictated by declining oil resources , and lack of easy access to the large national resources of Russia and most OPEC states , except Iraq , the deep water strategy however carries high costs and huge risks .
In the case of BP and since the April 20 disaster , its share price has wilted , wiping about $ 60 billion off the corporation 's market capitalization in the two months to June 20 .
BP 's need to find about $ 50 billion to cover its likely total exposure to damage and loss payments will almost surely delay the timing of new oil and gas projects or possibly eliminate them .
Sequels of this corporate , and ecological disaster are rippling across the oil industry , with concern that additional monitoring and maintenance of deep water projects , and other high risk and high cost operations could hurt earnings , cash flow and return on capital .
Amid the swath of information , the simple questions and answers are however avoided .
Why are the oil major corporations including BP , Exxon Mobil , Shell , Total and major NOCs like Petrobras of Brazil and Petronas of Malaysia investing huge amounts to explore and develop deep offshore oil ?
As the BP disaster has shown , amounts spent are very high .
E&P costs for Petrobras in the extreme depth Tupi field , for example , can be gauged by the $ 220 million price tag for the initial exploratory well and related seismic data collection .
To be sure , only oil prices in the range of $ 50 - $ 80 a barrel , and above can make such projects feasible .
The answer is simple : both international and national oil corporations , outside a few very special cases including some OPEC states and perhaps Russia are faced with diminishing and depleting onshore and shallow offshore oil reserves and resources .
This is the basic trigger for the rush to The Last Frontier .
This frontier focuses water depths now extending to 3.5 kilometres .
If onshore and shallow water resources and producible reserves were more abundant , the rush to develop deep water oil would be low or zero .
THE DEMAND DRIVER
The reason that oil has to found is also simple : world demand is recovering , after a short pause in 2008 - 2009 .
World demand contracted only about 3.5 % year - on - year , during the downturn described by the IMF as the worst global economic recession and financial crisis since 1929 .
World demand continues to be forecast as growing at an average of about 2 % a year , up to 1.75 Mbd extra demand each year , outside recession downturns .
Forecasts by the US EIA and the OECD 's IEA continue to suggest world demand could attain 115 million barrels a day ( Mbd ) by 2030 , rising from current demand of around 86 Mbd .
This will require not only the addition of 29 Mbd of new capacity , over 3 times current total export surplus of Saudi Arabia but also the replacement of capacity losses due to oil resource depletion of around 2.5 - 3.5 Mbd each year .
Due to increasing depletion losses in large established onshore and shallow water fields , mostly dating from and found in the 1955 - 1965 period , the annual replacement requirement will surely climb in the 2010 - 2020 short term .
Total capacity needed , for new supply to meet increasing demand , and replacement of existing supply lost through depletion , can easily attain 90 Mbd through 2010 - 2030 .
This is more than current world total capacity of about 88 Mbd including 2 Mbd underutilized and spare capacity .
Likely costs of this can be evoked by taking recent E&P ( exploration and production ) spending by world private oil corporations .
This is around $ 400 - $ 450 billion a year , including natural gas E&P spending .
On average this has delivered incremental capacity of about 1 - 2 Mbd a year , and up to 3 - 3.5 Mbd a year of slowed or postponed capacity loss through depletion .
Oil and gas E&P spending has grown radically with oil prices in the last 10 years : from about $ 200 bn a year in 2000 , to about $ 450 bn a year in 2009 , or a rate of close to 8 % a year in nominal US dollar terms , based on IEA data .
This agency , we can note , periodically issues what could be called " alarmist " reports on world oil supply , while also forecasting that oil industry E&P spending could attain $ 1000 bn a year by 2016 , and that total oil production capacity is able to climb to about 115 Mbd by 2030 .
The oil price needed for this is also indicated by the IEA , at or above $ 125 a barrel .
WASTE IT , FASTER
Estimates by scientists at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute of daily oil discharge into the Gulf indicate as much as 7 - 8 million litres ( up to 45 000 barrels / day ) is spewing from BP 's ruptured seafloor wellhead , of which variable and unsure estimates and claims from BP suggest that up to 15 000 barrels / day is being skimmed and captured , some days at least .
Some other estimates suggest that 60 000 barrels / day is being lost .
This feat of waste and pollution could potentially continue until September before final remedy , when costly and slow relief well drilling in water depths of 1.5 kilometres followed by cementing , is achieved .
Until April 20 , announcementss of big finds in deep water were highly prized by the IOCs and many leading NOCs .
According to BP , whose word is now more than somewhat tarnished , its 62 % ownership of the Gulf of Mexico Tiber field , in the same Mississippi Canyon seafloor formation as the Macondo field in which ' Deepwater Horizon ' was drilling , places BP as N°1 for deep offshore US oil reserves .
In turn , deep water oil reserves were , and probably still are considered by Obama 's administration as synonymous with US " national energy security " .
Deep water exploratory drilling was until now strongly encouraged in the US and other major oil importer countries and can likely bounce back if the current BP crisis winds down with an apparent final technological solution , and to be sure , generous damage payments by BP and its partners , notably Anadarko and Transoceanic plc , and their insurers .
This changes nothing relating to the slim resource basis , low recovery rates of oil in place , very high development costs , large amounts of waste , and extreme environment risks .
Never mentioned in upbeat , or even euphoric announcement of big new finds in deep water , these reserves at best can be recovered at around 5 % - 15 % of the oil in place .
Reserve finds announced as 1 billion barrels will deliver 50 to 150 million barrels over a timespan able to exceed 10 years .
in other words , over 10 years , the so - called " giant discovery " will yield a volume equal to 15 hours - 45 hours of current world oil demand .
In many , even most cases the associated gas extracted with the oil is simply flared : World Bank estimates place the loss of associated gas , by flaring in shallow and deep water offshore production at around 150 billion cubic metres a year .
As we know , on a volume - for - volume basis CH4 or methane gas has about a 20 - fold more powerful global warming impact than CO2 or carbon dioxide , released in part by burning fossil fuels .
When the great cause of reducing global warming is taken seriously , as leaders of major oil importing countries like to claim they espouse , the massive waste of associated gas in deep water oil production should be given major attention .
Worse for the environment , and well hidden within in - company technology audit data , as much as 2 % - 5 % of the " nameplate capacity " of the producer wells will be lost at the seafloor and in the complex high - tech oil loading and transfer operations .
Wells with a " nameplate capacity " of 60 000 barrels a day can attain waste and loss rates of 1200 - 3000 barrels a day .
Inside the deep water oil industry , these loss ans waste rates are commonplace , but rarely disclosed or admitted .
INVESTOR SUPPORT TO DEEP WATER OIL
Field discovery announcements are obligatorily large : the bigger the field claimed , the more media and public opinion support , and more government approval .
BP claims its
Tiber field could hold more than 5 billion barrels , other estimates placing the total closer to 3 bn barrels , but when we use median - case ( neither optimist nor pessimist ) scenarios for extraction , of around 5 % of this oil being extractible , the likely total production form the " hyper massive " Tiber field will be around 200 - 250 million barrels over 10 years or more .
An extracted volume of 200 mln barrels would cover 2.2 days of world oil demand or about 10 days of US current oil consumption .
Investor and media presentations rarely or never explain the extreme technology and industrial challenges faced in these environments .
Immense challenges are set by the race to find , and develop deep water oil fields .
In the Tiber case , drilling is needed to depths more than Mount Everest is high , that is 10 kilometres or 35 000 feet .
Extracted oil and associated gas ( entirely or almost entirely flared , that is thrown away ) are at temperatures often above 235 °C and at pressures up to several tons per square inch .
The risk of blow - outs , fire or explosion , as well as " regular and normal " loss and pollution from operations can be gauged from the above .
These temperatures , ironically speaking , show the potential for geothermal energy development .
Operations in over 3 kilometres water depth , with seafloor temperatures around 1.5 °C , and surface water temperatures close to 30 °C indicate the large potential for ocean thermal energy conversion ( OTEC ) technology and applications , for these installations after the final depletion of deep water oil reserves or abandonment of this costly , wasteful and dangerous oil production .
Capital spending for deep offshore oil attains extremes only exceeded by onshore tarsand oil extraction and synthetic oil production from coal , gas , or biomass .
Brazil 's deep offshore Tupi field , another field claimed to contain up to , or more than 5 bn barrels is for example estimated by industry analysts including Neftex Petroleum Consultants as requiring as much as $ 240 billion to develop .
Exploration and proving costs can be gauged from the $ 220 million price tag for the first test well in this field .
The estimated massive amounts of spending required may however only yield production at around 2.5
Mbd when peak output is attained , probably after 2015 if development moves ahead .
Peak output from this field may in fact be less than this , depending on total number of platforms ( and therefore development costs ) being deployed .
In extreme deep water , lost oil is injected at very high temperature , with seafloor gas release at high pressure , into waters at a typical temperature of 2 °C at 1.5 kilometres water depth .
This makes biodegradation almost impossible , or in any case extreme long period , that is decades or centuries rather than years .
It is currently unknown what long - term impacts the spreading of very large " oil sheets " at extreme water depths can or might have on oceanic life systems .
In shallow water production , conversely , there is quite rapid biodegradation of lost oil .
This was the case in the Gulf of Mexico 's previous most disastrous offshore oil accident , the 1979 Ixtoc 1 spill , offshore Mexico , in about 100 metres water depth and at drilling depths of around 3.6 kilometres , releasing a total of about 3.5 million barrels of crude over 35 weeks .
Simply because the BP disaster is both very large and offshore USA , it is exposed to quite intense and relatively impartial media coverage .
Increasing news reports on deep water oil rig accidents and damage to the environment , outside the USA , are gradually becoming available .
Accidents , sometimes very grave , and large " routine " losses of oil and massive flaring of associated gas are the basic picture : world offshore oil production results in around 75 - 100 billion cubic metres per year of flared and wasted natural gas .
Until now , the technological , industrial and environmental risks of oil production in extreme deep water , and its extreme wastefulness of energy resources have been consistently under- reported and under-estimated .
CAN DEEP WATER OIL PREVENT OIL SCARCITY ?
The principal interest in finding and developing extreme depth oil reserves , despite their small size , high rates of loss and waste in production , very high development costs , long lead times and extreme risks to the environment is simple .
World oil reserves are depleting , and access by the oil major companies , like BP , to the world 's most abundant remaining onshore and shallow offshore oil reserves - mainly in the OPEC states and Russia - is impossible , difficult or costly .
To be sure the " military option " for gaining access to the national resources of OPEC states , through pillage has been applied in the case of Iraq but the fruits of , or booty from this strategy will be quite long to mature .
The oil majors , all of them based in large oil importer and consumer countries , and the national oil corporations of major importer countries in an increasing number of cases , are therefore forced into deep water .
This has the sole target to find whatever oil they can , where they can .
Short - term and stopgap reasoning , and attempts at producing more oil wherever possible are rational or at least predictable in this context , that is ' supply side ' solutions .
Risk is systematically under-estimated , as proven not only by the BP disaster , but also by recurring smaller accidents and constant loss and waste of large volumes of oil , and massive quantities of gas in deep water operations .
The real , demand side solution of reducing oil demand in the large consumer countries on a determined , long - term basis is sidelined as the best , most rational response .
Current deep water oil production , worldwide , is very far from able to prevent global depletion impacts on world oil supply from tending to raise prices .
Defined as production in water depths below 1000 metres , current output can be estimated at not much above 1.8 million barrels / day ( Mbd ) or about 2.1 % of world total oil production .
Yearly additions of deep offshore oil production capacity are unimpressive and small , certainly below 0.33 Mbd a year .
To be sure , enthusiast advocates of deep offshore oil such as BP ( at least until end April 2010 ) regularly claim the reserve size is very big , and that " several hundred billion barrels " could be available , from extreme water depth operations .
Extreme optimists on these " last chance " oil reserves and production of course go further than this , adding at lest one zero to their fantasist estimates of deep water oil reserves .
Under all hypotheses and forecasts , large scale development of deep offshore oil resources would require very high , and increasingly extreme capital spending as water depths increase to as much as 3 - 3.5 kilometres .
Technological risks would need to be recklessly ignored , as BP has done , and again like BP there would need to be a complete disregard of risks to human life and to the environment .
All of these conditions are however now in doubt , following the BP disaster and increased public and political interest in deep offshore oil .
Due to the low recovery rates , extreme high investment costs , and slow " ramp up " of production capacity in deep offshore oil extraction it is very unlikely that deep water oil can seriously prevent or slow the arrival of structural undersupply of oil to world markets .
This will be manifested , as in 2008 , by radically high oil prices being attained before there is an inevitable economic slump , reducing oil prices .

How do we know you are not skewing the " fact presented ?
I trust no one in your industry .
The truth will come out eventually .
Sounds like a thinly veiled peak oil propaganda to me .

28 Jun 10 , 00:58 Plenty of oil
The problem is , that it came out in congress that the US has way more oil , on - shore than Saudi , and shallow water drilling is banned to avoid eyesores , yet US goes to war to control oil .
Of course , the emphasis is on control , to stop the refining and extraction of oil to maintain high prices .
Oil should be around $ 20 / barrel right now .
Plus , most of the oil in Alaska goes straight to Russia and China via BP .
Americans get hardly any of it .
We do n't need deep water oil and , given the ridiculous technology for extraction , its clear that alternative energy sources will be more efficient .

03 Jul 10 , 02:50 harvest the oil
all efforts should be made to harvest the leaking oil in as many ways as possible to reduce the environmental disaster as much as is humanly possible .
clean up attempts are not enough as long as it keeps gushing .
if BP has sole rights to the oil here these should be overturned by the US government so that oil companies with other specialisms can harvest also .
all hands to the pump !

03 Jul 10 , 19:00 Deeply , deeply , now to sleep
Delusion takes us down this path Beneath the earth , below the sea Beyond the reach of you or me With steel fingered robots we do the math
With their spiny digits we unleash the wrath Of a long sleeping dragon Despite its ' fire breath and toxic blood
We can't get off this crud
It hauls our wagon
So we go deeply now , and deeper still
So we can still crave the thrill
Of flying fast over the hills
Over the spills
Over the kills Salivating over our grills
Where our flesh burns Dream deeply , now only in our dreams
Are there ways to slay these Dragons
Now the answers only exist in our dreams
Wake up and remember them
A conservation activist says an investigation into claims that Japan bribes small nations for their support on whaling is confirmation of what has been common knowledge for a long time .
Two reporters from Britain 's Sunday Times newspaper posed as the lobbyists of a fictional Swiss billionaire and set out to buy votes at next week 's International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) meeting .
Six countries told the reporters they were willing to consider their offer , but the reporters were told they would need to better the aid the countries are already getting from the Japanese .
Tanzania 's IWC commissioner is recorded saying that as well as aid , politicians from his country are flown to Japan where they are offered prostitutes .
Geoffrey Nanyaro told the undercover reporters he has never used Japanese prostitutes .
" As a Christian , I live by the Bible , so I never indulge in such [ activities ] , " he said .
Mr Nanyaro says when he visits Japan he is put up in a five - star hotel , and women offering massages often call his room .
" They start by saying you know , do you want massaging , you know , it will be free massaging , you know .
Are you not alone there ? "
Nicola Beynon from Humane Society International says the undercover investigation adds weight to what environmental groups have long suspected .
" It has been common knowledge for a long time that a number of countries that vote in favour of commercial whaling at the IWC are not actually voting because they genuinely want to see a return to commercial whaling , but they are voting because they are beholden to Japan and Japan 's very generous fisheries aid , " she said .
" This is confirming what has been common knowledge for a long time and there has been very few occasions where we have had proof of it . "
Morocco meeting
The Japanese government is yet to comment on the bribery allegations , which come just a week before the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) meets in Morocco .
The meeting will decide whether Japan wins approval for limited commercial whaling .
The decision is a critical one for the Australian Government as well , because if the proposal goes ahead it would destroy the Federal Government 's legal case against the Japanese .
Every vote will be crucial .
On the table is a compromise deal that could see a return to commercial whaling in exchange for an end to the killing of whales for so - called scientific research .
The compromise is the brainchild of the IWC chairman Cristian Maquieria , but he is sick and will not be at the meeting .
Ms Beynon is sure the deal will be debated without the chairman .
" I think it is going to come to a negotiation over the quotas , so if the quotas are big enough then Japan , Norway and Iceland will want the proposal , " she said .
" They will be telling the countries who vote that they have been coercing ... to vote for it and then if those countries combined with some countries who just want a compromise .
" They are tired of the issue .
They think if they support this compromise then the issue will die down for them politically .
If those countries combine with the pro-whalers then we could see it going through . "
Countries that are considering the compromise include the USA .
Opposed to compromise
Australia is vehemently opposed to the compromise and Environment Minister Peter Garrett has launched a YouTube campaign asking for support to end whaling .
" It is highly ironic that we should be having a debate about reintroducing commercial whaling in 2010 - the year proclaimed by the United Nations as the international year of biodiversity , " the Minister says in the video clip .
" This is not the time to go backwards by sanctioning whaling for years to come .
It is the time to take steps to permanently safeguard the existence of these really important animals . "
Outside of the IWC , Australia is taking the Japanese to the International Court of Justice in a bid to prove Japan 's so - called scientific research is a sham .
But Ms Beynon warns that the legal case will crumble if commercial whaling is endorsed by the IWC next week .
" If Japan is given a quota for commercial whaling , it means they will no longer need to exploit that loophole for scientific whaling , " she said .
" It is the scientific whaling , the exploitation of that loophole that the Australian Government was going to challenge in court , so it would mean that that case becomes moot .
" The government in Japan would be able to continue whaling with a legitimate commercial whaling quota which would just be disastrous . "
The proposal for limited commercial whaling would see almost 13,000 whales killed in the next 10 years .
Mr Garrett is describing the meeting as the most important since the IWC banned commercial whaling in 1986 .

Need a picture of a pensive and lonely Barack Obama stewing over the BP oil spill ?
Just create one !
Jeremy Peters of the New York Times explains :
There was President Obama on the cover of the June 19 issue of The Economist , standing alone on a Louisiana beach , head down , looking forlornly at the ground .
The problem was , he was not actually alone .
The photograph was just edited to make it look that way .
The unaltered image , shot on May 28 by a Reuters photographer , Larry Downing , shows Adm .
Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard and Charlotte Randolph , a local parish president , standing alongside the president .
But in the image that appeared on The Economist ’s cover , Admiral Allen and Ms. Randolph had been scrubbed out , replaced by the blue water of the Gulf of Mexico .
An Economist editor responds with some examples of obvious image alteration they ’ve used in the past , but then falls down trying to explain why they did some pretty nonobvious alteration this time around :
I asked for Ms. Randolph [ the woman next to Obama ] to be removed because I wanted readers to focus on Mr. Obama , not because I wanted to make him look isolated .
That was n’t the point of the story .
“ The damage beyond the spill ” referred to on the cover , and examined in the cover leader , was the damage not to Mr. Obama , but to business in America .
The Economist has a history of using photos more as illustrations than as objects of straight news , but this still crosses a line that a news magazine should n’t cross .
Hell , I would n’t do something like this on my blog , let alone on the cover of the Economist .
But decide for yourself .
The full transformation is illustrated below — and yes , I used Photoshop to create it .
Mysterious floating blobs of light known as ball lightning might simply be hallucinations caused by overstimulated brains , a new study suggests .
For hundreds of years eyewitnesses have reported brief encounters with the golf ball - to tennis ball - size orbs of electricity .
But scientists have been unable to agree on how and why ball lightning forms , since the phenomenon is rare and very short - lived .
( See " Ball Lightning : A Shocking Scientific Mystery . " )
Ball lightning is often reported during thunderstorms , and it's known that multiple consecutive lightning strikes can create strong magnetic fields .
So Joseph Peer and Alexander Kendl at the University of Innsbruck in Austria wondered whether ball lightning is really a hallucination induced by magnetic stimulation of the brain 's visual cortex or the eye 's retina .
In previous experiments , other scientists had exposed humans to strong , rapidly changing magnetic fields using a medical machine called a transcranial magnetic stimulator , or TMS .
The machine 's magnetic fields are powerful enough to induce electric currents in human brain cells without being harmful .
Focusing magnetic fields on the visual cortex of the brain caused the subjects to see luminous discs and lines .
When the focus was moved around within the visual cortex , the subjects reported seeing the lights move .
In their paper , which appeared online May 7 on the physics research website arXiv.org , Peer and Kendl argue that magnetic fields made by lightning could have the same effect as TMS machines on nearby humans .
In fact , the pair thinks about half of all ball lightning reports are actually tricks of the mind induced by magnetism .
Ball Lightning Still Feasible in Nature
The researchers make a convincing argument that some ball lightning reports are spurred by hallucinations , said John Abrahamson , a chemist and ball lightning expert at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand who was not involved in the study .
But " I cannot believe that most of the images reported as ball lightning are due to this brain influence , " Abrahamson said in an email .
For one thing , the colors of light seen by the subjects in the experiment were " white , gray , or in unsaturated colors . "
But ball lightning has been reported in a variety of colors , including orange , green , and blue , Abrahamson said .
Also , some eyewitness reports of ball lightning include close - up observations detailing the internal structures of the balls and even associated smells and sounds .
Some reports of ball lightning even involve multiple eyewitnesses who saw the same phenomenon from different angles and saw the balls travel in the same directions .
" This common geometric perception from different angles would be very unlikely if their brains were being stimulated " by the local magnetic field caused by lightning strikes , Abrahamson said .
Eli Jerby , an engineer at Tel Aviv University in Israel , has actually created something similar to ball lightning in the lab .
He also does n't think hallucinations could account for all ball lightning reports .
" While hallucinations could explain some cases , the effect of ball lightning is yet feasible in both nature and the laboratory , " Jerby said in an email .
MANILA — Poorer countries that have borne the brunt of climate change ’s effects will save , not lose , money by putting in place ways to rescue the environment , Al Gore said yesterday .
The former US vice president spoke to a forum in Manila in one of his first public engagements since he and his wife , Tipper , announced they had separated after 40 years of marriage .
He would not answer audience questions about it , and reporters did not have an opportunity for interviews .
In the lecture focused on Asia , the Nobel Peace Prize laureate blamed global warming for droughts and frequent , more destructive typhoons , including those that have left millions homeless in India , Myanmar , the Philippines , and Vietnam over the last several years .
“ When there are lots of them , much more frequently and they are bigger on average , how can we connect those dots ? ’’ he asked .
“ How long will it take us as a civilization to connect those dots in a way that causes us to demand that our political leaders and political systems react ? ’’
Gore said proposals to store carbon dioxide in the ground are expensive , and the best way to trap it is in plants .
He added that China is a leader in this area , planting more trees than any other country .

With the 16th overall pick the St. Louis Blues picked during the 2010 NHL Entry Draft .
Tarasenko was the second Russian player picked in the first round after Alexander Burmistrov , picked up by Atlanta with the 8th pick .
Tarasenko , 18 , had two excellent seasons in the KHL .
This year he scored 24 points with Sibir Novosibirsk .
Tarasenko has already announced that he ’s going to spend the 10 - 11 season back home in Russia , but it looks like the Blues were n’t scared about this .
Tarasenko is under contract until 2012 .
Image caption Police say thousands of workers clashed with security forces at Ashulia
Owners have shut all 250 garment factories at one of Bangladesh 's main manufacturing zones after violent protests by workers over wages .
Employers say production at Ashulia near Dhaka has stopped indefinitely .
Thousands of workers reacted angrily to the news , burning tyres and smashing vehicles in a third day of protests .
Bangladesh relies heavily on textile exports .
Among factories shut were ones supplying Walmart , H&M , Zara , and Carrefour , manufacturers said .
Pay and working conditions in factories in Bangladesh have long been a source of concern .
The BBC's Mark Dummett in Dhaka says the industrial unrest is the worst Bangladesh has seen in several years .
' Anarchy '
Workers want three times the current minimum wage of $ 25 ( £ 17 ) a month .
The rate , set by the Bangladesh government , was last raised in 2006 .
The latest unrest over pay began on Saturday , since when there has been a wave of violent demonstrations .
Manufacturers say they cannot keep their factories open because of the violence .
On Monday , tens of thousands of workers walked out of factories and held protests in Ashulia , about 30 km ( 20 miles ) north of Dhaka .
Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas .
Workers pelted them with stones and set vehicles alight .
Thousands of protesters returned to the streets again on Tuesday when they heard about the factory closures .
" Striking workers picketed on the street , by burning tyres and smashing vehicles and set fire to a truck , " Dhaka district police chief Iqbal Bahar told the BBC .
He said the situation had later been brought under control .
At least 30 people were reported to have been injured in the latest unrest .
Siddiqur Rahman , vice - president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters ' Association ( BGMEA ) , told the BBC there was now " a state of anarchy " in Ashulia 's garment factories .
" In the past few weeks , angry workers vandalised around 200 garment factories , " he said .
" We feel insecure and unable to run the factories for the collapse of the law and order situation .
So we closed down all 250 factories in Ashulia . "
Mr Rahman said that garment factories inside another key manufacturing area - the Export Processing Zone - were still working .
Poorly paid
Garments are easily Bangladesh 's biggest export , accounting for more than 80 % of annual export earnings worth $ 15bn .
Our correspondent says food and property prices have risen sharply since the minimum wage was last raised in 2006 .
The current salary means Bangladeshi garment workers are among the lowest paid in the world .
This has led to a boom in recent years as factory owners have won hundreds of new contracts .
Factory owners say growth will be damaged if they increase salaries , but workers say they are not being paid a living wage .
From the YouTube posting :
" All the World is a Stage Folks ...
Here is some " live " footage of the spill , direct from CNN .
Take note of the Stage door opening in the center background at 29 sec , 38 secs and 5.12 min into the footage .... oops ...
So How do they explain a door opening at 5000 ft under the ocean ...???
they are obviously not showing us the real leak .... so its either 10 times worse than they are telling us ... or its a hoax ... are all those tankers in the gulf skimming up oil or are they dumping it into the water ?
Maybe what is seen here is simply a reflection from a studio monitor screen and they simply dont want people to see the full extent of the damage .
But why on earth would CNN allow this footage to be released ... what is going on here folks ?
Are CNN up to their old tricks again ? "
I dunno , what do you think ?
Well ....
CNN has proven they are capable of doing such a thing before ... see the video below ...
So , is the Gulf Oil Spill Cam a FAKE too ?

At WWDC , Apple treated its Mac OS X and iOS programmers to a preview of its entirely revised Xcode 4 integrated development environment .
Here 's a look at what 's new and how it matters for end users .
Xcode 4 presents an entirely new user interface and workflow for developers , along with new components for compiling , debugging and finding and correcting common errors .
The result : better , faster code from more productive developers .
One window to bind them all
The first major feature of Xcode 4 , according to developers familiar with Apple 's plans , is the shift from the multiple window workflow that Xcode ( and its predecessor , NeXT 's Project Builder ) currently uses to a new single window interface .
Rather than spawning new windows to search code , debug , build , and set parameters , everything can be done within a single window that echoes components of the design of iTunes , including a LCD - like status display .
The new window presents a dismissible Navigator control ( akin to iTunes ' Source List ) , with icon tabs that can present a variety of different types of development - related information within the same window column :
a listing of projects and files
a symbol listing of classes and methods
a search feature that lists project - wide results
an issues listing of build errors
debugging information
breakpoints
a listing of build logs
The main area of the new Xcode windows is devoted to the document being viewed , whether code , a data model , or the project 's graphical interface .
This area can also be segmented to view multiple documents , presenting a comparison of their differences ( such as for comparing two versions of the same code file ) .
The content area also integrates support for viewing PDFs and other file types supported by the extendable Quick Look feature .
Above the content area is a new Jump Bar , which presents a hierarchical " breadcrumb " listing similar to the Path Bar introduced in iTunes and the Finder .
The difference is that the new Jump Bar is fully interactive ; users can click on any path along the bar and select a popup that allows them to navigate at that level .
For example , in the photo below , a user can click on Resources within the Jump Bar to view ( and directly jump ) to other resource files within that directory via a dynamic popup window that is displayed .

Now including Interface Builder
Apple 's Xcode Mac OS
X developer tools , adapted alongside the iPhone 2.0 SDK to also create iOS mobile apps , originally included Project Builder for working with code and Interface Builder for laying out a program 's graphical user interface and mapping elements of the GUI to the code that made it functional .
Back in the late 80s , the original developer of Interface Builder , Jean - Marie Hullot , showed the graphical development concept to Apple but was wooed away to Steve Jobs ' NeXT Computer , which made the advanced GUI builder part of its development tools .
Interface Builder was used to rapidly develop Tim Berners - Lee 's WorldWideWeb browser at CERN .
Apple later acquired the technology when it bought NeXT in 1996 , making it part of the Mac OS X development tool package with Project Builder , which the company has since renamed Xcode .
In Xcode 4 , Interface Builder is folded into the revamped Project Builder - based IDE to create a single tool for creating both the appearance and the functionality of applications .
The deep integration between the two components provides a variety of improvements in developing mobile and desktop applications .
Graphical elements can now bind their outlets and actions right into source code using a graphical drag and drop gesture .
A new Assistant feature in Xcode 4 allows developers to work on the GUI and source code at the same time ( below ) .
On page 3 of 3 : Fixit , LLVM , LLDB , Instruments .
The Fixit feature
Developers report Apple has also introduced a new Fixit feature that provides advanced code completion and flags common bugs or typos using the same red underlining that Mac OS X uses system wide to indicate spelling errors .
The Fixit feature can suggest appropriate symbol spellings and supply correct punctuation , assisting developers to write code faster while making fewer mistakes .
A static analysis can find and flag common bugs and errors such as a failure to properly release memory that is no longer needed .
Xcode 4 is also reported to support new version control features for collaborative development , enabling coders to checkout , commit changes and update content in projects stored on Subversion and Git version control systems ( which work with multiple versions of files over time , like Time Machine ) .
New tools also allow users to compare different files for changes over time that have been checked into a version control system and revert or merge code into the latest version .
Apple shares new LLDB debugger as open source with LLVM
Xcode 4 is also reported to include a significant new version of the modern Low Level Virtual Machine ( LLVM ) Compiler , which Apple has been supporting as an open source project to eventually replace GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) , the tool most Unix - based development systems use to convert source code to executable object code targeted to a specific processor .
LLVM is a modular compiler system designed to create faster , more optimized code .
The new LLVM Compiler 2 now supports C++ in addition to the C and Objective C languages , and compiles code up to twice as fast as GCC .
The code it creates also runs faster than code compiled with GCC , with Mac OS X code reportedly running up to 25 % faster and iOS code running as much as 60 % faster , just through improvements made in optimizing the compilation of the same source code .
Also within Xcode 4 is an entirely new debugger system Apple designed for performance and efficiency , resulting in faster finding and fixing of bugs .
The new debugger is modeled after LLVM 's modular architecture , and is therefore named LLDB .
Apple is also said to be releasing its internal LLDB project as open source , and will make it available to third parties alongside the open source LLVM compiler .
Playing new Instruments
Another major feature delivered alongside Xcode 4 will be a new version of Instruments ( originally code named Xray ) , Apple 's graphical tool for code performance profiling based on Sun 's DTrace technology .
The new Instruments adds new time profiler support for iOS development , and includes new features that help developers examine how their application code interacts with other apps and the system 's kernel , in order to find where apps are spending their processing time and allocating their resources in a very complex computing environment .

President Barack Obama , who got his start in politics in the living room of domestic terrorists Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn , and spent his first year in office apologizing for American history , has now decisively tipped U.S. foreign policy toward America 's enemies .
Events of the past week have left no doubt .
There is a pattern .
President " Let No Crisis Be Wasted " Obama twists events to justify his radical agenda .
A financial crisis becomes the excuse for a massive health care entitlement .
An oil spill is exploited to push an unpopular energy tax .
And a jihadist publicity stunt -- the Gaza flotilla -- becomes the occasion to throw Israel to the wolves .
One mentions Ayers and Dohrn not to dwell on the past but because -- hello ! -- the pair has been involved with the Free Gaza movement , one of the organizers of the so - called " Freedom Flotilla . "
Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez has announced that he , too , would like to participate in the next running of the blockade -- and why not ?
Obama has blessed the project with success .
By 1 ) declaring through Secretary of State Clinton that the blockade of Gaza is " unsustainable and unacceptable " ; 2 ) joining the United Nations Security Council in " condemn ( ing ) those acts which resulted in the loss of at least 10 civilians and many wounded " ; and 3 ) having a White House official tell the Washington Post that there is now a " general sense in the administration that it's time to change our Gaza policy , " the Obama administration has handed the terrorists a victory .
To review :
In 2005 , Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza , forcibly uprooting 8,500 Jewish settlers and evacuating all soldiers .
The Palestinians were left free to form their own government and run their own affairs .
Much of value was left behind .
MSNBC reported at the time that " American Jewish donors ... bought more than 3,000 greenhouses from Israeli settlers in Gaza for $ 14 million last month and transferred them to the Palestinian Authority .
Former World Bank President James Wolfensohn , who brokered the deal , put up $ 500,000 of his own cash . "
But the day after Israeli troops departed , the greenhouses were looted .
MSNBC reported : " Palestinian police stood by helplessly Tuesday as looters carted off materials from greenhouses in several settlements , and commanders complained they did not have enough manpower to protect the prized assets .
In some instances , there was no security and in others , police even joined the looters , witnesses said . "
In 2007 , Hamas , the Iranian - backed Islamist terror group , staged a coup and gained control of Gaza .
Too busy to tend greenhouses , they occupied themselves by raining 10,000 missiles on Israeli cities and sending kidnappers and suicide bombers across the border .
Israel imposed a blockade to prevent Hamas from receiving weapons or the materials from which to make weapons .
Egypt , too , blockades Gaza .
Food , medicine , and other humanitarian relief flow to the inhabitants on a daily basis through Israel .
There is no humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
As the Washington Post reports , " Gazans readily admit that they are not going hungry ... ( but they ) used to be earning $ 100 per day , smoking Marlboros and going to Egypt every two months on vacation . "
Hamas ' charter calls for Israel 's destruction , and for the murder of all Jews " no matter how long that should take . "
By focusing on the blockade -- as the jihadis and blockade runners would wish -- instead of on Israel 's justified self - defense , the administration has undermined our own arguments for defeating terrorists .
The administration let it be known that it had " warned " Israel to " use restraint " against the Gaza convoy .
There was no corresponding warning to Turkey about supporting and supplying the illegal flotilla .
Come to think of it , where was the U.S. warning to Turkey or Brazil for linking arms with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last month and easing Iran 's path to a nuclear bomb ?
The depths of Obama 's radicalism were evident a year ago , when he sided with Chavez and the Castro brothers against the people of Honduras as Chavez wannabe Manuel Zelaya attempted to seize power in violation of the constitution .
For an American leader to side openly with leftist thugs was shocking .
And when Obama lost his voice as thousands of Iranians braved clubs and bullets to demand their freedom , his values were suspect .
But this week is a new low .
Under Obama 's leadership , the United States has capitulated to terror tactics and the despicable temptation to blame Israel .
America has always been the one country in the world that reliably countered the bullying and grotesque double standards much of the world applies to Israel .
Obama has now joined the jackals .
What a disgrace .
Years before the nation 's capital legalized same - sex marriage in March , one church in Washington , D.C. , opened its doors to gay couples as part of its mission to establish an " inclusive body of Biblical believers . "
Pastors Christine and Dennis Wiley performed a 2007 commitment ceremony at their altar .
That action split the historically black church , prompting half of the congregation to leave .
Yvonne Moore not only left Covenant Baptist , where she had worshipped for nearly 40 years : she filed a lawsuit for her weekly tithes because , as she said , " They did n't respect the members enough to listen to us . "
Moore said she attended the 2007 commitment ceremony and found it " totally disgusting . "
" I do n't believe in that , I 'm southern Baptist , " Moore told CNN 's Soledad O'Brien .
" The bible speaks against that .
You can not take that in the church . "
So she sued the church for a portion of the estimated $ 250,000 that she estimates she had paid in weekly donations over the past 37 years .
Read how race and ethnicity can be a challenge to gay acceptance
Moore 's now former pastors believe that gay rights are a natural extension of the black Civil Rights movement .
" I do n't think we as a people have a lock on civil rights , " Pastor Dennis Wiley said .
The struggle for civil rights is something that Moore can relate to : Growing up in Florida , she said she was one of the first blacks to eat at a lunch counter in her hometown .
But she is still on the fence about comparing her situation , as an African - American , to that of the gay community .
She said Dennis Wiley asked her to consider the situation of her friend , who is gay .
" Dennis asked me ... ' How do you feel the way you were treated and just think about the way he was treated . '
And I was like , ' Oh , OK , ' " Moore said .
She later dropped her lawsuit , but has not returned to the church .
Editor 's note : CNN 's Soledad O'Brien follows a same - sex couple in their struggle against the legal and personal obstacles to become parents .
Can these men achieve a life as mainstream as their parents ?

Reddit does n’t link to enough Australian technology news and views .
So Delimiter decided we ’d start our own technology news Reddit — with hookers and blackjack !
In fact , forget the technology news Reddit !
Ever wished there was a dedicated Australian technology news aggregator like Slashdot , Digg , Reddit , Hacker News or Techmeme ?
Today LeMay & Galt Media — the company behind Delimiter — is granting that wish with the launch of Delimiter ’s first sister site , Delinker .
Like sites such as Reddit , Delinker will aggregate the best content from multiple publications online into one central repository of links .
Unlike Reddit , however , Delinker will solely focus on content that is about technology in the Australian context .
It ’s taking Delimiter ’s motto of “ Just Australia .
Just technology . ” to a whole new level .
While Delinker is a sister site of Delimiter , the site has no special relationship with Delimiter .
Readers are encouraged to submit links to Delinker from any mainstream or niche publication , blog , forum , Twitter account , Flickr posting or even a link to a talkback item on another site .
The sole basis on which an article will make it to Delinker ’s front page will be the number of votes it gets .
When we decided to setup Delinker , we were aware that a number of other technology aggregators already serve the Australian market .
First and foremost , of course , is Whirlpool — a massive site which continues to be Australia ’s largest aggregator of technology content .
However , Whirlpool predominantly publishes news and views only about the telecommunications sector , and there is no easy way for its users to vote stories up and down for inclusion on the site ’s front page .
Reddit also operates a sub-reddit for Australia .
But again , this aggregator is fairly broad and includes any news from Australia – not just the technology sector .
There are a couple of ways in which Delimiter will stimulate community interest in Delinker .
Firstly , every Delimiter story will be submitted to Delinker after being published .
In addition , every day Delimiter staff will submit stories to Delinker which we think are top stories from other sites .
The Delimiter Twitter account will no longer link directly to stories on Delimiter .
Instead , it will link to the same stories on Delinker .
This way , you can choose whether to vote those stories up , to try and get them onto the front page , or bury them completely by voting them down .
The Delimiter Link Blog — which has been using our forums to distribute links to readers — has been a bit of a failed experiment — it was unwieldy from the start and too complex , so we ’re going to stop using it as an avenue of distributing links to readers .
Like all web sites , Delinker will continue to be a work in progress .
After wrestling with a number of content management systems ( including Reddit ’s open source code ) , we ’ve finally settled on the relatively new Hotaru CMS to build Delinker .
Hotaru is an actively developed open source CMS which runs on standard platforms such as Apache and the MySQL database .
As Hotaru continues to be developed and gains new functionality through its extensive plugin architecture , Delinker will continue to be developed further and evolve to meet the needs of readers .
If you see a feature that we need , get in touch and we ’ll take a look at the idea , poke it with a stick and likely implement it .
Let us know what you think of Delinker !

Sarah Palin was on Fox News ’
Fox and Friends this morning to argue that the oil spill in the Gulf is not a good enough reason to not , drill , baby , drill .
Palin said , “ We still need to drill , baby , drill . ”
She also bogusly claimed that without offshore drilling energy production would be , “ outsourced . ”
Does she understand that the oil belongs to the companies , not the American people ?
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

When asked if she had changed her position on drill , baby , drill , Palin said , “ No , we still need to drill , baby , drill , and we need to drill safely and ethically , and if we do n’t do that here then we will be outsourcing our energy production and development into countries and foreign waters that do not have the strict standards that we have .
The problem here with Gulf spill is that we did n’t adhere to those standards , and the MMS did n’t regulate aggressively enough , and BP told the government some things that now we are finding out are n’t necessarily true , so there ’s a lot blame to go around .
Certainly , the American public ca n’t be blamed for the problem that we are seeing today that tragedy in the Gulf , and they should not be punished .
They should not be punished with cap and tax either .
A tax on energy that now Obama is talking about in kind of a response to the Gulf spill , and we should n’t be published by outsourcing our energy development anymore than we are already outsourcing . ”
Palin claimed that she did n’t support a moratorium on offshore drilling but she did call for government oversight .
( This sounds an awful lot like the same big government that Palin is always criticizing Obama for ) .
For a so called energy expert , Sarah Palin knows virtually nothing about how energy markets actually work .
Her claim that without offshore drilling American energy production would be outsourced is a lie , based on the even bigger lie that the oil drilled for in this country belongs to America .
This is absolutely and completely false .
Oil companies pay fees and royalties to state and federal governments for the right to drill .
Any oil that they discover belongs to the companies , not the nation where the oil is taken from .
The oil companies are free to sell their oil on the global market to anyone they please .
This is why offshore drilling does not ease America ’s energy woes .
If Palin was serious about keeping energy production in the US , then she would support truly domestic alternative energy sources , which really do stay in the US , not the big lie that America can drill its way to energy independence .
The very system that Palin is supporting is run by international corporations who extract oil from the United States and sell it around the world .
Palin tried to use an outsourcing argument to defend the very outsourcing that occurs with offshore drilling .
The reality is that there is not enough oil anywhere in the US to feed our habit .
Sarah Palin is selling the myth that America can drill its way to energy independence .
Cap and trade and alternative energy are n’t punishments for the American people .
They are possible ways for the US to get off foreign oil .
Of course , this is the last thing that a shill for big oil like Palin ever wants to see .
South African athlete Caster Semenya has been given the all - clear to return to competition by the International Association of Athletics Federations .
The 19 - year - old world 800 m champion has been out of the sport for 11 months after undergoing gender tests .
" The IAAF accepts the conclusion of a panel of medical experts that she can compete with immediate effect , " said a statement from the athletics body .
" Please note that the medical details of the case remain confidential . "
Semenya could now choose to compete in the World Junior Championships in Canada later in July , with October 's Commonwealth Games likely to be her main focus this season .
The teenager said : " I am thrilled to enter the global athletics arena once again and look forward to competing with all the disputes behind me . "
GORDON FARQUHAR'S BLOG
She may never win another race or she might go on to be the London Olympics champion .
Whatever the outcome , she deserves our sympathy , and those who made mistakes owe it to her never to repeat them
Semenya 's lawyer Greg Nott said negotiations with the IAAF regarding her return to action had been a lengthy process .
" Our direct negotiations with the IAAF representatives , through the mediator , have been ongoing for 10 months , " he said .
" Meetings have been held in Monaco , Istanbul and Paris , but due to the nature of the matter the parties resolved to keep the negotiations confidential . "
African National Congress Youth League spokesperson Floyd Shivambu was glad that the verdict had brought an end to the " wild speculations " .
" The African National Congress Youth League welcomes the decision of the IAAF to clear South African golden girl Caster Semenya to continue to be an athlete as a woman , " said Shivambu .
" It brings to an end the wild speculations that were pushed and celebrated by those opposed to the progress and success of South Africa 's historically disadvantaged individuals . "
The saga began before her victory in the women 's 800 m at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin last August .
After lowering her personal best in the event by more than four seconds at the African junior event in Mauritius , Semenya was asked by the IAAF to take a gender test prior to the world championships amid fears she might not be able to run as a woman .
Following the findings of initial tests , the IAAF asked South Africa to withdraw her from their team for Germany but Athletics South Africa ( ASA ) insisted she should run .
You have to take certain givens in life - if the IAAF says the girl is clear to run , she is clear to run and we have to find a way to beat her
UK Athletics head coach Charles van Commenee Semenya , then 18 , secured victory in the 800 m final in an impressive time of one minute 55.45 seconds , 2.45 seconds ahead of defending champion Janeth Jepkosgei .
The IAAF then ordered more tests , saying questions had been raised about her muscular physique , running style and recent stunning improvement in times .
In January , world athletics ' ruling body said Semenya was free to run competitively despite its ongoing investigation into her gender , but that was quickly contradicted by South African Olympic Committee president Gideon Sam who said she would not be eligible until the IAAF had made its ruling .
" Hopefully , this resolution will set a precedent so that no female athlete in the future will have to experience the long delays and public scrutiny which Caster has been forced to endure , " added Nott 's fellow lawyer Jeffrey Kessler .
Meanwhile , UK Athletics head coach Charles van Commenee said his association would accept the decision and his athletes would seek to " find a way to beat " Semenya on the track .
" I respect simply the verdict and the solution and the way forward that the IAAF gives us , " he said .
" I 'm that sort of person anyway in life .
I just stop at traffic lights when they 're red .
And when they say Dwain Chambers can't compete then he can't compete .
When they say we run over 10 hurdles I 'm not going to argue we should run over nine or 11 .
" You have to take certain givens in life .
If the IAAF says the girl is clear to run , she is clear to run and we have to find a way to beat her . "

These are on a case by case basis .
Why
Problem is , it 's a very slow process .
Each passphrase is hashed 4096 times with SHA - 1 and 256 bits of the output is the resulting hash .
This is then compared to the hash generated in the initial key exchange .
Alot of computing power is required for this .
My dopey little P3/700 laptop only tests about 12 passphrases / second .
To complicate matters , the key hash can be different depending on the network it 's implimented on .
The SSID and the SSID length is seeded into the passphrase hash .
This means that the passphrase of ' password ' will be hashed differently on a network with the SSID of ' linksys ' than it will on a network with the SSID of ' default ' .
For the DC13 Wardriving contest there was one contest that was particularly infuriating .
" The Last Crusade " had contestants attacking a series of access points to connect to a server behind it , each one 's security was stronger than the previous .
The last AP was WPA - PSK .
3 hours was slated for the contest , 1 hour was spend on the 4 previous APs ' .
We spent the last 2 hours running coWPAtty on 2 laptops and ended up failing to get the key .
The last 2 hours were very boring .
After the contest I began thinking that there had to be a better way .
Eventually the planets aligned and I figured out a way .
Problem was , how to get it accomplished
WHO
RenderMan : Initiator , argent provocateur
Joshua Wright : Original author of coWPAtty , added code to make this project a success .
Coding god
Thorn : Moral support , sounding board , critic
Dragorn :
Ass saving CPU wrangler and cool guy
H1 kari : FPGA god who gave us access to dedicated hardware for generating these tables
Twitchy : CPU Wrangler and all around great guy
Other peoples work contributed in - directly to this , but they deserve mention :
Beetle : CPU wrangler for the Shmoo groups rainbow tables
Dan Moniz and Patrick Stach : Fellow Shmoo rainbow table conspirators
Philippe Oechslin : For a kick ass paper on the Time - Memory Trade - Off
WHAT
The application of the Time - Memory trade - off is particularly useful in password cracking and cryptography .
One of the barriers that cryptography uses is large keys .
In order to test every possible key , the attacker faces a huge task that in some cases can take years .
However given the exponential growth of both processing power and storage , it 's concievable that an attacker could invest the time to pre-compute a lookup table for every possible key in advance of the actual attack , and commit that result to some sort of storage .
All future attacks now only require a quick lookup in the table and are very close to instant .
After investing the initial time to build the table , they no longer have to re-invest that time for subsiquient lookups .
This technique can also be refined through various sorting methods which go beyond the scope of the CoWF tables for WPA - PSK
In 2005 the Shmoo group released Rainbow tables for LANMAN hashes , effectivly breaking NT password security forever .
This project led to the inspiration for the WPA - PSK tables
HOW
Instead we looked at the project and broke it down into a way to quickly check WPA - PSK networks against known english words and known passwords quickly , while still leaving the option open for brute forcing the rest of the keyspace .
Selecting the most effecient dictionary and SSID 's computed became the focus .
Size was also a concern .
As we wanted to be able to distribute the results , we did 'nt want the results to be beyond the storage capacity of most users .
The first dictionary was a merged list of Websters dictionary , several lists of common passwords and the list of SSID 's we were computing for .
This list was sorted and all passphrases < 8 or > 64 were removed due to the minimum and maximum passphrase length in WPA - PSK .
The grand total words was ~ 172,000
The SSID list was taken from the top 1000 SSID list on wigle .
net .
The SSID list came to represent about 52 % of the Wigle database ( at the time ) of 5 million access points , which accounts for about 2.7 million known access points .
We figured this would give us the widest possible coverage for public use ( you could still compute your own hash tables for non-listed SSID's ) .
The resulting tables fit comfortably onto 2 DVD's
Joshua Wright , author of coWPAtty graciously accepted my suggestion of integrating pre-hash tables into coWPAtty and coded up the tool ( genpmk ) for us .
I spend the next month or so with a couple CPU 's cranking away on the data , generating 1000 SSID 's worth of hash tables from a 172,000 word dictionary .
Towards the end I decided to test the hash files and get some metrics on how fast they computed .
I setup a workstation to talk to a WPA - PSK AP with a passphrase that was known to be in the dictionary and captured the nessecary hash .
I launched the attack with the coWPAtty 3.0 beta 's and it was 'nt finding the key .
Eventually with Joshua Wrights help we dicovered where I 'd screwed up .
The password list had been saved in windows txt file format , leaving a hidden return character at the end of each line .
This return character was being hashed in as part of the password giving me all wrong results !
Fortunatly , before commiting harikari for wasting a months CPU time , Dragorn offered access to a 27 node cluster .
This cluster was able to compute the job up in about 3 days , and these files were working .
The result was a set of hash tables of about 8 gig total , comprising 1000 of the most common SSID 's , computed for 172,000 dictionary words
Tests and a demonstration at Shmoocon showed that a p3/700 laptop without a hash table , tested keys at about 12 keys / sec .
Including the hash table , the same laptop tested 18,000 keys / sec. 3 orders of magnitude faster !.
What would have taken 4 hours to test previously , now was testable in 10 seconds .
This would be particularly useful for auditors wanting to confirm that WPA - PSK keys in use were not common words .
Conversely this could also be used by attackers looking to find networks with easy keys , but as will be shown , that can be easily overcome .
We were not completely satisfied with this scenario and decided to go further and compute more words
Mark Burnett , noted password expert , donated his list of 400 K actual passwords harvested through google giving us a highly targeted set of words that we know people have used .
This was padded out with other obscure dictionaries ( medical , etc ) to an even 1 million words .
Twitchy donated about 14 3 Ghz CPUs to do the work .
After a month that involved him blowing several breakers and having to work topless to beat the heat , it turned out that I screwed up again and somehow the password list had control characters appended again !
It was at this time I was informed of H1 kari 's work in implementing the PBKDF2 hash function in hardware and showing massive gains in speed over a general purpose CPU .
1 card could compute 600 Keys / sec .
He managed to hook us up with a box with 15 of these cards , effectivly doing over 9000 Keys / sec !
What previously took Twitchy almost a month to compute , took H1 kari 3 days .
The end results barely fits on 9 DVD's and weighs in at about 33 Gb .
At this time we also had Josh Wright add code to support using coWPAtty to do the same attack on WPA2 which uses the same PBKDF2 key exchange , thus making the tables instantly capable of attacking WPA2 as well !
Ass covering
To get decent protection from WPA - PSK , you should use a very long , very random , alphanumeric string longer than 20 characters .
To protect yourself further , particularly against the WPA - PSK hashtables , you should use a SSID not on the top 1000 list .
This will force the attacker to compute thier own list , rather than use one of the CoWF tables .
All that said , you should be using WPA2 with a radius server to get more reliable protection .

Review by Gerald Caplan
The Politics of Genocide ,
By Edward S. Herman and David Peterson ,
Monthly Review Press , New York , 2010 ,
112 pages plus endnotes and index , ISBN : 978-1-58367-212-9 .
June 17 , 2010 -- Pambazuka News --
This is a review of Edward S. Herman and David Peterson ’s The Politics of Genocide , Monthly Review Press , New York , 2010 .
The 1994 genocide of the Rwandan Tutsi never happened .
This is this unfounded and disturbing allegation at the heart of a new book by Edward S. Herman and David Peterson .
Instead the authors claim that that it was part of an elaborate US conspiracy to “ gain a strong military presence in Central Africa , a diminution of its European rivals ' influence , proxy armies to serve its interests , and access to the raw material - rich Democratic Republic of the Congo ” .
Why they want to create such gratuitous hurt for the survivors of the genocide in Rwanda is ‘ impossible to fathom ’ , says Caplan , but their ‘ egregious views ’ ‘ relegate them squarely to the lunatic fringe ’ .
Edward Herman is a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania and David Peterson is described as a Chicago - based journalist and researcher .
Those who have read Herman 's work , some of it in collaboration with Noam Chomsky , will only partly know what to expect from his latest book .
Herman and Peterson argue that in a world controlled by the American empire and its media and intellectual lackeys , genocide has become a political construct largely manipulated by Washington and its allies .
The claim of genocide becomes an excuse for so - called humanitarian intervention that disguises malevolent imperial motives : ‘ The Western establishment rushed to proclaim “ genocide ” in Bosnia - Herzegovina , Rwanda , Kosovo , and Darfur … In contrast , its silence over the crimes committed by its own regimes against the peoples of Southeast Asia , Central America , the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa is deafening .
This is the “ politics of genocide ” . ’
Herman and Peterson give some examples that should be familiar to all who reject the notion of the US as a unparalleled force for good in the world .
The suffering of Iraqis under US - led sanctions in the 1990s , American support for Israel 's repression in Gaza and destruction in Lebanon , the American role in the brutal massacres of Guatemalans and Salvadorans in the 1980s , America 's backing for Indonesia 's blood bath in East Timor – all are true , all are appalling , and all have been thoroughly documented .
No doubt it 's good for a new generation to be reminded of these atrocities , invariably distorted or ignored by the mainstream media .
But I 'm not at all sure that it 's helpful to explore these issues against a frame of genocide , and it 's supremely destructive that incontrovertible incidents of American crimes , such as the above , are included with bizarre fictions that have poisoned the authors ' minds , such as below .
This was decidedly unexpected from Edward Herman .
Playing the `expert ' card
To this stage , this little volume might on balance just be considered recommended reading .
Despite its strange biases and excesses in belabouring its thesis , it 's a useful reminder of American double standards that should not be forgotten ( particularly given the disappointing record of the Obama administration ) .
But all of this is mere preliminary for Herman and Peterson .
Their main target , which is none of the cases mentioned so far , can be found squarely in the heart of the book .
It 's chapter 4 , the longest single section , and its purpose is to show that the 1994 genocide of the Rwandan Tutsi never happened .
In fact the entire ‘ genocide ’ in Rwanda is an elaborate American conspiracy to ‘ gain a strong military presence in Central Africa , a diminution of its European rivals ' influence , proxy armies to serve its interests , and access to the raw material - rich Democratic Republic of the Congo ’ .
The authors ' greatest bete noir is Paul Kagame , commander of the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) rebels during the 1990 - 94 civil war and 1994 genocide , long - time president of post - genocide Rwanda – and leading Yankee stooge .
Yes , in order to blame the US empire for every ill on earth , Herman and Peterson , two dedicated anti-imperialists , have sunk to the level of genocide deniers .
And the ‘ evidence ’ they adduce to back up their delusional tale rests solidly on a foundation of other deniers , statements by genocidaires , fabrications , distortions , innuendo and gross ignorance .
In this Grimm fairy tale , everyone who contradicts their fantasies is an American / RPF pawn – Paul Kagame , human rights investigator Alison des Forges , the head of the UN military mission in Rwanda during the genocide General Romeo Dallaire , and entire human rights organisations .
The main authorities on whom the authors rest their fabrications are a tiny number of long - time American and Canadian genocide deniers , who gleefully drink each other 's putrid bath water .
Each solemnly cites the others ' works to document his fabrications – Robin Philpot , Christopher Black , Christian Davenport , Allan Stam , Peter Erlinder .
It 's as if a Holocaust denier cited as supporting evidence the testimonies of David Irving , David Duke , Robert Faurisson or Ernest Zundel .
Be confident Herman and Peterson are now being quoted as authoritative sources on the genocide by Robin Philpot , Christopher Black , Davenport and Stam , Peter Erlinder .
In reality , there is only a relative handful of these American deniers , but the vast power of the internet makes them seem ubiquitous and forceful .
Any online search for ‘ Rwanda genocide ’ gives them a vastly disproportionate pride of place .
Besides the five cited by Herman and Peterson , this rogue 's gallery of American deniers also includes Keith Harmon Snow and Wayne Madsen , who will bitterly resent the authors for failing to invoke them in their book .
Let me take a moment on Peter Erlinder , since he 's been in the news recently .
( I wrote about the case the other day in the Globe and Mail ) .
As of this writing , Erlinder is in prison in Rwanda , charged , apparently to his great surprise , with genocide denial .
I regret this decision by the Kagame government .
I wish it had simply denied him entry when he provocatively showed up as counsel for Victoire Ingabire , a declared presidential candidate who is also controversially accused of being a denier .
But no one could really be surprised at his arrest – especially Erlinder himself .
For Erlinder has explicitly conceded , more than once , that he knows he has broken Rwandan laws on genocide denial , and not in his work as a defence counsel at the International Criminal Tribunal For Rwanda ( ICTR ) .
For example , in a February 2008 article titled ‘ Genocide Cover - up ’ , Erlinder writes that ‘ under the laws of Rwanda I too am a criminal “ negationist ” for writing this essay . ’
And in a May 2008 article , ‘ Victor 's Impunity ’ , he agrees that ‘ Under the laws of Rwanda , I have violated the ban against “ negationism ” by questioning the Kagame version of events . ’
Of course he considers the laws he violated to be unjust .
Nevertheless , he chose to enter Rwanda aware he had broken them .
Was this not daring the Rwanda government to lock him up ?
Why would they not when he had confessed his guilt ?
That was by no means his only provocation .
Erlinder flew to Rwanda last month directly from a conference in Brussels that was notable for its collection of deniers and accused genocidaires .
So extreme was the composition of the conference that one of the world 's most rabid Kagame - haters withdrew his participation .
Indeed , shortly after the conference French authorities arrested one of the participants , Dr Eugene Rwamucyo , accused of taking part in the genocide .
Perhaps even worse , Erlinder has shamelessly distorted a ruling of the ICTR on which he 's based so many of his attacks on Kagame and company beyond the Tribunal .
A 2008 judgment ruled that there was not sufficient evidence to find that Colonel Theoneste Bagosora , seen by many as the mastermind of the genocide , had engaged in a conspiracy to exterminate all Tutsi .
In a series of speeches and writings , including one of his better - known articles ‘ Rwanda : No Conspiracy , No Genocide Planning … No Conspiracy ? ’ ( Jurist , Dec. 24 , 2008 ) , Erlinder milked the decision for all he could .
The title of the article said it all , and the question mark of course really does n’t exist in his mind .
As he said shortly before leaving America , there ‘ was no conspiracy or planning to commit genocide or other crime ’ .
No planning , no genocide .
What could be simpler ?
( Once arrested , however , he found it far more prudent to declare that he in fact did not deny the genocide . )
Yet in none of his frequent references to this judgment has Erlinder thought it worth including the following statements from the judgment :
1 . ‘ Indeed , these preparations [ by the accused ] are completely consistent with a plan to commit genocide . ’
2 . ‘ It can not be excluded that the extended campaign of violence directed against Tutsis , as such , became an added or an altered component of these preparations . ’
Readers can judge for themselves whether this kind of intellectual dishonesty makes Erlinder a credible witness on any aspect of Rwanda history .
On the other hand , there are other writers on Rwanda on whom Herman and Peterson do not rely .
They are many in number and they are totally ignored , except for the late Alison Des Forges , who is shabbily denigrated .
In fact they include the overwhelming number of those who have ever written about the genocide .
They include academics , human rights activists , journalists who were in Rwanda during the genocide or soon after , and others whose work brought them in close proximity to the events of 1994 .
Without exception , every single one agrees there was a genocide planned and executed by a cabal of leading Hutu extremists against Rwanda 's Tutsi minority .
Except for Des Forges , plus Linda Melvern , whose indispensable oeuvre merits a lonely footnote , not a single one of the following authors is cited by Herman and Peterson :
Alison Des Forges Linda Melvern Alex de Waal Rakiya Omaar Gerard Prunier Romeo Dallaire Peter Uvin Rene Lemarchand Scott Straus Andrew Wallis Jean Hatzfeld Samuel Totten Mahmood Mamdani Scott Peterson William Schabas Timothy Longman Christian Jennings Fergal Keane Howard Adelman Astri Suhrke Villia Jefremovas Michael Barnett Alain Destexhe John Berry and Carol Berry Wendy Whitworth Allan Thompson Kingsley Moghalu Susan Cook Philip Gourevitch Carol Rittner John Roth Henry Anyidoho Patrick de Saint - Exupery Frank Chalk Bill Berkeley Colette Braeckman Jean - Pierre Chrétien Bruce D. Jones Hugh McCullum Ingvar Carlsson James Smith Shaharyar Khan Elizabeth Neuffer Alan Kuperman
Before we dismiss all these authors as tools of Yanky imperialism , it needs to be added that several of the most prominent – Des Forges , Uvin , Prunier , Lemarchand , Kuperman – are ( or were ) fierce critics of the post - genocide Kagame government in Rwanda .
Yet none has thought to retract their original views on the reality of the genocide .
There are of course also the many grim testimonies of both Tutsi who somehow survived and Hutu who are confessed genocidaires .
Both kinds are now widely available in published collections or online ; the three volumes by French journalist Jean Hatzfeld are a good beginning .
Not a single such testimony or collection is referred to in ‘ The Politics of Genocide ’ , and in fact I 've never yet met a denier who had the guts to make his case before an audience of survivors .
Nor is a single mention made of the testimonies of the few outsiders who remained in Rwanda through all or much of the 100 days :
Romeo Dallaire ( UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda–UNAMIR ) James Orbinski ( Medicíns Sans Frontiérès ) Phillippe Gaillard ( International Committee of the Red Cross ) Carl Wilkens ( Adventist Development and Relief Agency International ) Henry Anyidoho ( UNAMIR )
As it happens , I know all of the above and none has the slightest doubt , having lived through it , that a genocide organised against the Tutsi took place .
Three of them – Dallaire , Orbinski and Anyidoho – have written about their experiences .
Of course , some of Herman and Peterson 's most treasured sources like Robin Philpot insist that General Dallaire was also a US puppet .
So we can obviously ignore Dallaire 's views completely .
How deniers handle inconvenient opinions
As for Alison Des Forges , until her untimely death perhaps the most prominent scholar and activist on the Rwanda file , she is dismissed as following : ‘[ Prior to 1993 ] , des Forges had worked for the US Department of State and National Security Council . ’
Nothing more is said to disqualify des Forges , so we must conclude that simply working for these bodies demonstrates the unreliability of her views on the genocide .
That her MA and Ph.D. theses were on Rwandan history , that she knew the country for 30 years before the genocide , that she was among a tiny number of outsiders who spoke Kinyarwanda , that she spent five years after 1994 researching the crisis , that her ‘ Leave None to Tell the Story ’ is a highly - respected encyclopaedic history of the genocide – all this is irrelevant to Herman and Peterson .
In their obsessive anti-Americanism , they blithely smear des Forges entire life : ‘ Alison Des Forge 's career is best understood in terms of the services she performed on behalf of US power - projection in Central Africa , with this policy - oriented work couched in the rhetoric of ' human rights ' .
In the process , Des Forges badly misinformed a whole generation of scholars , activists , and the cause of peace and justice . ’
But if she was such a loyal American hack , why was she such an unrestrained critic of the United States ' great ally Kagame ?
This obvious contradiction is of no apparent interest to Herman and Peterson .
The work of the 1993 International Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights Abuses in Rwanda is similarly dismissed .
The Inquiry brought together four well - known human rights organisations whose investigation led them to conclude that the Habyarimana government was deliberately targeting Tutsi for massacre , that extremists anti-Tutsi rhetoric was growing and that anti-Tutsi militia were being formed .
Yet none of this needs to be taken seriously .
Why ?
Because the Commission was little more than an RPF front , ‘ either directly funded by the RPF or infiltrated by it ’.
The sole source for this very serious accusation – made by no others of whom I 'm aware – is Robin Philpot , Canada 's preeminent denier of the genocide .
Is Philpot 's charge remotely credible ?
Has he exposed some deep conspiracy no one else has ever detected ?
By coincidence , I know both the person who initiated the Commission of Inquiry , Ed Broadbent , and one of its members , William Schabas .
( Alison Des Forges was another member , representing Human Rights Watch . )
Instead of just dismissing the Philpot charge , I asked each of them about the Commission .
Broadbent , a former leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada , was then the president of Rights and Democracy , an independent Canadian - based international human rights organisation funded by the Conservative government of the day .
I spoke to him by phone .
Rumours of foul doings in Rwanda took him to the country in 1992 , he told me , and he was so shaken by the evidence he found of violence and discrimination against the Tutsi minority that he organised and mostly funded the International Commission to follow up his work .
He told me he is simply incredulous that anyone would claim a role for the RPF in its work , since it was n't true .
Broadbent asked William Schabas , then professor of human rights law at the Universite du Quebec a Montréal , to represent Rights and Democracy in this investigation .
Schabas is now director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland in Galway , where he also holds the chair in human rights law .
In an email , Schabas told me he had never been to Rwanda before this mission and knew nothing about the country .
‘ I certainly never detected any pro-RPF sentiment from Ed… There was one member who seemed to be a sympathiser of the RPF … Otherwise , many members were quite openly critical of or hostile to the RPF . ’
Is this just a case of ‘ he said –they said ’ ?
Does an open - minded reader consider that the accusations of Robin Philpot , a man who also believes General Dallaire was an American stooge , are as worthy of consideration as the two statements by Ed Broadbent and William Schabas ?
Are both Broadbent and Schabas , 17 years later , blatantly lying to me , just as Dallaire 's entire life for the past 17 years must be a lie ?
Or does one rather draw another conclusion about how the deniers operate ?
If there are views that contradict your own , you simply dismiss them as tools of either the US State Department or the RPF .
Further proof is not required .
Ugly Americans everywhere
Let me cite the authors themselves to assure readers I have n't exaggerated or distorted their extraordinary re-writing of history .
Chapter 4 of their little book is devoted to Rwanda and the Congo and its 18 pages constitute far and away their longest case study .
They begin by asserting that ‘ the Western establishment [ has ] swallowed a propaganda line on Rwanda that turned perpetrator and victim upside - down ’ .
In their Rwanda story , it 's not Hutu extremists , the Presidential Guard , the post - Habyarimana interim government and the interahamwe militia who were the ‘ prime genocidaires ’ .
It was the RPF .
As a matter of fact , ‘ the Hutu members of Rwanda 's power - sharing government could n't possibly have planned a genocide against the Tutsi . ’
In fact , President Habyarimana repeatedly refused , until literally the end of his life , to implement the power - sharing agreement set out in the Arusha Accords .
In any event , why the Hutu members of the government ‘ could n't possibly have planned a genocide against the Tutsi ’ is never remotely explained .
Next :
The 1990 invasion of Rwanda from Uganda was carried out not by Rwandans but by Ugandan forces under Ugandan President Museveni , the RPF being ‘ a wing of the Ugandan army ’ .
There is no source given for this assertion , which contradicts almost all other histories of the invasion .
‘ It is clear that Museveni and the RPF were perceived as serving US interests and that the government of President Habyarimana was targeted for ouster …
The Ugandan army and the RPF were doing what the United States wanted done in Rwanda . ’
This is the central thesis of the entire chapter on Rwanda , but the only source who actually ‘ perceives ’ matters this way seems to be Robin Philpot , the Canadian who denies the genocide , since he is the only source offered for this categorical assertion .
No other historian of the genocide of whom I 'm aware makes this claim and no evidence for it exists .
Turning Linda Melvern ’s seminal book ‘ Conspiracy to Murder ’ on its head , the authors give us ‘ an RPF conspiracy ’ to overthrow the Hutu government and capture the state for themselves .
Since one of their sources , Christopher Black , considers Melvern part of the ‘ RPF - US propaganda machine ’ , she too can be dismissed .
But then why , they want to know , has the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda ( ICTR ) ‘ never once entertained the question of this conspiracy ? ’
This is indeed a reasonable question ; I wondered about it myself .
Here is their answer : ‘ This , we believe , flows from US and allied support of the RPF , reflected in media coverage , humanitarian intellectuals ' and NGO activism , as well as the ICTR 's jurisprudence . ’
In other words , a giant US - led conspiracy is at work here .
Dupes like me and most other writers believe the US and its allies betrayed Rwanda by refusing to reinforce the UN military mission there , as general Dallaire was pleading with them to do .
Eyewitnesses in Rwanda believed they witnessed for themselves what was developing .
The media actually played a deplorable role in the first month of the genocide , confusing a planned extermination with racist views of ‘ primordial African savagery ’ .
And the many different ICTR judges over 15 years , from around the globe , all pretended to base their findings on the legal evidence .
Yet in reality , all this time everyone was subtly being manipulated by the United States .
Indeed , so subtle was the manipulation that the devilishly cunning Yanks left no proof of it .
Moreover , every leading member of the Clinton administration , including the president himself , Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright , after her stint as ambassador to the UN as Clinton 's Secretary of State , have shamefacedly admitted abandoning the Tutsi .
Each claims to consider it perhaps the greatest regret of his / her time in office , merely demonstrating , of course , what unconscionable hypocrites they are .
Herman and Peterson hammer their charge home : ‘ Paul Kagame and the RPF were creatures of US power from their origins in Uganda in the 1980s ’.
They have the undisputed evidence .
From Allan Stam , ‘a Rwanda scholar who once served with the US Army Special Forces , ’ they learn that Kagame ‘ had spent some time at Fort Leavenworth … not too far before the 1994 genocide ’ .
Fort Leavenworth , Stam explains , is ‘ where rising stars of the US military and other places go to get training …
The training that they get there is on planning large - scale operations .
It 's not planning small - scale logistics .
It ’s not tactics .
It 's about how do you plan an invasion .
And apparently [ Kagame ] did very well . ’
This crucial paragraph deserves a little parsing .
To begin , it 's absolutely no secret that Kagame was briefly at Fort Leavenworth , though Stam does n't mention how very brief his stay was .
Kagame himself has never kept it a secret .
Note too that Allan Stam 's credibility is based on two factors .
First , that he is a ‘ Rwanda scholar , ’ though I believe not a single scholar listed above ever cites his work .
Second , that he ‘ once served with the US Army Special Forces ’ .
Presumably this service gives him special insight into how the US army works .
Yet he presents not a single specific detail about Kagame 's few weeks at Fort Leavenworth that ties him to American interest in and plans for Rwanda , which no one has ever documented .
And since thousands of officers from nations around the world have passed through Fort Leavenworth , you 'd think that the thousands of large - scale invasions they would return home and orchestrate would be better - known to the world than they are .
Stam 's curious thought processes are on display again , thanks to another citation by Herman and Peterson .
By 1994 , Stam has written , Kagame 's ‘ sophisticated plan for seizing power in Rwanda …looks staggeringly like the United States ' invasion of Iraq in 1991 . ’
Perhaps it 's my failing , but I have no idea what this means .
Hutu genocidaires becomes dead Hutu victims
Herman and Peterson now take their argument further .
They have concluded that the all - important conventionally - accepted truth about the 100 days of genocide is all wrong .
In fact this was no genocide at all against the Tutsi in which at a minimum 500,000 / 600,000 and perhaps as many as a million unarmed Tutsi were slaughtered , along with many Hutu who would n't cooperate with the extremists ' genocidal conspiracy .
On the contrary .
They cite the sensational estimate by Christian Davenport and Allan Stam that one million deaths occurred from April to July 1994 , and that ‘ the majority of victims are likely Hutu and not Tutsi . ’
That the methodology employed to arrive at such an Orwellian assertion has been totally discredited is of no interest to our authors and never mentioned .
Indeed , even a million dead , mostly Hutu , is n't good enough for them .
They refer to ‘ a number of observers as well as participants in the events of 1994 [ who ] claim that the great majority of deaths were Hutu , with some estimates as high as two million . ’
With Herman and Peterson , you always have to watch your wallets .
Checking the endnote for this rather extravagant statement , we find the figure comes from ‘ a former RPF military officer Christophe Hakizimana ’ in a letter to the 1999 UN Commission of Inquiry into the genocide .
But that Commission , chaired by former Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson , had n't the slightest doubt that genocide against the Tutsi had taken place and their report harshly criticised the US and its allies for refusing to intervene to stop it .
So it 's hardly surprising that the Inquiry 's report never mentions Hakizimana and his accusations .
So how did our authors know about it ?
‘ We base this on personal communications with the international criminal lawyer Christopher Black of Toronto . ’
It will by this time come as no surprise to readers to learn that Christopher Black is prominent among the small notorious band of deniers who cite each other so faithfully and who alone are the sources for Herman and Peterson 's chapter 4 .
Even among the lunatic fringe of deniers , Black inhabits a universe of his own .
Not only is the genocide of the Tutsi a ‘ myth ’ , not only did France have nothing to do with it , not only did the RPF rampage ‘ across the country massacring hundreds of thousands of Hutu and any Tutsi who were seen as non-reliable . ’
As well , he asserts , before 1994 there was no ethnic problem in Rwanda , then 'a semi- socialist country considered a model for Africa ’ .
For perspective , I note that this authority on Rwanda visited North Korea in 2003 and emerged to describe it as ‘ a progressive , socialist country deserving the support of all progressive peoples around the world . ’
Black also considered Slobodan Milosevic completely innocent of the charges brought against him and believes Milosevic was consistently committed to a multi-ethnic Yugoslavia during his time in government .
Do I belabour the obvious by pointing out that not a single one of the long list of authors cited above mention either Christophe Hakizimana or Christopher Black ?
Yet they are the two sources Herman and Peterson give for their stunning statement that ‘ a number of observers as well as participants in the events of 1994 claim that the great majority of deaths were Hutu , with some estimates as high as two million . ’
The authors simply dismiss out of hand the widely accepted facts about the genocide .
‘ The established narrative 's 800,000 or more largely Tutsi deaths resulting from a “ preprogrammed genocide ” committed by “ Hutu Power ” appears to have no basis in any facts beyond the early claims by Kagame 's RPF and its politically motivated Western sponsors and propagandists . ’
With this single sentence , and with no further amplification of any kind , the question of the number of Tutsi murdered is closed .
But there 's much more about murdered Hutu .
It is no surprise to the authors that the RFP killed so many people .
After all , ‘ the RPF was the only well - organised killing force within Rwanda in 1994 ... Clearly the chief responsibility for Rwanda political violence belongs to the RPF , and not to the ousted coalition government , the FAR [ Rwandan army ] , or any Hutu - related group . ’
So much for the interahamwe , apparently figments of everyone 's imagination .
And for the Hutu Power and Zero Network hit lists , which many diplomats actually saw .
And for the explicit public threats against the Tutsi from RTLM hate radio and Kangura magazine .
In the report I wrote for the International Panel of Eminent Persons appointed by the Organization of African Unity to investigate the genocide , there is a chapter titled ‘ The Eve of the Genocide : What the World Knew ’ .
The report , published in 2000 and called ‘ Rwanda : The Preventable Genocide ’ , is still available online , so readers can access it in full , as indeed could Herman and Peterson .
Chapter 9 includes ( among much else ) the notorious 1990 racist document ‘ Ten Commandments of the Hutu ’ ; the dramatic increase in Habyarimana 's military budget ; the formation of the extremist radical Hutu party CDR ; the beginning of military training for the youth wings of both Habyarimana 's party ( the interahamwe ) and the CDR ; Leon Mugesera 's speech inciting annihilation of the Tutsi ; the repudiation by Habyarimana and many of his officials and officers of the Arusha peace agreement ; the opening of RTLM hate radio in mid-1993 , funded by Habyarimana 's inner circle ; the report by Belgian intelligence at the end of 1993 that ‘ The interahamwe are armed to the teeth and on alert ... each of them has ammunition , grenades , mines and knives .
They are all waiting for the right moment to act ’ ; the Dallaire ‘ genocide fax ’ of 11 January 1994 ; the constant flow of new arms to Habyarimana 's forces from France or from South Africa and Egypt paid by France ; RTLM 's broadcast on Match 1 , as reported by the Belgian ambassador in Kigali , of ‘ inflammatory statements calling for the hatred — indeed for the extermination of the Tutsi ’ ; the late March statement by the officer in charge of intelligence for the Rwanda army that ‘ if Arusha were implemented , they [ the Rwanda army ] were ready to liquidate the Tutsi ’ ; the several RTLM and Kangura statements in the last days of March and early April that something major and dramatic was going to happen within the next few days ; the public threat uttered on 4 April , two days before the genocide began , by Colonel Theoneste Bagosora , widely considered the ringleader of the Hutu extremist conspirators , that ‘ The only plausible solution for Rwanda appears to be the extermination of the Tutsi . ’
Can every one of these well - documented points actually be some fantastically clever component of the American conspiracy behind Kagame 's RPF ?
Do n't bother asking Herman and Peterson ; they do n't even try to explain them all away .
They simply ignore hundreds of different pieces of evidence pointing to a developing Hutu extremist plot to annihilate the country 's Tutsi .
Instead , they focus on the crimes of the RPF .
Despite recklessly throwing around figures such as a million or even two million Hutu killed , the numbers they seem to take more seriously total some 25,000 to 45,000 Hutu massacred from April to July 1994 .
As evidence they cite the investigation led by Robert Gersony for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees , and even though Gersony 's report mysteriously vanished , both UNHCR and the US State Department seem to have found these figures credible .
Typically , Herman and Peterson refer to the Gersony Report as ‘ a whole body of important but suppressed research ’ .
Maybe this reflects the problem of only reading other deniers .
Yet look at chapter 22 of ‘ Rwanda : The Preventable Genocide ’ , the report of the OAU - appointed panel , titled ‘ The RPF and Human Rights ’ .
It points out that while the actual Gersony report seemed to be missing , Alison Des Forges of Human Rights Watch had uncovered confidential notes based on briefings by Gersony and his colleagues .
On p.253 , the panel describes the supposedly ‘ suppressed research ’ : ‘ Gersony reportedly estimated that during the months from April to August , the RPF killed between 25,000 and 45,000 persons . ’
After reviewing all the other evidence we could , the panel approved the following paragraph : ‘ Our own conclusion , based on the available evidence , is that it is quite unrealistic to deny RPF responsibility for serious human rights abuses in the months during and after the genocide .
They were tough soldiers in the middle of a murderous civil war made infinitely more vicious by the genocide directed by their enemies against their ethnic kin…Some had lost family and were aggressively looking for revenge .
But none of these factors excuse the excesses of which they [ the RPF ] were guilty . ’
So in fact the so - called suppressed research by Gersony has been well - known for years .
But the panel also knew this :
The fact of the genocide against the Tutsi was proved beyond any question , and while 25 - 45,000 deaths is a huge and gruesome number , it pales beside the genocide being executed at the same time .
As noted earlier , the lowest estimate by serious scholars of Tutsi killed during the 100 days is 500,000 – 600,000 ; some believe it could be closer to a million .
Beyond that , the reason the catastrophe is called a genocide is precisely because it meets the definition laid down in the 1948 UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide : ‘ acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group ’ .
That 's what qualitatively distinguishes the organised and systematic campaign led by a cabal of well - placed Hutu extremists in government and the military from the terrible killings by the RPF .
That 's why the ICTR has deemed its priority to be the trial of accused genocidaire rather than of accused RPF soldiers .
It 's the well - understood distinction between the Nazis and the fire - bombers of Dresden and Hamburg .
All are horrific crimes .
But genocide is , in our world , the crime of crimes , and it comes first .
Final aspects of the great US conspiracy in Rwanda
Let me address only two remaining points that are integral to the authors ' case .
Almost every well - known writer on the genocide condemns the international community , led by the US , for refusing to intervene to stop the massacres of the Tutsi .
Richard Barnett 's book Eyewitness to a Genocide , for example , describes his year as a staffer at the US Mission to the UN – it happened to be 1994 – watching as the US and the entire UN chose to abandon Rwanda 's Tutsi to its inexorable fate .
Samantha Power found a large number of President Clinton 's senior advisers who contritely explained to her why they failed to support General Dallaire 's urgent cries for reinforcements .
Madeleine Albright , Clinton 's ambassador to the UN , has abjectly apologised for her role in leading the Security Council to decimate Dallaire 's puny military mission , and has righteously claimed that behind the scenes she attempted to get the White House to change its position .
Non-permanent members of the Security Council later complained they were kept in the dark about the real situation in Rwanda by those who resisted intervention , including UN Secretary - General Boutros Boutros Ghali .
All of this is now well known .
Here 's what Herman and Peterson have to say : ‘ What the United States and its Western allies ( Britain , Canada and Belgium ) really did was sponsor the US - trained Kagame , support his invasion from Uganda and the massive ethnic cleansing prior to April 1994 , weaken the Rwandan state by forcing an economic recession and the RPF 's penetration of the government and throughout the country , and then press for the complete removal of UN troops because they did n't want UN troops to stand in the way of Kagame 's conquest of the country , even though Rwanda 's Hutu authorities were urging the dispatch of more [ sic ] UN troops . ’
The endnote for this dramatic paragraph gives as the source ‘ the Rwandan UN ambassador Jean - Damascene Bizimana ’ .
Presumably , though , it 's only the last part of the sentence that comes from Bizimana .
Bizimana had been appointed by President Habyarimana .
When the President 's plane was shot down on 6 April , an interim government of Hutu extremists was formed under Theoneste Bagosora .
Bizimana remained in his post .
In one of the many mind - boggling sidebars of the genocide story , 1994 happened to be Rwanda 's turn to fill a rotating Security Council seat .
So Bizimana ended up representing a genocidaire government on the Council throughout the entire genocide .
Soon after the plane crash and the start of the genocide , Bizimana reported to his Security Council peers that the Rwandan military and its people had ‘ reacted spontaneously ’ and were attacking those suspected of being responsible for killing their president .
Bizimana 's peers eventually understood the obscenity of having a spokesperson for the genocidal regime sitting among them , but as the British ambassador told Linda Melvern , there was no procedure for getting rid of him .
The 6 April plane crash , as is entirely predictable , features prominently in Herman and Peterson 's Orwellian version of Rwanda .
The plane , a gift from French President Mitterrand to Habyarimana , was bringing from Dar es Salaam to Kigali not only Habyarimana but the President of Burundi as well .
Both were killed , along with everyone else on board .
In what we have seen is a typical trick of the authors , they state that ‘ It has also been important to suppress the fact that that the first Hutu president of Burundi , Melchior Ndadaye , had been assassinated by Tutsi officers of his army in October 1993 . ’
That this assassination happened is true ; that anyone has ever tried to suppress it is ludicrous .
Why Herman and Peterson insist on it is incomprehensible .
For the record , this incident is included in my own report , ‘ Rwanda : The Preventable Genocide ’ , in Rene Lemarchand 's chapter on Rwanda in ‘ Century of Genocide ’ , in Gerard Prunier 's ‘ The Rwanda Crisis : History of a Genocide ’ , in Stephen Kinzer 's ‘ A Thousand Hills ’ , and in Linda Melvern 's ‘ A People Betrayed ’ , just to mention the few volumes that I took down at random .
Far from being suppressed , virtually everyone who writes about Rwanda recognises the great impetus given to Hutu Power advocates in Rwanda by Ndadaye 's untimely murder .
Herman and Peterson have no doubt that the RPF shot down Habyarimana 's plane .
In fact they go that extra mile and add that ‘ the United States and its close allies …very possibly aided the assassins in the shoot - down . ’
The sole source for this ‘ very possible ’ charge is Robin Philpot .
As for the crash itself , the authors invoke the familiar figures of Michael Hourigan and Jean - Louis Bruguiere .
Hourigan is a one - time ICTR investigator who found a few disaffected RPF soldiers who accused the RPF and Kagame personally of responsibility for the crash .
Bruguiere is a French magistrate who used some of the same informants as Hourigan , as well as the testimonies of accused genocidaires being held in Arusha , Tanzania , whom he took the trouble to visit ( though he never went to Rwanda or spoke to a single RPF official ) .
He too concluded that the RPF and Kagame were guilty .
Alas for both of them , their case fell apart when several key informants retracted their entire testimonies , some declaring they had never said anything like what they were quoted as saying .
This is all public knowledge , yet the authors never even hint that the basis of Bruguiere 's conclusions had been substantially undermined .
It has always seemed most plausible to a majority of those studying the genocide that Hutu extremists and not the RPF shot down the President 's plane .
But proof was never available and the issue remained moot .
It 's been one of the great unsolved mysteries of our time .
At the beginning of this year , however , a new report appeared by an Independent Committee of Experts appointed by the government of Rwanda , with the explicit title Report of the Investigation into the Causes and Circumstances of and Responsibility for the Attack of 06/04/1994 against the Falcon 50 Rwandan Presidential Aeroplane [ sic ] , Registration Number 9xR - NN .
The head of the 7 - person committee was Dr Jean Mutsinzi , former Justice of the Supreme Court of Rwanda , now a judge of the African Court on Human and Peoples ' Rights .
The Mutsinzi Report is available at mutsinzireport.com , and my review of the report can be found at Pambazuka News 466 , January 21 , 2010 .
While my review regretted that the Rwandan government had n't sought an independent investigation to take place , and while the Committee had obvious pro-RPF biases , I nevertheless found their comprehensive report highly persuasive .
They also smartly included a ballistics report from staff at the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom based at Cranfield University that supported their conclusions .
The report demonstrates why the RPF could not have been in a position to launch the fatal missiles while elements of the Rwandan army and Presidential Guard had the capacity , the means and the will to do so .
The report also documents the only logical motive for the attack , one that many other scholars had already anticipated .
In the Dar es Salaam meeting of regional presidents that he attended on his final day , 6 April , Habyarimana announced what he had just told his own senior advisors .
After stalling for months ( a fact Herman and Peterson seem not to grasp at all ) , he was finally about to implement the Arusha Accords .
That meant power - sharing in government and the full integration of the Rwandan and RPF armies .
The personal consequences for many Hutu government and military officials would be disastrous .
The latter had long sworn , publicly and privately , that they would accept Arusha over their dead bodies , and had pressured Habyarimana not to succumb to external pleas to implement .
Finally , however , he decided he had no recourse but honour the agreement , and the extremists decided to nullify Arusha over their president 's dead body .
Any reasonable person open to the evidence , including the likely motivation for the deed , will find the Mutsinzi Report credible .
But I do n't expect for a second that Messrs .
Peterson or Herman or Black or Erlinder or Stam or Davenport or Philpot to accept a single word of it .
No more do I expect them to agree with a single word in this review .
They are well beyond evidence or reason or commonsense .
They live in a different universe of witnesses and evidence , enough to satisfy themselves that the world has gotten Rwanda wrong and only they in the world have got it right .
The tragedy of American anti-imperialism
Edward Herman and David Peterson have written a very short book that 's not nearly short enough .
It should never have seen the light of day .
It brings shame to its two American authors , its publisher Monthly Review , and all those who have provided enthusiastic jacket blurbs , many of them prominent in progressive circles – Noam Chomsky , John Pilger , Norman Solomon , David Barsamian .
If this is what Anglo - American Marxism , or socialism , or anti-imperialism has degenerated into , we can hang our heads in shame for the future of the left .
Why a lifetime anti-imperialist leftist like Herman ( and presumably Peterson ) wants to exculpate the Serbs of Bosnia , Croatia and Serbia of crimes against humanity is beyond my understanding .
Why would it not have been enough to point out that appalling crimes were committed by all sides , but in every case Serbs were one of those sides ?
The only conceivable reason seems to be that the US and its allies singled out the Serbs for attack , which ipso facto makes them the real victims .
Indeed , the authors ' ally Christopher Black perversely sees Milosevic as an heroic figure .
As we 've already seen , hyperbole and slipperiness are cherished tools of the authors , and not just in regards to Rwanda .
‘ The leading mainstream experts on “ genocide ” and mass - atrocity crimes today , ’ they assert , ‘ still carefully exclude from consideration the US attacks on Indo - China as well as the 1965 - 1966 Indonesian massacres within that country ’ .
First note the way they add ‘ mass atrocity crimes ’ to genocidal crimes .
In fact , in many circles it surely remains widely accepted that the US was guilty of appalling atrocities in its aggressions against Viet Nam , Laos and Cambodia .
As for the ‘ exclusion from consideration ’ of those Indonesian massacres , chapter 7 of Totten and Parson 's popular volume Century of Genocide , is titled ‘ The Indonesian Massacres ’ .
Two other similar examples :
In true conspiratorial fashion , they argue that the crisis in Darfur was exaggerated to distract attention from United States ' real African interest , the mineral resources of the Congo .
Why both were n't worthy of serious attention is beyond me .
Nonetheless , they insist that Darfur solidarity activists dishonestly succeeded in framing Darfur as the ‘ unnoticed genocide ’ , though many , including me , have long understood that it's been the best publicised international crisis in decades .
And they charge that it 's the calamity in eastern Congo that ‘ has been truly ignored ’ , even though numerous celebrities , including playwright Eve Ensler ( The Vagina Monologues ) , actor Ben Affleck ( at least four times ) , UN Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have all made high - profile visits to the Kivus .
When the US Secretary of State visits a small province in eastern Congo , you know it 's the opposite of being ignored .
Many of the Rwanda deniers flaunt their left - wing credentials .
As this essay makes clear , they are driven by their anti-Americanism .
Certainly I agree that every progressive necessarily must be anti-American to some degree or other .
But this little band has driven over the edge .
As Peter Erlinder once wrote , America is ‘ the most dangerous Empire the world has ever seen ’ .
Everything bad must be America 's responsibility .
There 's not even room for others to share that responsibility , though the French government 's complicity in the Rwandan genocide , for example , has been definitively documented and is now even implicitly accepted by President Sarkozy and his foreign minister Bernard Kouchner .
Why the deniers are so determined , so passionate , so intransigent , so absolutely certain , so satisfied to remain part of a tiny minority of cranks , is completely unknown to me .
Why they want to create such gratuitous , almost sadistic hurt for the survivors of the genocide in Rwanda is impossible to fathom .
But in the end , it 's irrelevant what furies drive their obsessions .
It 's their egregious views – not their motives – that matter .
And their views relegate them squarely to the lunatic fringe .

He recently published The Betrayal of Africa . ]
( Natural News ) Following its 2008 declaration that the chemical bisphenol - A ( BPA ) is a safe additive in food and beverage plastics , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) received criticism from consumer advocacy groups and others for neglecting scientific evidence that indicated the contrary .
The agency reluctantly agreed to review its position and recently reversed its position , declaring that it now has concerns about the safety of BPA .
Several scientific studies have verified that BPA is a highly toxic endocrine disruptor that can impede proper reproductive function and lead to cardiovascular disease , liver problems , and diabetes .
It is especially harmful during the early developmental stages because it hinders the proper development of organ tissues and glands and inhibits proper sexual maturity .
A 2009 Harvard University study found that people who drank from polycarbonate bottles containing BPA for just one week experienced a two - thirds increase of BPA in their urine .
Published in the journal , the study verified that the BPA used in containers leaches very easily into food and beverages , especially when heated .
Manufacturers of plastic containers have been using BPA since the 1960s because it helps to harden plastic and make it more durable .
It is also used in food can linings and other packaging materials where it leaches into food .
According to many studies , nearly everyone is exposed to BPA , including unborn babies still in the womb .
Despite mounting evidence concerning its dangers , FDA officials , in conjunction with chemical industry spokesmen , have long denied that BPA is dangerous .
After giving the chemical a thumb's up in 2008 , the FDA submitted its report to an independent panel of scientific advisors which lambasted the agency for failing to properly evaluate important evidence that indicated the dangers associated with BPA .
Recognizing that scrutiny of its failure was only intensifying , the FDA finally conceded that BPA is dangerous and that further research is needed to verify just how dangerous it really is .
Many manufacturers have already begun to voluntarily remove BPA from their products , particularly those that produce products for babies and young children .
Chicago , Suffolk County , New York , and Canada have all outlawed BPA from being used children 's products .
The FDA officially recognizes BPA as a food additive , a difficult category for which to make regulatory changes .
FDA officials have expressed support for reclassifying BPA as a " food contact substance " which would allow the agency more control over how it is regulated .

For any band , the upsides to playing a college gig can be incredible .
There ’s good money , free beer , and a room packed with , ahem , spirited college kids , and that ’s just for starters .
There are over four thousand colleges and universities in the United States ( not to mention Canada ) all booking live performances , but there are many more bands looking to play , and so , like anything worth having , getting booked at a college is hard to get .
There are a few significant differences between playing at a college and playing at a regular bar or venue .
For clubs and bars , making a profit off of shows is essential to cover overhead .
This is not the case for college concert boards , which have tens of thousands of dollars allocated to them with no expectation of it being recouped .
These boards are comprised almost wholly of students , who use that money at their discretion for booking artists , paying sound technicians and renting soundsystems .
This is why colleges generally pay performers more than regular clubs – because their main objective is entertaining students , not profiting off the show .
In addition to the higher pay , college gigs have residual benefits : a young crowd attracted by cheap tickets and on - campus advertising ( newspapers , campus radio , fliers , word of mouth ) , ( generally ) free beer , and many good concert programs will give bands meal stipends .
So what stands between you and these shows ?
First of all , connecting with the college students who book shows remains a daunting task .
Bookers at colleges book bands they know and like first , which are usually already - popular bands .
Second , colleges book shows in different ways .
Some let the student body vote on who they want to see ; others give the decision - making power to a handful of students .
Georgetown University , for example , generally puts on one big concert each year or each semester , and the students vote online for who they want to see .
Their choices can range from Kid Cudi to Third Eye Blind to Dirty Projectors , but whoever gets the most votes gets booked .
There are smaller performances on the calendars of such schools , of course , but these large once - a- semester shows are the bread and butter of most schools ’ booking agendas .
Unfortunately , I cannot imagine that most small or unknown bands will have very many opportunities to be booked at such schools .
For smaller shows at these larger schools , you ’ve got to assume you ’re competing against campus bands – bands that the booker will have heard of , that she knows can bring people out , and that wo n’t be any hassle to accommodate .
For most bands looking to play college shows , small liberal arts colleges are your best bet .
Their student bodies tend to have tastes that are a bit more hip ( - ster ? - pie ? ) , so even niche bands can draw a good crowd , and more people are willing to take chances on shows because they are free or low - cost .
Even so , these colleges present their own challenges to bands seeking gigs .
For example , Oberlin College , where I went to college and booked bands for a couple years , has three primary venues – a bar ( rock / pop / electronic shows ) , a coffeehouse ( jazz / folk / comedy shows ) , and a large chapel ( large performances / convocation speakers ) .
Each venue had its primary booking committee – SUPC , Cat in the Cream , and Program Board , respectively – plus another committee ( Concert Board ) that put on most of its shows at the bar .
Each group had its own sizable budget and brought several shows a semester .
Most of these committees were comprised of people who would generally bring a certain kind of show – one kid who mostly booked jam bands , one who booked rap acts , one who booked punk .
The artists they would bring would often be bands they already liked or had heard before – not usually bands who contacted them .
And even when it comes to opening acts , most openers are local bands suggested by the headliner , friends of the booker , or bands that have been bugging the booker to play and that they want to get off their backs .
As you can see , for a new or relatively unknown band or performer , it can be tough to land a college gig .
Many colleges do n’t book small or unknown groups , and of the ones that do , it can be hard to get through to a booker and get booked .
But it is possible !
And in the second part of this piece , I ’ll show you the best ways how .
Today Swype announced that its popular keyboard alternative is now available for public download for all Android users .
The free - for - all beta download will be available for a limited amount of time — a few days most likely — and is a feature limited version of the keyboard .
Folks that want the fully featured version will have to purchase a handset like the myTouch 3G with Swype pre-installed .
Despite its limitations , the keyboard is a worthy replacement for the stock Android keyboard and is well worth the time it takes to sign up and snag a copy while it is free .
Happy Swyping !

In a major victory for Google in its battle with media companies , a federal judge in New York on Wednesday threw out Viacom ’s $ 1 billion copyright infringement lawsuit against Google ’s YouTube , the No. 1 Internet video - sharing site .
The ruling in the closely watched case could have major implications for the scores of Internet sites , like YouTube and Facebook , that are largely built with content uploaded by their users .
The judge granted Google ’s motion for summary judgment , saying the company was shielded from Viacom ’s copyright claims by “ safe harbor ” provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Those provisions generally protect a Web site from liability for copyrighted material uploaded by its users as long as the operator of the site takes down the material when notified by its rightful owner that it was uploaded without permission .

Interviews on Fox ' News ' ; Complaints filed with FEC , State AG concerning bizarre Democratic U.S. Senate primary election
UPDATE : Rawl appearance on Hartmann : ' It 's about the sanctity of our elections ' ...
Brad Friedman Byon 6/15/2010 , 9:17 pm PT
Former Circuit Court Judge Vic Rawl 's official protest against the results of South Carolina 's Democratic U.S. Senate primary election last Tuesday --- when he was purportedly beaten by Alvin Greene , a jobless man who did n't campaign and did n't even have a campaign website --- will focus on what he describes as " systemic issues involving the software of the voting machine , " according to the four - term , former state legislator in an interview with Fox " News " today .
The video and transcript of that interview --- in which Rawl displayed a very impressive command of the issues surrounding the 100 % unverifiable ES&S iVotronic touch - screen voting machines used in the election --- are posted below .
It 's well worth reading and / or watching .
But first , Democratic House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn ( D - SC ) also appeared on Fox today where he said , " I believe there was hacking done into that computer . "
He later added , that because SC used the type of voting machines that have been decertified by so many other states , " maybe somebody wanted machines that were easily hacked into . "
Take a look ...

Clyburn 's comments are remarkable --- certainly for a currently - serving Democratic official , much less one as high ranking as he is .
Perhaps his comments will help change the way the bulk of the mainstream media has been covering this issue to date .
They 've been looking at everything but the obvious potential for computer failure or manipulation , even though Rawl has been going out of his way to point to it --- as we saw in his remarkable statement announcing his protest of the election results filed yesterday , due , in no small part , to " the well - documented unreliability and unverifiability of the voting machines used in South Carolina . "
Since speculating on the accuracy of the results , or lack thereof , is all that most of us can do , given the nature of the type of e-voting system in use in SC which offer zero proof of actual winners and losers , there is certainly every reason to believe the election could have been hacked .
The state 's woeful ES&S system --- both its voting machines and its central tabulators --- has been shown time and again , in scientific report after scientific report , to be easily manipulated , particularly by a well - placed election insider .
That said , there still remain other less nefarious explanations for the results , and it should also be noted that Clyburn got quite a few of the details --- albeit fairly minor ones in the scope of his main point , if rather important to the rest of the country --- wrong ...
Here 's the key portion of the interview , as it applies to the oft - failed ES&S voting machines in question :
GRETCHEN CARLSON : How did [ Alvin Green ] get enough votes ?
How did he win ? ...
Are you saying you believe that there was fraud in the vote counting ?
How did [ Alvin Green ] get enough votes ?
How did he win ? ...
Are you saying you believe that there wasin the vote counting ?
REP .
JAMES CLYBURN : I 'm saying I believe there was hacking done into that computer .
Remember , these are the same machines that the state of Ohio , the state of California , uh , Louisiana , uh and Alabama , I believe --- all outlawed this machine .
I think that 49 states have decided that this machine is not reliable , and ought not be used for campaigns .
Yet , South Carolina --- the administration of South Carolina --- decided to go down to Louisiana and buy these machines , machines that Louisiana discarded .
So , maybe somebody wanted machines that were easily hacked into .
The fact of the matter is , that 's a proven fact , and we had no business with those machines in South Carolina , but this administration made the decision to buy machines that 49 states rejected as being unreliable .
Why ?...
Clyburn is wrong in his assertion that " 49 states have decided that this machine is not reliable . "
In fact , though many states have indeed found the ES&S iVotronic unreliable for a number of reasons , including the fact that they can be easily hacked , and have either recommended against their use or decertified them all together , many are still using the very same Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) voting systems to this day .
In addition to South Carolina , the exact same ES&S iVotronic machines --- the ones without the so - called " Voter - Verifiable Paper Audit Trail " ( or VVPAT , the cash register - type tapes that print out a supposed record of the voter 's vote , even though few read them , nobody actually counts them , they can also be hacked , and they do n't actually have any bearing on how the computer records votes ) --- are still used , according to VerifiedVoting.org 's 2008 database , in Colorado , Florida ( for disabled - accessible voting only ) , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Mississippi , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Tennessee , Texas and Virginia .
The equally - unverifiable version of the ES&S iVotronic with VVPAT , is still used in Arkansas , Colorado , D.C. , Kansas , Missouri , North Carolina , Ohio , Wisconsin and West Virginia .
Moreover , similarly unverifiable DRE / touch - screen voting systems , also oft - failed , easily - manipulated and equally - unverifiable , though made by other private companies , are used in dozens of other states across the country .
Of course , as we 've pointed out in previous articles on this SC mess , simple machine failure , versus malicious hacking , is also quite possible with these systems , as they have failed on many occasions --- most notoriously , perhaps , in the 2006 FL - 13 special election for the U.S.
House when 18,000 votes disappeared in a race decided by just 369 votes .
Whether the cause was hacking or machine failure remains unknown to this date , though it did help lead Florida to return to paper ballots as they decertified all DREs other than for limited use to meet the disabled voter requirements of the federal Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) of 2002 .
There are other reasons that SC 's results could have been what they were .
Though not many .
As Tom Schaller at FiveThirtyEight.com has speculated , the only other known explanation at this time would be a wildly possible cocktail of combined factors like ballot position , and a tiny percentage of voters who knew who Rawl was , but did n't like him .
Though those factors would seem to apply to votes on paper - based absentee ballots as well , where there was an inexplicable 11 - point disparity with the Election Day votes cast on the touch - screens .
Once again , that returns us to the possibility of machine malfunction or manipulation .
And that is squarely where Rawl seems to be focusing his attention , as explained to Fox 's Bill Hemmer today .
The video is well worth watching or reading ( transcript is also posted below ) .
The most impressive part of it all , from where we sit , was early in the interview , when Rawl appropriately interrupted Hemmer to disabuse him of the notion that the major concerns were not in " the voting booth " , but in the software that runs the entire system .
Rawl has done extraordinarily well in a series of recent interviews over the last 48 hours , particularly given the speed at which he's had to climb the sharp learning curve involved with the complexities and concerns of Election Integrity issues .
The good news is that , as a former Circuit Court Judge , he should be very familiar with the idea of what actually constitutes " evidence " , and the fact that there is absolutely none to prove that either Greene won , or that he lost .
Rawl 's protest will be argued before the 92 - member SC Democratic Party executive committee in Columbia on Thursday at 3 p ET .
The BRAD BLOG has reached out to both Rawl and his campaign for a number of questions we still have , but we have yet to make contact .
We are , however , getting closer .

D.C. watchdog group Citizen for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) , took two actions related to the election .
In one , they asked the SC Attorney General to investigate whether " was induced to run for the Senate in violation of South Carolina law . "
In the other , they " filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) alleging that primary - winner Greene and three other candidates in the June 8 , 2010 Democratic primary in South Carolina : Gregory Brown , Ben Frasier and Brian Doyle and their campaign committees , violated the Federal Election Campaign Act ( FECA ) and FEC regulations by failing to file mandatory disclosure reports prior to the election . "
There has been speculation that Greene , who has said he saved up for two years in order to raise the $ 10,440 filing fee to enter the election , was a " plant " in the race .
He is currently scheduled to face incumbent Republican Sen.
Jim DeMint in the general election this November , unless Rawl 's protest leads to a new election , or if DeMint himself is somehow tied to a malicious scheme --- in which case , it could turn out to be DeMint 's Waterloo .

JUDGE VIC RAWL :
We are protesting the election based on what we consider to be software problems with the voting machines .
Systemic issues involving the software of the voting machine .
The only way you can prove that is by utilizing expert testimony on software , computer science obviously , statisticians dealing with historical statistical data and the votes , and , of course , political science people who are dealing with , again , historical voting patterns and demographics . :
We are protesting the election based on what we consider to be software problems with the voting machines .
Systemic issues involving the software of the voting machine .
The only way you can prove that is by utilizing expert testimony on software , computer science obviously , statisticians dealing with historical statistical data and the votes , and , of course , political science people who are dealing with , again , historical voting patterns and demographics .
BILL HEMMER : Yeah , it 's the voting booth that is at the core of your investigation .
Now , I can understand ...
RAWL : No , sir .
It 's not the voting booth ...
HEMMER : Go ahead .
RAWL : It 's not the voting booth .
It 's the software that runs the touch - screen , non-paper controlled machines .
HEMMER : Okay , now this ... these machines ... I believe the ones in South Carolina have been used in Louisiana and that Louisiana officials got rid of it and went to a new system .
Now I can understand in 2000 , a difference of 537 votes and we hold the Presidency up for 36 , 37 days , but this guy got almost 60 thousands ... or , sorry , 60 percent of the vote .
That 's a huge discrepancy .
What explains that ?
I mean , what 's your theory ?
RAWL : Well , theoretically , I have to rely on my experts .
And talking to experts is very interesting unless you are one .
However , it 's pretty clear that the patterns indicate a systemic problem with the machine .
And the systemic problem in my opinion , from the information that I have , is contained in the software .
HEMMER : Do you think this election , as some have theorized now , publicly , do you think this was rigged ?
RAWL : I do n't know if it was rigged or whether it was a technical error , it was a software error , it was a software breakdown .
I can't say it was rigged , per se , intentionally or otherwise .
But it certainly appears to be a software problem with the election .
HEMMER : As some have suggested , this Alvin Greene was a Republican plant .
Do you buy that theory ?
RAWL : I have no comment on what Alvin Greene is or is not .
I campaigned very diligently from March the first until the primary date .
I never saw Alvin Greene .
I never met Alvin Greene .
I never saw any materials whatsoever containing his name or campaign paraphernalia and that 's all I know about Alvin Greene .
HEMMER : On Thursday , the Democratic Party in South Carolina is going to take up your case .
In the 15 seconds I have left , will you win on appeal ?
And can you win , technically ?
RAWL : This is n't an appeal .
This is a protest .
And in a protest , you have to show that there is a significant problem , and that that problem has a significant outcome on the election .
An appeal would be from an adverse opinion by the [ SC Democratic Party ]
Executive Committee and I do n't know if I will appeal or not .
I cross that bridge as I get to it .
We take this situation one step at a time ...
HEMMER : Alright , if the story ...
RAWL : ... I would , however , like to make sure ...
Go ahead ?
HEMMER : One more thought you have there ?...
RAWL : I would like to make sure that people understand that this is not a campaign against two people that did nothing .
That is very disingenuous to my campaign people that worked very diligently from March the first until the Election Day .
HEMMER : I can understand that .
We 'll see what comes of this on Thursday .
If the news changes , I hope you come back .
Vic Rawl , I thank you for your time ...
RAWL : Yes , sir .
Thank you , sir .
HEMMER : ... out of Charleston , South Carolina .
Martha ?
MARTHA MCCALLUM : Must have been a shock to him to lose to someone who had never seen or run into on the campaign trail and never saw a bumper sticker or poster and then he wakes up in the morning and goes ' what ? ' .
It 's bizarre .

( Health.com ) --
Between puffs of his cigarette , Aristo Lizica explains why he's all for a smoking ban in public housing -- including his own housing project on the Upper West Side of Manhattan .
" When you smoke indoors , it hurts everybody , " the 59 - year - old says , leaning against an iron fence outside his building .
" It 's better for me to just make myself sick . "
Lizica would prefer to avoid making himself sick too , of course .
" I want to quit , " he adds .
" I know cigarettes are bad for my health . "
Yet he remains unable to kick the habit .
Federal housing officials are trying to help people like Lizica -- and his neighbors -- by making public housing smoke - free .
Full or partial smoking bans would reduce secondhand smoke drifting between apartments , prevent cigarette - related fires , and even help smokers quit , they argue .
" We see it as a win - win for both residents and housing authorities , " says Donna White , a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development , the federal agency that oversees public housing .
15 ways smoking ruins your looks
In a 2009 memo , the department highlighted the dangers that indoor smoking poses to the nation 's 2.1 million public housing residents , and " strongly encouraged " local housing authorities to implement smoking restrictions .
But doing so remains voluntary , and so far only about 4 percent of local authorities have taken the step .
" Change is hard , " White says .
Public health experts are hoping to light a fire under the cause .
In a paper published today in the New England Journal of Medicine , a team of researchers and attorneys from Harvard University argue that the health and safety gains of a smoking ban in housing projects would far outweigh the losses , which some say would include the privacy rights of smokers .
Yet smokers like Lizica could prove to be the biggest winners , the authors suggest .
" If federal officials and public housing authorities take this cue , we can expect to have large numbers of people quit smoking , " says the lead author of the article , Jonathan Winickoff , M.D. , a pediatrician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School , in Boston .
" That could be the single greatest health benefit . "
Although the exact numbers of smokers in housing projects are unknown , about 30 percent of Americans living below the poverty line smoke tobacco , more than 1.5 times the rate of those who live above it .
70 years of menthol cigarette ads
The idea that the government can tell people what to do in their own homes is controversial , however .
As Winickoff and his colleagues acknowledge , the smoking restrictions they support are " morally offensive to some " because the restrictions would be imposed on residents who are poor and unable to easily relocate if they disagree with them .
Indeed , not all residents of public housing support the idea .
" I do want to quit , but at the end of the day , we should n't care what others do , " says Esther Matos , 29 , who lives and smokes in Lizica 's housing project .
" Do n't bother me , and I wo n't bother them . "
Even nonsmoker Lizzie Middleton , a 65 - year - old survivor of lung and colon cancer , agrees .
" It may be public housing , but people still pay rent and bills and buy their own cigarettes , " she says .
" They have the right to smoke in their own home . "
But HUD officials and the Harvard researchers argue that smokers such as Matos are , in fact , bothering their neighbors and harming the health of those around them .
Secondhand smoke and third - hand smoke -- the toxic residue left behind on walls , carpets , and clothes long after a cigarette is extinguished -- are bad news , especially for children , pregnant women , people with chronic illnesses , and the elderly , Winickoff and his colleagues note .
These vulnerable groups are disproportionately represented in public housing , they point out , and may be at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome , asthma , respiratory infections , heart attacks , and cancer .
6 common smoking triggers -- and how to fight them
Just a few smokers can cause a big impact in a large apartment building , Winickoff says .
" Tobacco smoke can stick around for weeks , months , even years , " he explains .
" Smoke does n't know to stop at a doorway .
It travels through air vents and cracks in walls , along ventilation and elevator shafts , and up stairways . "
Smoking bans might also reduce the number of smokers and prevent young people from starting in the first place , says Michelle Mello , Ph.D. , a professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health , and one of Winickoff 's co-authors .
" If we can remove the constant exposure to this behavior as well as to the smoke itself , we also stand a better chance of keeping at - risk youth from beginning to smoke , " Mello says .
10 crazy ways smokers finally kicked the habit
Even proponents acknowledge that smoking restrictions could prove difficult to enforce , however .
Mello believes that smoking could be regulated in public housing in the same way that drugs and alcohol are , but she and her co-authors note that penalties -- including eviction - may be hard to impose .
Although cities such as Boston , Seattle , and Denver have begun to roll out smoking bans in recent years , most of the cities and towns that have implemented restrictions to date are small and have relatively few housing projects .
Social , sneaky , or skinny ?
The 7 types of smokers
Milford , Connecticut , is one of the few cities that have responded to HUD 's urging .
In March , the city 's public housing authority passed a nonsmoking ordinance that covers all 465 of its units .
( Current tenants have until November 1 to comply . )
" We 've had broad , positive support , " says Anthony Vasiliou , executive director of the Milford Housing Authority .
The day after the ordinance was passed , he says , a longtime smoker and public housing resident personally thanked him , and told him she believed the ban would give her the motivation to finally quit .
" Believe it or not , " says Winickoff , " even some smokers want smoke - free housing . "

The wiry Italian at the counter asks if I 've had the vastedda before and I shake my head .
I had spleen once , but it was at 9 o ' clock in the morning after doing shots with Fergus Henderson .
That morning , I could have enjoyed the braised tongue of my own shoe .
" You like chicken liver ? " the guy asks .
" If you like chicken liver , maybe you 'll like this , I do n't know . "
We have to compare things to other things to describe them , but spleen has very little in common with chicken liver .
And the fat French blood sausage I had in mind before is relatively dainty .
Spleen tastes like the boiled , grizzly flotsam of a prehistoric monster .
Like a fictional creature butchered and left to rot in an ogre 's cellar .
After a few bites I lift the bun to peek and the sandwich yawns an ancient , meaty stink .
The crumbly slices have pieces of chew ( artery , membrane , anonymous gristle ) .
Comparing things is tricky : spleen is more like meat than most offal I 've had , but less like it too .
Verdict : the sandwich at Ferdinando's is the size of a fist , incidentally , the size of your own spleen , and after eating it you will feel full , which is of course the purpose of a sandwich .
It also tastes awful .
( Hey , if you want something that tastes good , try what Mrs. Leonardi has for lunch , the five - dollar pannelle sandwich , a squishy bun stuffed with deep fried squares of chickpea batter and ricotta .
It 's lovely . )
Like so many culinary relics , pleasure is not its purpose .
Vastare , the Latin from which the street snack gets its name , means to lay waste .
It suggests an act of devastation .
And truly , if the universe were running too smoothly for your liking and you wanted to momentarily obliterate yourself with a sandwich , you could do no better than a vastedda .
The spleen inside tastes like the work it did .
It leaves the rank taste of blood in your mouth , confirms that you 're alive , reminds you that you 're meat .

We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
It may surprise you to learn that many of your favorite technology companies are headquartered in Taiwan .
Though these companies may not come close to big name companies based out of the United States or Japan in terms of revenue , the impact these companies have on the global IT market is tremendous .
If you 're a frequent visitor to OverclockersClub , you 've probably heard of several of them - companies like A - DATA , Acer , AOpen , ASUS , BenQ , Biostar , D - Link , ECS , Foxconn , G.Skill , Gigabyte , IOGear , JMicron , Kingmax , Leadtek , Lian Li , MSI , QNAP , Realtek , Shuttle , SiS , SilverStone , Thermaltake , TITAN Technology , Transcend , VIA Technologies , and many , many more .
Odds are there is at least one part in your current PC that was manufactured by one of these companies .
It 's no wonder then , that Taiwan is the perfect spot for a computer expo .
COMPUTEX TAIPEI , also known as the Taipei International Information Technology Show , is the second biggest computer expo in the world , trailing only CeBIT , and had nearly 120,000 visitors in 2009 .
Further stats from the 2009 show can be found here .
The last time OverclockersClub got to attend Computex was 2008 .
I , Andrew " ClayMeow " Resnick , am honored to be representing OCC at Computex this year and will do my best to provide you with a wealth of information .
I have attended CES the past two years , so I do have experience with trade shows , but this is going to be an entirely different experience .
I 'm here on my own - no large group like we have at CES each year .
It will certainly be a challenge , but one that I am very ready to conquer .
The Flight
For anyone residing in North or South America , the worst part about any trip to Asia is getting there .
My trip started at John F. Kennedy International Airport ( JFK ) in New York , with a scheduled departure of 7:00 PM ET on Saturday , May 29th , heading to Los Angeles International Airport ( LAX ) .
It was the one leg of my trip that I did not have a pre-assigned seat , and thus , of course , I was stuck with a middle seat - one of only two remaining at the time .
Though I did the self check - in , there was an attendant standing by helping me , and he asked me if I 'd rather have the other seat , as it was an exit row and thus had more leg room - I declined .
Why am I mentioning this ?
Because one should never underestimate even the most minute decisions we make in our life .
By some stroke of good fortune , it so happened that there was a couple split up , the guy having the window seat by me , while the girl had an aisle seat a few rows back .
The girl asked if I would be willing to switch .
Sure , it was further back in the plane , but giving up a middle seat for an aisle ?
No brainer !
So the trip started out rather good , but quickly turned frustrating .
The flight was completely booked , and while a flight attendant was playing musical chairs , we were informed that a connecting flight from Kiev was first arriving , and thus we had to wait for roughly ten people .
Thankfully , as you 're probably aware , the airlines seem to account for delays , so we still arrived at LAX on time , at 10:50 PM PT .
At that point , I now had to exit the terminal I arrived in to head to Tom Bradley International Terminal .
This involved me actually having to exit completely , and walk up a sidewalk to an entirely new building , which of course meant going through security all over again .
My next flight was n't scheduled to leave until 1:15 AM PT , however , so I had plenty of time .
After getting through security , I made my way to Gate 123A , which was literally the very last gate on the right .
After standing around for a little while , someone from China Airlines made an announcement that our gate was changed to 101 .
Yes , you guessed it - the farthest possible gate from where we were .
So I , along with a hundred other people , made our way past gate after gate to the other side of the terminal .
Me being a New Yorker , I quickly emerged as the leader of the pack , and by the time we were just halfway there , was well ahead of everyone else .
While walking the long trek from the northern end of the terminal to the southern end , I hear an announcement - our gate was now changed to 104 .
I arrive at Gate 104 , well ahead of anyone else , and ask woman at the desk if this is the flight to Taipei - she says yes , asks for my boarding pass , and issues me a new one .
Unfortunately , because of the gate change , our departure time was pushed back to 2:15 AM PT .
Remember , I 'm from New York , so to me , it felt like 5:15 AM , and I had to fight really hard not to fall asleep in the gate - really , really hard .
By the time I was in my seat ( again , an aisle seat ) , I was ready to pass out - indeed , that 's what I did .
Unfortunately , I did n't realize that we would be served dinner - I thought it was just a breakfast flight .
So an hour into the flight , I 'm woken up for dinner , which essentially means I had a power nap .
The whole plan , going into the flight , was that I 'd sleep through it so that I would be wide awake for my arrival in Taipei , early Monday morning .
However , after the power nap , it was rather difficult to sleep .
I took a combination of pills that are supposed to cause drowsiness , but it did n't entirely help .
Still , I fought the urge to just watch a movie and instead kept my eyes closed throughout most of the flight - until breakfast .
Again , despite the hour delay on leaving LAX , my flight arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport ( TPE ) at the scheduled time of 6:15 AM local time on Monday , May 31st , which is a full twelve hours ahead of New York .
After clearing customs and acquiring my one checked suitcase , I made my way to the exit where there was a driver waiting to take me to my hotel .
Not only is English taught in schools , but it 's mandatory , so I was rather surprised when my driver did n't speak English .
Thankfully , he was already aware of my destination , so the language barrier was n't much of an issue .
After a roughly 20 - minute drive , I arrived at my hotel , the Golden Palace Hotel .
Despite it being just after 7 AM , I had no problem checking in and receiving my room key .
Because it was early , I was also able to attend the continental breakfast , which in my opinion is a hell of a lot nicer than the ones in the U.S. Typically speaking , continental breakfasts in the U.S. are cheap , consisting of some breads , cereals and drinks ( coffee and juice ) .

DM : What is it about this particular historical moment that makes discourses of gay rights such an important resource for US / Western imperial projects ?
How do you account for the rapidity with which gay rights have been retrospectively mobilized as emblematic of Western freedoms ?
JP : This depends on what we qualify as rapidity and how we demarcate the parameters of this particular historical moment .
In my recently published book , Terrorist Assemblages : Homonationalism in Queer Times , I sketch the rise of the utility of gay rights discourses to US / Western imperial projects in legislative and consumption realms that coincides with the production of various visible subjects .
These are , I contend , the results of the ’ successes ’ of incorporation , of the cultivation of subjects of liberal multiculturalism that have played off each other to cohere a pernicious binary that has emerged — not recently , but during the last 40 years of the post - civil rights era — in U.S. legislative , activist , and scholarly realms : the homosexual other is white , the racial other is straight .
Heteronormative ideals pivotal to nation - state formation are now supplemented by homonormativities — what I term homonationalism .
I point to western liberal feminist practices that function as both precursors and historical continuities to homonational formations .
Islamophobic strands in queer organizing that I detail start appearing in the 1990 ’s , while welfare reform , neo-liberal privatization , market accommodation , anti-immigrant legislation , and counterterrorism initiatives contribute to the fractioning of race and class alliances and the proliferation of homonationalisms .
DM : The War on Terror has very rapidly obliged us to recognize the regressive capacities of a hitherto ‘ progressive ’ politics of sexuality .
This is an observation that we might generalize in respect of other , until now unquestionably ‘ progressive ’ forms of social and cultural politics .
Given the way in which any particular practice has the capacity to bear a qualitatively different meaning at different levels of analysis ( the local , the national , the global ) , and within different conceptual frameworks ( based , for example , on the positionality of social actors ) how does a meaningful postcolonial politics avoid overdetermination at any of these points of articulation ?
JP : The war on terror is one temporal marker but it is not originary nor foundational .
The book is and is not a ‘ post 9/11 book ’ insofar as it traces earlier historical trajectories that have been differently illuminated for some through the events of September 11th — trajectories already well - understood to others .
But within the formulation of your query the answer is already proffered : From what locations do forms of social and cultural politics appear unquestionably progressive ?
I was visiting friends at LUMS ( Lahore University of Management Sciences , Pakistan ) in February 2008 and was struck , as many of us often are when attempting to translate our work into different localities , by the paradox of being aligned politically yet deeply separated by the pragmatic impact of these politics .
Many discussions were had regarding the numerous examples that highlight how ‘ western ’ LGBTIQ attention to and intervention in certain situations , for example the Cairo - 52 , the execution of purportedly homosexual men in Iran , and most recently a case in Pakistan involving a transgender man and his female partner , often have detrimental consequences for those locally involved , demonstrating the fragile and tenuous links between diaspora and homeland , global and local .
I make certain theoretical interventions to highlight the problems with these forms of self - proclaimed progressive organizing and politics ; yet the very presence of the book itself articulates and reconsolidates queer theory as a Euro - Anglo phenomenon , and as such resurrects to some degree the epistemic violence it seeks to counter .
It was clear to me that I was negotiating not a homophobic resistance to queer theory nor sexuality studies ( forms of which proliferate in South Asian scholarship ) , rather reluctance to embrace a project so embedded in U.S. dominant forms of academic production .
Thus the failure of overdetermination is itself overdetermined — the book does not porously traverse scale nor can it or should it .
It is inextricable from the western epistemologies it seeks to dismantle , constitutive of and constituted by the neoliberal economic and cultural flows within which it is embedded .
But this paradox , then , also engenders surprising confluences , like meeting scholars at both LUMS and JNU ( Jawaharlal Nehru University ) in Delhi , India , who have read , for example , the ‘ Monster - Terrorist - Fag ’ essay that I co-authored with Amit Rai in 2002 .
Reading audiences and reception , to some extent predictable and yet simultaneously unruly , cannot be mapped or assumed in advance .
DM : In much of the work now being done on the subject of race and sexuality , there is the suggestion that the very practice of institutionalizing or mainstreaming queer itself functions in such a way as to occult the nationalistic / civilizational ( racist ) components of queer practice : it is as if non-heteronormative positions are somehow so dazzling that they can blind us to their divisive tendencies .
Can you comment on this sense in which the queering of dominant formations appears to go hand in hand with a racial myopia ?
JP : The ascendancy of queer is not just coincidentally occurring in relation to certain racial politics but is contingent upon them .
We also know that any single - axis identity politics is invariably going to coagulate around the most conservative , normative construction of that identity , foreclosing the complexities of class , citizenship status , gender , nation , and perhaps most importantly in the context of very recent events , religion .
One example is the implications of the 2003 Lawrence decision that decriminalized sodomy between consenting adults on the federal level in the U.S.
While a plethora of queer and feminist scholars deftly and cogently critique the limits of the ruling in terms of its protection of privacy , intimacy , normative kinship forms , and property over queer sex — in other words , the domestication of queer sex — they predominantly do so by assessing the impact of the decision on LGBTIQ subjects .
But the implications of Lawrence extend far beyond its obvious sexual referents .
I reread the case through its import for surveillance , racial profiling , detention , and deportation , looking at its impact on terrorist populations and the reorganization of Muslim sexualities and kinship patterns .
I think this kind of rereading , what Siobhan Somerville calls a ’ sideways reading ’ , is a potent tactic for destabilizing a homophobia vs. racism binary .
In the last chapter , ‘” The Turban is Not a Hat ” : Queer Diaspora and Practices of Profiling ’
I interrogate the disjuncture between queer and anti-racist organizing by looking at the plight of turbaned Sikh men targeted in 9/11 ‘ backlash ’ violence .
In some ways that chapter is the most generative one , I think , in that it puts the most pressure on what constitutes a legitimate literal sexual referent for and of queer theory , analysis , and activism .
At the same time it begs the question — is the problem perhaps the desire to formalize a proper object of analysis , a properly queer body , in the first instance ?
DM : Is the critical capacity of queer politics dependent on its status as an oppositional discourse ?
Does social acceptance mean critical failure ?
What are the implications here for queer as a feature of popular or democratic political struggle ?
JP : I would argue that the critical capacity of queer politics and queerness lies not in its status as an oppositional discourse but in precisely the antithesis of this .
The more crucial question in my view is not how or whether queer remains oppositional , but rather what is gained , lost , and kept in the claims to oppositionality .
I am less focused on conservative homonormative political formations — they are in a sense easy ( albeit absolutely necessary ) targets — and more fascinated by what claims to oppositionality insidiously conceal in terms of subterranean conservative proclivities .
One imperative that I think Terrorist Assemblages takes up is a deconstruction of the notions of ’ social acceptance ’ and ‘ oppositional ’ — these positions are always inchoate — putting under duress the tendency of queer theories to lionize resistance and transgression , or conversely to lambaste complicity .
I approach a range of subject positionings and discourses –homonormative , queer liberal , and queer diasporic — to underscore that they all claim oppositional and resistant stances , in relation to similar entities — heteronorms in particular — but also in relation to each other .
Uncritically lauding queer transnational and diasporic articulations of opposition works to mask the national , class , regional , religious based identities that are being continually recast through the miasma of oppositionality .
For this reason I concentrate on conviviality rather than oppositionality , resistance , subversion , or transgression — these are all facets of queer exceptionalisms that unwittingly ( and sometimes deliberately ) dovetail with numerous narratives of exceptionalism and progress in modernity .
It is precisely through these claims of exceptionalism – and a resultant celebratory queerness — that grounds for political change become stultified .
As cultural workers invested in social justice , we are so beholden to locating resistance and tracking its paths .
I wonder what would happen , what new creative thinking and activism would emerge if we would put that mandate aside , just for a moment .
What does queerness conduct ?
What kinds of contradictory desires , social forms , identities , possibilities and foreclosures does it give rise to ?
Rather than what does it mean , what does it do ?
DM : Can you elaborate on your suggestion in ‘ Queer Times , Queer Assemblages ’ that we move ‘ from intersectionality to assemblage ’ as a form of critical practice ?
What implications does this have for gay and lesbian activism ?
To what extent do the problems we are experiencing derive in part from the historical relationship between anti-racism and gay rights as social movements ?
JP : For me the most productive and salient methodological and conceptual tension in the book is that between intersectionality and assemblage – in fact , the first half of the book deploys and defends intersectional queer readings while the second half symptomatically rails against the limits of the intersectional representational critique that I advocate .
It ’s an unintended , but thus curious and instructive , tension .
Let me first qualify that my concern is not about the formative black feminist theorizing of intersectionality , which generated groundbreaking interventions into feminist scholarship , but rather about the reception and deployment of this body of literature that tends to reify intersectionality into forms of standpoint epistemology .
Particularly in women ’s studies classes , I have often noted students hailing intesectionality as shorthand to diagnose difference rather than being able to articulate it as a conceptual frame arising out of particular historical and activist contexts .
In feminist human rights arenas the concept is also being globalized , sometimes problematically , whereby the terrain of a U.S. - centric frame is transposed onto other regional and national locations without sufficient attention to differing epistemological category formations .
The critical practice of assemblage is a reading practice , first and foremost , meaning that the implications for gay and lesbian activism is not that it needs to create assemblages but rather that contemporary and historical organizing practices need to be read as always already assemblages , and this re-reading may then open up new avenues of thinking , speaking , organizing , doing politics — lines of flight , affective eruptions , affect , energies , forces , temporalities , contagions , contingencies , and the inexplicable .
Because Deleuzian - inspired assemblages prioritize encounter and movement over positioning and location , one can never know in advance ‘ how ’ to organize .
A main component of assemblage is that it resists the call to announce a complicity - versus - resistance binary , recognizing that complicities are multifarious and just as unstable as resistances , and our efforts ( including my own ) to redress the fetish of resistance by emphasizing complicity have indeed led to a reification of the polarity of the two terms .
Categories — race , gender , sexuality — are considered as events , actions , and encounters between bodies , rather than as simply entities and attributes of subjects .
But assemblages , as theorized by numerous philosophers , are not inhospitable to intersectionality .
Positioning is temporally double , understood both as a retroactive fitting , a tagging of where the body once was as it continues about its perpetual motility , and as propelling forward of forces of deterritorialization and reterritorialization , acts of enunciation amidst lines of flight .
The book is an assemblage itself , an encounter between queer theory and assemblage , an example of assemblage and the kind of movement that assemblage can foment .
So for me , thinking through assemblages also means inviting unplanned and irruptive ontological shifts — we cannot do our work the same way as before .
I think the contradictions in the book signal this process , of assembling and being assembled and re-assembled .
Finally , assemblages are open to their own self - annihilation .
Political critique must be open to the possibility that it might disrupt and alter the exigencies of its own possibility such that it is no longer needed .
This approach would be a queer rejection of the biopolitical mandate to reproduce , cutting through narratives of queer exceptionalism .
The challenge then is how to craft political praxis that does not mandate a continual reinvestment in its form and content .
Do n’t we ultimately want a world within which queer and anti-racist theory and activism no longer need to exist ?
DM : While the relationship between sexuality and race is not a new theoretical problematic , the war on terror has clearly shifted this issue further towards the centre of academic scholarship .
This is arguably reflected in the recent work of Judith Butler .
In respect of your theorization of race and sexuality , where are some lines of convergence and divergence between your work ?
JP : Butler ’s work has been profoundly influential for my own and I use her thinking in T.A. extensively , though not specifically for theorizing relations of race , sexuality , and globalization .
In her current work I do not think she is actually offering a theorization of the concomitant workings of racialization and sexualization , rather tarrying with the paradigms of the ‘ human ’ and the ‘ inhuman ’ , and still doing so predominantly through the lens of gender .
This is not to say that the specter of racialization is not implicit in her writing , but I would aver that her primary frame of reference is still a subject whose ‘ gender trouble ’ is the foundational moment of differentiation .
The other distinction I would point to is her commitment to conventional subjects and methodologies of philosophy , whereby my approach is rooted in an interdisciplinary cultural studies that foregrounds solid engagement with transnational feminist studies , critical race theory , and postcolonial studies .
My object of analysis is public discourse , and as such , I foster an archive — archival accountability , however partial , biased , and incomplete — that excavates , through a very deliberately broad citational praxis , the complexity of public debate fostered in activist , artistic , mainstream gay press , and alternative press realms .
Of course , archives are created , not found .
Part of my intent is to provide a landscape of the unfolding archives for others to build upon and interrogate .
DM : Many of the contributors to this edition of darkmatter acknowledge the centrality of your recent work to understanding the politics of race and sexuality in the current conjuncture .
Can you give us a sketch of what you are working on at the moment ?
JP : In Terrorist Assemblages I propose a rapproachment of Foucauldian biopolitics and Achille Mbembe ’s critique of it through what I call a ‘ bio - necro collaboration ’ , one that conceptually acknowledges biopower ’s direct activity to death , while remaining bound to the optimalization of life , and necropolitics ’ nonchalance towards death even as it seeks out killing as a primary aim .
I allege that it is precisely within the interstices of life and death that we find the differences between queer subjects who are being folded ( back ) into life and the racialized queernesses that emerge through the naming of populations , thus fueling the oscillation between the disciplining of subjects and control of populations .
The result of the successes of queer incorporation into the domains of consumer markets and social recognition in the post - civil rights , late twentieth - century era , these various entries by queers into the biopolitics optimalization of life mark a shift , as homosexual bodies have been historically understood as endlessly cathected to death , from being figures of death ( i.e. , the AIDS pandemic ) to becoming tied to ideas of life and productivity ( i.e. , gay marriage and reproductive kinship ) .
I want to deconstruct the poles of bio- and necro- politics much further , thinking about bodies and events that really confound and make much more fluid and contradictory these foldings into and out of living and dying .
Surveillance technologies and related bioinformatic economies — DNA encoding and species preservation , stem - cell research , digitization , biometrics , life logging capacity , GPS , whose role includes increasing the contact zones and points of interface between bodies and their beyond — force all sorts of questions about bodies and their materialities .
Eugene Thacker , Kaushik Sunder Rajan , and others theorizing bio-ethics have asked , what is a body in informational terms ?
Where does a body begin and where does it end ?
If we consider DNA encoding to be life — information as life itself — what is a life , when does it begin and end , and who owns it ?
If the value of a body is increasingly sought not only in its capacity to labor but in the information that it yields , a revaluing of otherwise worthless bodies left for dying , and species can live through DNA , what does it mean to be debilitated or extinct ?
These are of course older historical questions about the changing contours of what counts as a body reanimated by emergent technologies .
I am particularly interested in approaching these questions from the vantage point of queer theory to put duress on assumptions about what queer bodies are , and to see what queer methods entail when we let go of the discrete organic queer body as its literal referent .
Queer disability studies has taken up these issues , but bodies , queer bodies , are still bounded by their material outlines or their relation to its ‘ mutation ’ or deviance from the presumed organic wholeness of the body , as opposed to bodies as assemblages .
It is also a field that suffers from what Robert McRuer terms ‘ disability culturalism ’ that privileges representational politics , along with , Julie Livingston points out , a dearth of theorizing beyond Euro - Anglo liberal individual subject formation , indicating to me a need to think more broadly about debility , assemblage , bodies , and bio - necro politics .
What happens to congenital disabilities , for example , if they are understood not only in ideological terms as pathologies but as informational errors in DNA coding that can be corrected , that is , where the disabled body is productive rather than entirely excised from regenerative capacity ?
What counts as queer and gender non-normative bodies in bio-informatic and statistical terms ?
How does Sarah Lochlann Jain ’s suggestion that we are all ‘ living in prognosis ’ — that is , living ( and dying ) in relation to statistical probability of populations vis -à - vis health , illness , disability , debility , infirmity , and disease — give us a more dynamic and temporally flexible frame for comprehending our multivalent and ever - shifting relations to life and death ?
Most recently , however , I indulged my secret obsession and riffed on my favorite soap opera , General Hospital , with cultural theorist Jennifer Doyle , who is also a long - time fan .

DETROIT —
There are over 1,000 workshops , panels , plenaries and assemblies as part of the U.S. Social Forum here in Detroit this week , June 22 - 26 .
They cover every social , political and economic issue faced by the people and communities of North America and world .
Many of these workshops are small intimate presentations by groups like Kentuckians for the Commonwealth .
KFTC ’s workshop titled , “ The Struggle for Justice in the Coalfields of Central Appalachia and Colombia , ” highlighted the dire economic and ecological consequences of mountaintop - removal coal mining .
Vanessa Hall , a member of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth spoke with People ’s World following the workshop ( See video below ) .
Mountaintop removal replaced deep mining across Appalachia , resulting in huge reductions in mining - related employment , devastation of the United Mineworkers Union , and the near total destruction of the natural habitat that the miners and former miners live in the coal fields of Eastern Kentucky and surrounding areas .
Big coal corporations decided it was cheaper and more profitable for them to take off the mountains ’ tops to get to the coal .
Creeks , ponds and forests that once provided water , fish and produce to help sustain families for generations are now clogged with silt and polluted with coal tailings , iron and sulfur .
Mining families already devastated by the los of industry jobs now face the destruction of their homes , land , health and even their culture .
Hall said that one lesson they learned from the Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities struggling against displacement from their lands due to coal extraction is the “ use of cultural traditions to protect community . ”
KFTC took the initiative along with Witness for Peace to take people from Appalachia to visit the communities in the coal - rich areas of the South American country of Colombia who are facing similar conditions often created by the same mining corporations that plague Appalachia .
KFTC has also hosted Colombian mineworkers and people displaced by coal mining in Kentucky to share experiences , strategies and culture .
The health and environmental impact of coal is not just in the coal fields , but also in the urban centers of the U.S. where coal is burned for electricity .
Workshop presenters called on participants and the public to visit ilovemountains.org to enter your zip code to see if your electricity comes from coal that is ripping apart mountains and communities in Appalachia or elsewhere .
The solution to the problems in Colombia and Kentucky require dramatic economic alternatives , said Hall .
“ It all boils down to people being able to live and live sustainably . ”

NAIROBI , Kenya —
A grenade attack on a political rally in downtown Nairobi on Sunday evening killed six people and injured more than 100 , cranking up tensions ahead of a hotly contested referendum on a new constitution .
Three grenades exploded one after the other at dusk in Uhuru Park , a treed carpet of green that stretches the length Nairobi ’s central business district .
The explosions caused a panicked stampede among thousands of Kenyans who had gathered to campaign for a ‘ No ’ vote in the forthcoming constitutional referendum due in early August .
The injured were taken to Kenyatta National Hospital where the luckier ones were laid on gurneys while others , bloodied and battered , littered the floor of the overstretched emergency department .
The blood , death and fear of Sunday evening were an unwelcome flashback for a country still feeling the aftershocks of political violence that killed more than 1,100 people following the last elections .
Not a single person has yet been convicted although an investigation underway by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) may change that .
Political violence is nothing new to Kenya .
Since multi-party democracy began in 1991 politics and violence have walked hand - in - hand .
Tensions rise before elections often erupting in ethnic attacks stoked by politicians who emphasize tribal allegiances and stoke local animosities .
The run-up to the constitutional referendum on Aug. 4 has been hotly contested , as it was in 2005 when a proposed new constitution was voted down , setting the stage for the disputed and ultimate bloody election of late 2007 .
On Tuesday six politicians were called in for questioning by Kenya ’s National Cohesion and Integration Commission for alleged , “ hate speech ” during the campaign .
A new constitution is widely considered to be long overdue .
The current one dates back to independence in 1963 and since the early 1990s a replacement has been debated and even fought over .
The proposed new constitution trims the president ’s sweeping powers , devolves more authority to the regions and addresses long - standing land grievances often seen as being at the root of Kenya ’s strife .
But it also allows abortion , “ if the life or health of the mother is in danger , ” and special Muslim courts for “ matters relating to personal status , marriage , divorce and inheritance . ”
These latter clauses have upset Christian groups so Sunday ’s rally was a politico - religious affair with politicians and preachers standing side - by - side to condemn the draft law .
As the dust settled in Uhuru Park and emergency doctors tended to the injured , accusations quickly began to fly .
‘ No ’ and ‘ yes ’ campaigners blamed one another .
The ‘ no ’ campaigners said it was an attempt to frighten their supporters , the ‘ yes ’ campaigners that it was an orchestrated attack designed to win sympathy .
Church groups , like the ‘ no ’ campaigners , blamed the government for the attack .
“ Having been informed over and over that the passage of the new constitution during the referendum is a government project , we are left in no doubt that the government , either directly or indirectly , had a hand in this attack , ” the National Council of Churches of Kenya said in a statement .
“ Who else in this country holds explosive devices ? ”
President Mwai Kibaki and Prime Minister Raila Odinga support the draft constitution , so do the majority of Kenyans according to opinion polls , but the Christian lobby is powerful , as are some of the politicians arrayed against them .
These include William Ruto , higher education minister , regarded as the flagbearer of the ‘ no ’ campaign .
He is among the six called in for “ hate speech ” this week and is one of 19 politicians named in a public list of alleged perpetrators of the post-election violence .
Analysts say that many powerful politicians have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo or seeking to disrupt the planned referendum .
Even before Sunday ’s attacks there was evidence that some were willing to employ dirty tricks to undermine efforts at reform .
An early draft of the constitution went to the government printer only to emerge with a reference to “ national security ” inserted into the new Bill of Rights section .
It was a ham - fisted attempt to undermine the very rights that the new constitution is designed to enshrine .
A police investigation into who was responsible has led nowhere .
Senior government officials have called for calm and for Kenyans to wait for the result of the police investigation but there is so little faith in the police that people here are busily speculating over who
was really behind Sunday ’s attack .
Macharia Gaitho , a commentator for the Daily Nation newspaper , expressed the opinion of many when he wrote : “ If [ the police ] do not catch culprits within a reasonable time … I will have a license to draw my own conclusions based on who benefits from the murderous actions . ”

Image caption Some are opposed to Mtwapa 's relaxed attitudes
Ishmael , an openly gay Kenyan man living in the small coastal town of Mtwapa , just north of Mombasa , says that many gay men have come to live here , attracted by its open - minded and liberal atmosphere .
But this image of the town has been overshadowed by an increasingly vocal and mobilised anti-gay campaign which has been garnering local support .
This comes after similar moves in neighbouring Uganda and Malawi .
Human rights groups are warning that hardening attitudes to homosexuality in Africa are driving gays and lesbians underground .
Religions united
At Mtwapa 's Masjid Answar Sunna Mosque Sheikh Ali Hussein tells around 300 worshippers that homosexuality is a " sin " which should be " punishable by death . "
Image caption Esthe Kache is one of the politicians campaigning against homosexuality
Mr Hussein is head of an influential Kenyan organisation called the Council of Imams and Preachers .
He called a meeting after Friday prayers to talk more about homosexuality which was attended by local church leader Pastor Kenga Kahindi and around 100 locals .
The pastor agreed with the sheikh that the act was a sin but he said : " I do n't think they should be killed , but removed from society " where he thinks some kind of rehabilitation of homosexuals could take place .
The anti-gay message brings together local Christians and Muslims , including Councillor Esthe Kache who is the local leader from the nearby town of Mnarani .
" In the Bible , it is not allowed at all and the Christians and Muslims around here , we are not going to allow such a thing , " she says .
Cultural change
Ms Kache says that another big problem in the local area is HIV / Aids .
She looks after six Aids orphans in her own home and she highlights the good work of the Kenya Medical Research Institute ( also known as Kemri ) which conducts research and provides treatment and prevention advice to people with the virus .
Image caption Poverty is a real issue in Mtwapa
But Kemri's Mtwapa branch was targeted by an anti-gay mob on 13 February 2010 when a protest resulted in people being dragged out from the waiting room of the clinic and beaten .
Kemri conducts research on HIV / Aids among high - risk groups and works with male and female sex workers and men who have sex with men .
Mtwapa is developing fast , with a growing tourist industry bringing wealth and prosperity but some locals are afraid that it is taking them away from their traditions and culture .
Local resident Ali Salim , who works with drug addicts , is among those concerned about the changes .
" I see a lot of young girls and a lot of young men involved in commercial sexing . "
He sees a link between a gay lifestyle and the growth in the male sex trade as he believes that gay men want to convert others and " grow their number " .
Seductive politics
But Ishmael thinks it is a common misconception that homosexuality and prostitution are linked in some way .
I believe we are going to review our laws to suit society 's concerns Katee Mwanza , Kilifi district commissioner Religion , politics and homophobia
" This is not true .
Gay life is also about love and many gay men stick on one partner and that is it . "
He was shocked when anti-gay feeling flared up in the town .
" For a long time , gay people have been coming into the area openly and going to their own bars and night clubs without problem , " he says .
But the bars and clubs in Mtwapa have been upsetting some locals and have become a campaign issue in local elections .
Mufideh Mohammed is seeking to become a councillor and has been pushing the anti-gay message .
At a rally for women she spoke about the problem of homosexuality : " This has become the worst thing , we ask our women to protect our kids , especially boys . "
One of those already in power locally is Kilifi district commissioner Kate Mwanza .
He wants Kenya to follow the lead of Uganda , where an MP has introduced a private member 's bill which calls for homosexual acts to be punished by life in prison and the death sentence in some cases .
In Malawi , a gay couple was recently sentenced to 14 years in prison after holding an engagement party , although international pressure led to them being pardoned and freed .
" I believe we are going to review our laws to suit society 's concerns , " said Mr Mwanza .
The main concerns for people here are losing their cultural traditions and the arrival of HIV , drugs and prostitution .
The politicians ' anti-gay campaign is seductive as it seems to address these fears , without really having to solve them .

Tis the season for NHL rumors again !
While the month leading into the NHL trade deadline is full of trade rumors , the month prior to the NHL Entry Draft , which takes place June 25 - 26 in Los Angeles , and July 1 , the start of free agency , has become rumor season part Deux .
With the Bruins holding the second overall pick in the draft , as well as three more in the first two rounds , and general manager Peter Chiarelli openly saying that he is exploring the trade market to improve the team , the Bruins have already been the subject of numerous rumors over the past two weeks .
So let ’s take a look at three rumors that probably wo n’t go away until the draft or July 1 , and whether there could be any validity to them .
1. The Bruins and Oilers swap the first and second overall picks to ensure the Bruins get Taylor Hall
Chiarelli did n’t help to diminish the smoke on this one when he admitted that he had spoken to Oilers GM Steve Tambellini over beers about possibly switching spots at the top of the draft .
But in a recent report by Scott Burnside of ESPN.com , Tambellini pretty much made it clear that it will take a knock - your - socks off type deal for him to consider dealing the top overall pick .
" Someone said would you trade the pick ?
I said , honestly I can't imagine what it would take for me to actually say this makes sense for the Edmonton Oilers organization that I move this pick , " Tambellini told ESPN.com .
" If I can't think about it , I guess I always have to be open to suggestions .
But I can't really think of what that is right now . "
According to sources close to Taylor Hall , right now it is highly unlikely that Tambellini and Chiarelli strike a deal to swap the picks , but there is still a good chance the Oilers take Tyler Seguin instead of Hall .
2 . The Bruins trade one or more of their remaining first ( No. 15 ) and second - round ( No. 32 & 45 ) picks , plus a roster player and / or prospects , to obtain another top ten ( preferably top five ) pick so that they can draft one of the top three defensemen available in the draft
Chiarelli has made it very clear that he wants more puck - moving blue liners and there are three solid two - way defensemen available at the top of the draft in Erik Gudbranson ( Kingston Frontenacs , OHL ) , Cam Fowler ( Windsor Spitfires , OHL ) and Brandon Gormley ( Moncton Wildcats , QMJHL ) .
We reported that this was the case and ESPN.com draft guru Gare Joyce agrees .
The Panthers hold the third overall pick and , while they were reportedly rebuffed in an attempt to acquire the second overall pick from the Bruins , NESN.com was told on Sunday that there have been talks about the Bruins still trading for the third pick so that they can get one of the aforementioned defensemen .
However , keep in mind that Dale Tallon was one of the main architects of the current Stanley Cup finalists , the Chicago Blackhawks , and he built through the draft , holding on to top picks like 2007 second overall pick , Patrick Kane .
3 . The Bruins try again to trade for Maple Leafs defenseman Tomas Kaberle
At the 2009 NHL Entry Draft in Montreal , the Bruins and Maple Leafs reportedly had a deal in place that would have sent Phil Kessel ( who ended up in Toronto in another trade ) to the Leafs for Tomas Kaberle , but there was apparently confusion on draft picks going each way and the deal fell through .
Earlier this month , TSN ’s Darren Dreger reported that Leafs GM Brian Burke had once again made Kaberle available in an e-mail reminding other GM ’s that Kaberle ’s no-movement clause will be lifted on July 1 and goes back into effect in August .
If the Bruins had interest last year , what ’s to say they do n’t now ?
Kaberle would instantly bring that puck - moving , transition defenseman that Chiarelli wants and could quarterback a power play .
He has one year left on his contract , though , so both he and the Bruins would probably want to make sure an extension could be signed .
If the Bruins are unable to strike a deal for one of the top defensive prospects in the draft , they may set their sights on the 32 - year - old Kaberle , who had 49 points last season .

Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has urged Hamas to endorse a reconciliation pact drawn up with Egyptian mediation , AFP reported on Tuesday , citing the Egyptian news agency .
According to the report , Abbas highlighted the " importance " of inter-Palestinian reconciliation , adding that any outstanding issues between the West Bank - based Fatah government and the Hamas government in Gaza could be resolved during the implementation of the document .
Speaking in Sharm e-Sheik following a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , Abbas reportedly said , " If the paper is signed , we do not mind forming a transitional government or a government of technocrats or independents to oversee several issues , most notably receiving reconstruction funds .
" Gaza is slated to receive billions of dollars for rehabilitation and reconstruction purposes via the Palestinian Authority government .
Hamas refuses to sign the Egyptian document , saying changes must be made to it .
Last week , Fatah officials in Ramallah said Hamas had rejected an overture by Hamas to dispatch a Fatah delegation to the Gaza Strip to discuss ways of ending the power struggle between the two parties .

INFOGRAPHIE - Les personnes se rendant aux matchs de la Coupe du Monde supportent en moyenne 127 décibels pendant plus de deux heures .
A titre de comparaison , un avion au décollage en produit 150 .
Congress took its Memorial Day vacation before it could send the president a bill extending a number of safety net benefits like unemployment aid and insurance assistance .
Worries about adding to the short - term deficit caused some moderate and conservative politicians to bargain down stimulus ' deficit tag from $ 100 billion to $ 50 billion , but passage of the bill is still no cinch .
Here 's one reason it should be .
The deficit is concerning , but it 's not nearly as concerning as the unprecedented state of our job market .
Look at this graph , which tracks the percentage of total unemployed , who have been without work for 27 weeks or longer .
Stated another way , the number of Americans unemployed for more than six months is more than six million , and roughly equal to the population of Massachusetts .
You 've already heard many the conclusions one can draw from this graph .
It paints the picture of a labor force that faces deep structural upheaval and millions of jobs -- especially in industries related to real estate -- are simply not coming back .
Even for the jobs that will return , long - term unemployment atrophies skills and makes workers less competitive .
Conservatives have argued that this picture is the result of , rather than a rationale for , unemployment benefits that can last up to 99 weeks because unemployment insurance inflates the unemployment rate by encouraging folks to stay home and collect checks .
Certainly , subsidizing joblessness might encourage some folks to not seek a job .

But the San Francisco Fed found the impact was minimal : " in the absence of extended benefits , the unemployment rate would have been about 0.4 percentage point lower at the end of 2009 , or about 9.6 % rather than 10.0 % . "

Moat should not be approached , police have said
A letter apparently written by suspected gunman Raoul Moat has declared war on the police and promised not to stop " until I 'm dead " .
The 37 - year - old has been on the run since allegedly shooting his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart , 22 , and killing her boyfriend , Chris Brown , 29 , in Birtley , Gateshead , on Saturday .
A police officer was also shot in his patrol car in Newcastle on Sunday .
Police are dealing with an incident in Rothbury connected to the shootings .
A two - mile exclusion zone has been put in place and people living in the town have been advised to stay indoors .
Earlier officers surrounded a house in the Springwell Road area of Gateshead as part of their operation .
The public need not fear me but the police should as I wo n't stop till I 'm dead Extract from letter allegedly sent to police by Moat Letter from a ' killer and maniac '
The 49 - page handwritten letter allegedly sent to police by Moat , which was also handed to The Sun newspaper , said : " Last night I called 999 and declared war on Northumbria Police before shooting an officer on the West End A69 roundabout in his T5 .
" Rang again and told them they 're gonna pay for what they 've done to me and Sam .
" I went straight but they could n't let it go .
" The public need not fear me but the police should as I wo n't stop till I 'm dead . "
Chip shop robbery
On Thursday Moat was released from prison after serving an 18 - week sentence for assault .
Northumbria Police said that on Friday afternoon Durham Prison contacted them to warn them that he had threatened to seriously harm his former girlfriend .
She and her boyfriend were shot in the early hours of Saturday .
The force has referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
Anyone with information should call 03456 043043 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111
Police are trying to trace a black Lexus IS200 SE with number plate V322 HKX which belongs to one of Moat 's friends .
They are also investigating an armed robbery at a chip shop in Seaton Delaval on Monday night , about 10 miles from Newcastle , carried out by a man with a similar description to Moat .
Moat is described as white , 6ft 3in ( 1.90 m ) tall , with very short or shaven blond hair and a large muscular build .
Police said extra firearms officers from forces including Cleveland , Humberside , West Yorkshire , South Yorkshire and Cumbria , had been brought in overnight to aid in the hunt for Moat .
Lousy Way Of Protesting The Lack Of Porn On The iPad [ NSFW ]
Steve Jobs dreams about “ freedom from porn ” , but there are some who actually enjoy naughty content .
A few of them even decided to demonstrate their disagreement with Jobs ’ squeaky clean vision by dirtying up iPad ads in Berlin , Germany .
Ad-busting , as these folks are calling it , is n’t exactly a new practice .
It ’s a term that can be applied to various modifications of logos or ads – be to share an agenda or to amuse .
Here ’s a closer look at the iPad ad pictured above so that you can see what the cheeky Germans did :
Seems that the slight vandalism was intended to send a message of some kind , no ?
Either that or someone just wanted to give little old ladies walking through train stations a reason to gasp and shout that we should think of the children .

3 Ways to Financially Help Family — Without Giving Money
Right now , many are seeing firsthand the difficulties that can come with tough economic times .
You may be watching friends and family struggle with their finances , and you may want to help .
But you may be wary of lending money — or even just gifting it outright .
Money can easily come between the best of friends , and put strain on family relationships .
Even when you formally structure a loan and come up with a repayment schedule , things can get acrimonious if the situation changes , or if your family member is unable or unwilling to repay the loan .
Gifting money can be one solution to this , but many are wary of becoming a main source of financial support .
Money does n’t always have to be the solution when you want to help family and friends with their financial situation .
My husband and I feel very blessed that I have been able to maintain a freelance business throughout these tough times , and we have been able to help some of our family and friends .
Here are 3 ways you can help financially , without handing over wads of cash :
1. Provide a Place to Stay
Our relatives jokingly refer to our home as the “ Hotel Marquit . ”
We are willing to have relatives and friends stay whenever they need to .
My brother lived with us for a time while waiting to get into student housing and line up a job , and my husband ’s cousin is currently staying with us while he looks for a job and a rental so that his family can join him ( she ’s staying at her parents ’ with the children while they try to get back on their feet ) .
And , every summer , we play host to various cousins and siblings trying to save a little bit between the end of the college semester and the start of a summer job .
One of the reasons we are considering buying a different house is so that we have a little more room for house guests .
Of course , this situation can get out of hand if the guests do n’t ever move out .
We have n’t had that problem , since all of our relatives have been pretty diligent about improving the situation .
If you feel like you can trust your friends and family to ardently search for a better situation and move out within a month or so , you can open your home to them , relieving them of the financial stress related to trying to pay rent when there is no income .
2. Feed Them
You can also help by feeding your relatives .
My husband and I both have siblings ( and their families ) that we have over for dinner regularly .
They save the amount of money they would normally spend on one meal , plus we often send leftovers home so they can make an additional meal .
If your family members are in dire straits , you might occasionally buy a few extra staples at the grocery store and drop them off .
My father - in - law regularly purchases basic food items to help his brother and his ailing mother .
This can be one of the easiest ways to provide a little bit of financial relief for your relatives .
Making the help somewhat erratic can keep your relatives from coming to rely on you too much .
3. Help with Errands
When we only had one car , and that broke down , a kind friend in my neighborhood offered to drive me around to run errands .
This saved me bus fare , and was a tremendous help , since we were struggling at the time .
You can offer rides to work , or , if you are running errands , offer to bring your relative along so that he or she can save money on transportation costs .
Related to this can be helping with maintenance and yard work .
If you know how to repair something , you can offer your services for free , so that your struggling friends and family do n’t have to pay for repairs .
There are a number of little ways that you can make life a little easier for those who are struggling .
Bottom line : Providing financial help does n’t have to be about you handing out money .
There are many things you can do to help someone who is struggling , including just being available for emotional support .
Right - leaning Israeli politicians like to refer to Jerusalem as their " undivided capital . "
But iPhone users here and around the world found recently that the storied , disputed city had been split in two .
In the smart phone 's weather application , the listing for " Jerusalem " disappeared earlier this month and was replaced by " West Jerusalem " and " East Jerusalem . "
Both Israelis , who dominate the west part of the city , and Palestinians , the majority in the east , claim Jerusalem as their capital .
Israel annexed East Jerusalem after the 1967 Middle East War , though Palestinians ( and most of the international community ) never accepted it .
The debate over how , or whether , to divide Jerusalem is still one of the thorniest issues in Mideast peace talks .
Perhaps frustrated with the lack of progress in the peace process , iPhone engineers apparently decided to impose their own mini-version of a two - state solution by partitioning the city and , in essence , forcing users to pick sides .
Yesterday Chris Matthews hosted a documentary look at the Tea Party , right - wing militias , Republican extremists , and other components of what he calls “ The Rise of the New Right . ”
It was a generally adequate compilation of the genesis and evolution of the year - old “ movement ” to take our country back – to the Dark Ages .
While Matthews touched on many of the most troubling aspects of the New Crusaders , there was a noticeable absence of fervor when discussing the very real threats posed by a small but zealous group of reactionaries bent on terminating their ideological rivals .
The documentary efficiently checked off the major flash points , but did so in a rather detached manner that diminishes the dangers posed by giving serious consideration to a phony party that was created by corporatists , fed by media , and dependent on the willful ignorance that is the byproduct of greed and fear .
Nevertheless , the subjects of this program have gotten their panties in a bunch by what they regard as slander and a “ left - wing propaganda hit piece ” .
In response , FreedomWorks has joined with Tea Partiers to boycott an MSNBC advertiser .
For some reason they singled out Dawn Dishwashing Liquid .
From the FreedomWorks web site :
“ Tea Party leaders from coast to coast are fighting back against the smears by boycotting one of the network ’s sponsors , Dawn dish soap , until they cut off funding to MSNBC .
FreedomWorks believes it is important to join this effort , and show unity with other Tea Party groups in the face of these attacks by writing , calling and faxing the offices of Dawn ( and parent company , Procter and Gamble ) to ask them to stop subsidizing these vicious attacks by MSNBC and Chris Matthews . ”
There is a certain measure of irony in this boycott initiative .
FreedomWorks just became a sponsor of Glenn Beck ’s radio program .
Beck told his listeners that accepting FreedomWorks as a sponsor was a “ hard decision ” because he did not “ want to send the message to you that the way to restore our republic is through the political process only . ”
Despite his reluctance , Beck gave a full - throated endorsement to FreedomWorks and urged his audience to “ link arms ” with them and to “ get on every bandwagon ” they can .
First of all , Beck ’s pretension that he has some sort of aversion to politics is perhaps one of the best examples yet of his severance from reality .
He rants about politics and Washington every single day .
But more to the point , he has been the target of a surprisingly successful boycott that has cost him more than a hundred advertisers .
Beck has taken to the air to denounce these activists as commies and thugs who are out to deprive him of his Constitutional rights .
But now he is embracing a new sponsor ( one of the few not ashamed to be associated with him ) that is engaging in the same tactics that he fiercely condemns .
I have no problem with any group engaging in a boycott .
It ’s a time - honored part of democracy .
If FreedomWorks wants dirty dishes they are free to boycott Dawn or Ivory or Joy or any dishwashing liquid they like .
I am curious though as to why they singled out Dawn .
Perhaps it has something to do with this :
“ For 32 years , the International Bird Rescue Research Center has had a surprise weapon in the battle against the oil : Dawn dishwashing detergent .
After a 1971 oil spill , the California - based nonprofit group began experimenting with products including paint thinner and nail polish remover to find the least traumatizing method for cleaning oiled animals .
In 1978 , the researchers settled on the blue liquid soap . ”
Dawn ’s website claims they have rescued thousands of animals over 35 years .
They have donated 7,000 bottles of detergent to the current oil spill crisis in the Gulf .
Maybe a crony corporate enterprise like FreedomWorks does n’t like the fact that Dawn eliminates oil or that they help wildlife ( for the record , Dawn is an oil - based detergent and may not be the best overall choice for the environment ) .
Maybe an organization so wrapped in hypocrisy should be boycotting Palmolive , because when it comes to hypocrisy , “ they ’re soaking in it ” ( h/t Madge ) .
It ’s unlikely that the FreedomWorks boycott will amount to much .
Targeting a single product would n’t cause much of a dent even if they were successful in getting P&G to stop running ads for Dawn .
And FreedomWorks is n’t even focusing their effort on Chris Matthews ’ show but at the MSNBC network .
Their announcement of the boycott leads off with this bit of bravado :
“ If MSNBC ‘s ratings could go down any further , they would after this show . ”
FreedomWorks may be disheartened to learn that the Matthews documentary posted the second highest rating for the network during primetime as well as being the # 2 program in its time period .
The documentary performed more than 60 % better than Matthews ’ average rating for May 2010 .
If Tea Baggers do n’t like seeing themselves portrayed as militant nutcases , then they should stop acting like them and associating with them .
They should stop embracing leaders like Beck , Sarah Palin , and Newt Gingrich , who frequently use hostile rhetoric .
Gingrich even called the Tea Party the “ militant wing of the GOP . ”
Lashing out at relatively mild documentaries and boycotting their advertisers is n’t going to gain them much respect .
To the contrary , it will reveal just how small and impotent a minority they really are .
And as for losing viewers , it ’s not like FreedomWorks members were ever in MSNBC ’s audience in the first place .

Also known as Cinnamon - Chocolate Cake . . .
In my family , we have a sort of strange New Year ’s Day tradition .
Of course , we have our black eyed peas for luck and our collards for money . . .
But we also have a dessert called Money Cake .
It has sort of developed from the tradition of the King Cake – which is made in France to celebrate the Epiphany , which falls on Jan. 6 every year , and marks the day when the Wise Men arrived to visit baby Jesus .
With the King Cake , a trinket ( usually a figurine of the baby Jesus ) is baked in a cake , and whoever gets the trinket in their piece is King for the day .
Well , there ’s also an English tradition of baking a bean and a pea in a pie , and the man and woman who get these are the king and queen for the day .
Somehow in my mom’s English - Canadian family this has morphed into our Money Cake .
We sanitize 2 quarters , 4 dimes , 6 nickels , and 8 pennies and wrap each one in wax paper .
Then we drop the coins randomly into the cake batter before the cake goes in the oven .
The coins bake inside the cake , and pretty much each person ’s piece of cake ends up having a coin inside .
The two quarters are for the king and queen , if you get a dime you are a prince or princess , if you get a nickel , you are a duke or duchess , and if you get a penny ?
You are a lowly peasant !
The best way to sanitize the coins is to wash them in soapy water and then boil them in a shallow pot of water .
Over the years , we have made the Money Cake with a chocolate pound cake recipe , a regular chocolate cake recipe , but most frequently it ’s a Cinnamon Chocolate Cake .
This cake is moist , fluffy , mild , delicious , and festive .
Not too sweet , not too rich , not to spicy – just perfect .
Even if you decide to make it without the money !
Cinnamon Chocolate Cake
Adapted from a recipe printed in the AJC in the 1980s

Meanwhile , whisk together flour , sugar , and salt in a mixing bowl .
Pour the chocolate mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix well .
Then , add the buttermilk and baking soda .
Mix together the eggs , cinnamon , and vanilla in a small bowl , and add to the batter .
Pour batter into prepared pan .
Drop wrapped coins into batter .
Bake 25 minutes .
Allow cake to cool completely in the pan .
Then , turn onto a plate , and sprinkle with powdered sugar .

High pressure and beautiful sunny weather at the north pole research station yesterday was reminiscent of the warm weather that led to the record low sea ice levels in September 2007 .
This year 's sea ice meltdown is well ahead of 2007 in loss of both area and thickness .
The ice is failing at a record pace , in part , because it is at a record low thickness for the date .
This ice is thinning at a record rate because of warm air temperatures above and because of melting from below .
Sea ice extent is well less for this date than it was in the record minimum year 2007 .
This year 's ice extent is 3.9 standard deviations below normal according to a comment below by math and stats expert Keith Pickering , so it cannot be explained by random variability .
Atmospheric pressure and wind patterns this past winter were favorable for preserving multi- year sea ice .
High pressure in the Arctic last winter led to less sea ice export out of the Arctic than normal .
The increase in multi - year sea ice last winter has been the basis for some experts predicting that there might be a rebound in sea ice levels this summer and fall .
First year sea ice is generally thin and relatively salty so most of it does n't survive the summer .
Normally , the increase of multiyear sea ice would be a basis for predicting an increase in the sea ice minimum this September .
Multi - year sea ice 2009 vs 2010
However , very warm temperatures in the Arctic in May , as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal offshore of Siberia , is melting the thinner than normal ice rapidly .
A large amount of the multiyear sea ice has been stretched thin and transported south where it is unlikely to survive the summer .
Wind patterns during most of May have continued to push this ice to the west , placing more ice into the Chukchi Sea and keeping the ice further south than in recent years .
Given the extent of melt over the past several years and the southern location of this old ice , we expect that it will completely melt out ( ed with limited exceptions ) .
The University of Colorado team 's forecast as of mid June is for a probable record low ice extent this fall .
Although the MoD was responsible for this deadly catalogue of failures long before he was promoted to his present post , the one man at the top of the MoD who could have had the clout to ensure that our troops in Afghanistan were equipped with mine - clearing machines as a top priority was Sir Jock Stirrup .
But still , for lack of the Buffalos and Huskies that protect their allies , men like Captain Shepherd continue to die .
Scarcely a day now goes by when we do not hear of another British soldier being blown up , usually by an IED .
And still Sir Jock continues to draw his £ 245,000 a year .
The more all these public servants are paid , it seems , the less they understand what it is the rest of us are paying them for .

A 23 - year - old Arab man sustained serious injuries after being attacked in Tiberias , allegedly for talking to a young Jewish woman .
Police are still searching for the suspected assailant , a 19 - year - old who fled the scene .
According to police , it is not yet clear whether the attack was nationalistically motivated and whether there was any connection between the suspect and the young woman .
The attack occurred on Tuesday night in a gas station in Tiberias .
Superintendent Jacky Dan of Tiberias Police told
Ynet that the investigation indicates that the young Arab man , who resides with his family in the city , was talking to a girl he knew prior to the assault .
The suspect arrived at the site and the two got into an argument .
The suspect angrily asked on what right was the victim talking to the woman and proceeded to hit him in the head .
According to police estimates , the Arab was beaten with a heavy metal object , which the suspect held inside a plastic bag .
The victim then lost consciousness and was rushed to the Rambam Medical Center in Haifa .
The hospital stated that the victim was admitted into the neurosurgical intensive care unit and has since regained consciousness .
His condition is stable .
Superintendent Dan said that police are familiar with the suspect and are searching for him .
If you 've got old but comfortable pants — anything but jeans , really — doing nothing much for your wardrobe , consider cutting them into shorts .
The instructions are more simple than you 'd think , and the results can be pretty surprising .

Menswear blog The Sunday Best suggests taking on this simple advice from GQ , which mainly suggests cutting your pants an inch below your knee with good scissors and going from there .
As Sunday Best suggests , the results can look a lot better than " cut-offs , " especially when it comes to fit :
The most compelling reason is fit .
Most shorts for men are cut as though you 're going to hide small mammals in the leg holes .
More tailored shorts charge for the benefit of actually fitting .
Pants , on the other hand , fit the way your lower garments should - close to the leg , with a proper amount of space for your ...er... important part .

There are also lots of pants on the discount rack that might make for decent shorts , if not full pants , so keep your eyes open the next time you 're forced to go clothes shopping against your will .

Microsoft will not follow the lead of Mozilla and Google in paying researchers for reporting vulnerabilities , a company executive said today .
" We do n't think [ bug bounties ] are the best way for us to compensate researchers , " said Mike Reavey , director of the Microsoft Security Research Center ( MSRC ) in an interview Thursday .
Reavey was responding to questions about recent moves by Google and Mozilla to boost payments made to outside researchers who report flaws , and whether Microsoft would follow suit .
Last week , Mozilla hiked Firefox bounties for bugs rated " critical " and " high " to $ 3,000 .
A few days later , Google matched Mozilla 's raise by increasing the top - dollar payment to $ 3,133 for reported Chrome flaws .
But Microsoft wo n't dive into the same pool .
" Not all researchers are financially motivated , " Reavey said , an argument that flies in the face of what some of the best - known researchers say , as well as against the grain of security vendors that claim profits inspire most hackers who craft and launch attacks .
Reavey also said that Microsoft compensates security researchers in other ways .
He ticked off the security conferences Microsoft sponsors or co-sponsors -- it 's one of seven top sponsors of next week 's Black Hat conference , for example -- its Blue Hat gathering on its Redmond , Wash .
campus , and employment opportunities for researchers as contractors and members of its security team .
" There are lots of ways we work with the [ researcher ] community , " said Reavey , that do n't involve handing out money directly .
But that 's exactly what Microsoft should be doing , several well - known bug finders said today .
" Sure , I 'd like to see [ bounties by Microsoft ] happen , " said Jeremiah Grossman , chief technology officer at White Hat Security .
Grossman will be demonstrating a vulnerability in Apple 's Safari browser next Thursday at Black Hat .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - U.S. lawmakers risk “ poisoning the atmosphere ” with China through proposed laws aimed at the yuan currency , China ’s official news agency said on Sunday , calling Congress members “ baby kissing ” incompetents .
The commentary from the state - run Xinhua news agency was Beijing ’s latest jab at members of the U.S. Congress demanding legislation tackling what they say is China ’s policy of keeping its yuan currency artificially low against the dollar .
One of the most vocal backers of such action , Senator Charles Schumer , a Democrat , said this week that he and other colleagues want a vote in the next two weeks on legislation to allow the use of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws against China or any other country deemed to have a fundamentally misaligned exchange rate .
Late last month , China and the United States avoided open contention over the yuan at high - level talks held in Beijing .
The Xinhua commentary was not so polite .
“ When they are manipulating the yuan debate , these American politicians may make some short - term political gains , but they put the long - term Sino - U.S. bilateral relations in jeopardy , ” said the English - language commentary .
“ These congressmen claim they are the white knights defending the interests of the American people , but in fact , they are nothing more than a bunch of baby - kissing politicians trying to swing voters by manipulating the yuan debate . ”
The commentary repeated Beijing ’s stance that the United States ’ trade deficit with China could not be blamed on the yuan .
It said the U.S. lawmakers were trying to divert public attention from “ much more serious domestic economic problems , which are caused in part by their incompetence . ”
Chinese government leaders have not used such strong words in opposing the proposed U.S. legislation .
But the commentary gave some hint of the acrimony that could erupt between the world ’s biggest and third biggest economies if bills targeting the yuan exchange rate move closer to becoming law .
With many U.S. lawmakers facing re-election in November and unemployment hovering just below 10 percent , political pressure is building on President Barack Obama ’s administration to push China to break the yuan ’s nearly two - year - old peg to the dollar .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Thursday the yuan was an impediment to global rebalancing , indicating that U.S. patience with China ’s currency policy was wearing thin .
After partly freeing its currency to rise gradually from mid-2005 to mid-2008 , China repegged the yuan to the dollar at a rate that U.S. lawmakers and some economists say is as much as 40 percent below the appropriate value .
Aperture 3.0 came out a few months ago , so you 're probably wondering why this review is so late .
I had hoped to do a simultaneous review of Lightroom 3 and Aperture 3 , but I was thinking that Lightroom 3 would come out at the same time as the CS5 applications , which came out just recently .
It now looks like Lightroom 3 is not due out until June or July , judging from the winds ( that 's hippy talk for " when the beta program expires " ) .
Anyway , it 's better that we waited , since Photoshop CS5 includes Adobe Camera RAW 6 and the noise reduction improvements that are going to be included in Lightroom 3 .
It also gave Apple a bit of time to clear up some bugs with the release , so we 're reviewing version 3.0.3 here .

Aperture 3 includes a ton of workflow tweaks and improvements — so many that covering every little one would be excessive .
Sure , the new feature page has some padding like " Space Bar Playback " — that 's a bit of a stretch as a feature .
But there are lots of touches that make version 3 a more comfortable , well - rounded workspace for importing , sorting , tagging , developing , and exporting images .
Even the icons are nicer :

It 's almost weird how bad the version 2 icons look now , like Aperture 2 was using NeXT icons where 3 uses OS X ones .

Of course , if you find them too loud , you can command - click the oblong widget at the top right to pick a more compact mode , like text - only display .
Fullscreen Projects View and Full - Screen Browser
Fullscreen mode got a big upgrade in Aperture 3 .
I like to work with the least clutter possible , and the changes in the latest Aperture make working in a minimal , fullscreen workspace a lot easier .
There is no longer a need to go back and forth between modes to navigate thanks to the browser bar at the top of fullscreen mode :
You can browse projects in fullscreen mode and dig around without reaching for the project tree panel .
Vanishing HUD
Another enhancement that will help you see more work while working is the Vanishing HUD .
If you hold shift while tweaking a slider in the Adjustment HUD , the palette disappears and shows just the image and the slider , letting you concentrate on the image :
It 's a nice touch but I just prefer to use the new docked Adjustments HUD while in full - screen mode :
The Adjustments HUD at the left is butted against the edge and can be set to the right as well .
Both of these interface tweaks help Aperture 3 feel less constricted and cluttered overall .
Aperture Trash
Aperture 3 now has a trash bin , so you do n't have to commit to nuking files outright .
Command - delete files or projects and clear the trash when it 's safe to later :
This helps projects stay organized , since sometimes you want to be able to go back to some options later , but you 're 95 % committed to your picks and just want to deal with those after trashing the others .
On empty , you 're given an option to remove the master files from the disk , or just clear them from the library ( the default ) .
Adjustment Presets and Live Previews
One of the sleeker changes to the interface is the addition of a live preview for adjustment presets .
You click on the preset menu and drag through the options to watch a good - sized preview of the image pop up with the settings :
These are user - customizable , and you can add your own presets and categories .
Zoom navigator .
If you 're working on a zoomed part of an image , a little zoom navigator pops up at the right side of the interface :
Once you mouse over the navigator , it expands to show the image contents , and you can grab and slide the zoom value for interactive zooming :
As you can see from the pixellated screenshot above , it zooms the low - res cache image until you let go of the mouse button .
This keeps the zoom response good on all hardware .
The zoom navigator and live previews , combined with the myriad other small tweaks , make working in Aperture 3 less restrictive , and they add to the feeling of having of a fully personalized workspace .
The secessionist movement in southern Yemen has become increasingly violent in recent months and has gained considerable momentum since it first attained a loose organizational structure in 2007 .
The prospect of a renewed civil war ensuing between southern forces and the central government in Sana ’a , Yemen ’s capital , seems highly possible .
There are also concerns that the movement may eventually decide to cooperate with al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) in an attempt to undermine President Ali Abdullah Saleh , despite the dismissal of such assertions by some southern leaders .
Since North and South Yemen united in 1990 , unemployment and poverty have risen in the south , a region which contains the majority of Yemen ’s land and its most important oil facilities .
Many southerners believe they are deliberately discriminated against in areas of employment , government services , economic development and political governance .
Tribal law and some previously outlawed traditions such as child marriage have also resurged in the south , in stark contrast to the secularism and relative gender equality of South Yemen ’s earlier socialist rule ( The National [ Abu Dhabi ] , March 6 ) .
Calls for secession and anti-government demonstrations have intensified amid growing violence .
Ali Salim al - Beidh , a former leader of the Yemeni Socialist Party ( YSP ) who has resumed his political career in exile to become one of the southern movement ’s leading figures , recently demanded that a U.N. commission recognize an independent South Yemen with Aden as its capital .
He also warned that Yemen would suffer “ catastrophic consequences ” if the Arab world – particularly the Gulf States – fail to intervene on behalf of southern Yemenis in their pursuit of sovereignty ( AFP [ Dubai ] , May 21 ) .
Violent clashes between security forces and separatists are occurring more frequently :
• Eight people were wounded in clashes with Yemeni security forces in al - Daleh governorate during the funeral of four civilians killed on June 6 ( Middle East Online , June 15 ) .
• Gunmen assassinated senior security official Jalal al - Uthmani in Abyan governorate on June 13 .
Two soldiers were also killed trying to defuse a bomb left at the gate of an army camp ( Reuters , June 13 ) .
• On June 10 , between 10 and 12 people were wounded when government troops fired on southern protestors in al - Daleh ( AFP , June 10 ) .
• Just three days earlier , on June 7 , six people were killed and 17 wounded in what witnesses described as “ indiscriminate ” shelling by the Yemeni army in al - Daleh ( al - Sahwa , June 10 ; Gulf Times , June 8 ) .
• Al - Daleh was also the site of rocket - propelled grenade assaults against military targets and an assassination attempt against Ghazi Ahmed Ali , al - Daleh ’s security director ( Yemen Times , May 24 ; Yemen Post , May 19 ) .
• Another attempted assassination occurred in Shabwah governorate against Sadiq Ameen Abu Ras , the Deputy Prime Minister for Interior Affairs , and President Saleh ’s convoy was attacked near the town of al - Habileen in Lahij governorate ( Yemen Times , May 17 ) .
• An ambush in Jada ’a ( Lahij governorate ) killed one soldier .
Two other soldiers were abducted , with secessionists setting a 48 - hour deadline for the release of southern leaders in exchange for their release ( Aden News , May 1 ; Yemen Post , May 29 ; Yemen Times , May 20 ; Asharq al - Awsat , May 2 ) .
The Yemeni government has attempted to suppress the movement by setting up regional checkpoints blocking the flow of people and goods , but such measures have only exacerbated tensions .
President Saleh has also sought the use of political means .
He announced in a speech on Unification Day ( May 22 ) that amnesty would be given to approximately 300 imprisoned southern separatists , Houthi rebels and journalists .
Saleh also hinted at creating a unity government to open up Yemen ’s political process and begin talks on setting the first parliamentary elections since 2003 ( Aden Press , May 24 ) .
Opposition forces welcomed the amnesty , but skepticism remains about the seriousness of the government ’s intentions .
Although approximately 134 southern separatists have reportedly been released , the arrests of activists continue , according to southern leader Yahya Ghaleb al - Shuaybi ( Gulf Times , June 8 ) .
Moreover , some leaders within the umbrella opposition organization al - Liqa ’a al - Mushtarak ( which includes the YSP ) believe talks about political inclusion are simply an attempt to appease U.S. concerns ( Aden Press , May 24 ) .
Analysts also maintain that Saleh ’s recent proposals are not enough to ensure Yemen ’s stability , as the core grievances of the southern movement in particular continue to fail to be addressed .
Indeed , secessionist leader Tariq al - Fadhli detailed the south ’s concerns in a recent interview and claimed that the prisoner amnesty would not suffice to meet southern demands .
( Yemen Times , May 27 ) .
Speculation has begun that President Saleh may ultimately initiate a large - scale military offensive , similar to the one launched against the Houthis last year .
Such a move would likely cause Yemen ’s stability to deteriorate drastically .
Although southern leaders have so far rejected offers of support from AQAP leader Nasir al - Wahayshi , the two groups could conceivably join forces if the Saleh regime were to engage the southern movement militarily under the guise of a “ counterterrorism ” initiative .
Yemen ’s future therefore hinges largely on whether or not Saleh decides to finally address the grievances of the south .
If he instead opts for a massive military response to the movement , the potential for the country to become violently torn apart through civil war is alarmingly plausible .
Let me start this post saying that in no way do I condone driving under the influence of marijuana .
I am not stating that there is no danger from driving while stoned .
I came across an article today while doing my rounds , and it caught my eye :
A recent study by the National Institute of Health put 85 subjects ( 50 men and 35 women ) in driving simulators , some having smoked pot and others a placebo cigarette , to see if marijuana uniquely affected men or women while driving .
The study found there was no difference between the two sexes .
The part I was interested in was in crash avoidance and basic driving , the stoned group also showed no difference in driving performance and performed as well as the group that received the placebo .
The study goes on to state that the stoned group drove slightly slower when distracted , suggesting they were using “ additional compensatory skills . ”
This study intrigued me because I have been hearing so much lately about how terrible drugged driving is and how it will be just like having twice as many drunk drivers on the road if marijuana is legalized .
So I decided to try and find more studies like this that compared driving completely sober to driving under the influence of marijuana .
I found two different types :
Some of the studies directly compared marijuana to alcohol and the affect they both have on one ’s motor skills .
In every study I could find , the subjects that were under the influence of marijuana were much more competent drivers that the ones who had consumed alcohol .
This information is really common sense to those of use who either consume marijuana or are constantly around people who consume it , but it ’s obvious the rest of the world needs more proof .
Most of the studies , however , just compared the affects marijuana had on someone ’s driving ability .
As I stated at the beginning of the article , MARIJUANA DOES AFFECT DRIVING ABILITY and in no way am I claiming the opposite , but these studies were full of generalizations and doublespeak .
Most studies had conclusions writen like this ( quoted from www.drugabuse.gov): “ Evidence from both real and simulated driving studies indicates that marijuana can negatively affect a driver ’s attentiveness , perception of time and speed , and the ability to draw on information obtained from past experiences . ”
Now , I do n’t argue with that at all , but I guarantee that a study about “ tired drivers ” or “ drivers listening to loud music ” or “ driving in the rain ” would yield identical results .
What I am trying to accomplish here is separate the risks of drugged driving and drunk driving .
In no way is driving under the influence of marijuana as dangerous or debilitating as driving drunk .
Driving while stoned is n’t a good idea , it ’s just like driving while sleepy or driving while on the phone ; it ’s dangerous and it does affect your concentration .
Driving drunk , however , is just outright stupid .
I have a handful of friends that have driven drunk before , and some of them have gotten into accidents because of it .
However , most of my friends LIVE stoned and marijuana has never hindered their ability to get 4.0 ’s , maintain a job , or safely drive an automobile .
Stop comparing drugged drivers to drunk drivers !

Here ’s an infographic detailing the main points of the current oil spill crisis , caused by a BP oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico that exploded and sank , killing 11 workers aboard .
As you ’ll see , the graphs illustrate all the main points of the story , including the rate of the spill and the number of ships being deployed to fight it .
But the most alarming stat is at the bottom of this graphic , which comes courtesy of GDS Digital .
If the oil well causing the spill is n’t plugged in 50 days , it will overtake Exxon Valdez as the largest oil spill in U.S. history .
What the graphic does n’t mention is that the oil rig causing the spill originally sank on April 20th –meaning that we ’re already 15 days in , while capping the well might take up to 90 days .
Not to mention what happens if the well - head goes completely belly up–in that case , the spillage rate will increase many fold .
For stunning images of the devastation so far , check out Boston.com’s
The Big Picture ; for NASA ’s satellite imagery of the spill , click here .
Some time after the Foxconn story broke , there were reports of a sort of spontaneous / unauthorized strike at a Honda parts plant .
Workers were given a substantial raise and that was supposed to be that .
Until there were two more ( REPORTED ) strikes at Honda plants .
As a result , Honda said , its automotive assembly plants in nearby Guangzhou , the provincial capital , would remain closed on Thursday .
It is the second time in as many weeks – following similar industrial action at a nearby transmission factory – that the Japanese carmaker ’s China operations have been held hostage by worker unrest .
... Employees at Honda Automotive Components Manufacturing , the transmission plant , secured an increase of 24 - 33 per cent late last week .
FT
... and it also turns out , there are strikes going on many other industries .
Bloomberg ( one example ) .
Chinese workers clashed with police ( 50 reported injured ) .
[ FT article , above ]
I can tell the business media is terrified when I see sentences like this : " There is no evidence that workers at different factories are co-ordinating their activities . "
And I can tell that Chinese leadership is terrified when I see sentences like this : " We had decided at the beginning of the year to raise wages 10 per cent by July 1 , but had never announced this to the staff . "
Not sure how directly connected -- but there was also a " flash strike " at a Hyundai factory in India around the same time . ( Reuters . )
Which leads me to wonder ...
Is this just a simple re-balancing , or is it something bigger ?
Will there be one wave of strikes , ending in a reasonable adjustment , or are there going to be waves of strikes ?
Assuming that this is n't de-stabilizing , this is good for everyone .
Although China 's currency remains parasitically undervalued , higher wages are good for Chinese workers and good for US competitiveness ( after all , thanks to these deficit hawks we 're facing a lost decade of stagnant wages ) .
( See Krugman generally ) .
Caveat : yes , I know that China and India are huge countries , and that none of this could be causally connected at all .
It might not be in the Zeitgeist .
BUT , why would the Business press and establishment media be paying any attention to a successful strike ?
They would n't .
They 'd ignore labor victories deliberately .
So if they 're reporting it , it 's undeniable and important .
That 's my reasoning .
UPDATE : I'm in the middle of studying for the Bar Exam , and getting this diary on the rec.
list has basically made my week .
In a bid to appear serious , the Coalition Government , with the Lib Dems centre - stage , last week announced some " surprise " spending cuts – a kind of warm - up act for the Budget .
These " cuts to planned spending " amounted to around £ 10bn , we were told .
But it transpires the bulk of the " scrapped " projects – around £ 8bn – were in fact only " suspended " .
Of the remaining £ 2bn , around £ 1bn of the commitments were unfunded anyway – so removing those wo n't affect the numbers .
And another £ 0.4bn of the " cuts " were included within efficiency savings already announced .
I kid you not .
BOSTON -- LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers only needed one quarter to elbow their way back into the lead of their Eastern Conference semifinal with the Boston Celtics .
James scored 21 of his 38 points in the first quarter to help Cleveland beat Boston 124-95 on Friday night , handing the Celtics their worst home playoff loss ever and taking a 2 - 1 lead in the best - of - seven Eastern Conference semifinals .
Showing no ill - effects of an elbow problem that was the talk of Cleveland during the long layoff , James finished with eight rebounds and seven assists .
The 21 points in a quarter was a franchise postseason record .
" I know I 'm going to hear a lot about the elbow , but I 'm here to play basketball and give our team a chance to win , " James said .
" We knew how important it was to come out and play aggressively after giving away Game 2 . "
Antawn Jamison had 20 points and 12 rebounds for Cleveland , while Shaquille O'Neal added 12 points and nine rebounds .
Rajon Rondo , who had 19 assists in Boston 's Game 2 victory on Monday , had 18 points and eight assists .
The Celtics missed 10 of their first 13 shots , hitting just 27 percent in the first quarter to spot Cleveland a 21 - point lead .
The Cavaliers shot 67 percent from the field in the first -- and 59 percent for the game -- and Boston was never able to recover .
" It was great to see LeBron set the tone from the jump , " Cleveland coach Mike Brown said .
" And the rest of the team followed . "
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
The Bank of England on Friday said measures to strengthen banks ' capital levels need to be phased in over a number of years as a media report also indicated the committee responsible for setting new capital requirements will pare back some of its tougher suggestions .
In its bi-annual Financial Stability Report , the Bank of England said U.K. lenders face several sometimes contradictory challenges , including refinancing substantial amounts of funding , maintaining lending levels to support economic recovery and building larger capital and liquidity buffers .
In the face of these challenges , the new capital rules from the Basel Committee should be introduced gradually , the central bank said .
" An extended transition to this new regime would enable banks to build resilience through greater retention of earnings , while sustaining lending , " the Bank of England said .
The report , which also highlighted the risk to U.K. banks from sovereign debt worries in Europe , came as the Financial Times reported that the Basel Committee may pare - back some of its proposals .
The latest draft of the committee 's proposals will be presented at a G - 20 summit this weekend in Toronto .
The major change is likely to be the scrapping of a requirement that banks maintain a longer term " net stable funding ratio " that aligns the maturity of assets and liabilities , the report said .
Lenders had argued that the proposal would have driven a sharp increase in funding costs and in borrowing charges for customers , the newspaper reported .
Funding challenge
In its report the Bank of England calculated that the largest U.K. banks will need to refinance or replace 750 billion pounds to 800 billion pounds ( $ 1.12 trillion to $ 1.19 trillion ) of term loans and liquid assets by the end of 2012 .
That equates to more than £ 25 billion a month , or more than double the average monthly issuance achieved so far this year .
The industry also needs to extend the maturity of its wholesale funding , around 60 % of which falls due within one year , the central bank said .
Mark Phin , an analyst at Keefe , Bruyette and Woods , said the Bank of England report makes the funding situation look bleaker than reality .
" We would point out that looking at wholesale maturities on a static basis does not take into account deposit growth or the ongoing balance sheet de-leverage at RBS and Lloyds , in particular , " he said in a note to clients .
" We do not mean to downplay the risks , particularly against current difficult market conditions , but think it 's worth pointing out that over half of the requirement can likely be offset , " Phin said .
The central bank added that U.K. banks have relatively limited holdings of sovereign debt in those countries where fiscal concerns have been most acute , but that the U.K. industry does have counterparty relationships with European banks that have much larger exposures .
" If undiminished , sovereign concerns could also affect U.K. banks through their impact on global financial markets , " the Bank of England said .
" Renewed concerns about counterparty risk could further reduce the availability of bank funding , and funding strains could be exacerbated by any falls in the perceived value of government support for banks , " it added .
Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are both stars in the new " Knight and Day " movie , released on June 23rd .
But next to them there is another star : a Ducati Hypermotard , that is in fact an Aprilia SXV550 in disguise .
Wait , what ?
Aprilia is being used as a stunt bike , while Ducatti is used for low - speed rides .
And how the Hypermotard is just to heavy and too fragile to pull off the stunts , the team opted to an Aprilia .
So why hiding an Aprilia under a Ducatti skin ?
Maybe because Cruise really wanted to drive a Ducatti in the movie , who knows !

To Everybody Coming Out to 14th and Broadway on Verdict Day by Some anarchists
Wednesday Jun 30th , 2010 3:28 PM
Anarchist statement on the upcoming Mehserle verdict .
SUP
We are anarchists who live in the Bay .
We are OUTRAGED by the murder of Oscar Grant , and we are pissed at continuing police violence and disregard of communities ' health and safety .
We 're writing this letter to all the people who are going be in the streets the day of Mehserle 's verdict .
PEOPLE BEEN TALKING BEHIND OUR BACKS
Some folks have been calling us " outside agitators " .
We wonder : outside of what ?
We are all faced by police violence whether we stay in the 510 , the 415 , the 925 , the 209 , the 831 , santa rita , san quentin , or wherever .
Except that we 're from here .
We live here , we contribute here , we have fun here , we get harassed here , and we fight back here .
We are men , women , transgendered , black , white , whatever adjective you can think of .
We are teachers , students , veterans , workers and the unemployed .
We look out for each other .
When people caught court cases after the January 7th uprising we were there .
The anarchist community stepped up , strategized , and fundraised .
THE PIGS STARTED THIS
Straight up , we do n't like that the police murder people .
We do n't want anyone to have the authority to murder people with impunity .
In a society where the banks can take away our homes , where we 're afraid to speak up to the boss , and where the cops can murder us face down and helpless on video and then call us the thugs , we are all Oscar Grant .
Last year when people expressed themselves in the streets , we heard condemnation of property destruction but no rebuke of police aggression against peoples bodies .
Lets not forget that the only reason Mehserle is on trial is because the people of Oakland rose up .
KNOW THE REAL ENEMY
Some of us will be with you at 14th and Broadway on the day of the verdict .
We know that the pigs will be looking to cause trouble , but we 're not going to give them an excuse .
We want everyone in Oakland to come out to 14th and Broadway .
We 'll leave it to the will of the people assembled to decide what goes down there .
Also , we just heard that Alameda County dropped at least $ 675,000 on an LRAD 300X sonic weapon system , so bring earplugs .
TO OAKLAND
The pigs are already going door to door at businesses and community groups to get them to snitch on those who will stand up .
We know this because our doors got knocked on .
For us , snitching violates core principles and destroys the very trust we are trying to build .
We hope that the orange - vest peace police will address the original cause of violence and face the REAL outside agitators , the OPD and BART Police .
There 's gonna be an army of pigs at 14th and broadway on the day of the verdict waiting to pounce on black people and people in black .
We are n't so stupid as to value a few smashed windows over a community acting and speaking together .
We 'll respect the tone .
PLAN B
If Mehserle is found guilty of murder it will be historic .
If he is found not guilty , or given a slap on the wrist , our response will be historic .
What happens in the streets will be determined by the people in the streets , and we know that we wo n't be there alone .
We say to the thugs at OPD , bring your chumps in body armor .
The more Bay Area cops you bring to downtown Oakland to threaten and intimidate those expressing themselves , the more targets you leave exposed .
It 's open game on all your $ hit from now until the job is done .
To everyone else , see you in the streets .
Written in solidarity with all disgruntled peoples fighting for freedom against this police state .

StarCraft II : Building On The Beta
By Chris Remo
For developers creating multiplayer games , the beta is invaluable -- data on every aspect of how the game is played comes rushing in .
But Blizzard 's StarCraft II design director Dustin Browder warns that caution is required when sifting through the data for meaningful changes to make .
He also says that it 's not Blizzard 's place to create an innovative competitive PC RTS with StarCraft II , as it fills a very specific niche in the market -- shaped by both the series ' broad popularity and its place at the forefront of the e-sports movement .
These and other topics are touched on in this interview , which encompasses the single and multiplayer modes , both of which Browder has responsibility for .
As design director , are you equally responsible for single - player and multiplayer design ?
They seem like very different games , more so than in the original StarCraft .
Dustin Browder : I am both single and multi .
I have a lot of folks who help me out with that , though .
I have a staff of very skilled designers in both areas .
They do a lot of the heavy lifting .
Having been in the beta test for a couple months , I would imagine the amount of balance and design data you have to work with has skyrocketed .
DB : It 's pretty high .
We can learn a lot .
The danger with a lot of this data is that you have to be very careful how you use it .
With unit stats , I can tell you that , for example , in a Protoss versus Terran game , 12 percent of the time the Protoss build carriers .
And when they build carriers , they win 70 percent of the time .
You could say , " That must mean carriers are overpowered ! "
That 's not really true , though .
It could just be that as you get towards the end of the game , if the Protoss have the extra resources to waste on a bunch of carriers , they 're probably going to win anyway .
In other words , if your opponent has n't managed to stop you being able to build 24 carriers ...
DB : Right .
Of course , it does n't mean the carriers are n't overpowered either .
That stat alone actually tells you nothing .
It 's a very dangerous stat .
If you listen to that stat , you can make all kinds of mistakes .
The real challenge for us is to continue to sort the wheat from the chaff , to determine which stats are real , which stats are meaningful , and which ones we should be looking at to make a meaningful change .
So you get that empirical data based on stat tracking , you get feedback from the beta forums , and then you get the high - level meta - game that exists largely in the minds and strategic evolution of experienced players .
DB : Yup .
And our personal play experience , which is probably the most important .
We take from whichever one is providing the correct information .
If we look at the stats and we say , " This does n't actually back anything we 're experiencing online , " I 'm very suspicious of that number .
We get information from a lot of different sources , and then we use the other sources to refute or corroborate .
We look at another source and say , " You know what ?
What they 're saying online matches my play experience , and it matches the stats .
This seems real .
Let 's talk about what some possible fixes can be . "
On the other hand , " You know , what they 're saying online does not match my play experience and it does not match the stats .
Let 's put this on a watch list , and if we see more information that can prove it to us , we 'll make a fix .
If we do n't , maybe it will go away and was never real . "
How much do you make a point to follow the meta - game that surrounds high - level players ?
Do you explicitly try to track that scene ?
It can be like going down the rabbit hole .
DB : We do track what 's going on , but we do n't make changes to try to push it in any direction .
We 're not trying to manipulate the meta - game so much as we 're trying to make sure the overall experience is a positive one .
We saw , through StarCraft : Brood War especially , how many times the meta - game changed when we did n't even make any balance changes .
One of the challenges for us is to know when not to touch it .
I do n't know how we 're going to hit that .
That 's the challenge for us down the road , and that 's where we lean on guys like [ Blizzard game design VP ]
Rob Pardo , guys who have been through this for many , many years .
We can go to these guys and say , " Hey , you 've done this before .
Do you have any opinion of what seems real to you here ? "
We can use that vast well of experience Blizzard has at this point for this kind of work to help us out .
Looking historically , even after StarCraft came out , it was n't really until Brood War that it really took off and something clicked .
DB : Yeah .
Blizzard had a while to ease into that .
Now , you guys are expected to hit that right out of the gate .
Do you think you 're operating in a development design mentality as a result than that team was ?
DB : Absolutely .
We have so much more information available to us than they had then , both in terms of stat - tracking and in terms of contact with the community .
And the community is smarter .
These guys learned how to play this game much faster than they learned how to play StarCraft or Brood War .
We have the advantage of their additional knowledge as well as the advantage of our additional knowledge .
And of course , we 're shooting for e-sports , which did n't exist in the way it does now .
We 're targeting something that simply was never there .
It 's definitely a brave new world in that respect .
There 's all kinds of new information out there for us to get , and there 's all kinds of new targets to hit that simply were n't there before .
On the notion of the e-sports phenomenon , there are some people for whom StarCraft is a fundamental competitive dynamic ; it makes sense to them that StarCraft II still relies on that same dynamic , in the same way football has n't changed its basic competitive form in many , many years .
Then there are the people who are more dismissive , who say , " Well , it 's the same thing I played ten years ago , but in 3D . "
How do you address that second group ?
DB : For us , we 're not trying to be innovative .
We 're not trying to change for change 's sake .
We 're just trying to make a quality product .
We definitely felt like there were some things from the previous game that were very high quality that we were n't super confident we could do a ton better .
I would n't have a lot of enthusiasm to make Siege Tank 2.0 .
Siege Tank is good .
It 's a good unit .
It 's much the same as the guys who are making Civilization or Team Fortress .
They 're making iterative changes to a quality product to do something really , really great .
But for the guys who are saying , " I just need new , " we 've created a whole solo play experience which we feel really scratches that itch , that is a brand new experience .
It gives them a new way to play RTS games that they have n't played in our games before .
I know other games have done a similar experience , but we feel we 've got a very high quality version of a non-linear RTS experience .
We really think that 's an area where players who are just bored of RTS can have a lot of fun .
But for the multiplayer experience , we 're much more about quality than in showing off , if you know what I 'm saying .
I 'd heard you actually tried to implement a Relic - style cover system , like in Company of Heroes or Dawn of War .
DB : We did actually try a cover system .
We tried it frequently , and what it did to our game was prevent a lot of movement from happening on the battlefield .
It slowed the game down .
Players would move to cover and stop .
The other player is like , " Can I get around it ?
Screw it .
I 'll just fight . "
Or , " I 'll just build up . "
The game stagnated .
Our game is about dancing : advance , retreat , advance , using the choke point -- until , " Oh no , the enemy went air , the choke is useless ! "
It 's about give and take .
For our game , it was a disaster .
It was n't a perfect cover system .
We never got that far , but the early indications were very poor .
A lot of players view RTS as a continuum : RTS was this , and now changes have been made , and now RTS must start from there .
We do n't view it that way .
We think each game has its own style and flavor .
Each game has its own strengths and weaknesses .
What works for us would never work for a Dawn of War , and what works for Dawn of War would never work for us .
They 're different games , and that 's the way it should be .
It seems encouraging that in 2010 , after something of a lull in RTS , that we have such a broad spectrum now -- those games , as well as things like Total War and so on .
DB : Right .
Totally different gameplay experiences , as it should be .
[ Those developers ] are making a game that really speaks to their consumers and makes their people really happy , which is awesome .
How do you look at that market ?
Do you feel more confident when you see more RTS out there ?
DB : It 's always great to see games , as a gamer .
There have been a decent number of Diablo clones , but we have n't seen a ton of them .
And yet , we 're making another one .
So , if we were the only RTS out there , I 'd be happy to make an RTS .
We do n't need thousands of people making this genre for it to feel like we should make a game .
We can make a game .
You do n't see a ton of clones of The Sims , but you still see The Sims turning out a product that 's obviously very compelling to the users .
But as a player , yeah .
It is cool .
It 's fun to play these games , and I love a lot of them .
You were saying before the interview that you recently split the single - and multiplayer trunks , in terms of unit design and balance .
DB : Sure .
When did you do that , and how significant a change has it been ?
DB : It was a couple [ months ] ago .
We had made a change to multi , and it broke four missions , and I said , " We 're splitting ! " [ laughs ]
It was like , " It 's over !
Oh my God !
I can't believe we just did that ! "
We tried to make it to the last possible moment .
We probably actually went a couple moments past the last possible moment .
We probably should have done it a couple days earlier .
We were pushing it , trying to get them as close as we could together , and we 'll still roll [ multiplayer ] changes back into the campaign if we find that they 're safe for the campaign .
Most of the fixes in that respect should hopefully be minor .
But if we come up with some major changes to balance from multi , we 're going to have some decisions to make , and it 's going to be tough .
The danger there is that single - player is supposed to train you for multiplayer .
But in practical terms , that never occurs .
DB : It never has .
Are you then trying to avoid creating a false impression for players that single - player will prepare them ?
DB : Right .
And yeah , we 've had that feedback from people as well , especially Terran players who go online and are looking for their medics [ which exist in StarCraft II 's campaign but not its multiplayer mode ] .
For such a long time , they were a crutch in the solo campaign .
We had some balance problems .
People were building nothing but marines and medics all the time .
We 've since addressed that issue .
The medic has been a little bit nerfed for campaign , so you get more diversity in the campaign , which is almost as important to us as unit diversity in the multiplayer experience .
We want you trying different units , playing with different toys .
People who would play nothing but campaign , and go to play online , would be like , " Where 's my stuff ? "
We 've been trying to work out language in the load screens and so on , to say , " Hey , you know , this is a little different . "
It 's definitely a challenge for us .
We have ways to guide the players through the experience right from the launch screen .
" Hey , you 've just finished the campaign .
Now you should play some challenges . "
You 'll know that you need to learn some new things before you jump into the multiplayer experience .
Then , " Hey , you 've played some challenges ?
You should play versus AI .
We 've got some achievements .
Come get the achievements .
Come on , buddy .
Come over here . "
One of the problems that we have over a game like World of Warcraft is that WoW limits you by level cap .
You 're not going to blunder into Molten Core or Karazhan or whatever at level 15 .
You 're just not .
Those mechanics are way more complicated than you 're ready for at level 15 , so they control it through content .
But we do n't want to lock players out of multi just because they have n't finished the campaign .
That would make a lot of people just very angry with us .
That means we have to try and control it through UI .
We 're going to use our achievement system as a carrot to pull players through the systems and hopefully get them to do them in an order that will make sense for them -- or something like an order that will make sense for them .
It does n't have to be exact .
I just do n't want them to play mission one , then jump into a one - on - one match , and then be angry , which could very easily happen .
I found it fascinating earlier when you mentioned unusual cases like the Zerg , for example , being very strong in Korea , but less strong in North America .
How widespread is that kind of thing ?
DB : That 's the biggest example of that kind of thing .
The other match - ups are more even across all the nationalities that we 're tracking .
So , how to deal with that ?
Right now , we 're just not going to .
It 's too strange to make a fix based on that information .
What we need to do is go out there and use other tools now to discover what the differences are out there , and which one is real .
Or are none of them real ?
And do we change nothing ?
That one is simply too strange to make a move on it .
It 's just terrifying , frankly .
It 's like , " Oh my God !
What do we do ?
Better do nothing . "
Because any move you make could be horribly , horribly wrong .
So we 're just going to watch and wait , let the communities exchange information , let the meta - game settle down in some places , and see what happens .
If we see things that are making the game more boring through less diversity , if we see rush problems , and if we see things we know are balance problems -- because we have played them and we cannot for the life of us figure out how to beat them , and we see other people not figuring out how to beat them -- then we 'll deal with them .
But that particular issue , we 're going to have to let that one ride and see how it goes .
The challenge modes try explicitly to create situations that will mimic things people would need to know online .
How did you approach designing those ?
DB : Both as a tutorial , and as a game .
We will say , " Look .
You need to learn how to use our hotkeys .
Here 's out hotkey challenge .
We 've disabled the [ on - screen ] UI for this challenge .
You need to learn some hotkeys if you 're gonna beat this . "
Then you can beat it at higher and higher levels of difficulty .
You can say , " I 've learned enough .
I 'm moving on , " or you can say , " I want to get the highest level because there 's an achievement for that .
I 'm going to learn a lot of hotkeys in order to do this . "
It 's actually pretty fun mission .
You just go nuts , kill as much stuff as you can , hitting hotkeys .
It 's just you destroying a whole map full of stuff with hotkeys as fast as you can , but it 's challenging to keep up .
There 's a lot of adrenaline .
Some of the other ones , the " counter - challenges , " are less of a game and more of a tutorial .
We 'll say , " You need to figure out which units need to go where , to counter these enemy forces . "
Once you 've figured it out , there 's some micro involved in limiting casualties , but it 's not as difficult or as rewarding to simply power through it , as it would be with a hotkey challenge .
It 's a mixture of the two .
It 's largely to learn the game , but it 's got a component that allows you to push yourself and have fun while doing it , so it 's not just learning .

Despite international criticism against Israel following a calamitous IDF raid on an aid flotilla to Gaza , it appeared Monday that Hamas was the one preventing the goods brought by the flotilla from entering the Strip .
The army announced Monday that the humanitarian aid brought by the ships had been mostly unloaded , and estimated that the task would be completed in the next few days .

However Hamas continues to insist that the shipment not be brought in through the land crossings , and in the meantime the goods continue to pile up in the army 's warehouses .
Major Or Elrom , of the office of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the ( Palestinian ) Territories , said there was nothing on board the flotilla 's ships that Gaza 's residents did not already have .
" All of these goods have been previously conveyed there , and we hope we can do the same in this case , " she said .
A Defense Ministry facility adjacent to the Tzrifin army base has been turned into a temporary warehouse over the past few days , containing beds , mattresses , couches , medical supplies , shoes , clothing , and medicine – some of which has reportedly expired .
Eitan Kosto , who heads the Defense Ministry 's logistics corps , said the cargo had not been loaded onto the ships according to professional guidelines and therefore some of the goods were damaged during the unloading .
" We had to work for a long time and devote many resources to unloading it all , " he said .
" The fact that it was n't properly organized caused damage to some of the goods , but finally we succeeded in organizing everything so it could be transferred to the Strip . "
Much of the equipment so far unloaded from the ships – mostly shoes and electric carts – was secondhand , while other products were apparently donated by various organizations and civilians , Kosto said .
He added that his personnel had not yet unloaded the cement and building materials on board , which would have to undergo security checks before entering the Strip .
However it remains unclear whether Hamas will allow the materials to enter .
Last week the group kept out eight trucks carrying humanitarian supplies , which were attempting to enter through the Kerem Shalom crossing .
Former Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull has stepped back into the political fray savaging Kevin Rudd ’s position on the emissions trading scheme as ‘‘ the greatest act of political gutlessness anyone has ever seen ’’ .
Mr Turnbull said his decision to recontest his eastern Sydney seat of Wentworth at this year ’s election was sparked by the ‘‘ extraordinary conduct of the Rudd government ’’ , in particular the prime minister ’s recent decision to shelve the emissions trading scheme .
‘‘ He does not have the courage of his convictions , he has walked away from his climate change policy and he now has no climate change policy at all , ’’ Mr Turnbull said , describing Mr Rudd ’s decision as ‘‘ the greatest act of political gutlessness anyone has ever seen ’’ .
‘‘ I believe political leaders have to have guts and have to have courage and that is the reason I am stepping back into the fray and running again here in Wentworth . ’’
Mr Turnbull said he stands by his support for the emissions trading scheme , which led to him losing the party ’s leadership to Tony Abbott last December .

Fixing the Fox
Update :
If you want to retain the dotted border for tab - based navigation , apply this to a :active .
This still allows the indicator to appear when focused by keyboard , but hides when mouse activated .
It ’s the best of both worlds …
a:active { outline : none ; }
It is no secret , I love Firefox .
I have been using it since the beta version of 0.8 .
Firefox 1.5 though , has a quirk that proves to be a minor irritation every time I use it .
I am of course referring to the dotted outline that appears around every link .
In versions previous to 1.5 , the outline behaved similarly to Internet Explorer on Windows , wrapping exactly around clickable areas .
Now though , it wraps completely around links that have negative value applied to text - indent .
This method was popularized by Mike Rundle , and is widely used on many websites .
Below is a screenshot of the link behavior on the 9rules Network homepage , as viewed in Firefox 1.5 on Windows .
Oddly enough , Firefox on Mac does not have this incorrect outlining misbehavior .
Designer Tips
If you dislike this quirk as much as I do , you ’re in luck .
I will provide a few methods for squashing this bug as a web designer , and another tweak which will completely remove it from your browser ’s default behavior by editing the CSS that controls the user interface .
First , let ’s look at web design tricks .
In your CSS document , just start out by putting this universal rule for all links :
a { outline : none ; }
My coworker Cody Lindley has also come up with a solution to this problem , via specifically targeting Mozilla based browsers .
His method involves universally targeting the : focus pseudo class .
He wrote an article on using JavaScript to remove the focus border in browsers such as Internet Explorer .
The CSS for his method is listed below .
It works for Mozilla , but is n’t valid .
: focus { - moz - outline - style : none ; }
The great thing about using outline : none ; when designing is that other browsers that do n’t mis-interpret the dotted border are n’t affected by it .
IE6 still renders it , as does Firefox on Mac. Opera by default has no indicator .
Browser Tweaks
CSS Validation is a big pet - peeve for me , which is why I opted to explore other options , and came up with the simple outline : none ; method .
This is the same syntax that we will use to tweak our Firefox installation on Windows , so that the border is gone for all websites .
Do n’t worry , it is a very simple solution .
Browse to : C : \Program Files \Mozilla Firefox\res\ua.css .
Open the file in a code - editor that has line number , and scroll to line 123 .
/* You Will See This : */ :- moz - any - link : focus { outline : 1 px dotted invert ; } /* Change It To This : */ :- moz - any - link : focus { outline : none ; }

Sam Gregory woke up one morning and found , to his dismay , that he had turned into a big cockroach .
“ Oh , no , ” he thought .
He had some idea of what was happening because of the Kafka story .
He had n’t exactly read it , but he had heard all about it back when he was in college .
Sam ’s roommate , Cliffe with an E , had taken a course called Shape Shifters in Modern Lit , thinking it would be an easy A , like the video games he played in the Student Union , taking on all comers , or Eco-Alternatives .
Instead , it required a paper , and Cliffe felt betrayed .
Sam said I told you so ( the wrong thing to say ) and Cliffe suggested he shut the fuck up .
That only made things worse and soon they were n’t speaking at all .
Several times , they almost came to blows .
Instead , they became the best of friends .
Here ’s how that happened : Cliffe ’s girlfriend was a Conflict Resolution major , and she suggested they go bowling blindfolded ( neither of them bowled ) in an effort to change the subject through creative misdirection while she monitored the experiment for credit .
They even rented the shoes .
It might have worked , too , but she did n’t know how to keep score , plus they had forgotten the blindfolds , so they played the pinball machine instead ; there was just one , between the Men ’s and the Ladies ’ , a leftover from some previous universe of bells and flippers .
“ What I do n’t like about it , ” said Cliffe , “ is that is it ’s just a metaphor instead of something real . ”
“ What if it was real ? ” I ( Sam ) asked .
“ What if it was me and I actually turned into a cockroach someday ? ”
“ Then I would do everything I could to help you out , ” said Cliffe .
I was to remember that promise later when I actually turned into a cockroach .
Meanwhile Cliffe ’s girlfriend , who I will call Anna , tagging along to monitor the experiment , was pleased with the results so far .
She was cute , not as cute as some but cuter than others , and I immediately fell in love with her .
It made me angry how Cliffe always criticized her for everything and I told her so .
We were sort of a threesome .
She was dying of a disease and told me so .
Cliffe already knew .
She only had a year to live .
We both felt sorry for her , me sorrier , but it was Cliffe who died .
This happened unexpectedly one afternoon .
It was time to make a new start so Anna and I moved to Park Slope , in Brooklyn .
We pretended we were married and even got a baby carriage .
We rolled up a towel in a blanket and pretended it was a baby and rolled it around the streets and sidewalks .
Then we discovered it really was a baby .
I say “ we ” but Anna had known it all along .
It was crying like crazy .
Luckily by then we had a house .
Now this had to happen !
Here I was , a big cockroach !
I tried to think of what to do .
The bedroom door was shut but I knew that sooner or later Anna would come in and see me , flat on my back with six legs in the air .
I had to figure out a way to communicate with her and let her know what was what , before she freaked out .
I was still figuring when the door opened and she came in and immediately started screaming .
I could see she was n’t going to be much help , so I scurried under the bed as fast as lightning , cockroach style .
Meanwhile she ran out of the room to get a broom , I figured , or something to kill me with .
I was on my own .
That was when I remembered Cliffe ’s promise and wished he was still alive .
But if wishes were pennies we ’d all be rich .
I scurried down through the walls and out of the house , making quick work of the front steps .
Here on the streets of Brooklyn I was less noticeable .
Fast - moving , too .
It was raining , and after lots of adventures which involved things like making a boat out of a leaf and riding on a roller skate like it was a bus , I made my way to the Gowanus Canal .
I had a plan .
I knew that with all the renovations in Brooklyn all the writers had ended up in one building , an old warehouse that was n’t hard to find .
There were their names on the mailbox : Auster , Lethem , Whitehead , etc. , and a bunch of unknowns .
“ This is not how you spell metaphor , ” they said , when I explained what had happened by walking through ink on scrap paper .
I had spelled it with an F .
I met with them all separately and together as well , but they were no help .
Plus , the canal smelled good and I was beginning to face facts : the cockroach thing was for real .
I ate some paper .
It was almost noon .
I had to figure out a way to call in sick , at least .
Then I might at least still have my job when things got straightened out .
I walked in a circle , thinking .
Then I met this old Jew .
It was in the park .
He almost stepped on me , then he picked me up and put me on the cuff of his shirt and started talking to me .
It was in Hebrew but that was the least of my problems .
His children had all died of this and that and he was fond of me .
It turned out he was even older than he looked and knew lots of secrets , many of them Kabbalistic .
He took out his pencil and outlined a Quest that would return me to normal .
I was off !
It took all day and involved more things like leaf boats and jumping onto the back of a pigeon and riding it like a dragon .
I got to know the sewers too .
I wished I had six little shoes .
But never mind , it worked , and by midafternoon I was normal , that is human , and full - sized .
I was in the Bronx , but I made it home and knocked on the door at precisely five p.m .
To my surprise it was unlocked and swung open on its own .
There was Anna with another lover , both of them nude .
“ I thought you had turned into a cockroach , ” she said .
“ It must have been your imagination , ” I said .
I did n’t want to get into it .
Especially in front of this other dude who was pulling on his pants .
If you are thinking I was devastated , you ’re right .
But at least I was no longer a cockroach .
I looked in the mirror to make sure .
I ’d had nothing to eat all day but paper , so I fixed a bowl of Cheerios while Anna got rid of her lover , who it turned out she hardly knew .
“ Maybe we can make a new start , ” said Anna , pulling on her panties and replacing the barrettes in her hair .
That was okay by me , I told her , and we were just about to watch TV when we heard the baby crying like crazy .
We had forgotten all about it !
Well , it had turned into a cockroach too .
There it was with six tiny legs , waving about , and I could see why Anna had screamed so on seeing me .
I looked at her .
She looked at me .
I knew what she was thinking .
We had neither of us wanted this baby and now it was a cockroach .
She was just about to step on it when the phone rang .
It was her father , the doctor .
“ Your year is up , ” he said .
Was our happiness about to come to an end ?
She had agreed as part of a medical experiment to come into his office after a year and be killed .
It was n’t a disease at all .
“ My father pressured me into it , ” she told me .
“ I ’ll go with you , ” I said .
I felt sorry for her .
Plus I had a plan .
I got a gun out of the box of them I had won in the lottery and stuck it into my belt .
My plan was to kill him before he killed her .
“ What ’s with the gun ? ” she asked and I told her .
“ You ’ll need an alibi , ” she said , mysteriously .
Her father ’s office was also near the Gowanus Canal , so I found myself retracing my steps , following her .
It did n’t smell so sweet this time .
It turned out Anna had a plan as well .
On the way , she showed me the items in her purse : a huge pair of scissors and a weird thing .
“ What ’s this thing ? ” I asked .
“ It ’s a cockroach hat . ”
She showed me how it worked .
When she put it on , she looked exactly like a cockroach , six legs and all .
I tried it on myself .
We were passing a health food store and I saw myself reflected in the plate glass window .
It worked !
She had made it herself out of stuff around the house .
“ You gave me the idea , ” she said .
“ I thought it might come in handy . ”
Indeed it did .
“ Before you kill me , ” she told her father , “ I want you to try on this hat .
I made it myself . ”
Like a fool he did .
I shot him and she cut him up with the scissors , careful to leave the hat on his “ head . ”
When the police came they were puzzled but we had an alibi .
“ He looked to us like a big cockroach , ” said Anna .
“ We believe you , ” said the police .
“ I love you , ” she said ( to me , Sam ) , but that came later .
First , they let us go and we walked home , hand in hand , along the canal part of the way , holding our noses comically .
It was a beautiful spring night in Brooklyn and I had learned a thing or two about love .
It was time to make a new start .
We quickened our steps .
We had forgotten to step on the baby .

Beetlejuice remake / reboot , yes .
Part deux ?
No thanks .
It just does n't sound right .
Baldwin is fat , Davis is old and gummier , and Winona Ryder .. too easy .
Of course Keaton is on board , they just need to throw 20 lbs of makeup on and he 's good to go .
It 's not like he 's busy anyway
Anyone up for an Edward Scissorhands 2 ?
Yeah ..
I should love to claim the credit for having figured out what Inception is really about , but Devin Faraci of C.H.U.D. is the one who started the ball rolling for me .
I do n’t know whether or not the essential clue was in Faraci ’s possession before he wrote his review , but even if it was , all I can say is , dang .
I ca n’t remember the last time a review succeeded in making me change my mind about a movie so absolutely , and so satisfyingly .
The clue is this : in recent a red - carpet interview , Leonardo DiCaprio compared Inception not to The Matrix or Dark City , but to 8 Â ½.
It ’s the merest cliché , that a movie is itself a shared dream .
The lights go down , and the audience shares a vision created by others .
We are the real targets of the inception , here .
After I read the Faraci review , I had to go and see the movie again .
And having done that , it now seems to me that Faraci did not go nearly far enough with the 8 Â ½ analogy .
Like 8 Â ½ , Inception is a movie about making movies ; it ’s not that the whole movie “ is a dream , ” though , but rather that the whole movie is an allegory of creation .
It ’s the story of Dom Cobb / Christopher Nolan , and his struggle with his own youthful , self - absorbed aesthetic in order to return “ home , ” where he can be united with his “ real ” children - his works , his films .
People have asked : why are the children generally wearing the same clothes , and why are they mostly the same age , throughout this movie ?
It ’s because they ’re the perfect vision of his creation , the ideal works of his mind ’s eye ; they symbolize the movies Nolan would like to make , or to have made .
The easiest way to access this interpretation is to examine the character of Mal , the wife of Dom Cobb .
She represents Cobb ’s personal inspiration ; the Greek kind of muse , not just the beautiful - girl kind .
Young artists conceive a passion for their métier that is analogous to a love affair .
“ He ’s wedded to his work , ” people will say .
The indescribable beauty of books , paintings or music that strikes us with such brilliance and force when we are young ; we fall in love with that .
Some fall in love to such a degree that nothing will suffice but that they too must become painters , writers , musicians .
Young artists often come to feel that that great love will provide all the inspiration they ’ll ever need to fuel their own works , that they can call on the muse and she will come , like a bolt of lightning , and then they will create works of equal brilliance out of the passion they ’ve felt for the works of others .
That feels inevitable , because the love is so colossal , so perfect , so overwhelming .
Nothing so beautiful and fulfilling can possibly be mistaken ; it is hard not to feel that .
But no artist who relies on passion alone is ever going to create meaningful work , it turns out .
The world of personal inspiration is sealed to the outside .
In the movie Mal , the symbol of inspiration , says this directly to Ariadne : “ Do you know what it is to be a lover ?
Half of a whole ? ”
Please note , there is no room for children or anything else in that formula .
Then , to Cobb , in distress : “ You said we ’d be together !
You said we ’d grow old together . ”
( By the way , in Greek mythology , Ariadne provided Theseus with the ball of thread or “ clew ” he uses to escape from the maze after slaying the Minotaur , you will recall .
This Ariadne is the same . )
The artist has to struggle and eventually to break with his muse , however seductive and beautiful she may be , if what he wants is to move an audience .
The muse will always be tempting him to indulge his own vision , rather than trying to reach outside himself for it .
This is the real story of Inception .
The deficiency of pure inspiration is illustrated quite baldly in the first scenes with Mal , at the cocktail party of Saito , the tycoon ( or , studio honcho ) whom Cobb is hoping to persuade to hire him .
Cobb asks her to sit in a chair ; he ’s begun to fashion his illusion for Saito , in furtherance of which he fastens a rope to the chair ’s leg , and then uses the rope to climb down the outer wall to a lower window .
Stay there , he tells her , before he pops out the window .
Mal immediately displays the caprice and unpredictability of inspiration : she betrays him instantly , lets him fall .
We see her empty chair , the fleeing rope , and Cobb plummets far lower than he ’d intended .
He ca n’t rely on inspiration to help him get where he wants to go .
This disturbs him , but it does n’t stop him ; he climbs up to the intended window , muse or no muse .
He has a larger purpose , one that does n’t include Mal .
Eventually that purpose will lead Cobb to Fischer , who represents on one level you , a single viewer , and on another , the audience and the culture at large .
It ’s Fischer that Cobb must reach in order to “ go home . ”
Tellingly , Cobb does n’t care much about Fischer , to begin with .
But by the end he is fully invested in Fischer ’s responses to all his machinations .
As “ Mr. Charles , ” Cobb takes the risk of revealing to Fischer that they ’re both in a dream .
That ’s like letting you know that you ’re watching a movie ; a directorial aside , a lifting of the curtain .
There ’s a leap of faith required from Fischer , too .
When he makes that leap , even though Cobb is deceiving Fischer , it ’s as though Fischer ’s story has now got a certain hold on Cobb ; now Cobb cares about Fischer , and will even dream Fischer ’s dream , in a sense .
By the end Cobb will have to choose , explicitly , between Mal and Fischer .
This is a very exact analogy : who are you doing this for ?
For your own vision , or for the audience ?
By then , reaching Fischer has created its own justification for undertaking such a risky enterprise .
For Fischer ’s epiphany , however artificially - induced , however staged , is strangely moving , beautiful and sad : it ’s real , for lack of a better way of putting it .
Note also that it comes to Fischer alone .
Cobb does n’t see this redemption ; he only has to have faith that it ’s happened .
How sad it is that no director can ever really see into the heart of a viewer who is seeing and understanding his work for the first time !
As much as I like Faraci ’s conceit of the various characters mapping to the various roles in a film production , it also appears that Nolan is a total auteur who writes all his own stuff .
He ’s married to his producer , even .
So I prefer a reading where the different roles here are played by the different parts of Nolan ’s own psyche ( not that these readings are mutually exclusive ; far from it . )
In this case Arthur represents the director ’s reason , experience or conscience - as well as the idea of “ producer , ” Eames , the “ thief and forger , ” represents daring , playfulness , invention - ” actor ” ; Yusuf , the technical , illusionist ’s part - ” production design ” ; Ariadne represents craft , curiosity and intuition - and , perhaps , “ writer . ”
( One need not even mention the striking resemblance of the film ’s star to its director . )
All these are played off against the Other represented by Mal .
She is the enemy , here .
Why ?
Because the Muse wants only Cobb , Cobb alone .
She could care less about anything but the private magic between them - not even their children .
Their “ real ” children , she claims , are beyond the veil .
So Cobb ’s destruction of Mal provides the real climax of the movie .
“ Fischer is real , ” says Ariadne , the leader out of the maze .
“ Mal is just a projection . ”
Cobb has to follow Fischer , whose catharsis is now revealed to be the real reason for Cobb ’s work , down into the deepest part of himself : the intuition that guides his craft ( in the form of Ariadne ) leads him to believe that success can be achieved , Fischer reached ( and all brought out of the maze ! ) ; otherwise even Cobb himself would have given up .
Cobb goes home , where his mentor and father - in - law Miles is waiting with his “ real children . ”
( It ’s no accident that Cobb first meets up with Miles in Paris , the old capital of art , and of film , and then he magically shows up at “ home . ” )
Cobb sees his children ’s faces for the first time in the movie and , also for the first time , he does n’t care whether or not the top , his totemic indicator of “ reality , ” ceases to spin .
Audiences have been moved to speculate on the ultimate fate of the top , as if what were being said is merely that “ reality ” is in question .
Which sure , that is being said .
But the real point is that Cobb leaves the top spinning , in order to go outside and find his children waiting for him .
Whether or not reality is “ real ” has stopped mattering to Cobb , and that final leap of faith is what redeems him .
All the seeming inconsistencies that bothered me on a first viewing evaporated instantly on the second , after I had read Faraci ’s review .
Every line of the movie finds its place , viewed through this lens .
Take Saito , the studio executive who is willing to give Cobb a job , but just a job is n’t enough ; Saito must tempt Cobb with the promise of reaching his children : creative autonomy .
“ How do I know you can deliver ? ” Cobb asks , and Saito responds : “ You do n’t … but I can . ”
That did n’t mean much to me when the players were rival titans of industry , but when I saw Saito as a studio head extending the offer of creative control to the director of the movie I was watching , whoa .
And line after line , it was the same .
“ A man possessed of radical notions . ”
“ The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind . ”
“ How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion ? ”
The most fun part of this whole thing is that Nolan ’s attempt at Inception has worked really beautifully , so far .
He ’s made an idea , “ like a virus , ” enter millions of minds , and we do n’t quite know what it is , not yet .

He added , “ What woman only wears only one outfit for 60 - plus years ? ”
Given Wonder Woman ’s pre-eminence as a female character in the largely male superhero pantheon , her looks have always been a matter of more than casual interest , to both fanboys and feminists .
In a 2006 interview about her work on the series , the novelist Jodi Picoult said : “ One of the first things I did was ask if we could give her breast - reduction surgery , because as a woman , I know you would n’t fight crime in a bustier .
But I was somehow shot down by DC . ”

Image caption Mr Faulkner was given a rapturous reception on returning home
An American man who was arrested in Pakistan while on a solo mission to " hunt down Osama Bin Laden " is back in the United States .
Gary Brooks Faulkner arrived at Los Angeles airport on Wednesday .
He said he would not give up on his mission .
He was detained in the mountains of Chitral district , north of Peshawar city , 10 days ago .
He was carrying a pistol , dagger , sword , night - vision equipment and Christian literature .
" I would describe the situation , like : I got dialysis .
So anyone got a kidney they want to lend me so I can finish this up , " the Associated Press news agency quoted Mr Faulkner as saying .
" This is not about me .
What this is about is the American people and the world .
We can't let people like this scare us .
" We do n't get scared by people like this , we scare them and that 's what this is about .
We 're going to take care of this business . "
Mr Faulkner - an unemployed construction worker dubbed " the American Ninja " was stopped near the Pakistani border with Afghanistan 's Nuristan province , a known Taliban stronghold .
He told investigators after his arrest that he was on a solo mission to kill Osama Bin Laden who is thought to be hiding in the mountainous area .
The al - Qaeda leader is the world 's most - wanted man , with the US offering a reward of up to $ 25 m ( £ 17 m ) for information leading to his capture .
Quit Facebook
Day may have flopped when it comes to creating a mass exodus of Facebook users , but those who care about privacy owe a debt of gratitude to the failed movement .
If you 're still using Facebook after pledging to quit , you 're in good company .
According to the organizers of Quit Facebook Day , only 31,000 angry Facebook users , out of an estimated 450 million , actually followed through with their pledge to delete their account on Monday ( Quit Facebook Day ) .
The day of protest was designed to send Facebook a message that its users were fed - up with surprise privacy changes .
The attempt to strong - arm Facebook to take privacy more seriously is widely seen as a flop .
No , there was no giant sucking sound of people fleeing Facebook over the long holiday weekend .
But the small - stakes game of poker with Facebook , crystallized with Quit Facebook Day , likely did push Facebook 's CEO Mark Zuckerberg to address publicly its new privacy policies and make changes .
Bad publicity , not corporate kindness , convinced Facebook 's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to hold an impromptu press event last week .
It was only then that we heard Zuckerberg attempt to come down off the Facebook mountain and explain its new privacy policies and announce changes in wake of the privacy backlash .
I 'm certain Zuckerberg never would have held last Wednesday 's meeting if it were n't for the Quit Facebook Day thousands .
Facebook Users Love to Hate
Facebook does n't appear to listen to anything more than angry mobs .
Remember , back in February of 2009 when Facebook changed its privacy policies giving the site ownership of users ' " name , likeness , and image " to use in promotions or external advertising ?
Once word broke of the changes , users formed a protest group of 38,000 strong .
It did n't take long for Facebook to do an about - face , reverting to its old terms and agreeing to allow users vote on privacy policy changes .
Remember the Facebook Beacon debacle ?
Back in 2007 , Facebook introduced Beacon , which was part of the company 's ad platform .
Beacons tracked Facebook users as they went to some external sites , like Blockbuster and Fandango , and reported some of their actions back to their Facebook friends network .
Angry Facebook users grabbed their virtual pitchforks and torches and blasted the company for what they called a privacy breech .
It was only then that Zuckerberg publicly apologized for missteps in the design and deployment of Beacon .
Another protest popped up in March 2009 when Facebook redesigned its site .
A Facebook group called " Petition Against the New Facebook " had more than 1.6 million backers , while another Facebook group called " I hate the new Facebook " had 1.5 million supporters .
Again , it was n't until Facebook users revolted that Facebook caved to user gripes and promised to tweak its homepage in response to user uproar .
The Facebook Resistance
Facebook is a private company entitled to change its terms of service whenever it wants .
For Facebook to grow and become more financially successful it will have to .
Who can fault Facebook for that ?
However , if it 's interested in not following the footsteps of other faded Internet champs , such as AOL and MySpace ( which annoyed its users into leaving ) , Facebook would be well served to be more pro-active about communicating changes to its terms of service as opposed to reactive .
Will Facebook ever learn from its privacy missteps , or will its users have to rise up against the service that they value again ?
Until a viable Facebook alternative emerges keep the pitchforks handy .
Long live the Facebook resistance !
It is tempting to express disappointment at the watering down the Senate did to Congressman Ron Pauls vision of how to audit the Federal Reserve .
Dr. Paul himself is , in an interview with the Sun this morning , characterizing the Senates bill as only slightly better than nothing .
He is even warning ,  It does political harm ,  in that it gives the Fed cover  and people can hide from it .
The bill that cleared the Senate is aimed at finding out merely what the Fed did during the recent bailouts but not what it is doing , say , at the discount window or in the way of loans to other central banks and governments and international financial institutions .
It may lead to an auditing merely of procedures and not of numbers .
The right move in the House - Senate conference is a pursuit of a wide audit that would open the Fed to daylight .
In the longer scheme of things , however , its possible to see the a more encouraging side to this story , at least for those of us who came in to the campaign for monetary reform in the 1970s , after President Nixon closed the gold window in 1971 and brought Bretton Woods to its bang - less , whimpering end .
A decade later Congress established the United States Gold Commission .
The commission backed the current system .
But it produced Dr. Pauls famous minority report , in which the congressman from Texas was joined by another member of the commission , Lewis Lehrman , a New York businessman and intellectual .
Now here we are , albeit 30 years later , and a version of what Dr. Paul has been asking for , even if a watered down version , has passed the Senate 96 to zero , and Dr. Paul ranks nearly even in the polls with the sitting president .
Everywhere one goes , moreover , there is a growing recognition , among both ordinary Americans and the high and mighty , that something is off .
We noted , in a story yesterday , that a group of the most distinguished judges on the federal bench is so upset about the decision of the Congress to rescind a promised cost - of - living adjustment in their pay that they are appealing to the Supreme Court .
How can judges sue over their own pay ?
It turns out that judges are a special case , because it is flatly unconstitutional to diminish the pay of a federal judge while the judge continues in office .
So our story covers the possibility that their own lawsuit will eventually confront the judges with the need to do something about the fact that a dollar that only a decade ago was worth a 265th of an ounce of gold is today worth less than a 1,200th of an ounce of gold .
No one perceives this vast unease more clearly than the Fed itself , which has been fighting the idea of an audit on Capitol Hill and , if an audit does emerge from the Congress , can be expected to fight it in court .
The Fed may win the battle in the short run , dodging the kind of wide and full audit that Dr. Paul wants .
We re not immune to the thought that the coalition that is pressing for an audit includes figures on the left , and even far left ( the Nation magazines report on the NPR Web site is here ) , not normally associated with open government and free market capitalism .
But at bottom the shift that is taking place is encouraging .
Partisans of fiat money are now on the defensive .
Countries , like Greece , are collapsing because they have been pursuing a socialistic course , and millions of Americans are demanding to look under the hood of the Fed to see what is being lent out in the way of our money .
The step in the Senate is best seen as but a beginning .
Was hell - raising Baroque artist Caravaggio killed by his own paintings ?
Italian painter Caravaggio died in 1610 of suspected syphilis
In life he was known for his brawling and hard drinking while his death has been shrouded in mystery .
But , 400 years on , the remains of Italian Renaissance master Caravaggio have been found and may unlock the secret , scientists say .
Caravaggio , or Michelangelo Merisi , went on the run in 1606 after being sentenced to death by Pope Paul V for murder .
Four years later he was dead at 39 .
Theories range from syphilis to sunstroke or even foul play .
His final resting place was never recorded and he was thought to have been buried in an unmarked grave .
But now it looks as though he may have been killed by his own paintings ... from lead poisoning .
Scientists today said they believe they have found Caravaggio 's remains .
Last year a collection of bones was found at Caravaggio 's last - known haunt of Porto Ercole , on the coast north of Rome , buried below a church .
In 1610 the area was controlled by the Spanish and there was no record of his burial , with historians saying this was to prevent anyone from staking a claim on Caravaggio 's priceless works of art .
These bones were exhumed and a series of carbon dating and DNA tests were carried out on them with comparisons being made to the DNA of Caravaggio 's known descendants .
Scientists took samples from people traced through his relatives and who had the surname Merisi as part of their 18 - month long CSI - style investigation at the Universities of Bologna and Ravenna .
The bones recovered included parts from a skull , jaw pieces , a femur and a fragment of spine and they were put on show in a glass container at a ceremony in Ravenna University today .
Professor Giorgio Gruppioni , who led the investigation , said the team had focused primarily on a set of remains called ' number five ' and that they were ' 85 per cent certain they were of Caravaggio . '
They had used a 1629 document recovered from archives at Porto Ercole signed by Bishop Scipione Tancredi which had described how the remains of several people had been buried in the crypt below the church at Porto Ercole .
He added that DNA was taken from the remains of Caravaggio 's uncle and brother - both priests - and used for the research and compared to present day descendants .
Professor Gruppioni said : ' Using the information we had to hand , including age , build and height we found elements that would suggest the remains are 85 per cent certain those of Caravaggio .
' Another indicator was the high level of lead in the bones , as it is known the oil paints Caravaggio used contained high amounts of lead and this may have even contributed to his death .
' Lead posioning induces aggressive and violent behaviour which were well known traits of Caravaggio and methods we used were very similar to ones used by detectives solving crimes . "
Caravaggio pioneered the Baroque painting technique known as chiaroscuro , in which light and shadow are sharply contrasted and the discovery of his remains comes just days after a six month exhibition marking his death ended in Rome .
He painted more than 80 works in his brief life and many of them are of a religious nature featuring violent struggles , grotesque decapitations , torture and death .
BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - A rogue Thai general leading a militant wing of anti-government protesters was shot in the head and critically wounded on Thursday , and a man was killed when the army used force to blockade a five - week street rally .
Khattiya Sawasdipol , a suspended army specialist in charge of security for thousands of demonstrators , was shot by an apparent sniper ’s bullet to the temple and rushed to hospital , the state Narenthorn Emergency Medical Service said .
The shootings sparked half a dozen confrontations between rock - throwing protesters and armed security forces on the outskirts of the 3 sq-km ( 1.2 sq- mile ) commercial district where red-shirted protesters have barricaded themselves since April 3 .
One protester was shot in the eye and died after a group of red shirts confronted soldiers armed with assault rifles next to a park in the Silom business district , witnesses said .
Some protesters hurled rocks and troops fired in return .
Gun fire , explosions and sporadic fighting continued into the night around army checkpoints near the protesters ’ encampment , protected by medieval - like walls made from tyres and wooden staves soaked in kerosene and topped by razor wire .
By 2:30 a.m. ( 10:30 p.m. EDT ) , nine people were wounded , according to the Erawan Medical Center .
The military brought in armored vehicles , shut down power in some areas at the protest site and cut some mobile phone services .
Khattiya , better known as “ Seh Daeng ” ( Commander Red ) , was dubbed a “ terrorist ” by Thailand ’s government , which accuses him of involvement in dozens of grenade attacks that have wounded more than 100 people .
But in recent days he was equally critical of other red shirt leaders , accusing them of embracing Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva ’s proposed “ national reconciliation ” which unraveled this week after protesters refused to leave the streets .
Several Thai and foreign reporters said Khattiya was shot as they interviewed him .
He was answering a question about whether the Thai military would be able to penetrate the area .
It is unclear who shot him , though some security analysts suggested the army may have played a role .
“ It ’s a clear attempt to decapitate the red shirt military leadership , ” said Anthony Davis , a security consultant with IHS - Jane’s .
“ It ’s a smart tactical move that will cause confusion in the red shirts ’ military ranks and send a message to the leadership that if they do n’t want to negotiate and come out , they can expect extreme consequences . ”
PRIME MINISTER UNDER PRESSURE
The shooting of Khattiya and the security cordon around the red shirt encampment mark the start of a violent crackdown in which the Thai government stands a good chance of clearing the streets , the Eurasia Group political risk consultancy said .

“ But it will not end the polarization that has led to the current instability -- ensuring that the pressure from the red shirts will persist and that political volatility will remain a persistent problem for Thailand for the foreseeable future . ”
Around the time of the shooting , a loud blast was heard , followed by bursts of automatic gunfire near the business district .
Hours later , troops at a nearby park fired into the air as protesters tried to block their movement .
Abhisit is under enormous pressure to end the protests , which began with festive rallies on March 12 and descended into the deadliest political violence in 18 years in which 30 people have been killed and more than 1,400 wounded .

The crisis has paralyzed parts of the capital , decimated tourism , pushed away foreign portfolio investors and slowed growth in Southeast Asia ’s second - biggest economy .
Foreign investors have sold $ 584 million in Thai shares in the past six sessions , cutting their net buying so far this year to $ 607.6 million in an emerging market seen at the start of the year as one of Asia ’s most promising .
On Wednesday , Abhisit canceled a proposed November 14 election and called off talks with the protesters , who broadly back former premier Thaksin Shinawatra , who was ousted in a 2006 coup and convicted of graft .
He lives in self - exile , mostly in Dubai .
The 22 - member red shirt leadership council has struggled to find consensus and appeared in disarray on Thursday night .
Its chairman and several others have not been seen in days .
Former Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh , chairman of the protesters ’ parliamentary wing , the Puea Thai Party , called on the demonstrators to leave the upscale shopping district where about 20,000 had gathered earlier in the day .
Some hardliners such as Khattiya advocated stepping up the protests to win the fight once and for all .
Many face criminal charges for defying an emergency decree and some , like Khattiya , face terrorism charges carrying a maximum penalty of death .
The protesters said this week they would only disperse if a deputy prime minister faces criminal charges over a deadly April 10 clash between troops and protesters .
The Cabinet on Thursday approved a state of emergency in 17 northern and northeastern provinces , which are red shirt strongholds , to prevent potential unrest .
Companies and embassies across the area , including the U.S. embassy , closed and activated back - up plans for Friday .
Public transportation was diverted from the area .
Protest leaders pleaded over their radio station for people to come and reinforce the encampment and threatened to lay siege to Abhisit ’s house and an infantry barracks where he has taken refuge if there was a crackdown .
Image caption Louisiana is already feeling the effects of the oil spill
A sheen of oil from the Gulf of Mexico spill is nearing the white sand beaches of north - west Florida , officials say .
The slick , containing thousands of tar balls , is only nine miles ( 15 km ) from Pensacola on the Florida " panhandle " .
" It 's inevitable that we will see it on the beaches , " said Keith Wilkins , an Escambia County official .
Meanwhile , BP 's efforts to cap the leaking well got back on track as a saw that had become stuck in a thick pipe on the sea bed for hours was freed .
The company is attempting to contain the spill from the well by cutting off the fractured pipe and sealing it with a cap .
Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said crews were shooting chemical dispersants at the oil now leaking out of the new cut .
Barriers approved
Forecasters suggest the oil spill may reach Florida 's shores as soon as Friday .
Workers have been rushing to place more booms along the threatened coastline in an effort to protect its beaches and wildlife .
Every day they wait , every day they make us wait , we 're losing our battle to protect our coast Bobby Jindal , Louisiana governor
Florida Governor Charlie Crist said the oil sheen observed off the state 's north - west coast contained thousands of tar balls , heavy globs of decayed oil .
" The goal is to remove that oil from near shore waters and prevent or minimise any potential impacts on our state , " he told reporters .
In Louisiana , the worst - affected state , Governor Bobby Jindal told a news conference that the White House had approved the construction of five sand barriers , or berms , off its coastline - and had ordered BP to pay for the work .
Mr Jindal has strongly criticised the Obama administration and BP over the past few days for being too slow to respond to the crisis .
" Every day they wait , every day they make us wait , we 're losing our battle to protect our coast , " he said .
Oil debris has also reached Alabama 's Dauphin Island and parts of the Mississippi shoreline .
BP estimates that the disaster has so far cost the company approximately $ 990 m ( £ 674 m ) in clean - up costs , but has refused to speculate on future expenses .
BP shares have fallen by more than a third since the spill .
News that the US justice department has opened several civil and criminal inquiries into the Gulf spill caused futher falls on Wednesday morning .
' Dangerous short - cuts '
The BBC's North America editor Mark Mardell says there is a growing sense of frustration that all BP 's efforts have come to naught , and things could get worse for the company .
Image caption Clean - up crews have been working to remove oil from beaches and marshes
In a speech in Pennsylvania on Wednesday , President Barack Obama said that the leak " may prove to be a result of human error , or of corporations taking dangerous shortcuts to compromise safety " .
He went on : " We have to acknowledge that there are inherent risks to drilling four miles beneath the surface of the Earth .
" These are risks that are bound to increase the harder oil extraction becomes . "
Mr Obama urged Congress to pass legislation to overhaul US energy policy and end tax breaks for oil companies , saying he would seek Republican as well as Democratic support for reform .
" I will continue to make the case for a clean energy future wherever and whenever I can , " he said .
" I will work with anyone to get this done . "
The oil began leaking into the Gulf of Mexico on 20 April when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , leased to BP , exploded , killing 11 workers .
BP is drilling two relief wells to permanently stop the leak but they are not expected to be completed until August .
A " top kill " procedure , which had been considered the best hope for plugging the leak , failed over the weekend when engineers were unable to pump enough heavy mud into the well to staunch the oil flow .
I was thinking recently about my visit to SCO back in 2003 .
Since then SCO has been through bankruptcy and their various court cases have collapsed several times , although they are still struggling on .
Their argument was always very weak .
I could see that at the time , although I was also scared that the court might come to the wrong decision anyhow .
Fortunately that has not happened to date .
What I think most about was Blake Stowell ’s question to me as I was leaving .
Blake Stowell was at the time SCO ’s Director of Public Relations .
He asked what I would do if I owned some proprietary code that somebody else had copied , implying that SCO ’s behaviour was not merely legally justified but was even morally justified .
It was a long time ago , but the impression that I recall was that he sincerely thought that SCO was doing something which reasonable people would consider to be OK , and wanted to see whether I agreed .
My answer at the time was not very good .
It ’s a question which I now think brings us to the heart of copyright laws .
If I write something myself , what rights do I have to prevent other people from making derivative works ?
If I buy the rights to something that somebody else wrote , do I have the same rights with regard to derivative works ?
Does it matter how those derivative works are being used ?
I ’m raising these rhetorical questions not as a matter of law — the law is what it is — but as a matter of what we , as a society , ideally want to permit .
SCO was acting as the copyright equivalent of a patent troll : they acquired the rights to something which they did not create , and attempted to gain revenue from other people using the same ideas .
Should we permit that ?
In considering issues like this , it ’s very important to not mix up copyright with real property .
It ’s natural to start thinking that something that I write is like something that I own .
If I own a car , it ’s not OK for somebody to drive it without my permission .
The issues with code are far less clear .
Copyright is a balance between the rights of the authors and the rights of everybody else .
Copyright does not last forever , unlike my ownership of the car .
There are various exceptions to copyright , such as fair use .
Even if we take SCO ’s very best case , they were talking about a tiny percentage of code being copied from an earlier version of Unix into the Linux kernel .
Did that give them the right to charge people for using the Linux kernel ?
If the code was removed from the Linux kernel , as did in fact happen later , would they still have the right to charge based on an expansive notion of derived work ?
Intuitively I think that while the original author has considerable rights to control code that she or he writes , those rights tend to decrease with time and distance .
It ’s not obvious to me that control over an author ’s work is something that can be sold or inherited .
It also makes a difference whether the work is used in its entirety or whether a portion of the work is excerpted .
It also makes a difference whether the work is used by itself or in combination with work by other authors .
Unfortunately these issues are all fuzzy .
For law to be useful , the issues have to be spelled out , which is hard , and tends to give too much weight to the author at the expense of the rest of society .
And the rules appropriate for books and music may not be appropriate for code .
A sane copyright law has to make it clear that legal assertions like the ones that SCO made claiming to own Linux are unsupportable .
The remedy for minor code copying is to remove the copied code ; it is not to grant ownership rights to the larger package into which the code was copied .
SCO ’s actions were not justified .
The fact that they appear to be failing is a triumph of justice .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - A new study adds to evidence that pregnancy may worsen or bring on symptoms of obsessive - compulsive disorder in some women -- suggesting , researchers say , that certain cases of the disorder involve abnormal responses to hormonal changes .
Obsessive - compulsive disorder , or OCD , is an anxiety disorder in which people have persistent , unwanted thoughts that compel them to repeat routines and rituals over and over .
An obsession with germs or cleanliness , for example , may drive a person to wash his or her hands constantly throughout the day .
It ’s estimated that just over 2 million U.S. adults have OCD , with the symptoms often arising in childhood or the teenage years .
However , a few studies have found that OCD can also arise during or soon after pregnancy , and that pregnancy may worsen OCD symptoms in some women who already have the disorder .
The new study confirms and extends those findings , according to lead researcher Dr. Ariadna Forray , of Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven , Connecticut .
Using medical records and interviews with 126 women treated at the Yale OCD Clinic , the researchers found that of the 78 women who had ever been pregnant , 24 ( 32 percent ) had their first OCD symptoms during or soon after pregnancy .
And when the researchers looked at pregnancies among women with pre-existing OCD , they found that the women ’s OCD symptoms worsened one - third of the time .
( In a smaller number of pregnancies -- 22 percent -- symptoms actually improved . )
Forray ’s team also found that women whose pre-pregnancy OCD typically got worse in the premenstrual period were at greater risk of exacerbations during pregnancy .
That finding , the researchers say , supports the notion that there is a “ hormone - related ” subtype of OCD that affects some women .
“ These women may have a differential sensitivity to reproductive hormones , and , as such , normal reproductive events are triggers for the onset or exacerbation of OCD , ” Forray told Reuters Health in an email .
It is not known why such differences in hormone sensitivity may exist , she said , but it could involve differences in genes that help regulate , or are regulated by , reproductive hormones .
Forray said the findings suggest that women with OCD , and their doctors , should be aware that pregnancy might worsen their symptoms -- particularly if they normally have exacerbations in the premenstrual period .
They and their doctors can then keep track of their OCD symptoms during pregnancy and possibly make changes in how they are managing the disorder .
The standard treatments for OCD include cognitive - behavioral therapy , antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications .
Women and doctors should also be aware that OCD can arise during or soon after pregnancy , according to Forray .
It is normal for expectant or new mothers to have some anxiety and worries .
But , Forray said , if certain thoughts and behaviors -- like worries about cleanliness , order , or the baby ’s well - being -- start to cause distress and interfere with everyday functioning , then it is time to discuss it with your doctor .
The current findings also suggest that women who develop OCD around the time of pregnancy may be particularly likely to have symptoms related to fear of “ contamination ” -- germs and dirt .
Of women whose symptoms arose during or after pregnancy , 67 percent had such worries .
That compared with 36 percent of women whose OCD onset was not pregnancy - related .

( So , in reality , D probably is n’t all that little , but here ’s to it making it up the mountain . )
A good while ago I wrote a post about my hope for the D programming language as an up - and - comer in systems and embedded programming .
D promises to bring a number of modern language concepts and constructs to low - level systems while yet producing a fairly efficient runtime .
It ’s 3 years on since my original post , but I ’m still hopeful .
Just a few days ago a comment came in on my original post .
My friend Mark VanderVoord responded in that comment thread .
I thought I ’d make the content of the thread a bit more visible ( below ) as it ’s concerned with using D in the real world .
There ’s been respectable progress toward D becoming viable in the mainstream .
I ’ll venture a guess that it ’s going to be several more years until it truly is .
Update ( 7/1/2010 ) : We do n’t often attract a great many comments on our posts .
But we have here .
I point it out because there ’s good resources , background , and perspective on D in the comments .
Take a read .
The original comment thread that sparked this post can still be found beneath this update .
Since our comments can’t contain links , I ’m listing & linkifying here what our commenters have referenced :
Update ( 7/6/2010 ) : Commenter devdanke suggested Apple as a D corporate backer .
Google seems to be pursuing Go ; why not Apple getting behind D? Apple certainly has a lot invested in LLVM of late .
Apple may just be up to something — though I ’m doubtful it ’s D. Time will tell …

Is there any active development that you know of to get D running on embedded , bare - metal type platforms ?
As the beaches of Southern Europe prepare for this summer 's influx of pale skinned British sun worshippers , new research from the University of Bradford has found that redheads are just as capable of making the melanin needed for a tan as the olive skinned locals .
Scientists have always assumed that the propensity of redheads to burn is related to their inability to make melanin -- the pigment which is created and stored in our skin cells to protect us against the sun 's ultra-violet radiation ( UVR ) .
But a team from the University 's Centre for Skin Sciences ( CSS ) found that in the laboratory , pigment cells isolated from very fair ( Celtic - type ) skin were able to make as much -- and in one case up to five times more -- melanin than cells from olive ( Italian - type ) skin , when cultured under identical conditions .
However , the fair skin cells did show a higher inflammatory response to UVR than their olive - skinned counterparts .
The research , in part funded by the Wellcome Trust , is published in the current issue of Pigment Cell and Melanoma Research .
CSS Director and the study 's lead author , Professor of Cell Biology Des Tobin , says : " Research into sunburn has tended to ignore melanocytes -- the cells that make melanin -- as it's been assumed that was all they did .
But our research has shown that in some skin types they also contribute to the inflammation that creates sunburn and it's this , rather than their ability to make melanin , that seems to be at the root of how different skins respond to the sun . "
The researchers isolated melanocytes from five patients with very fair skin and from five with olive skin .
Some of the cells from each patient were stimulated to create melanin and the levels measured .
Others cells from each patient were subjected to UVR and levels of a pro-inflammatory chemical called prostaglandin - E 2 ( PGE 2 ) measured .
All the cells were able to make similar amounts of melanin , with one fair skinned patient making five times more than the other patients .
However , melanocytes from patients with very fair skins made up to five times more PGE 2 than those from olive - skinned patients .
" Our research shows that melanocytes may play a role in UVR - induced inflammation , so targeting these cells with anti-inflammatory interventions could offer a new way of protecting more vulnerable skin types from sunburn , " says Professor Tobin .
" Clearly something within fair skins is also preventing melanocytes from making protective melanin to prevent the harm caused by UVR and we will be focusing further research on this area . "
With an advertising world keen to use every inch of a medium for brand or product experience , it is becoming increasingly popular to design websites with full - browser backgrounds .
Using CSS , this can be achieved quite easily .
Just drop a huge background image in a page with one line of code ( Line wraps marked » — Ed. ) :
Article Continues Below
body { background : # 000 url( myBackground_1280x960.jpg ) » center center fixed no - repeat ; }
Example one shows a centered background image of 1280 by 960 pixels that is fixed to the viewing area ( it does n’t scroll with the document ) .
But which image size will be big enough ?
Monitors and operating systems have evolved quickly , and as a result there is a wide range of available screen resolutions .
The most popular resolutions today are 1024x768 px , 1280x800 px , 1280x1024px , and 1440x900 px .
However , with the advent of HD screens ( 1920x1080 px ) and professional displays that support resolutions up to 2560x1600 px , almost anything is possible .
There is also a case to be made for lower resolutions .
Many people resize their browser window to fill up a percentage of their screen , while a range of modern screens only support an 800x600 px resolution .
And that leaves a lot of lower - spec handhelds out of the equation .
Instead of using one fixed background size , a better solution would be to scale the image to make it fit within different window sizes .
Unfortunately , CSS 2.1 has no means of scaling background images .
There are a couple of workarounds , however these all rely on the HTML img element ( instead of CSS backgrounds ) .
They also use absolute positioning for layering and tables or scripting to enable resizing .
Additionally , not all of these techniques preserve the image ’s ratio , which results in unrealistically stretched backgrounds .
CSS3 backgrounds to the rescue#section2
The W3C CSS Background and Borders Module Level 3 ( currently a working draft ) defines the background - size property that fits our requirements .
Interesting values ( to cite the W3C specs ) are :
contain
Scale the image , while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio ( if any ) , to the largest size such that both its width and its height can fit inside the background positioning area .
cover
Scale the image , while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio ( if any ) , to the smallest size such that both its width and its height can completely cover the background positioning area .
Contain always fits the entire image within your viewport , leaving opaque borders on either the top - bottom or the left - right whenever the ratio of the background image and browser window are not the same .
In Example two , we have extended the code from Example one by setting the background - size property to contain .
Cover always fills the browser window , cutting off some hair or ears in the process , which is what I personally prefer for most cases .
You can control how your image is aligned within the viewport by using the background - position property .
In Example three we have extended Example one again , this time by setting the background - size property to cover .
You enable background scaling by adding the following declarations to your stylesheet :
body { background : # 000 url( myBackground_1280x960.jpg ) » center center fixed no -repeat ; - moz - background - size : cover ; background - size : cover ; }
The background - size property is already supported by Firefox 3.6 ( using the - moz prefix ; Firefox 4 will use the regular CSS3 property ) , Chrome 5 , Safari 5 , and Opera 10.54 ; and it will be included in Internet Explorer 9 ( it ’s already available in Preview 3 ) .
Older Webkit and Opera versions already support the background - size property , however these implementations are based on a previous draft which did not include the contain and cover keywords .
The downside of this method is that there is no background property available to set a minimum width or height .
When one resizes the browser window to a very small width or height , the background image will rescale to a very small size , an often - undesired behavior .
Adding CSS3 media queries to the mix#section3
The W3C CSS3 Media Queries Module ( a candidate recommendation ) defines conditional rules that only apply within certain width or height ranges .
This enables us to implement background scaling from a minimal width and height and on .
Media queries are supported by Firefox 3.5 , Chrome , Safari 3 , and Opera 7 , and will also be included in Internet Explorer 9 .
By adding the following style rules we tell the browser that we do n’t want a background image to scale smaller than 1024 ×768 pixels :
body { background : # 000 url( myBackground_1280x960.jpg ) » center center fixed no -repeat ; - moz - background - size : cover ; background - size : cover ; }@media only all and ( max - width : 1024 px ) and ( max - height : 768 px ) { body { - moz - background - size : 1024 px 768 px ; background - size : 1024px 768 px ; } }
Note that 1024x768px has the same ratio as the background image ( 1280x960 px ) .
When using a different ratio you will get sudden jumps in scaling when resizing your browser window .
In our final examples , four and five , we have added the @media rule , so that our background image does n’t scale smaller than 1024 by 768 pixels .
Example five shows that by setting the background - position property to left - bottom instead of center - center , we can control the way the background image is aligned within the viewport .
Revisiting old techniques #section4
These are exciting times for web developers , with all the browser makers working hard to implement upcoming technologies like HTML5 and CSS3 .
As a result , it ’s time to start revisiting old techniques to see how the same things can be done in smarter , cleaner ways .
While the upgrade cycles of Firefox , Chrome , Safari , and Opera are relatively short , it will be interesting to see how quickly people embrace Internet Explorer 9 , so we can start using many of these new techniques on a large scale soon .

Do kids outgrow socialism ?
A fascinating new study , " Fairness and the Development of Inequality Acceptance , " [ subscription required ] published last week in the journal Science by researchers at the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration sheds some light on individual moral development .
It turns out that as people move from childhood through adolescence to young adulthood they become increasingly meritocratic , that is , they come to believe that people deserve unequal rewards based on their individual achievements .
The Norwegian researchers studied about 500 children beginning in the fifth grade through the 13th grade ( ages 11 through 19 ) as they played modified versions of the dictator game .
In the standard dictator game , a sum of money , say $ 100 , is divided up between two players .
The dictator decides how much to keep and how much to give the second player , the responder .
Interestingly , research shows consistently that most dictators do not keep all the money .
The Norwegian researchers modified the game allowing for a 45 - minute production phase in which players could earn points by finding and clicking on specific numbers in a series of computer screens .
The researchers also set up alternative tasks allowing students to choose to play video games or watch cartoons instead of trying to collect points .
Most of the participants turned out to be workaholics who clicked away full time trying to gain points .
Later the points could be exchanged for money , but in some cases the amount of money was randomly given a multiplier , so that some lucky participants ended up earning more than others who had been equally productive .
Once the game was over , kids from the same grade were paired and told how long each had spent earning points , how many they earned , and what multiplier each received .
The pair 's winnings were combined and one — the dictator — would decide how to divide up the total .
What happened ?
The Norwegian school kids , both male and female , divvied up the money with the mean share given to responders averaging around 45 percent across all grades .
The researchers suggest that this nearly equal division results from the fact that " there is no apparent fairness argument justifying an unequal division of the money . "
However , the researchers found that how students divided up money changed as they became older when it was earned and depended on individual achievements and luck .
Most fifth graders ( 63 percent ) remained strict egalitarians , dividing up the money equally , despite the fact that some players earned more money through individual achievement .
However , the portion of egalitarians dropped to 40 percent by 7th grade ; falling eventually to 22 percent by 13th grade .
Conversely , the share of meritocrats rose from 5 percent in the fifth grade , to 22 percent in 7th grade , rising eventually to 42 percent in the 13th grade .
A full 42 percent of players in the 13th grade kept more money for themselves because they believed that they have earned it .
The authors of the Norwegian study conclude that the meritocratic fairness view increases as the cognitive abilities of children mature .
In other words : yes , kids outgrow socialism .
The researchers also wanted to see if people are affected by efficiency considerations , so they set up the game so that some players ' earnings could be multiplied by as much as a factor of four .
In this case , the dictator can increase the overall total earned by the pair by giving his points to the responder .
Younger kids do n't take this multiplier effect into account , but as the age of male players increased , they were more willing to sacrifice points in order to increase the overall size of the pot .
In other words , they choose to take less in order to maximize overall income .
In addition , the researchers found that in every grade about one - third of students do not find inequalities in earnings unfair , regardless of whether they are gained either through achievement or luck .
They call this group " libertarians . "
Oddly , the study does not reveal how " libertarians " played the dictator game , though the overall average 45 /55 percent split does not seem to have been greatly affected by their play .
The researchers note , " Although there was a sharp decrease in the importance of the strict egalitarian fairness view , the prevalence of the libertarian fairness view was stable throughout adolescence . "
Whatever motivates them , it is clear is that they are not egalitarians .
University of Virginia moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt 's research explores similar territory : the differences in ethical reasoning between liberals , conservatives , and libertarians .
He argues that there are five dimensions along which people make moral choices , e.g. , fairness , harm , loyalty , authority , and spiritual purity .
Haidt finds that liberals focus chiefly on the first two dimensions , whereas conservatives deploy all five dimensions in their ethical reasoning .
At a recent lecture at the American Enterprise Institute , Haidt further refined the notion of fairness , asserting that there are three kinds of fairness .
Liberals focus on one kind of fairness , where everyone 's needs are met to some degree .
Conservatives , by contrast , see fairness when people are rewarded for their efforts , e.g. , what they put in , they get to take out .
They also see retribution as a special kind of equity in which perpetrators of wrongs must suffer to the same degree as their victims , e.g. , an eye for an eye .
What about libertarians ?
After his lecture , I asked Haidt where libertarians fit along the five moral dimensions .
He asked me to guess how libertarians tested .
" Like liberals , " I said , by which I meant that libertarians , like liberals , are less concerned about group loyalty , obedience to authority , and purity .
He laughed and said , " Yes , like liberals , but without compassion . "
Put another way , libertarians react like liberals , but without the concerns about egalitarianism that dominate the way liberals — and 10 - year - olds — think about fairness .

Even Buddha can't catch a break in San Francisco .
The 15 - ton , three - headed copper sculpture that was unveiled in Civic Center Plaza last month for the 30th anniversary of San Francisco 's sister - city relationship with Shanghai has already been defaced twice by graffiti .
Officials retained an art restorer to remove the tags , including one scrawl proclaiming , " Jesus is the one . "
Now , City Hall fears that the giant Buddha may prove too inviting to booze - fueled partygoers from the nearby World Cup big screen telecasts and Gay Priders looking for a little climbing fun during their upcoming post - parade party .
So the $ 1.6 million sculpture , on loan from artist Zhang Huan , is in protective custody for the next three weeks , surrounded by a 6 - foot - tall screened fence to deter climbers and anyone else .
Check swing :
The odds of San Jose getting an A's ballpark plan on the November ballot appear to be slipping fast - in large part because of inaction by Major League Baseball .
" We keep waiting for the ' swing away ' sign from baseball , but so far - nothing , " Mayor Chuck Reed said .
Baseball officials have been sympathetic to the Giants ' argument that the South Bay is their territory , which means no other team can move in .
They would have to do a 180 to bless any proposed stadium for the A's - and publicly say , " Thanks , but no thanks " to the city of Oakland as well .
The City Council 's meeting next week will be its last before a month - plus summer break .
It 's already too late to get any stadium plan on the agenda for that session .
The next meeting is Aug. 3 - just days before the deadline for putting a measure on the November ballot .
Reed said the council could put something before voters without baseball 's blessing , and he 's confident it would still pass .
But Santa Clara County Assessor LarryStone , one of the ballpark 's biggest boosters , said that going ahead without a commitment of a team would " not be very productive .
It just gives the opposition too much ammunition . "
Fading power : San Francisco is tapping the brakes on its plan to offer a green alternative to Pacific Gas and Electric Co .
The proposal outlined by Power Choice LLC , the consortium picked by the city 's Public Utilities Commission to deliver green energy , came with some pretty thick strings attached .
For starters , to keep rates competitive with PG&E for at least the first three years , Power Choice has proposed borrowing an estimated $ 400 million - which customers would then have to repay over 15 years in the form of higher rates .
Power Choice also wants the city to use its credit to back the plan , meaning the city would be on the hook if the consortium went belly up .
PUC General Manager Ed Harrington tells us those terms " would not be satisfactory to the city . "
Even San Francisco SupervisorRoss Mirkarimi , a major proponent of the city 's green power movement , said it may be worth scrubbing the Power Choice proposal altogether and putting the contract back out to bid .
Ready , set ... :
Word is , Jim Hammer may not be the only San Francisco Police Commission member looking to replace Kamala Harrisas district attorney .
David Onek , a former criminal justice deputy to Mayor Gavin Newsomand a senior fellow at UC Berkeley 's Boalt Hall School of Law - as well as the son - in - law of 1988 Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis - reportedly is eyeing a run as well .
We 're told he will soon step down from the Police Commission to concentrate on the campaign .
Stay tuned .

As we ramp up to the mid-term elections in November 2010 — sure to be just a warmup to the insanity that will be the Presidential election in 2012 — you can bet your bottom shekel that we ’ll be hearing from a lot of " family values " politicians decrying our lack of morality .
That ’s de rigeur for any election , but every cycle it seems to get worse .
A lot of these claim that the United States is either a Christian nation — a ridiculous and easily - disprovable notion — or that it was founded on Judeo - Christian principles ( the " Judeo " part is a giveaway that these politicians are Leviticans : they seem to keep their noses buried more in the fiery wrath of the Old Testament than in the actually gentle , politically - correct teachings of Jesus … more on this later , promise ) .
Specifically , they claim quite often that our laws are based on the Ten Commandments .
I was thinking about this recently .
People seem to accept that our laws are based on the morals of the Old Testament laid out in the Commandments , but as a proper skeptic , I decided to take a look myself .
Why not go over the Commandments , said I to myself , and compare them to our actual laws , as well as the Constitution , the legal document framed by the Founding Fathers , and upon which our laws are actually based ?
So I did *.
For those of you not familiar with the Bible — which includes many politicians most willing to thump it , it seems — what follows is the relevant passage from Exodus 20 in the King James Version† .
I found it online at the University of Michigan ’s Digital Library , which matches other online versions I found .
Note : apparently , God said some other stuff interspersed among the Commandments , a sort of legal commentary to stress the aspects
He felt important .
I have highlighted the actual Commandments below .
Let ’s take a look :
[ 1 ] And God spake all these words , saying , [ 2 ]
I am the LORD thy God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage . [ 3 ]
Thou shalt have no other gods before me . [ 4 ]
Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth : [ 5 ]
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them : for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ; [ 6 ]
And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me , and keep my commandments . [ 7 ]
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain ; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain . [ 8 ]
Remember the sabbath day , to keep it holy . [ 9 ]
Six days shalt thou labour , and do all thy work : [ 10 ]
But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God : in it thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , thy manservant , nor thy maidservant , nor thy cattle , nor thy stranger that is within thy gates : [ 11 ]
For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it . [ 12 ]
Honour thy father and thy mother : that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee . [ 13 ]
Thou shalt not kill . [ 14 ]
Thou shalt not commit adultery . [ 15 ]
Thou shalt not steal . [ 16 ]
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour . [ 17 ]
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour ’s house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour ’s wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s .
So let ’s take these one at a time , and see how many points of U.S. law that overlap the Ten Commandments shalt rack up .
1 ) I am the LORD thy God …
Thou shalt have no other gods before me .
OK , that ’s clear enough .
Obviously , God is saying
He ’s the only one , and all other religions that have other gods , or other versions of The One God , are wrong .
So let ’s take a look at the Constitution , specifically the First Amendment :
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ;
Right away , we have a problem .
That ’s the very first thing laid out in the Bill of Rights , and I mean the very first sentence .
" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . "
What this says to me , and is pretty clear about it , is that we cannot make laws saying this god or that god is The God .
Not only that , if you want to worship a god , any god , you have the legal right to do so .
Clearly , this very First Right of all Americans is in direct contradiction to the very first Commandment sent down by God .
So people saying our laws are based on the Ten Commandments must never have even gotten to the first one of the ten .
I guess they got to Exodus 19 and stopped .

2 ) Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above , or that is in the earth beneath , or that is in the water under the earth .
Obviously , we have no laws governing this .
As I understand it , this is a point of contention between many different sub-sections of Christianity , which is understandable .
If you have a statue of , say Jesus , and you worship it , does it break this Commandment ?
Maybe you can claim it only represents God .
I suppose transubstantiation is also something to consider here .
But I wonder ; sometimes people leave little offerings to statues and such , like when a statue of the Virgin Mary is seen to bleed , or when a religious icon appears in an overpass or a window .
Is that a violation of this Commandment ?
These sorts of arguments are interesting to me , but I ’m not a religious scholar , so I ’ll leave it for others to decide .
The point is , no laws are on the books or in the Constitution to prevent that , and again the First Amendment says it ’s OK to worship whomever you want .
So …

3 ) Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain
Ah , another easy one .
The very second phrase in the First Amendment states :
[ Congress shall make no law ] abridging the freedom of speech
There ’s no codicil that says , " … except for taking the Lord ’s name in vain " , so I have to conclude the Constitution not only is not based on this Commandment , but directly contradicts it as well .

4 ) Remember the sabbath day
Well , we do have Blue Laws in the US , restricting things like business practices ( notably liquor sales ) on Sunday .
Of course , the Jews say the sabbath is from Friday night to Saturday night , and do n’t see Sunday as being the sabbath at all , so interpreting this Commandment is a bit up in the air .
But even ignoring that , most of these Blue Laws have — correctly — been repealed .
Not only that , but I suspect that a lot of these politicians making claims about the Ten Commandments themselves work on Sundays ( or even Saturdays ) .
Since we do in fact have laws based on this Commandment — even if they are unconstitutional — I ’ll give this one half credit .

5 ) Honour thy father and thy mother
This is good advice , certainly , and at the very least worth keeping in mind and even attempting in daily life .
But is this the basis for any legal precedent ?
Children disrespect their parents all the time — I might even accept that as a definition of childhood .
Of course , before they ’re 18 we ca n’t toss a kid in jail for saying their dad is a poopyhead , but after they come into the majority … but then adult offspring still do all sorts of disrespectful things to their parents .
Again , think as I might on this , I ca n’t come up with any laws ( or any Constitutional statements ) specifically saying you ca n’t be disrespectful .
Sure , you ca n’t slander your parents , or libel them , or beat them up , or any number of other awful things .
But you ca n’t do that to anyone , and those are illegal for other reasons , and do n’t count .

Intermission
So here we are , halfway through the Ten Commandments , and there is not yet one single thing they say that actually has legal precedent .
Mind you , if I were God , I ’d put the most important rules first , so I think even at this midway point we can safely say our laws are not based on the Ten Commandments .
But it ’s worth going through them all , and besides , I promised .
I do n’t want to be accused of bearing false witness .
6 ) Thou shalt not kill .
Now we ’re getting somewhere .
This action forbidden by God actually isillegal !
Now , I can argue that this particular action was objectionable long before the Ten Commandments were etched in stone .
Heck , even some other primates apparently can grieve over the loss of other primates .
So I do n’t think we can actually state that our laws are based on this Commandment ; it ’s more like they have a common ancestor .
Note too that the code of Ur - Nammu , which predates Moses by centuries , expressly forbad murder .
Also , people kill all the time , and it ’s not necessarily illegal .
Soldiers , for example , or killing in self defense .
Some people say that the Commandment actually translates to " murder " , which would then exclude my two examples .
Fair enough .
But either way , the Commandments can’t really claim first rights to this one .
However , I ca n’t rule out that our law is based on this Commandment ; even if other civilizations had their own rules , ours may have a different pedigree .
From what I ’ve read , much of the rules laid out in the Constitution were taken from British law , and that itself may have roots traceable back to the Commandments .
Given all this , I can be generous , and give this one a full point .

7 ) Thou shalt not commit adultery .
Well , we do have some laws dealing with this as well — though they are seldom enforced , and vary wildly from state to state .
To be honest , I think these laws are silly , and I ’m glad they ’re not taken too seriously .
If someone chooses to have adulterous relations outside their marriage , that ’s up to them .
If they have a contract — legal or emotional or personal — to someone else , and betray them in this way , then yeah , that ’s pretty awful , and immoral .
We ’ve evolved to be mostly monogamous creatures , and we feel pretty bad when our mate goes off with someone else .
But we do have the capability to exceed our evolutionary limitations .
And what if both people in the relationship mutually agree to bring in a third party ?
Is n’t that up to them , and not some Senator who peeps into their bedroom window to decide ?
Something like this , I suspect , should be taken on a case - by - case basis , and not have blanket laws thrown over everything .
In this sense ( and more things listed below ) , my feelings would fall under the purview of libertarianism .
Mind you , there are some things that may be bad behavior but are n’t necessarily illegal .
If you disagree with this , think about some bad behavior you personally might have , and ask yourself if they should be illegal .
Bear in mind marijuana is illegal , but tobacco and alcohol are n’t .
Hmmm .
Since few of these laws even exist , and those are on the wane — and not enforced — even half credit would be a stretch .

8 ) Thou shalt not steal .
Well , sure .
No quarrel here .
And since a lot of the arguments behind this follow those of # 6 above , I ’ll have to give this a full point .
Still , something here bugs me .
After all , this one ’s a bit specific , do n’t you think ?
I mean , if God went out of His way to start mentioning specific acts to be bad , why this one ?
Why not other ones that are generally considered to be more important ?
Sure , stealing is bad , but I ’d rather someone steals a loaf of bread than rapes someone , for example .
I would put rape much higher on the list even than adultery , too .
What kind of legal or moral code would leave that act off its list of " Thou shalt nots " ?
I ’ll note that the above - mentioned Code of Ur - Nammu made rape a capital crime .
Since we do have laws about this , and given # 6 , I ’ll grant this a full point .
Points : 1.0

9 ) Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour .
Of all the Commandments , this is the one I like the best .
Why ?
For one thing , as a skeptic and scientist , I think it ’s incredibly important to be honest .
But another reason is schadenfreude .
So many people who interpret the Bible literally seem to ignore this Commandment , like , for example , here , and here , and here , and here , and here , and here .
Say .
However , the strict interpretation of this Commandment is not simply lying .
Bearing false witness is a phrase that implies you are lying in some sort of official capacity ; for example , in front of a local judge or magistrate .
In that case , it ’s perjury , and illegal .
Again , these rules are more ancient than the Commandments , but with # 6 and # 8 above , I ’ll have to give this a full point .
Points : 1.0

10 ) Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour ’s house , thou shalt not covet thy neighbour ’s wife , nor his manservant , nor his maidservant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s .
I ’m not a big fan of coveting .
It ’s more than simple jealousy , it ’s the actual inordinate desire to possess something owned by or associated with someone else .
It can be an ugly emotion , to be sure , but making it illegal would , I think , be overstepping the bounds of the legal system .
I ’m also not so big on outlawing an emotion .
Coveting is uncool , but there is a whole laundry list of negative emotions , many of which are ugly indeed .
We do n’t have laws against those , but it ’s odd to me that the one emotion listed in the Commandments is coveting .
Either way , this certainly argues against the idea that we ’re basing our laws on the Commandments .
Flipping this around , there ’s also a huge list of immoral actions that are illegal , but not mentioned in the Ten Commandments .
Torture , for one .
Waging false war would be up there pretty high on my list .
Nepotism is a good one , too .
I bet you can think of others .
Anyway , since we do n’t have actual laws against coveting this one gets no credit .

Hmph .
So at the very best — and I think I was generous — not even half the Commandments translate into law , and those that do have a suspicious pedigree .
Moreover , the first four Commandments , and the ones that most pertain to religion and Judeo - Christianity specifically , are expressly forbidden by our Constitution ( and the fifth is arguably unconstitutional as well ) .
If the Founding Fathers really wanted our country ’s system of laws to be based on the Commandments , then this is not an auspicious way to do it .
One might even think they were trying on purpose , very hard , to prevent such a thing .
Now , some people say that it ’s not really our laws , but our morality that ’s based on the Ten Commandments .
I think that ’s a silly claim as well , for many of the same reasons outlined above .
Remember too that many civilizations had codes of ethics and legal systems that had similar ideas long before Moses climbed Mt. Sinai .
Moreover , reading through the teachings of Jesus , I see a lot of things like ( paraphrasing a bit ) " Be nice to each other " , " Forgive one another " , " Look at your own failings before sniping at someone else " , and others .
Not only are these not in the Ten Commandments , most of them are n’t even hinted at .
Sure , not coveting and stealing your neighbor ’s possessions is a good place to start for morality , but I think those could both be encompassed by saying " Your neighbor ’s a person too , and you should respect that . "
I might even claim that rule to be golden .
Say .
So the Ten Commandments are clearly neither the moral nor legal basis of the United States of America .
At best , you can say that 2 ( rounding up ) overlap our laws , but they are a hardly a basis for laws .
And they fall far , far short of being a basis of morality .
I would think a lot of the things ( but not all of them ! ) in Jesus ’s Sermon on the Mount would be in a better position for claims of our moral basis , but I do n’t see anyone saying a transcript of that speech should be hung in a courtroom .
And it would be illegal in many cases to do so anyway .
Of course , nearly all politicians making claims about moral issues based on the Bible are themselves going against a whole lot of the things Jesus was pretty specific about .
Go ahead and read the Sermon on the Mount , and ask yourself if the politicians so fond of bringing up that old - time religion are really following in the footsteps of the One they claim to follow .
Military expenditures are one of the reasons the U.S. government 's financial path is unsustainable .
Setting aside expenditures related to the country 's ongoing wars , the fiscal year 2011 defense budget requested by President Barack Obama is $ 549 billion , 2.8 percent more than last year .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are expected to cost $ 159 billion more .
That comes to $ 708 billion , the biggest military budget that the United States has seen since World War II .
Defense will represent 19.6 percent of the federal government 's overall spending and 64 percent of discretionary spending .
Even adjusted for inflation , according to Travis Sharp , a research associate at the Center for a New American Security , this level , $ 644 billion in 2000 dollars , is 13 percent higher than the Korean War peak ( $ 624 billion ) , 33 percent higher than the Vietnam War peak ( $ 534 billion ) , and 23 percent higher than the Reagan era peak ( $ 574 billion ) .
And we might end up spending even more than that .
In March the administration came back mid-year to ask for $ 33 billion more to support the troops in Afghanistan .
Do n't be surprised to see another supplemental spending request in fiscal year 2011 .
Liberals often view the Pentagon as an item that should be cut but can't for political reasons .
Commentator Matthew Yglesias writes :
" The military is the most trusted institution in America and then on top of that the defense sector of the economy has a lot of money and economic reach .
Consequently , it 's very politically difficult for a president to do anything that provokes the ire of the defense establishment whether or not it polls well in the abstract . "
Yet such cuts have been achieved in the past .
Figure 1 shows large variations , increases and decreases , in military spending since 1942 .
During the last 70 years , the defense budget was cut 26 times by an average rate of 10 percent ( Figure 2 ) .
The biggest cuts followed World War II , with a 72 percent reduction in 1947 .
The last cut was in 1998 .
Figure 2 shows that most of the cuts have taken place after the end of a war .
But cuts were also achieved in the late 1960s and early ' 70s , despite the ongoing conflict in Vietnam .
Politicians explicitly debated how to cut spending without cutting security , and they still managed to get re-elected .
If liberals underestimate the political feasibility of Pentagon cuts , conservatives often overestimate the value of the spending .
Many seem to believe the military budget should never be trimmed .
The right - wing Heritage Foundation , for example , points to the " long war against Islamic terrorists " to justify the need for always - growing Pentagon budgets .
Here too , the data tell a different story .
In 2008 the U.S. military budget represented 48 percent of the $ 1.4 trillion in military spending worldwide ( see Figure 3 ) .
That 's six times as much as runner - up China and more than 10 times as much as Russia .
Are all the other countries of the world in less danger of a terrorist attack than we are ?
Perhaps the level of spending and the level of danger do n't have much to do with one another .
After all , our military budget was already massive and growing ( $ 364 billion in 2000 dollars , 40 percent of world spending ) before we were attacked on September 11 , 2001 .
As Benjamin Friedman , a defense analyst at the Cato Institute , recently noted in The Christian Science Monitor , " North Korea , Syria , and Iran trouble their citizens and neighbors , but with small economies , shoddy militaries , and a desire to survive , they pose little threat to us .
Their combined military spending is one - sixtieth of ours .
… And with an economy larger than ours , the European Union can protect itself . "
Furthermore , the degree of waste and fraud that attends Pentagon contracting and spending is infamous .
A March report from the Government Accountability Office compiles an impressive list of serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense , including misreporting of contracts , assets , and properties .
Travis Sharp , the defense analyst , tells me : " Reports from across the political spectrum , including from watchdog groups and defense contractors , have estimated that over $ 50 billion per year could be saved by eliminating a few controversial weapons systems or by reforming the Pentagon 's supply chain , I.T. , and personnel management practices .
Of course , winding down operations in Afghanistan and Iraq would add even more to these potential savings . "
It is true that military spending as a percentage of GDP has gone down , declining from 6.2 percent at its high in the 1980s to 4.6 percent in 2009 .
In response , some on the right , including Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) and Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , have proposed that Pentagon spending be fixed at 4 percent of GDP .
It 's a strange suggestion : Indexing military spending to GDP makes about as much sense as indexing your rent to your salary .
And I suspect McCain and Mullen would not agree that the budget should be slashed from its current 4.6 percent level to the 4 percent ideal .
The important question is not how much money we spend but whether we spend it effectively and meet our defense needs in the process .
Demanding that military spending be driven by economic growth is just another way of saying that military spending is not about safety .
It 's about spending as an end in itself .

They do n't do communism in the US , but they certainly do retribution .
Americans are not afraid to criticise or even destroy big business if they think it out of control .
We are very much in one of those periodic purges .
The US economy is so large and dynamic that it matters little if a big company is demonised out of existence ; there are always others coming up through the ranks to take its place .
Have you heard the one about the woman who went to the dealership for new tires and came out with a new car ?
No , it 's not a joke , at least not in the case of Madeline Leonard .
Leonard took her 2004 Mazda 3 in for new tires at Mazda of Orangeville in Ontario .
She walked out with a 2010 Mazda 6 , for which she paid $ 66,000 ( note : All dollar figures in this post are Canadian ) .
By the way , that 6 was n't brand new , but had been used as a demonstrator by the dealership .
The 56 - year - old mentally - disabled woman says that " Moe " , the salesman , was a fast - talker who soon was talking numbers with her before selling her the car , which should have retailed for $ 41,000 , according to the Ontario Motor Vehicle Industry Council .
Carey Smith , the director of investigations for the agency , has levied charges against both the store and two senior employees .
Fines could total $ 250,000 .
The deal went down in late December of 2009 , and Kien Trung , the dealer 's business manager , says it was on the up - and - up .
" We did n’t do anything wrong in the case of this transaction , ” Trung told the Toronto Star .
“ We made a little bit of money on the deal .
I guess she was not happy with it . ”
Mazda Canada lists a base price of $ 39,969 for the car , but Mazda of Orangeville supposedly had the car listed at a sticker price of $ 45,846 .
On top of that , the dealership sold Leonard a $ 4,500 " protection package " that included rust - proofing and window etching .
The unemployed Leonard makes less than $ 2,000 a month , yet she was on the hook for an eight - year loan for $ 16,000 , which included a final balloon payment of $ 7,000 .
Smith says she should not have qualified for the loan .
Leonard says after the deal was done , she drove to other dealerships and compared prices on other 6s , only to find the difference in price to be , as she said , " shocking . "
Trung and sales manager Mohammed ( Moe ) Shaikh are being charged with " engaging in unfair practice by making an unconscionable representation " opposite to the provincial Consumer Protection Act .
Both plan to plead not guilty .
Mazda of Canada is withholding specific comment until the case is resolved in court .

If only it were this easy for FOX News to fire Glenn Beck .
Still , I 'll take progress wherever I can get it .
Arizona FOX affiliate KYCA fired Steve Blair today over the mural controversy painted on a wall at Miller Valley School .
Actually , he was n't fired over the controversy .
He was fired for creating the controversy .
When asked about what his objections were to the mural , he replied :
" Number one , it was defacing a public building of a historic nature on one of the most heavily traveled roadways in Prescott , Arizona without any edification of what the mural was supposed to be , what it stood for , and it's a piece of public art that I do n't support .
Not there .
Somewhere else , maybe yes , but not there .
And based upon the fact that nobody bothered to let the community know what that mural was supposed to depict made it very difficult to buy in on -- um -- what the mission statement of that mural was supposed to be .
Plus it was too big , too in - your - face , wrong place , wrong time . "
Defacing ?
Really ?
That particular verb , especially when taken in concert with what he says about the school mural project in general , really exposes him clearly .
It 's difficult to transcribe everything he said , but at some point he listed the other three murals that , with the school mural , make up the Prescott Mural Project as being perfectly acceptable .
The site is down under heavy traffic right now , but if it comes back up , you can see all the murals at http://www.prescottmurals.com/.
The Miller School project was the last of four .
During the conversation about his confusion on what the Miller school mural is supposed to represent , he said :
" [ It ] looks like a guy black guy brown guy holding a stick and a big flowers and stuff , what was it supposed to mean ?
I do n't know what it 's supposed to mean , I really do n't .
If it means going green , what does that mean ?
Not everything is okay , and not everything should be looked at as " I have to be politically correct ...
If I do n't like public art like the mural , I have the right to say I do n't like it ... The hard part is where do people draw the line of standing up to what 's right or wrong . "
" I want somebody to tell me why I should like that .
I like that one at the library .
I like the one on the parking garage ... "
The mural at the library depicts Prescott history from ancient times through modern .
The one at the parking garage is entitled " Art for All " .
You can see some of it here .
Not content to leave it there , Blair continues his rant :
" Should we be able to paint Kumbaya on the side of the Elks theater now instead of renovating it ?
Put kids and jackals on the side of that building ?
Should we just unilaterally deface that building without talking to the guys that own it ? "
" Why because I do n't like it am I being painted as a racist ? "
( For reference , the Elks Theater renovation project is another downtown project to restore a historical theater to its halcyon days . )
When asked if he would take back his comments regarding the mural he replied with a flat " No . "
He sums it up this way :
Why are we allowing people to deface historic buildings with murals ?
That 's twice now with the word " deface " .
While he does n't seem to have any problem with " defacing " any other building or wall in Prescott , this one alone gives him heartburn .
The one with " the black guy brown guy , sticks and flowers . "
Prescott started this project in 2001 as part of an overall downtown renovation effort .
The murals are funded with money granted by the Prescott Alternative Transportation Center .
The mural at the school was selected by the students and faculty and features student 's faces in the artwork .
All reactions to art come from the heart .
Steve Blair shows his heart as clearly as the children of that school do .
I 'll answer Blair 's question about racism this way :
When it 's the color of the people on the historic building that you object to , when the message of the mural is as clear and consistent as those who paid to have it painted , you 're kidding yourself if you think this is about " defacing public property . "
I love our Los Angeles murals .
They were painted for the 1984 Olympics and brighten the smoggy landscape of concrete and glass in the city .
These murals are a wonderful way to brighten and renovate an aging downtown area .
Prescott citizens should question whether this city councilman has their interests or his prejudices at heart .
Update : From a comment by azmtdog :
The Principal of the school and the Superintendent of Prescott Unified School District admitted " We made a mistake " .
The mural will not be ' lightened ' .
Some things work out .
Good job , parents , teachers , Principal and Superintendent .
That 's a big win .

When we have too little of something and there is demand for it , its value increases .
The reverse is true as well .
If there is way too much of something , even if demand remains , its value will plummet and the excess will languish , unutilized .
For most of us , our ethical social manchimp brains shy away from the fact that labor is something that can also accumulate to extreme excess .
We understand that inert objects , which when foolishly produced in gross excess , can go to waste .
But the idea of wasted human lives is for us a different beast .
Reality often hurts , so stictly in the case of our bias favoring our manchimp equals , we modify the rules we use to engage with it as if reality is going to sympathize with us .
This is irrational .
A unit of labor , embodied in a human , is a component of economy , not the cause of it , not the whole of it , and not the purpose of it .
It is even questionable whether as much human labor will be required in the future as we increasingly automate tasks using our technologies .
Our reasoned response is to face reality and get used to the continued devaluation of the human labor component within economies .
For 23 years , 58 - year - old Cindy Paoletti of Salina , N.Y. , worked in the corporate accounting division of J.P. Morgan Chase , balancing payroll accounts in an upstate office of the Wall Street bank .
In December 2007 , Paoletti was let go in a wave of layoffs that eventually shuttered the entire Syracuse operations center .
â€ œMy job went to India , â€ she sighs .

There is only so much competent ownership that can go around .
Every human has not shown himself capable of entrepreneurship , industry leadership , or even business management .
Relatively very few have .
This is why we have a division between the great mass of human labor and the far fewer providers of the means to work .
If the human labor portion had even minimal mental compentence , it would understand its own role in the arrangement .
It is not the place of labor to own and control the means of production .
Thus , the unemployed are not entitled to work .
They are drawn upon as a resource pool and then discarded as required by the reality of economy as a system requiring proportional balance to function .
Too much labor is a gross imbalance between human population numbers and the means of the providers to make use of this overwhelming excess .
Unemployment is a compensatory effect of an economy that requires the harmony of its components to maintain stability .

The US news media radically changed how it reported on the issue of waterboarding after it emerged that US forces had used the practice , says a new study from Harvard University .
The study also found a double standard when defining waterboarding , with news sources commonly referring to waterboarding as “ torture ” when talking about foreign countries using the practice , but declining to do so when it ’s being carried out by the United States .
ADVERTISEMENT
The study ( PDF ) reports :
From the early 1930 ’s until the modern story broke in 2004 , the newspapers that covered waterboarding almost uniformly called the practice torture or implied it was torture :
The New York Times characterized it thus in 81.5 % ( 44 of 54 ) of articles on the subject and The Los Angeles Times did so in 96.3 % of articles ( 26 of 27 ) .
By contrast , from 2002 - 2008 , the studied newspapers almost never referred to waterboarding as torture .
The New York Times called waterboarding torture or implied it was torture in just 2 of 143 articles ( 1.4 % ) .
The Los Angeles Times did so in 4.8 % of articles ( 3 of 63 ) .
The Wall Street Journal characterized the practice as torture in just 1 of 63 articles ( 1.6 % ) .
USA Today never called waterboarding torture or implied it was torture .
The study went on to note a marked difference in the way waterboarding is portrayed when the individuals doing the waterboarding are American , and when they ’re not .
[ N]ewspapers are much more likely to call waterboarding torture if a country other than the United States is the perpetrator .
In The New York Times , 85.8 % of articles ( 28 of 33 ) that dealt with a country other than the United States using waterboarding called it torture or implied it was torture while only 7.69 % ( 16 of 208 ) did so when the United States was responsible .
The Los Angeles Times characterized the practice as torture in 91.3 % of articles ( 21 of 23 ) when another country was the violator , but in only 11.4 % of articles ( 9 of 79 ) when the United States was the perpetrator .
The study , from Harvard University ’s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press , Politics and Public Policy , may be the first empirical evidence of what many media critics have been accusing the US media of , anecdotally , for some time :
That the press changed its standards for “ torture ” once it became known the US was practicing it .
ADVERTISEMENT
That shift was not an accident , argues Salon.com blogger Glenn Greenwald , who first reported the study .
“ Media outlets such as the NYT , The Washington Post and NPR explicitly adopted policies to ban the use of the word ‘ torture ’ for techniques the US government had authorized once government officials announced it should not be called ‘ torture , ' ” Greenwald writes .
“ We do n’t need a state - run media because our media outlets volunteer for the task : once the US government decrees that a technique is no longer torture , US media outlets dutifully cease using the term , ” Greenwald writes .
ADVERTISEMENT
Adam Serwer at the American Prospect argues that it ’s not “ servitude ” to the media that motivated the news media , but rather “ the conventions of journalism … are at fault here . ”
Serwer writes :
As soon as Republicans started quibbling over the definition of torture , traditional media outlets felt compelled to treat the issue as a “ controversial ” matter , and in order to appear as though they were n’t taking a side , media outlets treated the issue as unsettled , rather than confronting a blatant falsehood … .
Of course , this attempt at “ neutrality ” was , in and of itself , taking a side , if inadvertently .
It was taking the side of people who supported torture , opposed investigating it as a crime , and wanted to protect those who implemented the policy from any kind of legal accountability .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Harvard study leaves it to readers to draw their own conclusion as to why the US media changed how it reported on waterboarding , but it does refute the argument , made by New York Times editor Clark Hoyt , that reporters and editors voluntarily stopped using the word torture to maintain the appearance of neutrality .
“ The willingness of the newspapers to call the practice torture prior to 2004 seems to refute this claim , ” the study states .
“ According to the data , for almost a century before 2004 there was consensus within the print media that waterboarding was torture .
Yet once reports of the use of waterboarding by the CIA and other abuses by the US surfaced , this consensus no longer held … . ”
The commander of multinational forces in Afghanistan , Gen Stanley McChrystal , has been dismissed by US President Barack Obama after critical comments about senior administration officials .
He will be replaced by Gen David Petraeus , who led the " surge " in Iraq .
Mr Obama insisted it was " a change in personnel but not a change in policy " .
In a profile in Rolling Stone magazine , Gen McChrystal and aides were quoted as making disparaging remarks about Mr Obama and senior colleagues .
Gen McChrystal himself described the period last year when President Obama was slowly moving towards the approval of the deployment of thousands more US soldiers to Afghanistan as " painful " .
And referring to a key Oval Office meeting between Mr Obama and Gen McChrystal a year ago , an aide of Gen McChrystal said the president " did n't seem very engaged .
The boss [ Gen McChrystal ] was pretty disappointed " .
Others targeted included :
Vice - President Joe Biden , who Gen McChrystal pretended not to know
US ambassador to Kabul Karl Eikenberry , who Gen McChrystal said he felt " betrayed " by
National Security Adviser James Jones , who one of Gen McChrystal 's aides described as a " clown "
US special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke , whose electronic communication led Gen McChrystal to say : " Oh , not another e-mail from Holbrooke ... I do n't even want to open it "
The announcement that Gen McChrystal was standing down came after he met Mr Obama at the White House on Wednesday to discuss the damaging article .
Analysis
This was not a clash over strategy .
In the now infamous Rolling Stone profile , Gen McChrystal did not question the policy he himself helped to devise .
But it was a matter of authority .
In their dismissive remarks about members of the administration , Stanley McChrystal and his unnamed colleagues fatally compromised their relationship with the commander - in - chief .
Not to get rid of him would have looked like weakness .
If the past year has turned Gen McChrystal into something of a legend , then his replacement is an even bigger and more celebrated figure .
As the head of US Central Command , David Petraeus is Gen McChrystal 's boss .
His military , diplomatic and political skills are hugely admired here in Washington .
Mr Obama said he had made the decision to replace Gen McChrystal " with considerable regret " but added that he had failed to " meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general " .
He said the article had eroded trust and " undermines the civilian control of the military that 's at the core of our democratic system " .
" I do n't make this decision based on any difference in policy with General McChrystal ... nor do I make this decision out of any sense of personal insult , " he added .
He said he welcomed debate within his team , but would not tolerate division .
" War is bigger than any one man or woman , whether a private , a general , or a president . "
He urged Congress to confirm Gen Petraeus in the position swiftly .
Until that happens , leadership of the Nato - led force in Afghanistan fall to a British officer , Lt Gen Nick Parker .
' Poor judgement '
Gen McChrystal said in a statement he had resigned out of a " desire to see the mission succeed " .
" I strongly support the president 's strategy in Afghanistan and am deeply committed to our coalition forces , our partner nations , and the Afghan people . "
The day before his dismissal , Gen McChrystal apologised for the magazine article , written by freelance journalist Michael Hastings , admitting : " It was a mistake reflecting poor judgement and should never have happened . "
Afghan President Hamid Karzai had indicated he did not want Gen McChrystal replaced , describing him as the best commander in nine years of US military operations in Afghanistan .
But a spokesman for Mr Karzai said on Wednesday : " We are looking forward to working with General Petraeus , a very experienced soldier who President Karzai knows well . "
The secretary general of Nato , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , said the Western military alliance 's Afghan war strategy remained unchanged after Gen McChrystal 's replacement .
" The approach he helped put in place is the right one , " he added .
“ They have the magic touch , where they can take a topic and turn it into a T - shirt slogan , yet not lose touch with the issue , ” said Ben Popken , one of the managing editors of Consumerist.com , a Web site specializing in consumer advocacy and personal finance .
“ They ’re geniuses at doing that . ”
Their most recent and ambitious effort , “ Stadium Status , ” which will be shown for the first time Tuesday evening at the Brooklyn Public Library , takes on local sports franchises that get millions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives while their neighbors scramble to make ends meet in a sour economy .
The idea that luxury lives next door to poverty is not lost on the filmmakers .
“ In this city you can have the poorest and the wealthiest , sometimes in the same ZIP code , ” Mr. Penn said .
“ But even in this huge city , people feel separated and that should n’t be .
I hope our films can show that one way or another we are all connected . ”
Befitting an Internet invention , the trio ’s origins date back to the days , four years ago , when Mr. Penn and Mr. Kam were fans of each other ’s blogs .
“ I felt like there was a voice in my head that I did n’t hear anyone else using , ” Mr. Penn said .
“ I wanted to read between the lines , to write about what was going on in New York City with politics , relationships , movies .
Anything that came through my head . ”
Ryanair puts up luggage charges in time for summer ( and passengers will have to pay to use the toilet too )
New charges :
The £ 15 fee for checked - in bags will be raised to £ 20 for the summer ( file photo )
Ryanair is taking no -frills flights to new heights - by charging for lavatories .
All onboard toilets will become coin-operated , forcing passengers to pay £ 1 or one euro .
The Irish airline is also cutting the number of loos , meaning there may be only one on planes carrying 189 passengers .
It already charges customers to check in luggage , for online check - in , for onboard snacks and for credit card payments .
Ryanair 's Stephen McNamara said : ' By charging for the toilets we are hoping to change passenger behaviour so that they use the bathroom before or after the flight .
' That will enable us to remove two out of three of the toilets and make way for at least six extra seats . '
The airline mooted the idea of toilet charges last year but backtracked after criticism .
It also emerged yesterday that its single bag check - in charge will rise from £ 15 to £ 20 during the summer holidays .
The £ 15 fee for checked - in bags will be in operation again from September .
Mr McNamara said : ' We are determined to incentivise passengers to travel light this summer by increasing our checked - in baggage fees for the months of July and August only .
' Over 70 per cent of all Ryanair passengers will be unaffected by these changes because they travel with no checked - in bags . '
More charges : Spending a penny could soon cost a pound
Rochelle Turner , head of research for Which ?
magazine , said : ' Ryanair might claim that they are incentivising people to travel light but we think it is more a case of penalising those families who can only go away on holiday during this time .
' Flying with Ryanair is not as cheap as it first appears and we would advise passengers to factor in these extra costs when choosing who to fly with . '
Mr O'Leary first suggested the toilet charges last year but the budget carrier appeared to backtrack on the idea .
However , the airline has confirmed its plans in its latest in - flight magazine , although Mr McNamara said the charges would not be coming in this summer .
Sky high prices : Snacks on no-frills flights can cost nearly quadruple what they would cost in the supermarket
The confirmation of further charges on board comes just as a new survey has shown that low - cost carriers are charging sky - high prices for food and drink .
Passengers pay 374 per cent more for snacks on flights than they would at the supermarket , according to statistics from price comparison site travelsupermarket.com .
When asked about the price of food on board Ryanair aircraft , Mr McNamara said : ' I would like to know how much Tesco are charging for flights from Barcelona to London . '
Of all Israels ties with Muslim countries , those with Turkey are the oldest .
Until recently , in terms of strategy , that country was considered no less important than Egypt .
The affair of the Gaza aid flotilla and the harsh and excessive comments by Turkeys prime minister against Israel have dramatically shaken the stability of these ties .
Israelis now perceive Turkey as an enemy that should be denounced , or at least boycotted .
But it should be pointed out that compared to Egypt , Turkey has for years maintained close and cordial ties with Israel at all levels .
Israelis have considered it a sister nation , trade with Turkey has expanded , and military cooperation has been perceived as a given .
Visits by the leaders of both countries have also become a standard part of our political lives .
Turkeys involvement in the indirect talks between Syria and Israel helped forge understandings between Damascus and Jerusalem , and normalization was not a subject Turkey and Israel disagreed on .
Normalization actually preceded official ties between the two countries .
The change did not happen because of the victory of the Justice and Development Party and the election of Recep Tayyip Erdogan as prime minister .
That party has been in power since 2002 , and despite the dark prophecies that accompanied its rise to power , relations between the two countries continued normally .
Turkeys anger exploded when its prime minister felt betrayed by former prime minister Ehud Olmert , who allowed Turkey to try to mediate between Israel and Hamas on the eve of Operation Cast Lead .
Turkey realized then that Israel considers it a given ; that it has to agree with all of Israels whims .
Erdogans criticism of Israel is not different in substance than the criticism by other friends of Israel in Europe and the United States .
But his style is more blatant and direct .
Erdogan does not agree with Israel on continuing the blockade of the Gaza Strip , and he is finding hard to understand , like many Israelis , the logic behind the blockade after four years in which it has not achieved Israels goals .
Erdogans backing of the flotilla was just a continuation of the view that the blockade cannot go on .
Israel can ignore Turkeys serious arguments , slander its prime minister and describe the flotillas activists as terrorists .
This will not be enough to remove the stain of the operation that dragged Israels image not Turkeys , eight of whose citizens were killed into the mud internationally .
Israel , which is now struggling to save its good name , considers public relations the sole means for achieving its goals .
But without wise policy , public relations will prove empty of substance .
The first step is to rehabilitate relations with Turkey , especially with its prime minister .
For this , political courage is necessary , which will lift the blockade on Gaza Strip and bring Turkey closer to the regions political process .
Without all this , Israel can only continue being pleased with itself under the political blockade imposed on it .

The Return of Naughty Tom : Why does not Turkish state [… ]
The Palestinians were carrying waterproof packages believed to be filled with weaponry .
The troops opened fire after calls to stop were ignored , and four terrorists were killed in the ensuing gunfight .
Another Palestinian , who was on a nearby boat guiding the divers , was reportedly wounded .
According to the IDF , the commandos had received prior intelligence regarding a possible infiltration and were in the area when they spotted the frogmen swimming out of Nahal Aza into the Mediterranean Sea .
Commandos from the Israel Navy ’s Flotilla ( Shayetet ) 13 on Monday shot and killed at least four Palestinian frogmen who were swimming out of Gaza on their way to attack targets in Israel .
The IDF said the size of the unit and equipment it was carrying proved that a large attack had been thwarted .
The navy refused on Monday to disclose what was in the waterproof packages .
Based on the way the frogmen were swimming , as well as the diving equipment they used , they likely had undergone extensive training for the operation .
Later in the day , the Israel Air Force bombed a terrorist cell in the northern Gaza Strip that was preparing to fire rockets into Israel .
The IDF has said it holds Hamas responsible for all terrorist activity in Gaza .

Dear Friend of GATA and Gold ( and Silver ) :
Within a half hour of each other today the leading business television networks in North America reported doubts that gold exchange - traded funds either have the gold they claim to have or can get enough real gold to meet likely demand .
The first doubt was expressed on CNBC in the United States , where market analyst Rick Santelli comments at 5:30 into this segment :
http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=1494145732&play=1
The second doubt was expressed on BNN in Canada , where reporter Niall McGee commented at length :
http://watch.bnn.ca/#clip302139
There seems to be growing consensus in favor of what GATA long has been urging gold and silver investors to do : to take possession of their metal or make certain that any custodian has got it in allocated and audited form , especially since the custodians of the largest gold and silver ETFs are also the biggest gold and silver shorts , a grotesque and unacknowledged conflict of interest :

（ Unicode仕様 書 V4.0 Fig.11 - 3 p.299 より引用）
ここに、X軸はセマンティック（意味または機能）、Y軸は抽象的形状、Z軸はタイプフェース（書体）とされています。
この概念モデルに基づいて、日本、中国、韓国などの漢字をひとつにまとめたと説明しています。しかし、Unicodeの仕様書を読んでも、どうも統合にあたってのセマンティック軸の扱いが明確になっていません。そこで、この部分を私なりに検討してみました。
■仕様 書V2.0では次のように書かれています。
Only characters that have the same abstract shape ( that is , occupy a single point on the X and Y axes ) are potential candidates for unification .
Z axis typeface and semantic differences are generally ignored .
（ Unicode V2.0 仕様書 p. 6-108、下から10行目～8行目）
※アンダーラインは私が付けました。以下、同じです。
3次元概念モデルでは、Y軸上で同じ位置の漢字が同じ抽象的な形状となります。抽象的形状が同じものをまとめるということは、Z軸とX軸を無視することになります。ですので上の文章は正しくありません。私の考えでは、正しくは次の文章になるはずです。
Only characters that have the same abstract shape ( that is , occupy a single point on the Y axis ) are potential candidates for unification .
Z axis typeface and X axis semantic differences are generally ignored .
上の図の例で、セマンティックを無視すれば、 と は統合され、ひとつのコードポイントが与えられます。
※ちなみに、この二つは字形が同じで意味が違う例として、
は ” 機械 ” を意味し、 は、 ” 机 ” を意味すると説明されています 。
■ところが、V3.0仕様書から以降、この部分が次のように訂正されています。
Only characters that have the same abstract shape ( that is , occupy a single point on the X and Y axes ) are potential candidates for unification .
Z axis typeface and stylistic differences are generally ignored .
( 直訳）
同じ抽象的形状をもつ文字（すなわち、XとY軸の上でひとつの点を占める）のみが統合化の潜在的候補となる。Z軸のタイプフェースとスタイルの違いは一般に無視する。
この新しい説明では、セマンティック（semantic）がスタイル（stylistic）に代わってしまいました。そして、無視されるのはZ軸（タイプフェースとスタイル）のみとされています。
セマンティックの扱いは明確に書かれていません。しかし、X及びY軸で同じ位置にあるものが抽象的形状が同じ、と言っているわけですから、セマンティックが抽象的形状の一要因になったということに等しいわけです。言い換えると
セマンティックが違えば抽象的形状が違うとみなす
、と暗黙に示したことになります。
このあたり、3次元(立体）で考えるのは難しいので、わかり易くするため、2つの軸、X軸×Y軸を1次元に展開して、図を書き直すと次のようになります。
※この2次元の図は私が作りましたが、上の3次元の図と同等なはずです。
V3.0以降の仕様書では、この図でZ軸のみが無視されると言っています。ですので、 と は別のコードポイントが与えられることになります。
言い換えると、V3.0以降では同じ抽象的形状でもセマンティックが異なれば統合の候補にならない。抽象的形状とセマンティックが共に同じ漢字のみが統合の候補になると変更したことになります。
※しかし、仕様書には、統合ルールは、原規格分離規則以外は、変更してないとも書いてあります。従って、仕様書の説明に矛盾を含んでいます。
X軸、すなわちセマンティックについて考えて見ます。同じ字形の漢字でも言語によって意味が変わったり、新しい意味が付加されたりすることが多く、言語の違いがセマンティックに重要な影響を及ぼすのは明らかです。従って、字形が同じでもセマンティックが違えば別のコードポイントを与えるとなると、中国語、日本語、韓国語、ベトナム語という異なる言語の中で出現する漢字を字形で統合するのは至難になります。乱暴に言えば、セマンティックを無視しなければ、CJKVの漢字統合はできないのではないでしょうか。
結局、概念モデルではセマンティックを無視しないと言い、実際の作業はセマンティックを無視して漢字統合したということで、示した理論と実際にやったことが矛盾してしまったように思います。
V1.0でCJK漢字を統合すると言いながら、原規格分離規則によって、これを徹底できずにV3.0では原規格分離規則を廃止したというように、漢字統合ルールも振れています。
昨日 、Unicodeの漢字統合は破綻してしまったと言いましたが、その原因を辿っていけば、ルールの基になる概念＝3次元概念モデルが曖昧だったためではないでしょうか？
20世紀最大の偉業のはずなんですが。残念。漢字統合は、21世紀にもう一度やり直しが必要なんでしょうね。
