Police suspect two homes were involved a gunfight on a south - west Sydney street overnight .
Three men inside a house on Francis Street escaped injury when several shots were fired into the front bedroom window and front fence at 7:50 pm ( AEST ) yesterday .
Police say one of the men fired back at the house across the road within a minute .
Inspector Jason Donald says the first home has shattered windows , while the second home has a bullet hole in the roof .
" We 're speaking to the occupants of those homes and witnesses in the area , " he said .
" We do n't know at this stage any more information that gives us a clear picture of what 's happened .
" We do n't want to speculate till we get firm facts but at this stage , we 're still very much trying to get to the bottom of it , find a motivation . "
There was a string of drive - by shootings on nearby Sackville Street in Fairfield late last year but Inspector Donald says Francis Street is not a regular trouble spot .
" These types of shootings have occurred out here but I 'm not aware of anything in that particular street , " he said .
Police are continuing their investigations today .
Anyone with information about the shooting is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 .

The band was brought together in late 1975 by impresario Kim Fowley , who thought a novelty act of teenaged girls performing in leather and lace would be an easy sell , but the girls ended up proving to be serious and influential musicians with songs like “ Cherry Bomb . ”
The band lasted about four years together , falling apart over management and money issues .

Although Acer may be applying the brakes to its planned Android Netbook deployment , when the Google -y mini computers do hit the shelves , SugarSync will be ready .
On Wednesday , Sharpcast , SugarSync 's developer , released a version of the cross- platform multimedia syncing management software for Android phones and Netbooks .
SugarSync for Android lets you view and download files on your Android Netbook or mobile phone , and upload local files to your free or premium SugarSync repository .
Since SugarSync 's applications are free ( you just pay for the storage you use ) , you can use it as a makeshift remote access tool , and as online backup .
Files you upload from multiple desktops , laptops , or mobile phones are accessible from other platforms or the Web .
You 'll also be able to share files and folders from the phone .
However , not all SugarSync managers have been created equally .
The app is much more photocentric on Android phones , where being able to upload and download mobile photos to and from your SugarSync account is the only media format guarantee .
Android Netbook users should be able to view the full range of supported file types .
SugarSync's Android start screen has you tap one button to access your uploaded files remotely , and another button to open local files on your Android phone or Netbook .
A word to the wise : uploading files from an Android phone requires a long hold , where you touch and hold the file until you see a pop-up menu and the option to upload to SugarSync .
One complaint is that SugarSync takes some initial setup time on a desktop computer , which is where the bulk of your saved files will probably originate .
Android Netbook users should have an easier job getting started , though only time will tell .
SugarSync is available from the Android Market on your Android phone .
SugarSync managers can also be found for the following desktop and mobile platforms :
SugarSync for Windows
SugarSync for Mac
SugarSync for Windows Mobile
SugarSync for iPhone
SugarSync for BlackBerry
At U.S.A.I.D. , Juggling Political Priorities and Pandemic Response
Aggressive oversight of the aid agency by political appointees at the White House and the State Department has delayed humanitarian aid when the world needs it most .
( NaturalNews ) Environmentalists are increasingly pushing for people in the United States to change their toilet paper buying habits , in recognition of the fact that the soft , fluffy toilet paper widely preferred in the United States for home use can only be made by logging wild forests throughout the Western Hemisphere .
"
No forest of any kind should be used to make toilet paper , " said Allen Hershkowitz of the Natural Resource Defense Council .
Toilet paper can easily be made from recycled paper , but only at the cost of a coarser final product .
Manufacturers admit that the primary factor that keeps them making toilet paper out of freshly cut trees is the fact that standing trees yield longer fibers than recycled material does .
Longer fibers , in turn , make for softer , fluffier toilet paper .
Environmental groups estimate that depending on the brand , between 25 and 50 percent of the pulp used to make toilet paper comes from U.S. or South American tree farms , with the remainder coming from wild forests .
These forests are ecologically important not only as ways to remove greenhouse gases from the air , but as water purification systems and habitat providers for thousands of different life forms .
It 's not just the previously logged , second - growth forests being cut to make pulp for toilet paper , either ; a major source of pulp for the U.S. toilet paper market is Canada 's endangered , old - growth boreal forest .
According to an estimate from Greenpeace , Cottonelle and Scott parent company Kimberly Clark acquires up to 22 percent of its pulp from companies that log these forests .
The company admits to sourcing 14 percent of its pulp from the Canadian boreal forests .
Other environmental costs to premium , plush toilet paper include higher water use , higher use of toxic chlorine bleaches and an overall larger waste footprint than recycled paper .
Greenpeace has issued a guide for consumers to the relative environmental friendliness of various different brands of toilet paper .
Along with many other environmental groups , it is hoping to persuade U.S. consumers to purchase more recycled paper .
The popularity of plump , soft toilet paper is a distinctly U.S. phenomenon .
Less than 2 percent of the toilet paper purchased in the United States for home use is composed of 100 percent recycled fibers .
In contrast , 20 percent of the at - home toilet paper market in Europe and Latin America includes recycled content .
Consumers in other countries are also more willing to accept a rough toilet tissue .
U.S. consumers , on the other hand , " demand soft and comfortable , " said Georgia Pacific spokesperson James Malone .
" Recycled fiber cannot do it .
" Furthermore , the United States uses more toilet paper than any other country in the world -- an average of 23.6 rolls per person per year .
Toilet paper companies insist that consumer desire is driving their decision to keep sourcing pulp from wild forests .
Kimberly Clark Vice President of Product and Technology Research Jerry Baker noted that the company uses recycled fibers in the paper it sells to its " away from home " customers , such as offices , restaurants and schools .
Recycled paper advocates are hoping to capitalize on the global recession to introduce more consumers to the advantages of coarser toilet paper .
Already , the cost difference between premium and recycled toilet paper has caused U.S. sales of the former to drop 7 percent in the last few months .
Tim Spring , chief executive of recycled paper manufacturer Marcal , said that recycled toilet paper has other benefits too , beyond its lower price tag .
" People want to know what happens to the paper they recycle , " he said .
" This will give them closure .
" Marcal recently launched a $ 30 million campaign to advertise the environmental benefits of recycled toilet paper .

If Jeff Clark has his way , medical marijuana patients will soon be able to buy pot from his collective in law - and - order Kern County , known more for growing almonds than cannabis .
Clark , 55 , a disabled veteran , thinks the time is right .
After eight years of raids on storefront dispensaries under the Bush administration , Eric H. Holder Jr. , the new U.S. attorney general , has made it clear that the Justice Department wo n’t go after organizations operating under state laws in California and a dozen other states .
Kern County ’s Board of Supervisors and sheriff have agreed to lay off too , as long as pot sellers adhere to the state ’s guidelines .
Last month , supervisors rescinded a de facto ban on pot dispensaries in place since 2007 .

“ I ’m very optimistic , ” said Clark , who plans to open facilities near his home in Lake Isabella and in Bakersfield within the next few months .
“ This could be the turning point we ’ve all been waiting for . ”
But local government and law enforcement officials say that a more lenient Drug Enforcement Administration is not likely to mean that new medical marijuana dispensaries will sprout like weeds .
Kern County authorities say that , even with their more relaxed approach , they wo n’t allow just anyone to open up shop .
“ People think the DEA has opened the door to opening dispensaries anywhere and any time , and that ’s just not true , ” said Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood .
“ I will do my job irrespective of what the DEA does or does not do . ”
Even medical marijuana advocates say cities and counties that view medical marijuana with suspicion are n’t likely to suddenly welcome dispensaries .
And they have plenty of tools to make life difficult for potential distributors .

Local laws
More than 100 cities and seven counties have laws banning dispensaries , said Joe Elford , chief counsel with the Oakland - based Americans for Safe Access , a medical marijuana advocacy group .
The validity of such bans is being litigated in appellate courts , he said .
Still other cities and counties have limited the number of operators or put temporary bans on new dispensaries .
Elford does n’t expect that to change soon .

“ The DEA ’s new stance certainly sends a clear message to localities that they should not be policing federal law , ” Elford said .
“ But that remains to be seen . ”
Kent Johnston , 56 , a retired Ventura County sheriff ’s deputy , got the cold shoulder last week from the Westlake Village City Council when he announced his intentions to open a medical marijuana dispensary .
A city attorney informed him that the city adheres to the federal view that selling cannabis is illegal , Johnston said .
“ I was not there to fight them .
I was there to say this is going to happen because it ’s legal , ” said Johnston , who worked for 20 years in law enforcement .
“ Would n’t you rather have me , a retired deputy , running one legitimately than someone doing it under the wire and causing problems ?
But they treated me like I was foolish and trying to break the law . ”

Much of the tension has stemmed from the conflict between state and federal laws .
Growing , selling and using medical marijuana is allowed under California law .
But federal law makes cannabis illegal .
Court battles and follow - up legislation in the 13 years since voters approved Proposition 215 have reduced some of the confusion .
Last fall , state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown issued guidelines to help patients , sellers and local law enforcement agencies determine what it takes to operate within the law .
The guidelines say sellers must organize as not - for - profit “ collectives ” or “ cooperatives ” to cultivate and distribute pot only to members .
Advertisement
Groups are required to keep detailed records , including copies of each member ’s state - issued ID card and a doctor ’s recommendation that marijuana will help relieve his or her medical symptoms .
They also are barred from signing up members on the spot after a quick medical interview , a guideline that has been widely ignored in more liberal areas , including Los Angeles and Oakland .
The state guidelines make it easier for police to enforce the law and make it less likely that collectives will be used as fronts for illegal drug sales , said John Irby , former deputy county counsel in Kern County .
“ It ’s hard to be legal , and you do not make any money if you are legal , ” he said .

California ’s cities and counties fall into three categories : those that accept and even embrace medical marijuana , including Los Angeles and San Francisco ; those that adamantly oppose it ; and those in between .
Ventura County is in the middle .
It does n’t encourage storefront dispensaries but has n’t banned them either .
Although no such storefronts exist in the county , marijuana patients can turn to discreet delivery services advertised in a local weekly publication .

Illegal sales
Undersheriff Craig Husband said his deputies follow the state guidelines , but he acknowledged that the department suspects many operations are fronts for illegal sales .
“ The attorney general provided clarity , but I do n’t think it was the answer law enforcement wanted to hear , ” Husband said .
“ There tends to be criminal activity involved around these facilities .
You have others trying to burglarize or rob the facilities .
There is a lot of diversion of product for profit . ”
At least 111 cities , including Anaheim , Pasadena and Torrance , ban medical pot sales altogether .
Counties that ban sales are Amador , Contra Costa , El Dorado , Merced , Riverside , Stanislaus and Sutter , according to Americans for Safe Access .
Advertisement
Bigger cities , including San Francisco and Los Angeles , have plenty of storefronts , some with smoking lounges and arrays of baked marijuana edibles .
Los Angeles County has more than 100 dispensaries and delivery services .
The city of Los Angeles has so many that in 2007 the council put a moratorium on new shops while it drafted an ordinance , expected later this year , to regulate them .
Applications spiked last month after Holder ’s announcement of the new DEA policy , city officials said .
San Diego County has been among the regions most hostile to dispensaries .
Advertisement
When the state passed a bill in 2004 requiring counties to issue identification cards to qualified patients , San Diego County responded by filing a lawsuit .
Its court battle arguing that the ID card program is preempted by federal drug laws has gone all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court , where it awaits review , Elford said .
In the meantime , the San Diego County district attorney ’s office aggressively prosecutes suspected violations , said Steve Walker , a spokesman for the office .
“ We have prosecuted cases where essentially drug dealers have hidden behind these laws and run these storefronts , ” he said .
In August , a task force made up of DEA and local drug agents raided four San Diego marijuana dispensaries and arrested three people , seizing 20 pounds of pot and marijuana - laced edibles .
Those cases are working their way through federal court .

Fewer defendants
Elford predicted that there will be far fewer federal criminal defendants as the DEA ’s new stance is implemented .
So - called DEA landlord letters , which threatened landlords with forfeiture of property if they rented to dispensaries , are also expected to stop , he said .
But the bigger question will be whether localities follow suit by prosecuting only violators of state law , advocates say .
“ It ’s a little soon to tell whether there has been a significant change of heart by locals , ” said Kris Hermes , an Americans for Safe Access spokesman .
Advertisement
Johnston , the retired deputy , said he will continuing pushing Westlake Village to allow medical pot sales .
But it will be a campaign of letters and public comments , he said , because he can’t afford attorneys to make his case in court .
Clark , the marijuana advocate in Kern County , said he is ready to test the waters despite the risks .
He was among advocates who regularly approached the Board of Supervisors in the last year to change its approach .
Patients who are legally entitled to use medical marijuana should n’t have to travel to other counties to get it , he said .
“ I ’m going to follow the law as written , ” Clark said .
“ If I go to jail , then I guess our laws really do n’t hold up . ”

In the Part I on Simple sustainable living in the city I was writing about the reasons to make your life greener .
Part II has some simple green ideas to start your sustainable living .
Part III is about us : what have we done and what are we doing to live sustainably in the city .
What does sustainable city living mean for us
We are an ordinary , average family of 4 living in a big city .
We are n’t striving to be self - sufficient : it ’s hardly possible to be in an urban jungle .
We are just trying to live more sustainable life , implementing green changes one step at a time .
We are n’t perfect and do n’t do everything right all the time every time , but trying our best .
And hope to get greener as we go , because we believe sustainable living is a journey , not a destination .
Here are some aspects of green sustainable living that are important to our family , in no particular order :
Living consciously
Reducing our energy use
Growing some of our food
Living simple life where family comes first
Reducing waste
Eliminating chemicals from our home
Shopping consciously
Cooking our meals using fresh and ingredients in season
Walking / cycling / using public transport whenever possible
Introducing the concept of sustainable living to our children .
Our sustainable journey so far ( more green tips )
Food :
I like to cook and bake bread , so food category is the first on the list .
We strive to by local produce when possible , fresh and in season fruit and veggies .
Farmers markets , u-pick farms and our own garden are favourite sources .
We have three chickens , very spoiled ladies that wreck our veggie and herb garden every so often .
But eggs are great , so we ca n’t complain .
We have reduced our meat consumption for health reason , but when buying we choose organic / free range .
Things we buy organic : milk , meat , coffee , tea and cocoa ( last three fair - trade too ) .
For fruit and veggies choice depends on availability and season .
When shopping , I read the labels and avoid food with preservatives , artificial colours and flavours .
My husband and kids have homemade lunches for work / school / kinder every day – all spoiled a bit too , but it ’s healthier and I do n’t complain .
Neither do they 🙂
I like to MYO everything ; keep coming back for more recipes .
Energy and Water
Let ’s start with the most common : we changed light bulbs to energy saving ones
Air conditioner is rarely switched on in our home
We do n’t have a clothes dryer
The ceiling insulation has been installed and windows and doors sealed
All power points are switched off at night ; even our 8 y.o. son is doing it now
We switch off the computer when not in use even if it ’s only for an hour or so
Rooms not in use are n’t heated nor light left on .
We have switched to green energy
Showers are timed to 4 minutes , garden is watered with grey water and dishwasher uses less water than I do and never complains about dirty dishes !
We have a front loader washing machine which uses a lot less water than top loaders .
Water saving shower head has been installed .
Urban Garden
We have a small urban garden that we are sharing now with our chickens .
I plan to introduce them to the world via this blog – they are n’t camera shy !
At the moment , we have only one fruit tree left , a mandarin .
The lemon died due to constant pruning to remove gall wasp infected branches .
A fruitless avocado does n’t count .
The herb garden is recovering ( chicken attack ) and waiting to be relocated into pots in a safer position .
Front garden has been planted with drought tolerant plants and has n’t been watered for ages .
Whichever plants do n’t survive , sorry , it ’s not for this climate .
Transport
We own one car and that one is often parked in the garage for days .
My husband uses public transport to get to work .
Kids and I are cycling / walking to school and kinder whenever possible .
When using car , I try to combine several things I need car for like shopping , visits and appointments in one day .
For holidays we chose local destinations and only every few years an overseas trip .
Green Cleaning
Green cleaning is one of the first changes we made .
My favourite method is microfiber cloth and pure water .
I also use natural soap , bicarb soda , vinegar , lemon and essential oils in tiny amounts
We have floorboards and tiles throughout the house for easier cleaning .
Shoes are taken off before entering the house , for the same reason as above
A plant based liquid laundry detergent is used for coloured washing , though there ’s still the conventional one for whites .
I ’m testing and trying different eco brands right now .
There will be more on green cleaning on this blog in the future .
Personal Care
For the kids we buy natural and organic bath and shampoo products .
They are n’t petroleum based as most baby and kids products on the shop shelves .
Our toothpaste is natural and fluoride - free .
We have far too much fluoride in our water already .
We also use bicarb soda as a tooth cleaner as well as natural deodorant .
We prefer a vegetable based bar of soap and natural ingredients shampoo .
I ’ve stopped dying my hair 5 years ago and do n’t use hair products like gels or hair sprays
Most cosmetics have vanished from our bathroom shelves ; on a daily basis I only use a natural lipstick and a face cream , preferably my own mix .
My husband uses natural and organic shaving gel .
Shopping
Generally , I shop less and really buy less stuff .
Mindless shopping is not in .
I ask myself before buying : do I really need it or can I buy it second hand ?
I like to shop at second - hand and op - shops and also give my unwanted items there
Whenever possible , I go shopping without kids – no need to explain this one 🙂
I try to shop locally
Recycling and Composting
Composting is one of my passions so much so that I have to write a separate post about it .
As most of us , we do recycle paper , glass , tins and plastics .
However , we are trying to reduce packaging as much as possible : buying in bulk , buying loose fruit and veggies , making our own etc .
Refuse , reduce , reuse , recycle is our approach .
Recycling uses energy too .
Our recycling and general waste bins are mostly 1/3 full in time for garbage collection
Kids
This last but not least category deserves to have a blog entry of its own .
Are you still with me ?
It ’s quite a lengthy post although we have so much more to add .
Instead to continue on and on , we would rather tell you about our simple sustainable life through the posts on our blog .
What are our plans and future projects ?
There are so many !
The simplest way to follow our journey is by subscribing to RSS feed .

VIETNAM is seeing a boom in male births as increasing numbers of parents opt for sex-specific abortions .
Christophe Guilmoto of Descartes University in Paris , France , and his colleagues analysed population data collected by the General Statistics Office of Vietnam since 2000 , plus two surveys which assessed birth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
In 2001 , the sex ratio in Vietnam was close to the biological norm of 105 male births per 100 female births , but this reached 111 to 100 by 2007 ( PLoS One , DOI : 10.1371/journal.pone0004624 ) .
Guilmoto also analysed statistics of access to prenatal ultrasounds , and found that there …
CNN 's Rick Sanchez brings in Michael Moore basher Sanjay Gupta and Rep. Roy Blunt to lament the horrors of private insurance companies no longer being able to reap massive profits on the backs of United States citizens .
If we did by some miracle actually ever get to universal health care in the U.S. , it would not mean these companies are out of business completely .
They would still be offering supplemental insurance to compliment the government plan .
In the world of the Gupta 's and Blunt 's out there , that would be a tragedy .
Blunt goes so far as to cite Medicare Part D as an example of just how well Republican health care reform has worked with giving consumers " choices " .
Yeah , the " choice " to line the pharmaceutical industry 's pocket .
So we agree on the goals , and our biggest disagreements are how you get there .
And probably the biggest disagreement of how you get there is whether the government is going to run a plan that does n't broaden competition , but actually eventually eliminates all the competition .
We need a plan that has -- we need a health care system that has access for everybody regardless of preexisting conditions , one that has more competition , more choice in a way that would make it more affordable , and one that ensures that people have the maximum opportunity to make their own choices about their doctor and their health care .
BLUNT : Actually , that 's the interesting thing about this debate , I think , Rick , is everybody agrees on the top line issues .
We believe , I believe , as the leader of our group on our side that 's tried to bring our committees together to work on this , I think we are in generally broad agreement .
Congressman , thanks for being with us .
I imagine the news that you are hearing , that there are problems here in the city , are ones you would have expected .
But let me start you somewhere else and ask you , OK , what would your plan be ?
SANCHEZ : Roy Blunt is joining us now .
He is a congressman from Missouri .
He is good enough to talk to us now .
SANCHEZ : It 's interesting , and I will let you maybe discuss this with my colleague , Sanjay Gupta , who has been giving this a lot of thought , and he seems to be suggesting , and Sanjay , I do n't want to put words in your mouth , but maybe something in the middle may be the answer , right ?
Because if you do everything based on profit , as you suggest , congressman , that leaves you some holes as well .
And we all know if you let the government take care of it itself , that may leave you some holes .
Sanjay , would you suggest a mixture of the two would be the way to go ?
GUPTA : There are several different issues sort of at play here .
and as far as a mixture of the two goes , people have suggested sort of a public / private option .
And I am not sure if Representative Blunt is referring to that specifically or how he feels about the idea of a public option .
Let me lay it out this way .
The public option would be , the way it has been presented would be for people who cannot afford health care and need some sort of subsidy or some other system in which they can purchase into to get their health care insurance .
The concern , the critics will charge this , Rick .
They will charge that a public option that has the backing of taxpayer dollars will be such a big competitor that it eventually will sort of remove the private insurance industry all together , and that wo n't be any kind of competition at all .
That 's what the critics will charge .
SANCHEZ : Let 's hear from the congressman on that .
What do you make of that , sir ?
BLUNT : Rick , and I think you said a moment ago that I was for a system based on profit .
I 'm actually not .
I 'm for a system based on competition , which is different than a system based on profit .
SANCHEZ : Are n't they the same ?
Are n't the really the same .
You compete because you want to do better than the next guy .
BLUNT : You want to have some profit , but you do n't want to have profit that the marketplace really should n't allow .
That 's the problem with the current system is it sort of grew up out of nowhere after World War II without any thoughts to really having maximum choices for people .
An example of maximum choices for people would be Medicare Part D , where everybody every year gets to look at their provider and decide if they still like that provider or not .
But back to Sanjay 's point .
I think many of us could accept the idea that if at some point the competition we are confident would be there does n't materialize , and these new choices can't be developed , you visit this again .
But if you start out with a government competitor , nobody describes this as just a competitor for people who can't get insurance .
The idea of the government competitor is to somehow make the marketplace more competitive .
What happens is that government competitor eventually drives all the other competitors away .
A government competitor is like an elephant in a room full of mice .
The fast mice get out of the room as quick as they can .
The slow mice get crushed by the elephant .
And then the only thing left in the room is the elephant .
And then , you have government - run health care , which is what we do n't want .
We want more competition .
We just do n't happen to think the government trying to run a big health care operation is the best place to give people more choice , more competition , and actually , ultimately , lower prices with their health care .
SANCHEZ : That makes sense .
We appreciate the analogy with the elephant .
We certainly understand that , quite vivid , in fact .
What do you expect the president to come out and tell the American people in the next five minutes ?
BLUNT : I think he is going to try to explain these numbers that the Congressional Budget Office came up with that really say that this is n't just a trillion dollars over 10 years , it is actually $ 2 trillion over ten years because the first five years , no money is spent .
The second five years , you are spending almost $ 200 billion a year .
That 's not anywhere close to being paid for by either tax increases that have been proposed in this bill or Medicare cuts .
And surely , he will try to explain why both his own Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office are wrong in saying this does nothing to slow down the spiraling health care costs .
There were two goals supposedly here .
One was to get people insured who are n't insured , and two was to stop the spiraling health care cost .
And I do n't think this program does either of those , but it sure costs the American taxpayer and the American economy a lot of money .

The busy Java developer 's guide to Scala Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
Welcome back , Scala fans .
Last month , we talked about Twitter , the micro- blogging site currently enjoying tremendous interest among social - networking types , and how its XML -/ REST - based API makes it an interesting playground for developers to investigate and explore .
Toward that end , we began to flesh out the basic structure of " Scitter , " a Scala library for accessing Twitter .
About this series Ted Neward dives into the Scala programming language and takes you along with him .
In this developerWorks series , you 'll learn what all the recent hype is about and see some of Scala 's linguistic capabilities in action .
Scala code and Java™ code will be shown side by side wherever comparison is relevant , but ( as you 'll discover ) many things in Scala have no direct correlation to anything you 've found in Java — and therein lies much of Scala 's charm !
After all , if Java could do it , why bother learning Scala ?
We have several goals for Scitter :
To make it substantially easier to access Twitter than just opening an HTTP connection and doing the work " by hand "
To be as easily accessible to Java clients
To make it easy to mock out for testing
We wo n't necessarily flesh out the fullness of the entire Twitter API in this installment , but we 'll get some of the core bits in place , with an eye toward making it easy for others to finish the job once this library hits a public source control repository .
The story so far : Scitter 0.1
Let 's start with a quick reminder of where we left off :

It 's a bit lengthy , but pretty easy to distill into a couple of basic components :
Case classes User and Status represent the basic types that Twitter sends back to its clients in response to an API call , complete with methods to construct into and extract from XML representations .
and represent the basic types that Twitter sends back to its clients in response to an API call , complete with methods to construct into and extract from XML representations .
A Scitter singleton object handles those operations that do n't require an authenticated user .
A Scitter instance ( parameterized by username and password ) is used for operations that require an authenticated user .
About the Twitter API
If you 're not familiar with the Twitter API , it 's worth taking a few minutes to go check out the Twitter API Wiki page for more details .
The basic fundamentals are simple — parameters are passed as part of the URL query , the responses can be in one of four formats ( JSON , XML , ATOM , or RSS ) , and so on — but as with all APIs , the devil is in the details and assuming readers have the Twitter API open in a browser somewhere while they read this article makes it easier to focus on the Scala parts of the discussion .
So far within the two Scitter types , we have only the test , verifyCredentials , and public_timeline APIs covered .
While those help verify that the basics of HTTP access ( using the Apache HttpClient library ) works and that our basic form of converting the XML responses into Status objects works , right now we can't even do the basic " what are my friends saying " public timeline query , nor have we taken even the basic steps towards preventing " repeat yourself " kinds of problems within the codebase , much less started looking at ways to make it easier to mock out the network access code for testing .
Clearly we 've got a long way to go in this episode .
Connecting
The first thing that bugs me about the code is that I 'm repeating the sequence of operations to create an HttpClient instance , initialize it , parameterize it with the necessary authentication parameters , and so on , in every one of the methods of both the Scitter object and class .
When there are only three methods between the two of them , it might be manageable , but it 's clearly not going to scale , and there are a lot of methods left to do .
Plus it 's going to be really difficult to go back into those methods later and introduce some kind of mocking and / or local / offline - testing capability .
So let 's fix that .
This really is n't a Scala-ism , per se , that we 're introducing here ; it 's just good plain Don't - Repeat - Yourself kind of thinking .
As such , I 'm going to start with a basic OO - oriented approach : create a helper method to do the actual work :
Listing 2 . DRYing out the codebase
package com.tedneward.scitter { // ... object Scitter { // ... private [ scitter ] def execute ( url : String ) = { val client = new HttpClient ( ) val method = new GetMethod ( url ) method.getParams().setParameter( HttpMethodParams.RETRY_HANDLER , new DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler( 3 , false ) ) client.executeMethod( method ) ( method.getStatusLine().getStatusCode ( ) , method.getResponseBodyAsString( ) ) } } }
Keep DRY in mind
For those of you who have not read Pragmatic Programmer or have n't read it in a long time , DRY stands for " Do n't Repeat Yourself . "
It basically suggests that any time you 're typing the same bits of code over and over again , you 're repeating yourself and you will eventually find yourself wishing those bits of code that do exactly the same thing were gathered into one place ( like a method ) so they can be easily fixed , enhanced , or replaced , later .
And if you have n't read Pragmatic Programmer by now , shame on you .
That 's your homework assignment for the month .
Notice a couple of things about this : first of all , I 'm returning a tuple from the execute ( ) method , containing both the status code and the response body ; this is one of the powerful parts of having tuples as a baked - in part of the language because it becomes really easy to hand back what , in effect , turns out to be multiple return values from a single method invocation .
Of course , in Java code , we could do the same thing by creating a top - level or nested class that contains the tuple elements , but that 's going to require a whole slew of code that 's specific to this one particular method .
Or we could hand back a Map with String keys and Object values , but then we lose type - safety in a big way .
Tuples are not a game - changing feature , just another one of those " niceties " that makes Scala a powerful language to use .
Because I 'm using a tuple , I 'm going to want to use another of Scala 's syntactic idioms to capture both results into local variables , such as this rewritten version of Scitter.
test :
Listing 3 . Is this a DRY run ?
package com.tedneward.scitter { // ... object Scitter { /** *
Ping the server to see if it 's up and running .
* * Twitter docs say : * test * Returns the string " ok " in the requested format with a 200 OK HTTP status code .
* URL : http://twitter.com/help/test.format * Formats : xml , json * Method(s ) : GET */ def test : Boolean = { val ( statusCode , statusBody ) = execute ( " http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.xml " ) statusCode == 200 } } }
In fact , I could easily strike statusBody entirely and replace it with _ because I do n't ever use the second parameter ( test has no return body ) , but I 'll need the body for the other calls , so I leave it here for demonstrative purposes .
Notice how execute ( ) does n't leak any of the details that deal with the actual HTTP communication — this is Encapsulation 101 .
This will make it easier to replace execute ( ) with another implementation later ( which we 'll do later ) or to potentially optimize the code by reusing a single HttpClient object instead of reinstantiating a new one each time .
Premature optimization
By the way , the optimization here would be useful only if it turns out that HttpClient does something non-trivial in its constructor .
Specifically , it would not be a useful optimization to try and cache the HttpClient object just to save on object allocations — the garbage collector , much maligned within the Java performance literature for years , is actually quite good at allocating and collecting short - lived objects , like the HttpClient object and its kin in this particular case .
Most of all , though , I 'm going to apply this optimization only if and when I discover that the execute ( ) method is somehow a bottleneck or a waste of resources .
Act accordingly .
Next , notice how the execute ( ) method is on the Scitter object ?
This means that I 'll be able to use it from the various Scitter instances ( at least for now I can , until I do something inside execute ( ) that prevents me from doing so ) — this is why I 've marked execute ( ) as private [ scitter ] , which means that everything inside the com.tedneward .
scitter package can see it .
( By the way , if you have n't already , run the tests to make sure that everything still works fine .
I 'm going to assume you are doing that as we go through the code , so if I forget to mention it , that does n't mean you get to forget to do it . )
By the way , supporting the Scitter class is going to require a username and password for authenticated access , so I 'll just create an overloaded version of the execute ( ) method that takes two additional String s as parameters :
Listing 4 .
An even DRYer version
package com.tedneward.scitter { // ... object Scitter { // ... private [ scitter ] def execute ( url : String , username : String , password : String ) = { val client = new HttpClient ( ) val method = new GetMethod ( url ) method.getParams() .setParameter( HttpMethodParams.RETRY_HANDLER , new DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler( 3 , false ) ) client.getParams().setAuthenticationPreemptive(true ) client.getState().setCredentials ( new AuthScope ( " twitter.com " , 80 , AuthScope.ANY_REALM ) , new UsernamePasswordCredentials ( username , password ) ) client.executeMethod(method ) ( method.getStatusLine().getStatusCode ( ) , method.getResponseBodyAsString( ) ) } } }
In fact , given that the two execute ( ) s do pretty much the same thing modulo the authentication bits , we can rewrite the first execute ( ) entirely in terms of the second with the caveat that Scala requires us to be explicit about the return type of the overloaded execute ( ) :
Listing 5 . Desert DRY
package com.tedneward.scitter { // ... object Scitter { // ... private [ scitter ] def execute ( url : String ) : ( Int , String ) = execute ( url , " " , " " ) private [ scitter ] def execute ( url : String , username : String , password : String ) = { val client = new HttpClient ( ) val method = new GetMethod ( url ) method.getParams().setParameter( HttpMethodParams.RETRY_HANDLER , new DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler( 3 , false ) ) if ( ( username != " " ) && ( password != " " ) ) { client.getParams().setAuthenticationPreemptive(true ) client.getState().setCredentials ( new AuthScope ( " twitter.com " , 80 , AuthScope.ANY_REALM ) , new UsernamePasswordCredentials ( username , password ) ) } client.executeMethod( method ) ( method.getStatusLine().getStatusCode ( ) , method.getResponseBodyAsString( ) ) } } }
So far , so good .
We 've DRY 'ed the communication parts of the Scitter code so let 's move on to the next thing on the list : Let 's get a list of my friends ' tweets .
Connecting ( to friends )
The Twitter API states that the friends_timeline API call " returns the 20 most recent statuses posted by the authenticating user and that user 's friends . "
( It also points out , for those of you who use Twitter from the Twitter Web site directly , that " This is the equivalent of ' / home ' on the Web . " )
This is a pretty basic requirement for any Twitter API , so let 's add that to the Scitter class ; we add it to the class and not the object because , as the docs point out , this is done on behalf of the authenticating user , which I 've decided belongs in the Scitter class and not the Scitter object .
Here we get tossed a curveball , though :
The friends_timeline call accepts a list of " optional parameters " including since_id , max_id , count , and page to control the results returned .
This is going to be a tricky operation because Scala does n't natively support the idea of " optional parameters " the way that other languages ( like Groovy , JRuby , or JavaScript ) do , but let 's deal with the simple stuff first — let 's create a friends Timeline method that just executes the normal , non-parameterized call :
Listing 6 . " Tell me what company thou keepst ... "
package com.tedneward.scitter { class Scitter { def friendsTimeline : List [ Status ] = { val ( statusCode , statusBody ) = Scitter.execute ( " http://twitter.com/statuses/friends_timeline.xml " , username , password ) if ( statusCode == 200 ) { val responseXML = XML.loadString( statusBody ) val statusListBuffer = new ListBuffer [ Status ] for ( n <- ( responseXML \\ " status " ) .elements ) statusListBuffer += ( Status.fromXml(n ) ) statusListBuffer.toList } else { Nil } } } }
So far , so good ; the corresponding method to test this looks something like this :
Listing 7 . " ... and I 'll tell thee what thou art . " ( Miguel de Cervantes )
package com.tedneward.scitter.test { class ScitterTests { // ... @ Test def scitter FriendsTimeline = { val scitter = new Scitter ( testUser , testPassword ) val result = scitter.friendsTimeline assertTrue(result.length >
0 ) } } }
Perfect .
Looks just like the publicTimeline ( ) method from the Scitter object and behaves almost exactly the same way , too .
Futures ....
As part of writing this article , I asked the authors of Programming in Scala — Bill Venners , Martin Odersky , and Lex Spoon — what they thought the best and / or most idiomatic way to deal with optional parameters would be and in the ensuing discussion , Martin mentioned that this is an area that they 're looking into , most possibly for the 2.8 release .
Whether that will take the form of " default parameters " or " optional parameters " is n't quite clear yet , at least not to me , but if this is an area that particularly intrigues you , now is the time to chime in on the mailing lists .
We still have the problem of those optional parameters .
Because Scala does n't have optional parameters as a language feature , the only option at first blush seems to be to create a whole slew of overloaded friendsTimeline ( ) methods , taking some factorially governed number of parameters .
Fortunately , there is a better way to do this by combining two of Scala 's language features ( one of which I have n't mentioned yet ) in an interesting way — case classes and " repeated parameters " ( look at Listing 8 ) :
Listing 8 . " How do I love thee ? ... "
package com.tedneward.scitter { // ... abstract class OptionalParam case class Id( id : String ) extends OptionalParam case class UserId ( id : Long ) extends OptionalParam case class Since ( since_id : Long ) extends OptionalParam case class Max ( max_id : Long ) extends OptionalParam case class Count ( count : Int ) extends OptionalParam case class Page ( page : Int ) extends OptionalParam class Scitter ( username : String , password : String ) { // ... def friendsTimeline ( options : OptionalParam* ) : List [ Status ] = { val optionsStr = new StringBuffer ( " http://twitter.com/statuses/friends_timeline.xml? " ) for ( option <- options ) { option match { case Since ( since_id ) => options Str.append (" since_id= " + since_id.toString ( ) + " & " ) case Max( max_id ) => optionsStr.append(" max_id= " + max_id.toString ( ) + " & " ) case Count ( count ) => optionsStr.append(" count= " + count.toString ( ) + " & " ) case Page ( page ) => optionsStr.append(" page= " + page.toString ( ) + " & " ) } } val ( statusCode , statusBody ) = Scitter.execute(optionsStr.toString ( ) , username , password ) if ( statusCode == 200 ) { val responseXML = XML.loadString( statusBody ) val statusListBuffer = new ListBuffer [ Status ] for ( n <- ( responseXML \\ " status " ) .elements ) statusListBuffer += ( Status.fromXml(n ) ) statusListBuffer.toList } else { Nil } } } }
See the * tagging the end of the options parameter ?
That indicates that the parameter is actually a sequence of parameters , very much akin to the Java 5 varargs construct .
Just as with varargs , the number of parameters passed can be zero just as we had before ( although we will need to go back into the test code and add a pair of parentheses to the friendsTimeline call now , otherwise the compiler wo n't know if we 're trying to call the method with no parameters or trying to use it for partial - application purposes or something similar ) ; we can also can start passing those case types around , as in the following :
Listing 9 . " ... Let me count the ways " ( William Shakespeare )
package com.tedneward.scitter.test { class ScitterTests { // ... @ Test def scitterFriendsTimelineWithCount = { val scitter = new Scitter ( testUser , testPassword ) val result = scitter.friendsTimeline( Count( 5 ) ) assertTrue( result.length == 5 ) } } }
Of course , there 's always the possibility that a sociopathic client could pass in some truly bizarre sequence of parameters , such as friends Timeline ( Count ( 5 ) , Count ( 6 ) , Count ( 7 ) ) , but in this case we 'll just blindly hand the list over to Twitter ( and hope that their error - handling is strong enough to just take the last one specified ) .
Of course , if it becomes a concern , it 's not hard to walk through the list of repeated parameters and take the last one of each kind specified before constructing the URL sent to Twitter .
In the meantime , Caveat emptor .
Compatibility
This does raise an interesting question , though : How easy is it to call this method from Java code ?
After all , if one of the major goals of this library is to maintain compatibility to Java code , then we need to make sure that Java code does n't have to jump through too many hoops to use it .
Let 's start by tossing the Scitter class at our good friend javap :
Listing 10 .
Oh , yeah , Java code ... I remember now ....
C:\>javap - classpath classes com.tedneward.scitter .Scitter Compiled from " scitter.scala " public class com.tedneward.scitter .Scitter extends java.lang .
Object implements s cala.ScalaObject{ public com.tedneward.scitter.Scitter(java.lang.String , java.lang.String ) ; public scala .
List friendsTimeline( scala.Seq ) ; public boolean verifyCredentials ( ) ; public int $ tag ( ) throws java.rmi.RemoteException ; }
Yikes !
Two things jump out at me here as concerns .
First , friendsTimeline ( ) takes a scala .
Seq as a parameter ( which is the repeated parameters feature we just used ) .
Second , the friendsTimeline ( ) method , just as with the publicTimeline ( ) method from the Scitter object ( run javap on it to double - check if you do n't believe me ) returns a scala .
List of elements .
How usable are these two types from Java code ?
The easiest way to find out is to write a small set of JUnit tests in Java code rather than in Scala , so let 's do that .
While we could go and test the construction of the Scitter instance and call its verifyCredentials ( ) method , those are n't particularly useful — remember , we 're not here ( in this case ) to verify the correctness of the Scitter class but to see how easy it is to use the thing from Java code .
Toward that end , let 's just jump directly to writing a test that will fetch the " friends timeline " — in other words , we want to instantiate a Scitter instance and invoke its friendsTimeline ( ) method with no parameters .
Doing this is a bit trickier , thanks to the scala .
Seq parameter that we need to pass in — scala .
Seq is a Scala trait which means it gets mapped to the underlying JVM as an interface , so we can't just instantiate one directly .
We can try the classic Java null parameter , but doing so throws an exception at run time .
What we need is a scala .
Seq class that we can easily instantiate from Java code .
Turns out , we find one in the very same mutable .
ListBuffer type that we use inside the Scitter implementation itself :
Listing 11 .
And now I remember why I like Scala ....
package com.tedneward.scitter.test ; import org.junit.* ; import com.tedneward.scitter .* ; public class JavaScitterTests { public static final String testUser = " TESTUSER " ; public static final String testPassword = " TESTPASSWORD " ; @ Test public void getFriendsStatuses ( ) { Scitter scitter = new Scitter ( testUser , testPassword ) ; if ( scitter.verifyCredentials ( ) ) { scala .
List statuses = scitter.friendsTimeline(new scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer ( ) ) ; Assert.assertTrue(statuses.length ( ) > 0 ) ; } else Assert.assertTrue ( false ) ; } }
Using the returned scala .
List is n't a problem because we can just treat it as much like we would any other Collection class ( though we do miss some of the Collections API niceties because the Scala - based methods on List all assume you will be interacting with them from Scala ) , so walking through the results is n't all that difficult , if a bit " old- school " Java code ( circa 1995 ) :
Listing 12 . 1995 called ; they want their Vector back ....
package com.tedneward.scitter.test ; import org.junit.* ; import com.tedneward.scitter .* ; public class JavaScitterTests { public static final String testUser = " TESTUSER " ; public static final String testPassword = " TESTPASSWORD " ; @ Test public void getFriendsStatuses ( ) { Scitter scitter = new Scitter ( testUser , testPassword ) ; if ( scitter.verifyCredentials ( ) ) { scala .
List statuses = scitter.friendsTimeline(new scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer ( ) ) ; Assert.assertTrue(statuses.length( ) > 0 ) ; for ( int i=0 ; i< statuses.length ( ) ; i++) { Status stat = ( Status) statuses.apply ( i ) ; System.out.println(stat.user().screenName( ) + " said " + stat.text ( ) ) ; } } else Assert.assertTrue ( false ) ; } }
Which brings us to the next part , that of passing the parameters into the friendsTimeline ( ) method .
Unfortunately , the ListBuffer type does n't take a collection as a constructor parameter , so we have to construct the list of params , then pass the collection in on the method call ; it 's tedious , but not overly burdensome :
Listing 13 .
Can I go back to Scala now , please ?
package com.tedneward.scitter.test ; import org.junit.* ; import com.tedneward.scitter .* ; public class JavaScitterTests { public static final String testUser = " TESTUSER " ; public static final String testPassword = " TESTPASSWORD " ; // ... @ Test public void getFriendsStatusesWithCount ( ) { Scitter scitter = new Scitter ( testUser , testPassword ) ; if ( scitter.verifyCredentials ( ) ) { scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer params = new scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer( ) ; params.$plus$eq ( new Count ( 5 ) ) ; scala .
List statuses = scitter.friendsTimeline(params ) ; Assert.assertTrue(statuses.length ( ) > 0 ) ; Assert.assertTrue(statuses.length( ) == 5 ) ; for ( int i=0 ; i< statuses.length ( ) ; i++) { Status stat = ( Status) statuses.apply ( i ) ; System.out.println(stat.user().screenName( ) + " said " + stat.text ( ) ) ; } } else Assert.assertTrue ( false ) ; } }
So although the Java version is a bit more verbose than its Scala equivalent , so far it 's still pretty straightforward to call the Scitter library from any Java client that might want to use it .
Excellent .
Conclusion
Clearly there 's a long way yet to go with Scitter , but it 's starting to really take shape and form and so far , it 's feeling pretty good .
We 've managed to DRY - ify the communication parts of the Scitter library and to incorporate the optional parameters that Twitter asks for a number of the different API calls it provides — and so far Java clients are n't going to be too deeply put off by the API we 're exposing .
Granted , it 's not nearly as clean an API as the one that Scala can consume naturally , but if Java developers want to use the Scitter library , they do n't have too much to do to get started .
The Scitter library still has something of an " objectish " feel to it , but we 're starting to see some of Scala 's " functionalish " features creeping their way into the system .
As we continue building out the library , more and more of those features will begin to worm their way in , anywhere that they help make the code more concise and more clear .
And that 's as it should be .
For now , it 's time for us to part ways while I take a brief hiatus .
When I return , I 'll add some support for offline testing , plus the ability to update a user 's status to the library .
Until then , Scala fans , remember :
It 's always better to be functional than dysfunctional .
( Sorry .
I like that joke just way too much . )

A former student was kind enough to draw my attention to the following video , a very interesting TED talk by anthropologist Wade Davis , a National Geographic “ Explorer - in - Residence ” :
I have a lot of respect for Wade Davis and I have long been an admirer of his work on zombification in Haiti , which he calls the “ ethnobiology ” of the Haitian zombie .
Indeed it seems that biological metaphors and comparisons are interwoven throughout his entire talk above , a talk that raised many problematic issues for me , which I want to address but not in any particular order .
One problem has to do with the fusion of elements of conservative and evolutionist notions of cultures as natural organisms , fragile at that , weak in the face of Western development because it is “ beyond their capacity to adapt to it ” — a view that privileges “ our ” position as Westerners , at the apex of progress .
Aside from the imputed holism which suggests peoples cut off from the wider world - system , one in which they have been active participants for centuries , Davis also suggests that cultural change is cultural loss — these are endangered cultures after all .
This reminds me of Marshall Sahlins ‘ observation ( following Margaret Jolly ) , that “ when we change it ’s called progress , but when they do — notably when they adopt some of our progressive things — it ’s a kind of adulteration , a loss of their culture . ”
The conservative aspect goes back to the influences of Edmund Burke and Bronislaw Malinowski , the latter writing :
every item of culture … represents a value , fulfills a social function … .
For tradition is a fabric in which all the strands are so clearly woven that the destruction of one unmakes the whole .
And tradition is …a form of collective adaptation of a community to its surroundings .
Destroy tradition , and you will deprive the collective organism of its protective shell , and give it over to the slow but inevitable process of dying out .

Wade Davis is taking us back to these older conceptualizations of anthropology ’s most favoured others , as if several decades of criticism had never happened , while imparting to his audience that this is what we anthropologists do : we study primitive , endangered others .
From them we collect precious bits of unique wisdom which we assemble into a cabinet of curios that can then be shown to enthusiastic TED audiences , streamed on the Web .
This takes me to the second jumble of problematic points — the National Geographic Explorer approach to indigenous peoples combined with Wade Davis ’ statement that at National Geographic they do not engage in politics and polemics , look at the awful decisions made by politicians ( the audience applauds … except they are really only applauding as much as the statement applies to the other person ’s favourite politician ) .
Davis talks about ethnocide , which is the result of political decisions .
Davis also speaks about indigenous peoples fighting for survival — are they able to do so without politics , without political ideas ?
There is a desire , that I find occasionally among students , to depoliticize the other — let ’s just talk about their “ cultures , ” their magical beliefs , and how plants sing to them at night .
Tell us what they eat , what they wear , but do n’t tell us about what makes them so angry and what they are doing about it .
The expectation of a few is that a course I have inherited ( and revised ) , “ Indigenous Cultures Today , ” will be a brochure - like traveler ’s exposé of bits and pieces of indigenous knowledge and practice minus their politics .
The Zapatistas barely figure as indigenous for National Geographic — after 15 years they have an item on a musical band and a film announcement , that ’s all .
Yet while the Zapatistas do not earn the attention of National Geographic and its “ explorers ” , Tibet certainly does , as you heard Davis speak .
Indeed , Davis has written about Tibet , but not the Zapatistas .
This takes me to the lead question for this post :
If Wade Davis is interested in cultures endangered by violence , marginalization , and conquering occupiers then why does he not speak about Gaza or the West Bank ?
Do the Taliban count as another culture , fighting for survival ?
Do n’t they have a unique belief system and distinctive way of life too ?
Or is it that “ we ” are only interested in other cultures –struggling , endangered cultures — as long as they do not threaten “ us ” ( even if maybe they threaten others ) ?
Finally , do we need Wade Davis to speak for these “ others ” ?
Does the Indian not ever speak for himself ?
Yes , he does , but “ we ” just fired him for saying nasty things about us and 9/11 , and besides he is a “ fake Indian ” ( as judged by us white racists ) .
But surely , cross-cultural understanding is important for world peace , one might assert .
That takes me to my next post .

Wednesday 's episode of Lost ( 9 pm / ET , ABC ) is titled " Dead Is Dead . "
It purports to tell the story of Ben 's atonement for his many sins , but it brings to mind that pesky rumor we keep hearing :
Two main characters will die before the end of the season .
And not Frogurt - caliber characters — people you actually care about .
Putting aside for a second the fact that dying on Lost does n't exactly mean a trip to the unemployment office , let 's examine a few likely suspects , and then tell us who you think is going to take that long island dirt nap .
BEN
FOR HIM
Last we saw him , little Ben was on death 's door after getting plugged by Sayid .
Sure , Richard Alpert said he could save him , but can he really ?
Plus , see above — the episode is called " Dead Is Dead " for a reason .
AGAINST HIM
In revealing the backstory of Ben 's fractured childhood — and his fate at the hands of the Hostiles — the character has become infinitely more sympathetic .
In addition , Lost appears to be headed toward a showdown between Ben and Widmore , and it 's still too early for that confrontation to take place .
NARRATIVE PUNCH
Lost without Ben would certainly be duller .
Good guy or bad , he has double - crossed nearly everyone in the cast .
CLAIRE
FOR HER
There is a well - developed conspiracy theory that claims that Claire actually died in that explosion in her house in New Otherton .
Supporters point to her last communication with Miles ( aka Señor Ghostbuster ) , her abandonment of Aaron and her cozying up to Christian , her dead dad , inside Jacob 's cabin .
AGAINST HER
There is no indication that Emilie de Ravin has been on set at all this season .
Plus : Emilie de Ravin told us already that Claire will return as a regular cast member for the final season .
NARRATIVE PUNCH
There are still a few unanswered questions in Claire 's backstory , but most revolve around the significance of Aaron .
In short , we might like her more as a ghost .
DESMOND
FOR HIM Desmond would do anything to protect Penny and their son , Charlie — including die to save them .
AGAINST HIM Daniel Faraday has hinted at Desmond 's importance in the show 's evolving time - travel conceit , in that the rules do n't appear to apply to him .
Now that the gang is stuck in 1977 , he may be their only hope of rescue .
NARRATIVE PUNCH
Desmond is a popular character , especially with the lay - deez .
( Holla ! )
They would riot if he was killed .
HURLEY
FOR HIM
Truthfully , there is no indication that it would be him .
AGAINST HIM Hurley is the Oceanic 6's truth - teller ; he keeps everyone honest .
Hurley seems to be the most accessible character through which to tell the story of " the numbers , " an annoying plot point that has yet to be adequately explained .
NARRATIVE PUNCH
Dude , it would totally suck .
JULIET
FOR HER
The blogosphere erupted when it was revealed that Elizabeth Mitchell had been cast in the remake of the V miniseries .
Did that mean she was leaving Lost ?
AGAINST HER
Though the rumors persist , ABC says the role is just a guest - starring gig ; plus , we 're hearing Juliet appears in Season 6 .
NARRATIVE PUNCH
Long - suffering Juliet seems to have finally found peace with Sawyer among the Dharma Initiative .
Killing her now would be especially harsh — and dramatically potent .
KATE
FOR HER
There were rumblings earlier in the season that Evangeline Lilly was available to audition for pilot season , which sent Lost fans into a tizzy that Kate might be exiting .
AGAINST HER
The rumor was quickly silenced .
( " Not even remotely true , " a source told TVGuide.com . )
NARRATIVE PUNCH
Needless to say , losing Kate before the end of the series would be truly shocking .
PENNY
FOR HER After Widmore killed Ben's " daughter , " Alex , Ben pledged revenge .
Last we saw Ben , he had an errand to run at what appeared to be a marina .
He then boarded Ajira Flight 316 bloodied and bruised .
AGAINST HER Penny and Desmond 's globetrotting ( indeed , time - trotting ) romance has become the heart of the show .
It would be downright cruel to break up this happily reunited couple after their long , torturous separation .
NARRATIVE PUNCH
Sucker .
To the kidneys .
And the heart .
Sniff .
SAWYER
FOR HIM As Jim LaFleur , Sawyer holds a prominent position within the Dharma Initiative .
But as James Ford , survivor of Oceanic 815 , he has other goals .
As his two interests start to diverge , it 's possible that Sawyer 's double - agent routine will be discovered .
AGAINST HIM
The Kate - Jack - Juliet - Sawyer love rectangle is an endless source of discussion for the fans .
They 'd never remove one of the variables , would they ?
NARRATIVE PUNCH
Killing Sawyer just as he redeemed himself would be bittersweet — and characteristic of Lost .
SAYID
FOR HIM After shooting little Ben , Sayid is Dharma Public Enemy No. 1 .
AGAINST HIM
His recent declaration —
" You were right ; I am a killer " — seems to indicate the beginning of a redemption story arc .
NARRATIVE PUNCH
Hard to say .
We love Naveen Andrews , but how much more do we need to know about Sayid ?
SUN
FOR HER
She 's hanging out with Christian lately , and he tends to show up , Grim Reaper - like , just before people meet their maker ( see : Locke , Michael , Claire ? ) .
AGAINST HER Similar to Des and Penny , Sun and Jin 's flawed romance sneaked up on us .
Sun has already believed Jin dead ; is n't that enough ?
NARRATIVE PUNCH
Killing her off before ( or even after ) she finds Jin would make for some terrific drama .
The recent unemployment numbers have undermined confidence that we might be nearing the bottom of the recession .
What we can see on the surface is disconcerting enough , but the inside numbers are just as bad .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminary estimate for job losses for June is 467,000 , which means 7.2 million people have lost their jobs since the start of the recession .
The cumulative job losses over the last six months have been greater than for any other half year period since World War II , including the military ...
Should There Be More Religious Control Of Banking ?
Asks University Of Leicester
The University of Leicester ’s School of Management wonders if more religious control of banks might have lessened the impact of the global financial crisis .
Buying into the notion that a ' sub - prime ' housing market led to the latest global financial crisis , they say developing new practices which can address the issues that led the world to the brink of collapse are a vital part of recovery .
Professor Martin Parker , Director of Research for the Management School , thinks a banking system consistent with the principles of Islamic law ( Sharia ) may be a solution so the university is hosting a conference to consider potential lessons from the Islamic Banking and Finance sector .
What would that mean ?
Concepts like term loans that return interest to banks would be forbidden and banks would be forbidden from investing in companies contrary to Fiqh al - Muamalat - Islamic rules on transactions .
Parker says , “ It is important for everyone ’s future that we study the current crisis in order that more sustainable financial practices can be developed .
This conference is a contribution to that project . ”
Unlike Christianity , Muslim countries and financial institutions are able to gather and ally using religious precepts without criticism from western political groups so Islamic banking has grown each year and exists in all ' Muslim ' countries , including ones considered Christian .
There 's even a World Islamic Banking Conference , held annually in Bahrain each year since 1994 .
Imagine the outrage in the U.S.A. if a Christian Banking Conference were held with government sponsorship and endorsements .
Despite the societal concerns of a fundamentalist approach to getting a mortgage for your home , the University of Leicester ’s School of Management is hosting a conference to consider potential lessons from the Islamic Banking and Finance sector .
The conference , to be held on 2nd and 3rd July , will consider topics such as :
· Are Islamic banks more resilient than the secular / government ones in the west ?
· Would the principle in Islamic banking that the transaction be free from interest and backed up by a tangible asset make it more robust than secular / government banks ?
· Will globalization make the Islamic system vulnerable ?
· Does the obligation of Islamic Financial Institutions on transparency make it less vulnerable ?
Well , it is n't all that transparent .
Islamic banks do n't loan the buyer money to purchase a house , because that is against sharia , and instead the bank buys it and sells it to the buyer at a profit and lets the buyer pay in installments - but they can't call it a profit .
True , mark - to - market rules cannot apply and write downs wo n't occur , causing a false problem , if no one actually knows what a house is worth , since the buying price is set by the bank , but that is n't more transparent .
Not on the docket ; will you be able to get a loan if you are not Muslim ?
And the IOR ( Instituto
per le Opere di Religione ) , better known as the ' Vatican Bank ' , does pretty well too .
It 's unclear if Christian - and Jewish - controlled banks will get equal time in Leicester .
Conference coordinator , Dr Ibrahim Umar , said “ This is an opportunity for economists , business practitioners , Islamic scholars , and private industries such as banking and insurance to come together to consider whether we can learn lessons from the Islamic system and , if so , what benefits might be achieved .
It also gives us the opportunity to consider what potential situations or factors may have a detrimental effect in the future .
The conference is open to both academics and practitioners .
I hope that anyone who has something to add to the debate will attend . ”

You 're Rich and You Don't Know It
Today you are richer than 99 % of the people who ever walked the earth .
That ’s true even if you ’re out of work , flat broke , your credit cards are maxed out , your car ’s been repossessed and a sheriff ’s deputy has already served your eviction notice .
I ’m about to explain why – and share the best three words of advice you ’ll ever get …
According to a recent CBS News / New York Times poll , Americans ’ views on the general state of the country have hit an all - time low , with 81 % saying the nation is on the “ wrong track ” – the worst - ever number for this barometer .
Some will say this simply reflects
The Great Recession and the inevitable pain and suffering it has wrought .
But that ’s not the whole story .
Increasing numbers have been saying this – not just for years but for decades , with large majorities claiming that the country is going downhill , life is getting tougher , our children face a declining future and the world in general is going to hell in a hand basket .
Exactly why is pretty obvious …
We face the twin specters of terrorism and nuclear proliferation .
American troops are bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan .
TV programming is trash .
Taxes are high .
The federal deficit is ballooning , home prices are falling , the currency is weak , food and fuel prices have jumped , credit is tight , and the stock market just experienced its worst year since 1931 .
Of course , the national media delivers the world through a highly distorted lens .
It does this to attract attention .
It takes viewers to sell advertising .
And you do n’t draw a crowd talking about buildings that do n’t burn , planes that do n’t crash , or companies that are hiring instead of laying off .
Yet despite all the negative news , our general lot is getting better , not worse .
As Greg Easterbrook of the Brookings Institution recently wrote in The Wall Street Journal , “ Living standards are the highest they have ever been , including the living standards for the middle class and the poor .
All forms of pollution other than greenhouse gases are in decline ; cancer , heart disease and stroke incidence are declining ; crime is in a long - term cycle of significant decline , education levels are at all - time highs . ”
Our ancestors just a few generations removed would marvel at life today .
In the first half of the 20th century , for instance , most people earned a subsistence living through long hours of backbreaking work in forestry , mining , farms or factories .
Today we work roughly half as many hours , physical toil has ended for most wage earners , and we have more purchasing power with far more leisure .
In the first half of our nation ’s history , most Americans lived and died within a few miles of where they were born .
Nothing – neither people nor news – traveled faster than a horse .
And , as far as we knew , nothing ever would .
Today we have instantaneous global communication , 24 - hour broadband Internet access and same - day travel to distant cities .
Formal discrimination against women and minorities has ended .
There is mass home ownership , with central heat and air - conditioning – and endless labor - saving devices : stoves , ovens , refrigerators , dishwashers , microwaves , cell phones and computers .
Medicine was almost non-existent 80 years ago .
In 1927 , for example , President Calvin Coolidge ’s sixteen - year old son Calvin Jr. developed a blister playing tennis without socks .
It became infected .
Five days later , he died .
Before the advent of antibiotics , tragedies like this were routine .
Advances in drugs and technology have eliminated most of history ’s plagues .
There has been a stunning reduction in infectious diseases .
We complain about the rising cost of health care .
But that ’s only because we live long enough to need more of it .
The average American lifespan has almost doubled over the past century .
We have low - cost access to information , art and literature .
We have almost every imaginable political and economic freedom .
True , the federal government is a sprawling , metastasizing leviathan that needs to be beat back with a stick .
But compare it to most governments in most countries down through the ages .
In short , we enjoy economic and political freedoms that millions throughout history have risked theirs lives for .
We live a long time , in comfortable circumstances , and enjoy goods and services in almost limitless supply .
By almost any measure , we are living better than 99 % of the people who have come before us .
Yet Americans routinely tell pollsters that life is hard and things are getting worse .
In short , we risk becoming the moping caricature that comedian Steve Martin creates when he grumbles , “ the only joy I know is a dishwashing liquid . ”
Seldom do we take a moment to appreciate our incredible good fortune being alive .
As Oxford biologist Richard Dawkins writes :
We are going to die , and that makes us the lucky ones .
Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born .
The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara .
Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats , scientists greater than Newton .
We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively outnumbers the set of actual people .
In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I , in our ordinariness , that are here …
And none of us knows how long he ’s going to be here .
Take Eugene O’Kelly , former Chairman and CEO of accounting giant KPMG , for example .
Four years ago , he was diagnosed with inoperable , late - stage brain cancer .
He was told he had three to six months to live .
He was 53 .
Suddenly , the life of this rich , powerful and privileged man , whose days were filled with executive meetings and business appointments , became something very different .
He was left with less than 100 days to live .
“ No more living in the future , ” he wrote in his memoir .
“ ( Or the past , for that matter – a problem for many people , although a lesser one for me . )
I needed to stop living two months , a week , even a few hours ahead .
Even a few minutes ahead .
Sixty seconds from now is , in its way , as elusive as sixty years from now , and always will be .
It is – was – exhausting to live in a world that never exists .
Also kind of silly , since we happen to be blessed with such a fascinating one right here , right now .
I felt that if I could learn to stay in the present moment , to be fully conscious of my surroundings , I would buy myself lots of time that had never been available to me , not in all the years I was healthy … ”
With the clock counting down , O’Kelly made a list of his closest friends and colleagues and planned a final encounter with each one :
“ I stopped at each name and made myself recall , in the closest detail possible , all the moments the two of us had enjoyed together .
How we met .
What made us become friends in the first place .
The qualities in them I particularly appreciated .
The lessons I learned by knowing them .
The ways in which having met him or her had made me a better person . ”
His friends were touched – usually overwhelmed – to know how much they had meant to him .
“ Enjoy every sandwich , ” he writes .
Most of us promise ourselves that one day – not too long from now – we ’ll slow down .
We ’ll spend more time with our family .
Enjoy a lazy day out with friends .
Or just take a walk alone in the woods or on the seashore .
Some day …
If – like me – you ’re one of the millions who has often deluded himself this way , O’Kelly has three words of advice : “ Move it up . ”
Eugene O’Kelly died on September 10th , 2005 .

Just this week , Wiley & Sons published a new collection of his essays , The Secret of Shelter Island : Money and What Matters .
When we first wrote about Foursquare back in March it had just hit the web scene at SXSW and was taking the social media community by storm .
We instantly saw the potential of a location - based service based on your Twitter network with an added layer of social gameplay .
Now we 're starting to see the app get adopted by more and more of our friends , finding traction in San Francisco , New York , Los Angeles , Atlanta , Chicago , San Diego , and several other hyperlocal metro hubs .
These breeding grounds of Foursquare activity are creating quite a frenzy , and we thought it appropriate to take a step back and survey the surrounding location - based social networking space as it applies to mobile apps , look forward to the future , and break down the beauty of Foursquare .
While no service is likely to achieve the same scale as Twitter in the coming months , Foursquare has all the right ingredients to be one of this year 's big hits .
The Long and Short of LBS
Foursquare is by no means the first location - based social network to help you connect with friends using GPS via your mobile device .
In fact , Brightkite was one of the first companies to really make a splash , combining location sharing , friend connections , and Twitter - like streams to create a photo and status update feed for your check - in history , and placestreams for each location .
If only we really wanted all that .
If time has proven anything , it 's that Brightkite is in danger of turning into something like FriendFeed .
Great in every way , shape , and form but somehow just missing the mark .
In fact , it may have taught us all one big bright lesson — that even though the technology and the idea are fantastic , we do n't really want to know where other people are in the world unless they 're our friends , or we 're at an event .
Strangers meeting up with strangers is just strange .
Google Latitude falls in the same boat .
Google 's approach to location - based social networking lacks innovation and foresight .
In fact , they basically copied the idea from Brightkite , skimped on feature set , and created a service knowing it would gain traction because of their name .
But , it 's just not good enough , especially since their iPhone app is really just a Safari view of a mobile web page .
Of course , let 's not forget about Loopt , the location - based iPhone app and social network that saw immediate uptake as one of the first of its kind to land on the iPhone ; very useful at times , but still without the real secret sauce .
Before them all , however , was a small company called Dodgeball , which just so happens to be the roots of Foursquare .
It was a location - based app before its time ; Google snatched them up and essentially killed them off .
Thankfully Dennis Crowley and Naveen Selvadurai , the guys behind Foursquare , had the wherewithal to keep thinking about location , making Foursquare a realized continuation of their initial vision .
Despite all the competition and growth in the space , there 's still room for a game changer here , and we believe it could be Foursquare .
Let 's take a look at why .
Foursquare is Like Twitter Before it Was Twitter
Remember the early days when everyone mocked Twitter .
Actually go back even further to March of 2007 , when Twitter made its first big hit at SXSW .
The initial kool - aide drinkers really got Twitter , tweeted their enthusiasm , took to their blogs to spread the Twitter love , and started to break down why it would be a game changer .
The rest of us just laughed .
" Ha " we said , " why would I want to share or read mundane information about myself on the web .
What pointless , mundane , drivel . "
And then an intangible and metaphorical wave happened , where one by one more and more people started to tweet , started to figure out for themselves why it was important , and then repeat the same cycle as the early adopters before them .
Then along came the media .
They were quick to judge , full of fantastic puns , and naysayers , until they started to use it and figure it out too .
Long story short , Twitter , as simple as it is , was ( and to some extent still is ) misunderstood .
Foursquare 's very much in the same boat as Twitter was two years ago .
The early adopters have started to drink the kool - aide , myself included , but for the most part it remains a service completely misunderstood , and even mocked from time to time .
But here 's the thing , it is starting to catch on and people are starting to sit up take notice , and actually use it .
Foursquare is one of the more practical location - based social networking applications , and it 's value can only truly be gleaned by actually using it .
Foursquare : What 's Different and What 's Next
I recently chatted with Dennis Crowley about the app , its current status , and where it 's headed .
We also talked about the space in general , and what really struck me was that Crowley has obviously discovered what most of us are still trying to figure out .
Plain and simple , other apps in the space are all about location and saying okay I 'm here .
As Crowley put it , " the point of the service is n't I 'm here , but I 'm here , so now what ? "
It 's the now what ?
part that really hits home too .
With Foursquare , your check-ins and activity actually mean something .
Here 's why :
The Game :
To those of you not playing , it may sound like a joke , but do n't knock it till you try it .
You earn points for every check - in — unless of course you check - in at the same locale all the time .
You 're rewarded with more points for being adventuresome ( exploring different parts of the city ) , for hitting up multiple spots in one night , and eventually for the tips other people try and the to - dos you complete .
Mayorship is key .
Should you check - in at the same location a few times , you 'll become the mayor of that spot , and though it sounds silly in theory , in practice it 's incredibly sticky .
Being mayor is pretty nifty , and you might find yourself trying to actively maintain your power , which is good for your game stats , good for the business , and great for creating competition amongst friends .
The stats themselves are also quite interesting .
On one level you 're competing against just your immediate circle of Foursquare friends , on another you 're competing against everyone in your city on a weekly basis .
The stats reset to zero on Sunday night so everyone , even the noobs , has a fair playing ground come Monday morning .
Tips and To - Dos : Another differentiating factor about Foursquare are tips and to - dos .
As a user , you can add tips to locales to tell your friends and the general public about the key things they need to know about a venue .
Say for example the local pizza place has a discount every Tuesday night , you 'd add that info into Foursquare , and then anyone nearby can see the tip and save it as a to - do to their personal check list .
Once your city sees an uptake in Foursquare users , you 'll find that the GPS - aware tips offer an incredibly useful way to find out about drink specials , dinner discounts , delectable desserts and the like .
Also , eventually you 'll be rewarded for points if others complete your tips as to - dos , and vice versa .
Twitter Tie -Ins :
Yes , almost every social savvy app and startup now how has some type of Twitter integration , but Foursquare has done it better .
You 'll have to figure out what works best for you , but you can optionally tweet out every check - in ( it 's not automatic , which you 'll find to be a great way to stay under the radar ) , you can optionally DM your Foursquare friends when you do check - in somewhere , and of course you can find your Twitter friends that are using Foursquare .
Here 's a sample real - life example of why this is a fantastic integration that really works to the advantage of the user .
Foursquare user Matt has a small circle of Foursquare friends , a pretty extensive Twitter network , and a propensity for sharing his location only when he wants to be found .
He uses his iPhone to check - in at the coffee shop down the street and he does n't want to be bothered , but he stills wants the points and potential mayorship .
He check - ins , decides to only share with his Foursquare friends , and remains solo .
Later in the week he 's attending a conference out of town and is interested in connecting with like - minded people .
This time when he checks - in , he 's already configured his settings to DM his Foursquare friends , and he decides to publicly update Twitter with the check - in as well .
He 's made himself available with little to no effort , and really has the opportunity to tap into and connect with his Twitter network .
Coming Soon :
In my candid chat with Dennis , he mentioned that 80 % of users are using the iPhone app , which is probably because they have n't developed any other apps , other than the mobile - friendly site , at this point .
That 's going to change .
The next stop on their immediate road map is a BlackBerry app .
As already alluded to above , you can expect the intricate gameplay to be complicated and improved by more rules and ways to earn points .
This means you 'll be rewarded conditionally based on different types of activities , and loyalty / engagement with the app .
Foursquare is also working on adding an events layer to the places and venues schema they have now .
This means that you can associate yourself with a book signing , concert , conference , or what have you , instead of just a place or venue .
They 've also got businesses on the brain , and they 'll be building in more features to make it possible for venues to get value out of the application .
Keep reading for more details on that below .
Foursquare for Vendors : Where Status Meets Opportunity
Foursquare is in a position to be a boon for businesses .
In the same way that savvy business owners can tap into the Yelp community to promote and encourage reviews , they can tap into Foursquare check - ins to get people talking about their establishment and rewarding them for their patronage .
As is , businesses in thriving Foursquare hubs like New York , San Francisco , and Los Angeles are already tapping into the potential that the location - based social game offers .
Take The Marsh cafe in San Francisco — now this is genius — they 've put up signs indicating that the Foursquare Mayor drinks for free .
Think about it .
The competition elements of the game mean that they 've just manufactured a social contest like no other .
They 'll get intense mayoral battles , which means more frequent check - ins , and a grip of free online exposure .
Since this side economy has already developed on its own , Foursquare is working on tools to allow venues to more easily offer special deals to those that check - in , including location mayors .
They want to be able to support the local business economy with tools and tracking , and in turn find a formidable business model that they can take to the bank themselves .

The popular British comic icon , Stephen Fry , shocked some of the attendants at last night ’s iTunes ( Apple ) Live event when he admitted to using his broadband ISP connection to download music and TV shows illegally via BitTorrent file sharing ( P2P ) networks .
He then promptly criticised the creative industry for trying to criminalise those who do it purely for personal consumption .
The event , which was held at Camden 's Roundhouse venue , has seen some interesting moments in the past but this was certainly more interesting than most .
However Fry did criticise those who downloaded illegally on an " " , but warned that making examples of " " was stupid .
Fry did n't stop there though ; he also slammed the recent Digital Britain report for representing too many industry views , as opposed to those of the general public .
He then criticised the industry he worked in for being a " " and " " .
He added that most people probably do feel guilty about downloading something illegally .
The remarks , which should soon be made available via a free podcast on the Apple iTunes store , are likely to cause a mix of opinions .
For the record , Fry downloaded episodes of 24 and the season finale of House , the latter of which he also downloaded legally too .
Increasingly in the modern world , everything is being connected to a network .
Even parking meters that were once just purely mechanical devices are now connected .
For IT security researchers , anything that is connected to a network is a potential target for research  even the lowly parking meter .
Security researcher Joe Grand has taken a particular interest in the new generation of smart parking meters .
He sees various angles where the parking meters could potentially be at risk from security issues and he wants to help make the system better for everyone .
Grand has not yet divulged the full details of how parking meters might be at risk , but he plans on delivering a session at the upcoming Black Hat security conference this summer .
In a live preview Webcast , Grand provided an overview why parking meters are interesting from a security point of view and why we should all care .
" Why parking meters ?
It 's a combination of everything , software , hardware , network connectivity and it's a physical real application used all over the world , " Grand said .
" They 're taken for granted .
It 's just a big metal box in the ground where you shove your money into it , get your parking and you walk away . "
Grand added that most parking meter users do n't think about the financial risks and the social implications of the parking meters if there was to be security breach against them .
In 2003 , San Francisco replaced 23,000 mechanical meters with new smart parking meters at a cost of $ 35 million .
Grand noted that other major cities in the US and around the world have also adopted a new generation of smart parking meters .
These meters provide smart card capabilities , can take credit cards in some cases , have display screens and are usually networked .
From a security point of view , there are multiple angles to examine on a parking meter .
With smart card meters where there are cards that are loaded with dollar values , those cards could potentially be reset or reloaded .
Some meters also take credit cards and that information might be stored on the meter where an attacker could potentially grab the information .
In some cities , the meters are connected by wireless networks while in other cases they can be accessed by way of an infrared wireless device .
Grand noted that meters could potentially be reset to give free parking  or on the other side to expire parking for a valid spot .
Smart meters also often have LCD screens which Grand commented could hypothetically be used by a hacker to transmit messages .
Black
Hat presentations have been the subject of vendor scrutiny in the past , with multiple incidents over the years where presentation were blocked before the researcher could deliver the presentation .
In 2008 , at the Defcon conference which immediately follows Black Hat , researchers were blocked from presenting their research into issues with the Boston subway / Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ( MBTA ) system fare system .
In 2005 , Cisco tried to get a presentation pulled that exposed flaws in its equipment .
" Even if you do n't care about parking meters at all , we go through the standard hardware hacking process and you kinda learn the mentality of breaking hardware and that 's what I want people to really take away from the presentation , " Grand said .
Grand noted that the purpose of his presentation is not to show people how to get free parking or break the law .
" The whole educational aspect is our goal , " Grand said .
" We 're trying to do everything we can in a way where we can educate people and not harm companies .
We need to educate designers and implementers of these systems and let them know about problems .
If I 'm giving a public presentation at Black Hat , I can guarantee to you that there are already people out there that that already know about the problems and are taking advantage of them . "
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Bernard Madoff , the financier convicted for Wall Street ’s biggest investment fraud , was surprised his $ 65 billion Ponzi scheme was not uncovered sooner , he said in his first interview since entering prison .

Madoff , the disgraced 71 - year - old Wall Streeter who drew 150 years ’ prison time for the fraud , expressed remorse and talked candidly to a pair of lawyers suing him on behalf of investors , according to news reports of their jailhouse meeting on Tuesday .
San Francisco attorneys Joseph Cotchett and Nancy Fineman met with Madoff at the North Carolina prison where he was taken two weeks ago after pleading guilty , the Associated Press and ABC News reported on Tuesday .
“ There were several times that I met with the SEC and thought ‘ they got me , ’ ” Madoff told Cotchett and Fineman , according to abc news.com .
The Securities and Exchange Commission is now conducting an in - depth review of how they missed the fraud , drawing intense criticism .
The results of their investigation are expected to be released in weeks .
Cotchett and Fineman represent about a dozen investors who lost money in Madoff ’s decades - long scheme , an unprecedented global scam for which Madoff eventually pleaded guilty to laundering , securities fraud and perjury .
“ It was an extraordinary visit .
He was very candid , very open , and answered every one of our questions , ” Cotchett said of the 4 - 1/2 - hour meeting .
He was “ very remorseful ” but looked healthy and appeared to be working out , Cotchett told the news outlets .
“ I think he ’s not too happy to be where he is but he ’s certainly not complaining , ” said Cotchett , who set up the interview through Madoff ’s attorneys .
The visiting attorneys said they planned to use what they learned at the meeting in a lawsuit to be filed this week in Manhattan against Madoff and his brother , Peter Madoff , who acted as chief compliance officer , and potentially officers at some of the feeder funds that worked with Madoff , according to the reports .
Madoff said he believed securities investigators had found all the money that could have been recovered , Cotchett said in the news reports .
“ But it might be in many different venues , and by that I mean I do n’t think that Bernie knows where all the money is ” because some was paid out to feeder funds , Cotchett said .
Madoff agreed to speak with Cotchett after the lawyer threatened to sue his wife , Ruth , abc news.com reported .
“ He cares about Ruth , ” Cotchett said .
everyone loves a bargain , as long as we believe it ’s in good taste .
And nobody does low - price , high - style better than IKEA , the world ’s largest furniture retailer .
IKEA passes as the anti-Wal - Mart : a company where value and good values coexist .
It uses design as a proxy for quality , and its brand — embodied by all those smiling , white - teethed Scandinavians standing next to smooth , shiny modular furniture with unpronounceable names — as a passport to a guilt - free world of low prices .
But put down your 59 - cent Färgrik coffee mug and ask yourself :
Can we afford to keep shopping at places where an item ’s price reflects only a fraction of its societal costs ?
IKEA designs to price , challenging its talented European team to create ever - cheaper objects , and its suppliers — most of them in low - wage countries in Asia and eastern Europe — to squeeze out the lowest possible price .
By some measures the world ’s third - largest wood consumer , IKEA proudly employs 15 “ forestry monitors . ”
Eight of them work in China and Russia , but illegal logging is widespread in those vast countries , making it impossible to guarantee that all wood is legally harvested .
( The company declines to pay a premium to ensure that all timber is legally harvested , citing costs that would be passed along to the consumer . )
IKEA furniture made of particleboard and pine is not meant to last a lifetime ; indeed , some professional movers decline to guarantee its safe transport .
But to be fair , creating heirlooms is not IKEA ’s goal .
Nor , despite a lot of self - serving hoopla , is energy conservation : the company boasts of illuminating its stores with low - wattage lightbulbs but positions outlets far from city centers , where taxes are low and commuting costs high — the average IKEA customer drives 50 miles round - trip .
Cleverly , IKEA transfers transport and energy costs onto consumers , who are then handed the additional burden of assembling their purchases .
Designed but not crafted , IKEA bookcases and chairs , like most cheap objects , resist involvement : when they break or malfunction , we tend not to fix them .
Rather , we buy new ones .
Wig Zamore , a Massachusetts environmental activist who was recently recognized for his work by the Environmental Protection Agency , is working with IKEA and supports some of the company ’s regional green initiatives .
But as he put it , “ IKEA is the least sustainable retailer on the planet . ”
And in real costs — the kind that will burden our grandchildren — that also makes it among the most expensive .

A Pokersource Poker - Eval Primer
Pokersource Poker - Eval , the open - source poker hand evaluation library , takes a lot of flack for being “ low - level ” .
In The Great Poker Hand Evaluator Roundup , I wrote :
The Poker - Eval library is implemented in highly optimized , heavily macro’d C for unadulterated speed , but language mappings for .
NET , Java , and Python are provided .
Now , I ’ll be honest .
The first time I saw the poker - eval source code , I immediately unlearned about sixty - two months of best - practices software development …
That statement was a little tongue - in - cheek , but still : it seems like every time someone suggests Pokersource Poker - Eval , a disclaimer immediately follows :
Do n’t use this library unless you ’re a competent C programmer !
Danger , Will Robinson !
Just the other day , for example , I was looking at poker - related questions on Stack Overflow when I came across this : How Do I Programatically Calculate Poker Odds ?
Hello , I ’m trying to write a simple game / utility to calculate poker odds .
I know there ’s plenty of resources that talk about the formulas to do so , but I guess I ’m having trouble translating that to code .
Particularly , I ’m interested in Texas Hold -em … I understand that there are several different approaches , one being that you can calculate the odds that you will draw some hand based on the cards you can see .
The other approach is calculating the odds that you will win a certain hand .
The second approach seems much more complex as you ’d have to enter more data ( how many players , etc . )
I ’m not asking that you write it for me , but some nudges in the right direction would help
One of the answers suggested using Pokersource :
Take a look at pokersource if you have reasonably strong C abilities .
It ’s not simple , I ’m afraid , but some of the things you ’re looking for are complex .
The poker - eval program that uses the library will probably do much of what you want if you can get the input format correct ( not easy either ) .
Sites such as this one or this also use this library AFAIK .
Still , it could be worse , you could be wanting to calculate something tricky like Omaha Hi-lo …
Again with the disclaimer !
And it occurred to me : you know what ?
All this FUD is really kind of bogus .
As of this writing , Pokersource is still the best and most complete library of publically available poker - related code in the world .
Period .
What ’s more : the Pokersource evaluator is extremely easy to use provided you understand the Pokersource way of doing things .
So I thought , why not put together a brief Pokersource Poker - Eval primer ?
The Basics : Pokersource Grammar
The Pokersource evaluator represents a collection of N cards as a sequence of 52 bits , one bit for each card in the deck .
This structure is called a mask and in code it ’s represented by the StdDeck_CardMask type .
A single StdDeck_CardMask value can store a single card , an entire N - card poker hand , or any other arbitrary collection of between 0 and 52 cards .
Typically , StdDeck_CardMask values will be used to store player hands , board cards , and / or dead cards :
StdDeck_CardMask player1 , player2 , player3 ;
StdDeck_CardMask boardCards ;
Pokersource also allows a card to be addressed / identified by index — as an integer between 0 and 51 .
A given card index can be converted to an StdDeck_CardMask by using the StdDeck_MASK macro :
StdDeck_CardMask the Card = StdDeck_MASK ( cardIndex ) ;
You can clear a given Pokersource mask ( removing all cards from the mask ) via the StdDeck_CardMask_RESET
macro .
It ’s a good idea to do this before using the mask ( similar to initializing a numeric variable to 0 ) .
StdDeck_CardMask hand ;
StdDeck_CardMask_RESET
( hand ) ;
You can combine Pokersource masks together to create a single mask containing all cards from both masks by using the StdDeck_CardMask_OR macro .
StdDeck_CardMask player1HoleCards = /* some value */
StdDeck_CardMask the Board = /* some value */
StdDeck_CardMask combinedHand ;
StdDeck_CardMask_OR ( combinedHand , player1HoleCards , the Board ) ;
Since a single StdDeck_CardMask can “ contain ” between 0 and 52 cards , sometimes it ’s helpful to be able to count the cards present in a particular mask .
For this , you can use the StdDeck_numCards macro :
StdDeck_CardMask arbitraryCollectionOfCards = /* some value */
int cardCount = StdDeck_numCards ( arbitraryCollectionOfCards ) ;
Now you might be wondering : can the Pokersource evaluator handle text ?
The answer is yes .
You can convert a textual description of a card ( such as “ Ah ” or “ 2 d ” ) into the proper index value by using the StdDeck_stringToCard macro :
int cardIndex = - 1 ;
StdDeck_stringToCard ( “ Ah ” , & cardIndex ) ;
Which means that you can convert a textual description of a card into its corresponding mask value by using StdDeck_stringToCard followed by StdDeck_MASK :
int cardIndex = - 1 ;
StdDeck_stringToCard ( “ Ah ” , & cardIndex ) ;
StdDeck_CardMask the Card = StdDeck_MASK ( cardIndex ) ;
This , of course , can be generalized to a function allowing you to convert text representing any number of cards into a single StdDeck_CardMask value :
( const char * strHand )
{
StdDeck_CardMask the Hand , the Card ;
StdDeck_CardMask_RESET
( the Hand ) ; StdDeck_CardMask TextToPokerEvalstrHandStdDeck_CardMask the Hand , the CardStdDeck_CardMask_RESETtheHand if ( strHand && strlen( strHand ) )
{
int cardIndex = - 1 ;
char * curCard = const_cast < char *>( strHand ) ; while ( * curCard )
{
// Take the card text and convert it to an index ( 0..51 )
StdDeck_stringToCard(curCard , & cardIndex ) ;
// Convert the card index to a mask
the Card = StdDeck_MASK( cardIndex ) ;
// Add the card ( mask ) to the hand
StdDeck_CardMask_OR( theHand , the Hand , the Card ) ;
// Advance to the next card ( if any )
curCard += 2 ;
}
} return the Hand ;
}
Going in the opposite direction , we can convert a Pokersource mask value to text by using the StdDeck_maskString and StdDeck_maskToString macros .
The difference is that StdDeck_maskString manages the memory for the string internally , whereas StdDeck_maskToString copies the text to a user - supplied string buffer .
StdDeck_CardMask hand = /* some player hand */
char * hand = StdDeck_maskString ( hand ) ;
Similarly , we can take a card index and get a text value representing that card using the StdDeck_cardToString macro :
char cardText [ 3 ] ;
int cardIndex = /* some card index */
StdDeck_cardToString ( cardIndex , cardText ) ;
Another popular way of representing card values is as a combination of rank and suit .
Pokersource allows you to create an StdDeck_CardMask value for a specific card by specifying its rank and suit in the StdDeck_MAKE_CARD macro , which returns the card ’s index :
int cardIndex = StdDeck_MAKE_CARD
( someRankValue , someSuitValue ) ;
StdDeck_CardMask = StdDeck_MASK ( cardIndex ) ;
Note that Pokersource has a specific numeric definition of each card rank :
#define StdDeck_Rank_2 0
#define StdDeck_Rank_3 1
#define StdDeck_Rank_4 2
#define StdDeck_Rank_5 3
#define StdDeck_Rank_6 4
#define StdDeck_Rank_7 5
#define StdDeck_Rank_8 6
#define StdDeck_Rank_9 7
# define StdDeck_Rank_TEN
8
# define StdDeck_Rank_JACK
9
# define StdDeck_Rank_QUEEN
10
#define StdDeck_Rank_KING
11
#define StdDeck_Rank_ACE
12
# define StdDeck_Rank_COUNT
13
# define StdDeck_Rank_FIRST
StdDeck_Rank_2
# define StdDeck_Rank_LAST
StdDeck_Rank_ACE
As well as each suit .
Pokersource bucks convention here by ordering suits Hearts - Diamonds - Clubs - Spades rather than Clubs - Diamonds - Hearts - Spades but it does n’t really matter .
# define StdDeck_Suit_HEARTS
0
# define StdDeck_Suit_DIAMONDS
1
#define StdDeck_Suit_CLUBS
2
#define StdDeck_Suit_SPADES
3
# define StdDeck_Suit_FIRST
StdDeck_Suit_HEARTS
#define StdDeck_Suit_LAST
StdDeck_Suit_SPADES
Evaluating Hands with Pokersource
Pokersource Poker - Eval is , first and foremost , a hand evaluator .
It takes a given N - card poker hand and returns a number which can be compared with the number returned for other hands to determine the winner .
There are two evaluation macros you ’ll typically use :
StdDeck_StdRules_EVAL_N
.
The full evaluator .
.
The full evaluator .
StdDeck_StdRules_EVAL_TYPE .
A pared - down evaluator which returns only the hand category ( e.g. , Full House , Quads , One Pair , etc . )
So in order to determine the winner in a game of Texas Hold ’em where Player 1 has “ AhAd ” and Player 2 has “ KcKs ” on a board of “ 2d4c4sKh9d ” , you ’ll write code similar to this :
// Say we start with something like this …
StdDeck_CardMask player1 = TextToPokerEval ( “ AhAd ” ) ;
StdDeck_CardMask player2 = TextToPokerEval ( “ KcKs ” ) ;
StdDeck_CardMask the Board = TextToPokerEval ( “ 2d4c4sKh9d ” ) ; StdDeck_CardMask player1TextToPokerEvalStdDeck_CardMask player2TextToPokerEvalStdDeck_CardMask theBoardTextToPokerEval //
Get each player ’s full 7 - card hand into his mask
StdDeck_CardMask_OR( player1 , player1 , the Board ) ;
StdDeck_CardMask_OR( player2 , player2 , the Board ) ; //
Evaluate each player ’s hand
int player1 Val = StdDeck_StdRules_EVAL_N( player1 , 7 ) ;
int player2Val = StdDeck_StdRules_EVAL_N( player2 , 7 ) ; if ( player1 Val > player2Val )
;// Player 1 wins .
Do something .
else if ( player1Val < player2Val )
;// Player 2 wins .
Do something .
else
;// Tie .
Do something .
Using the StdDeck_StdRules_EVAL_TYPE
evaluator is exactly the same , except the value returned is an integer representing the category of the hand .
That ’s literally all there is to it .
Monte Carlo and Exhaustive Enumeration with Pokersource
It ’s a little - known fact , but Pokersource ships with built - in support for both Monte Carlo simulation and Exhaustive Enumeration .
In fact , we can leverage the Pokersource enumeration library to build a full - fledged poker calculator with support for multiple opponents with arbitrary hand ranges or distributions .
Pokersource provides Monte Carlo and Exhaustive Enumeration functionality through the following macros , all of which live in the enumerate.h header file .
DECK_ENUMERATE_x_CARDS
DECK_ENUMERATE_x_CARDS_D
DECK_MONTECARLO_N_CARDS_D
DECK_ENUMERATE_COMBINATIONS_D
DECK_ENUMERATE_PERMUTATIONS_D
DECK_MONTECARLO_PERMUTATIONS_D
Using these macros is extremely simple provided you understand the format .
Basically , each macro is going to “ visit ” or “ generate ” certain cards , repeatedly , using either exhaustive enumeration or Monte Carlo .
For each set of visited / generated cards , the macro is going to execute a piece of arbitrary code provided by you .
This will be clearer if we look at some source code .
Here ’s how you ’d calculate the equity of a typical preflop matchup …
Player 1 : [ Ah Ac ]
Player 2 : [ Kh Kc ]
…using exhaustive enumeration of all possible outcomes .
void calculateHoldemMatchup
{
// Create player hands …
StdDeck_CardMask player1 = CardConverter :: TextToPokerEval ( “ AhAc ” ) ;
StdDeck_CardMask player2 = CardConverter :: TextToPokerEval ( “ KhKc ” ) ;
StdDeck_CardMask boardCards ; calculateHoldemMatchupStdDeck_CardMask player1CardConverterStdDeck_CardMask player2CardConverterStdDeck_CardMask boardCards //
Add player cards to “ dead ” or “ used ” cards
StdDeck_CardMask usedCards ;
StdDeck_CardMask_OR(usedCards , player1 , player2 ) ; //
Create an array to tally wins
double wins [ 2 ] = { 0.0 } ;
int numberOfTrials = 0 ; // Enumerate all possible 5 - card boards , excluding boards which
// contain one or more player hole cards .
This will call ‘ evalSingleTrial ’
// once for each unique board .
DECK_ENUMERATE_5_CARDS_D(
StdDeck , boardCards , usedCards ,
evalSingleTrial ( player1 , player2 , boardCards , wins , numberOfTrials ) ; ) ; //
Convert each player ’s win tally to equity ..
double player1 Equity = ( wins [ 0 ] / numberOfTrials ) * 100.0 ;
double player2 Equity = ( wins [ 1 ] / numberOfTrials ) * 100.0 ; // Results :
// Player 1 : 82.64 %
// Player 2 : 17.26 %
} void evalSingleTrial( StdDeck_CardMask player1 , StdDeck_CardMask player2 ,
StdDeck_CardMask board , double wins [ ] , int& numberOfTrials )
{
// Combine each player ’s hole cards with the 5 - card board
StdDeck_CardMask_OR( player1 , player1 , board ) ;
StdDeck_CardMask_OR( player2 , player2 , board ) ; //
Evaluate each player ’s hand
int p1Val = StdDeck_StdRules_EVAL_N( player1 , 7 ) ;
int p2Val = StdDeck_StdRules_EVAL_N( player2 , 7 ) ; // Tally wins
if ( p1Val > p2Val )
wins [ 0 ] += 1.0 ;
else if ( p1Val < p2Val )
wins [ 1 ] += 1.0 ;
else
{
wins [ 0 ] += 0.5 ;
wins [ 1 ] += 0.5 ;
} numberOfTrials ++;
}
The above code exhaustively enumerates all 1,712,304 possible outcomes ( the number of unique 5 - card boards that can be drawn from the 48 remaining cards in the deck ) and runs the evaluator for each , tallying per-player wins which are then converted into percentage equities .
If you wanted to use Monte Carlo instead , you ’d use DECK_MONTECARLO_N_CARDS_D .
The other enumeration macros all have this same structure : you tell Pokersource what you want enumerated or randomly sampled , and it does the grunt work , executing your user - provided code once for each enumerated / sampled outcome .
The ability to generically enumerate / randomly sample specific subsets of cards in the presence of dead cards is enough firepower to build a full - fledged poker calculator such as the one we built in Multiway Isometric Ranged Equity Calculation in Poker , Part 1 .
And yet this post has really only scratched the surface of what is possible with Pokersource .
We have n’t discussed Pokersource ’s support for other poker variants ( Omaha , Stud , etc. ) , or how the Pokersource evaluator can be extended to support still other variants .
In conclusion , when looking for poker evaluation / calculation code , Pokersource should always be your first stop .
I ’m not saying it ’s always the right library for the job , but you wo n’t find another publically available library that has equivalent functionality .
I encourage you to explore the Pokersource library and who knows , perhaps join the Pokersource email distribution list and say hello to Loic Dachary , Michael Maurer , and some of the other maintainers .
Long live Pokersource !

* Behind the Tribute *
It is with GREAT pleasure that I present to you this collection of Wesley Willis covers .
For many , this has been a long trip completed within a short period of time .
Each contributing artist was given the task of taking their Wesley track of choice and putting a whole new spin to it !
The goal now ( as it has always been ) was to honor Wesley by showing the world that people from different musical backgrounds listen to his music and words .
I 'm confident and proud in the work that each of the artists have done .
Many were careful to mold their track just right as they wanted to do something that would n't disgrace the Wesley name .
And it is my firm opinion , that each artist has succeeded in doing this .
" Thanks " deserve to go all around .
First off , thanks to Wesley ; he was one cool dude that broke new ground in rock n roll , punk , and music in general !
Next , thanks to the heart and soul of this project : the artists ; mad props go out to them because without them , there would n't be this tribute album .
Then there 's Tom Gordon and Loren Hill ; Loren was essential in referring many of the bands , and Tom not only recorded quite a number of the contributors , but he also mastered the tracks .
Of course , the Internet Archive can't be forgotten either : they were kind enough to host all the MP3 files !
Finally , thanks go out to all the people who helped out in other ways : creating buddy icons , flyers , spreading the word , and more .
Now , sit back , click on an MP3 , and enjoy the tunes !
Thanks ,
Hiji

The Masuda family and R.C. Hoiles Share
This :
The Masuda family did not have to wait a day to realize the full impact of Pearl Habor upon their lives .
On the evening of December 7th , Gensuke ( George ) and Tamae Masuda were at their farmhouse in Talbert , Orange County , California when there was a knock on the door .
At that time , Orange County was an agricultural area with the soil constituting its wealth .
According to a 1940 census , the Japanese - American community comprised 1,855 people , most of whom were engaged in farming .
Many were Issei â€ “ first generation Japanese who had immigranted .
Gensuke had arrive in America in 1898 to work on a railroad in Oregon and , then , he moved to Talbert where he leased 200 acres and eventually purchased 10 more ; his 5 sons and 4 daughters farmed the land as a family .
Sheriff deputies were the ones who knocked .
Without explanation , they took Gensuke and loaded him onto a bus with other Issei .
Ten days later -- without trial , legal representation or right of appeal -- Gensuke was accused of â€œsubversive activityâ€ and incarcerated in a stockade at Ft. Missoula , Montana .
The authorities refused to state specific reasons for the accusation but there was a general fear that a Japanese invasion of the West Coast was imminent and would be assisted by resident Japanese citizens , such as Gensuke .
The news of his father 's imprisonment incensed Kazuo , who had not been present at the farmhouse with other family members .
On October 17 , he and his brother Takashi had boarded a train to report for military duty at their respective basic training camps .
Through the proper authorities at Fort Ord , Kazuo Masuda ( Pvt. 39,166,362 ) wrote a letter to Washington D.C. in which he professed his father 's allegiance to America .
He wrote , in part ,
â€ œI cannot believe my father has done any act of disloyalty toward the United States .
He has been a resident of this country for over 40 years , that is to say since 1898 .
He has been a farmer for over 35 years During this time he has seen his sons and daughters grow into good , solid American citizens ....
He has , in my opinion , maintained during his 44 years of residence in this country a perfect record of unquestionable loyalty to this country .
He has never been arrested for any violations of the laws of this country .
That he would commit acts which endanger the safety of this country is unthinkable ....
In all the 23 years I have lived with my father , he has never uttered a single word against the United States .
He has always considered this nation his country , and I believe he has done his part in making it the great nation that we are .
He did not , as so many others have done , send any of his children to Japan for any part of their education .
He wanted his children to be Americans .
I know that he has succeed in his wish .
He has often expressed hope that he would be able to spend the remainder of his life in the United States.â€ 
Kazuo's letter is credited for Gensuke 's early release , at which time joined Tamae and the family in Fresno where they had retreated to live with a relative for safety .
It would be short - lived .
On February 19 , 1942 , Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 that gave the War Department authority at their sole discretion to exclude any â€œpersonsâ€ from prescribed areas , including much of the West Coast .
The Order was the basis of a campaign of relocation and mass detention aimed at both Issei and Nisei .
In October 1942 , the Masuda family joined thousands of other Japanese - Americans at the Fresno County Fairgrounds where they were ordered to assemble .
They were held 56 days before being loaded onto trains for the five - day trip to the Jerome Relocation Center , a 10,000 acre internment camp that stretched over three southern Arkansas counties .
Thus , the Masuda family joined over 110,000 japanese - Americans who involuntarily left their homes and businesses to be interned behind barbed wire by the War Relocation authority ( WRA ) in ten primitive ' relocation ' centers in Colorado , California , Wyoming , Utah , Arkansas , Idaho and Arizona .
The vast majority of the internees were American citizens ; their detention lasted three years , from 1942 to 1945 .
During the upheaval what did the major newspapers say ?
Next to no one spoke out against the massive violation of civil liberties , especially no one on the West Coast .
A March 6 , 1942 editorial in the San Francisco News was typical in arguing : " Japanese leaders in California who are counseling their people , both aliens and native - born , to cooperate with the Army in carrying out the evacuation plans are , in effect , offering the best possible way for all Japanese to demonstrate their loyalty to the United States . "
The feisty libertarian R.C. Hoiles was a rare exception .
On Feb. 5 , before the internment order was announced , Hoiles declared in the Orange County Register : " The recommendation of the grand jury to have all alien enemies removed from Orange County calls for a difficult undertaking .
Every bit of wealth that these workers are prevented from creating , which we so badly need during the war , will have to be created by the labor of some other worker .
" Of course , there is no such thing as absolute security .
We must run some risks in every move .
Risks are life itself .
It would seem that we should not become too skeptical of the loyalty of those people who were born in a foreign country and have lived in the country as good citizens for many years .
It is very hard to believe that they are dangerous . "
As the internments became law , Hoiles became more aggressive in his defense of Japanese - Americans ;
In an October 14th column , again in the Register , Hoiles called the evacuations â€œunconstitutionalâ€ and an error â€œwe should make every effort possible to correct ... as rapidly as possible .â€ 
He argued that â€œconvicting people of disloyalty to our country without having specific evidence against them is too foreign to our way of life and too close akin to the kind of government we are fighting .... We cannot help but believe that we would shorten the war and lose fewer lives and less property if we would rescind the order and let the Japanese return and go to work , until such time as we have reason to suspect any individuals of being guilty of being disloyal to America.â€ 
Meanwhile , Kazuo experienced his own personal battles in the military .
Although he ranked first in Morse code classes , the Signal Corps rejected him and he was offered , instead , work as a gardener .
When the 442nd Infantry Regiment was formed at Camp Shelby , Mississippi , Kazuo quickly joined and rose to the rank of Staff Sargeant .
The 442nd was formed in early February 1943 to establish an all Japanese - American combat unit .
It subsequently became known as the â€œGo for Broke Regimentâ€ because of its extreme valor .
The book â€ œHonor By Fireâ€ by Lyn Crost -- the definitive work on the 442nd â€ “ explains that it was the most decorated unit of its size and length of service in U.S. military history .
Crost reported that it was collectively awarded 18,143 decorations , including 9,486 Purple Hearts .
On furlough , before going into active battle in Italy , Kazuo visited his family in block 15 - 03 - D in Jerome .
Thereafter the Masudas were moved to the Gila River Relocation Center , in the hot Arizona desert .
There they would stay in block 49 - 11 - D of Butte , the larger of the two camps at Gila until their release in the summer of 1945 .
It was at Gila that Tamae received a Western Union telegram from the War Department in which her name was misspelled .
â€ œThe Secretary of War desires me to express his deep regret that your son Staff Sgt. Kazuo Masuda was killed in action on 27th August in Italy .
Letter follows.â€ Kazuo was 25 - years - old .
The subsequent one - page letter offered little additional information , claiming that â€œreports of this nature contain only the briefest details as they are prepared under battle conditions and the means of transmission are limited .â€ 
An article in the â€ œFifth Army Newsâ€ filled in the blanks when it reported on Kazuo being posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism in action .
He had already received the European Theater Ribbon with a battle star , the Combat Infantryman Badge , the American Defense Ribbon and the Good Conduct Medal ; he would later be awarded a Purple Heart .
The article read , in part ,
â€ œWhile the 442nd was attached to the 34th â€ œRed Bullâ€ Division , Masuda was operating from a forward observation post but enemy shells cut communication lines , makng the OP useless .
Unwilling to risk the lives of members of his mortar crew , he obtained a mortar tube , 20 rounds of ammunition and an extra helmet .
With his load , Masuda walked 200 yards through enemy fire .
â€ œUsing the helmet packed with dirt as a baseplate , he went into action when the enemy attacked , firing all 20 rounds and repulsing the Germans .
The Nazis location his position and subjected him to an intense mortar and artillery fire but Masuda held his ground , returning to his line for more ammunition .
His fire was so effective , another attack did not even threaten the company line .
In the action in which he subsequently was killed , Masuda crawled ahead of his men when they heard noises .
He discovered himself only five yards from the enemy .
Firing his submachine gun , Masuda called to his men to withdraw .
They , thinking he was following , retired .
Next day , they found Masuda dead , with his sub - machine gun in his hands and facing the enemy , lying over a dead German machine pistol operator.â€ 
At Gila , the Masudas held a Buddhist memorial which was rendered all the more significance by the fact that another son , Masao , was due to report for duty .
In early May , 1945 , Mary Masuda was granted permission to travel to Talbert in order to prepare the way for her parent 's return to the farm .
Her return was not welcome by all .
Nor was the hostility she experienced an isolated event .
In reporting the threats against Mary , the Utah Nippoâ€ ( Salt lake City ) stated on May 18 , 1945 , â€ œThe new incidents are in addition to 15 shooting attacks , one attempted dynamiting , three arson cases , and five threatening visits ... in California in the last four months.â€ 
Why was there such hostility toward returnees ?
One reason was economic .
Secretary of Interior Harold L. Ickes explained , is quoted as saying , â€ The hoodlums grow more desperate in their lawlessness as some of them see that they will not be able to establish an economic beachhead on the property of the evacuees they vainly hoped would sell out or run out.â€ 
Mary discovered that someone , without paying rent or receiving authorization , had farmed the Masuda land and lived in their home .
On the first evening of her return , she was ' visited ' by five men who threatened her with bodily harm if she did leave town ; the Gila News - Courier ( May 15 , 1945 ) identified the men as â€œseveral Orange County farmers.â€ 
When Mary reported the incident to the police , she was told that nothing could be done about it .
Several days later , he changed his mind .
The sheriff changed his mind several days later due to both public and official pressure .
R.C. Hoiles spearheaded the public pressure by featuring a photo of Mary and Masao on the front page of the then - Santa Ana Register ( now the Orange County Register ) .
He also published lengthy commentaries by Mary , as well as columns defending the returnees and their property rights .
On June 6th , in a letter - to - editor , Mary expressed her gratitude to Hoiles .
â€œThis letter should have been written long ago and I hope you will forgive me for my negligence , â€ she wrote .
â€œThe fine publicity of my incident , along with the large picture of Masao and myself appearing in the front page of your newspaper was indeed a great honor and I am deeply grateful to you ....
It is truly gratifying to know that an influential concern as your newspaper is standing by the minority group , for the democratic principles so that our gallant men who are giving their supreme sacrifices are not dying in vain.â€ 
The official pressure came from government officials , especially from within the War Department and WRA , who saw the postwar wisdom of reversing the hostility toward Japanese - Americans which they had been instrumental in creating .
Whereas Hoiles publicized the injustice being done to returnees without fanfare , those with more political motives trumpeted the Masuda case .
On December 8th , Four Star General Joseph W. Stilwell , accompanied by General Arthur E. Easterbrook , took the unprecedented step of flying 3,000 miles from Washington , D.C. to visit the Masuda farm which had been returned to the family .
There he presented Mary with a Purple Heart on behalf of Kazuo .
Usually such medals are presented by the highest ranking officer in the area at the nearest army installation ; traditionally , the medal is given to a parent , both of whom attended the December 8th ceremony .
Arguably , however , Mary was the more press worthy family member due to her earlier news coverage .
A December 10th press release from the WRA declared of the ceremony , â€ œThere were four newsreel companies there ; two broadcasting networks ; and many reporters and photographers .
General Stilwell in a history - making little drama of modern democracy walked up to the weather - beaten front porch of the Masuda home and pinned the D.S.C. on Mary Masuda.â€  Life Magazine memorialized the moment .
Thereafter , Stilwell and Mary proceeded to a ' United America ' rally at the Santa Ana Municipal Bowl to attend a political rally that included Hollywood celebrities .
Introduced by Will Rogers , Stilwell declared , â€ œWho , after all , is the real American ?
The real American is the man who calls it a fair exchange to law down his life in order that American ideals may go on living .
And judging by such a test , Sgt. Masuda was a better American than any of us here today .
â€
Actor and army captain Ronald Reagan spoke on behalf of the American Veterans Committee .
Mary also addressed the crowd .
In 1948 , Kazuo 's body was brought home from Italy for burial in Westminster Memorial Park , Orange County .
But the controversy over his Nisei status did not end with death .
A November 20 , 1948 headline in the â€œCitizenâ€ read , â€ œHome Town Cemetery Bars Burial of Nisei War Hero.â€ 
The article explained that Kazuo could not be buried in a â€œdesirableâ€ plot with trees and lawns because of a restrictive covenant against those of Japanese ancestry .
Due to intervention by Gen. Mark Clark under whom Kazuo had fought , the cemetery relented .
Kazuo was buried in a â€œdesirableâ€ plot with full military honors .
His grave became a gathering point for annual ceremonies honoring Nisei veterans who died in the war .
In 1957 , the Kazuo Masuda Memorial VFW Post 3670 was founded in Orange County .
On December 17 , 1975 , the Kazuo Masuda School was dedicated and became the first American public school named for a Nisei .
In a public ceremony in November 2005 , Mas Masuda thanked R.C. Hoiles on behalf of his family , stating , " We are very grateful for what he did.â€ 
What R.C. Hoiles did was to speak out against an injustice that had overwhelming public support .
After the war , it became popular and politic to defend the Nisei .
But Hoiles spoke when it counted most -- while the injustice was happening .
He did not act in self - promotion or to erase a mistake ; he spoke out of simple decency .
When the Nisei veterans returned from Italy in July 1946 , President Harry S. Truman stated , â€ œYou fought not only the enemy , but you fought prejudice â€ “ and you have won.â€ 
Three years earlier , in a letter sent to Mary while she was in a detention camp , Kazuo wrote , â€ œI 'll be alright wherever I may be .
I can take care of myself .
Of course , no one likes this war , no one likes to fight and die if he does n't have to , but it is much easier if one know what he is in here for .
Myself and the rest of the Combat Team , I believe , know for what he fights .
It is for us , our future in America ....
Of course , we have n't been treated exactly fair , we 've been kicked around .
We know that .
But we can take it on the chin and come up fighting and we will win out in the end .â€ 

The tale begins abruptly on the morning of Sunday , December 7th , 1941 .
In a speech delivered at 12:30 p .m. the next day , President Franklin D. Roosevelt called the 7th " a date which will live in infamy " .
He referred to a surprise aerial attack by the Japanese against the American naval base at Pearl Habor , Hawaii , which crippled the U.S. fleet .
At the time of the attack , World War II had been raging for over two years .
Although America was clearly supportive of the Allies ( initially the United Kingdom and France ) against the Axis Powers ( initially Germany , Italy and Japan ) , the U.S. had not entered the war and there was significant domestic resistance to doing so .
Within an hour of the President 's speech , however , Congress formally declared war against Japan ; on 11th December 1941 , Germany responded by declaring war on the US .
The Masuda family did not have to wait a day to realize the full impact of Pearl Habor upon their lives .
On the evening of December 7th , Gensuke ( George ) and Tamae Masuda were at their farmhouse in Talbert , Orange County , California when there was a knock on the door .
At that time , Orange County was an agricultural area with the soil constituting its wealth .
According to a 1940 census , the Japanese - American community comprised 1,855 people , most of whom were engaged in farming .
Many were Issei â€ “ first generation Japanese who had immigranted .
Gensuke had arrive in America in 1898 to work on a railroad in Oregon and , then , he moved to Talbert where he leased 200 acres and eventually purchased 10 more ; his 5 sons and 4 daughters farmed the land as a family .
Sheriff deputies were the ones who knocked .
Without explanation , they took Gensuke and loaded him onto a bus with other Issei .
Ten days later -- without trial , legal representation or right of appeal -- Gensuke was accused of â€œsubversive activityâ€ and incarcerated in a stockade at Ft. Missoula , Montana .
The authorities refused to state specific reasons for the accusation but there was a general fear that a Japanese invasion of the West Coast was imminent and would be assisted by resident Japanese citizens , such as Gensuke .
The news of his father 's imprisonment incensed Kazuo , who had not been present at the farmhouse with other family members .
On October 17 , he and his brother Takashi had boarded a train to report for military duty at their respective basic training camps .
Through the proper authorities at Fort Ord , Kazuo Masuda ( Pvt. 39,166,362 ) wrote a letter to Washington D.C. in which he professed his father 's allegiance to America .
He wrote , in part , â€ œI cannot believe my father has done any act of disloyalty toward the United States .
He has been a resident of this country for over 40 years , that is to say since 1898 .
He has been a farmer for over 35 years During this time he has seen his sons and daughters grow into good , solid American citizens ....
He has , in my opinion , maintained during his 44 years of residence in this country a perfect record of unquestionable loyalty to this country .

The story of Kazuo and Mary Masuda is both a cautionary and inspiring tale .
The brother and sister were Nisei and , as 2nd generation Japanese - Americans , they were targeted by their own government for brutal oppression during World War II ; their story cautions us against judging people based on ancestry or skin color , especially during times of crisis when emotions too easily substitute for reason .
Their story also inspires us through the bravery and dignity displayed by Kazuo and Mary .
Equally inspiring are the rare individuals who spoke up on their behalf â€ “ not years afterward when the political ' error ' had become clear and defending Nisei was safe but while the injustices were actually occurring .
Perhaps loudest among those rare voices was R.C. Hoiles , the libertarian editor and co-publisher of the Orange County Register .
At least one of our ancestors regularly ate fish 40,000 years ago , a new study finds .
Scientists analyzed chemical compositions of the protein collagen in an ancient human skeleton from Tianyuan Cave near Beijing to reach their conclusion .
Fishing at this time must have involved considerable effort , the researchers think , because fossil records suggest humans were not using sophisticated tools — beyond crude stone blades — until about 50,000 years ago .
" This analysis provides the first direct evidence for the consumption of aquatic resources by early modern humans in China and has implications for early modern human subsistence and demography , " said Michael P. Richards of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology .
Other researchers have theorized that fish consumption may have helped humans grow bigger brains , though it's also thought that the introduction of meat protein from land animals into the human diet , perhaps 2 million years ago , was an important factor , too .
( Other factors , such as sheer survival needs driven by environmental catastrophe , may have fueled brain growth , too . )
Regardless , the shift to more fish in the human diet , as found in the new study , likely reflects greater pressure from an expanding population at the time of modern human emergence across Eurasia , Richards and his colleagues said in a statement .
The findings were detailed this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Ran across this article posted in Jumping In Pools .
Not sure how credible it is , but allegedly Barack Obama will provide the blueprints for the B - 2 stealth bomber to China in exchange for $ 50 billion in debt relief .
According to author Richard Hogarty :
According to the Administration , this proposal will help the United States resolve its debt issues .
They point out their belief that the B - 2 bomber is “ strategically obsolete ” , according to a source in the White House Press Office .
In addition , the source claims that the Chinese would be unable to create their own functioning stealth bomber fleet for “ at least eight years . ”
American allies Taiwan , Japan , and South Korea are very wary of the proposal .
Koo Syi , a geopolitical analyst from South Korea , points out that this technology could be passed to China ’s allies .
This was the case when Chinese nuclear technology was transferred to Pakistan and North Korea .
According to Koo , Obama has rendered US allies ’ opinions as “ irrelevant . ”
While this proposal is controversial , it is not being presented to Congress , where it could meet with stern opposition .
Instead , the State Department has been informed to assisted the Defense Department with the transfer of materials .
A little skeptical here as frankly $ 50 billion is less than a drop in the bucket of Chinese Treasury holdings which are easily well over $ 1 trillion .
The economic impact of this transaction would be negligible to zero .
On the other hand , if this ends up being true , it is quite frightening , as it merely demonstrates , aside from all the scary geo-political considerations , just how bad of a dealmaker our President is .
In other China - related news , Reuters reporting that Tim Geithner ’s soothing words from his Beijing whirlwind tour that “ Chinese assets are very safe , ” drew loud laughter from the audience .
“ Chinese assets are very safe , ” Geithner said in response to a question after a speech at Peking University , where he studied Chinese as a student in the 1980s .
His answer drew loud laughter from his student audience , reflecting scepticism in China about the wisdom of a developing country accumulating a vast stockpile of foreign reserves instead of spending the money to raise living standards at home .
Alas , laughter is more and more the traditional response when other economies consider the sustainability of the ongoing economic fiasco developing before our eyes ( and this author ’s response to the continued market manipulation ) .

IT 'S FREE INDIANAPOLIS ( AP )  Employers who offer health insurance coverage could see a 9 % cost increase next year , and their workers may face an even bigger hit , according to a report Thursday from consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers Costs will rise in part because workers worried about losing their jobs are using their health care more while they still have it , the firm said in the report released to the Associated Press .
The report also said rising unemployment is driving up medical costs .
Health care reform legislation currently being hashed out in Congress likely will have little impact on next year 's costs , said PWC Principal Michael Thompson .
But he noted that the intense focus on health care may slow price increases .
" Nobody wants to be front page news when all the lights are shinning on your industry , " he said .
The report projects the expected cost increase per person for employee benefits plans , and it factors in things such as price increases , as well as utilization changes .
Businesses confronted with increases will likely pass some of the burden to employees via higher premiums , deductibles or copays , Thompson said .
" If the underlying costs go up by 9 % , employees ' costs actually go up by double digits , " he said , noting that will have a " major , major impact " when many employers also are freezing or cutting pay .
A total of 42 % of employers surveyed said they would increase employees ' share of costs .
The 9 % increase predicted for 2010 , however , represents a slight decrease from the 9.2 % PWC projected for this year , and 9.9 % predicted for 2008 .
A growing use of generic drugs has helped tame spending , according to the most recent survey .
Actual cost increases for this year and last were not available .
PWC surveyed more than 500 employers and health insurers .
One of the factors it found that may increase medical costs next year is the lingering threat of unemployment .
Workers worried about losing their health coverage along with their jobs tend to seek medical care they might otherwise put off .
PWC also said health care providers tend to shift costs to private insurance plans to make up for the revenue drop they see from a rise in the uninsured population or from an increase in the percentage of people covered by Medicaid , the state - federal insurance program for the poor .
Georgetown University health economist Jean Mitchell said she sees one main reason behind any health care cost increase : overutilization .
Mitchell , who was not involved with the survey , said health care costs have been rising faster than inflation because the payment system rewards care providers for doing more .
" Until we fix that , we 're never going to be able to rein in health care costs , " she said .

“ Warning : Consuming hot dogs and other processed meats increases the risk of cancer . ”
That ’s the label that a vegan advocacy group wants a New Jersey court to order Oscar Mayer , Hebrew National and other food companies to slap on hot dog packages .
The nonprofit Cancer Project filed a lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of three New Jersey plaintiffs asking the Essex County Superior Court to compel the companies to place cancer - risk warning labels on hot dog packages sold in New Jersey .
“ Just as tobacco causes lung cancer , processed meats are linked to colon cancer , ” said Neal Barnard , president of the Cancer Project and an adjunct professor at the George Washington University medical school in Washington , D.C. “ Companies that sell hot dogs are well aware of the danger , and their customers deserve the same information . ”

The defendants in the lawsuit , which seeks class - action status , include Nathan ’s Famous Inc. , Oscar Mayer owner Kraft Foods Inc. , Sara Lee Corp. , Marathon Enterprises Inc. and ConAgra Foods Inc. , which owns Hebrew National .
Efforts to put warning labels on hot dog packages are “ crazy , ” said Josh Urdang , 27 , as he stood in line to buy two franks at Pink ’s hot dog stand in Hollywood on Tuesday .
“ It would n’t change how many hot dogs I eat .
Not at all , ” said Urdang , an information technology consultant from Hollywood .
His friend Joe Di Lauro , 31 , called such a move “ overpolicing .
. . .
At what point do you stop breaking things down ?
Unless we ’re going to put a warning label on every single food and say what ’s bad in it . ”

Other consumers were skeptical of the Cancer Project ’s agenda .
“ Vegans complaining about hot dogs is like the Amish complaining about gas prices , ” said Susan Thatcher of Irvine .
Americans spent $ 3.4 billion buying 730 million packages of hot dogs and sausages in U.S. supermarkets last year , according to the National Hot Dog & Sausage Council .
Nutrition experts say that the science is far more complicated and that slapping warning labels on the staple of baseball games and picnics would not have much effect on public health .

“ If one were to call for a ‘ black label ’ on frankfurters , where should the warning label end ?
If we were to evaluate each food for its naturally occurring toxins and eliminate that food , then our food plate would be empty , ” said Roger Clemens , a nutrition expert at USC ’s pharmacy school .
The industry is dead set against such warning labels .
“ These proposals are unfounded .
Hot dogs have been enjoyed by consumers for more than 100 years , ” said Sydney Lindner , a Kraft spokeswoman .
The Cancer Project is a branch of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine , a group that lobbies against animal research and pitches the adoption of meat - free diets .

In the lawsuit , the Cancer Project cites the role of nitrites , preservatives used in cured and processed meats such as hot dogs , in the development of cancer - forming agents .
During digestion , nitrites break down into nitrosamines and other N - nitroso compounds that are considered carcinogens .
Although some medical studies link red and processed meats to cancer risk , it ’s not clear whether it is because of the nitrites or other factors such as high fat content .
Said Keith - Thomas Ayoob , a nutritionist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York : “ There is speculation that nitrosamines can increase cancer risk when consumed in large amounts and frequently .
Occasionally should cause no worry .
The stuff people typically have with a hot dog may be a more immediate concern : too many calories from all the fat - laden potato and macaroni salads , sugary drinks and sweet desserts . ”
Advertisement
An American Institute for Cancer Research report cited in the lawsuit notes that one 50 - gram serving of processed meat -- about the amount in one hot dog -- consumed daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer 21 % on average .
Colorectal cancer kills about 50,000 Americans annually .
But a 2004 analysis by Harvard University researchers of pooled data from 14 studies in North America and Europe did not find a similar link between various red and processed meats and cancer .
But they did find that higher consumption of poultry and fish may be associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer .
The lawsuit acknowledges debate over how the consumption of some types of meats leads to greater cancer risk , but it argues that that does n’t negate a need for warnings on hot dogs .
“ This situation is similar to the link between the smoking of tobacco products and lung cancer :
While all the molecular events linking the smoking of tobacco to the development of lung cancer are not known , the link cannot be disputed , ” the lawsuit states .
Advertisement
There may be arguments for broader health warnings about red meat consumption , but the bigger risk is of heart disease rather than cancer , said Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest .
“ Though I favor warning notices in certain circumstances , the overuse of warnings can lead to ‘ warning fatigue , ’ ” Jacobson said .
“ Eating hot dogs occasionally is not by itself worrisome . ”

ZURICH / MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A federal court judge in Miami approved a delay in a high - profile trial on Monday in which U.S. tax authorities hoped to force UBS AG to reveal the identities of thousands of Americans suspected of using the Swiss bank to evade taxes .
Both UBS and the U.S. Justice Department requested the postponement on Sunday as the parties said for the first time that they were engaged in talks for a possible out - of court settlement of the case centering on Switzerland ’s jealously guarded tradition of bank secrecy .
Presiding Judge Alan Gold of U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida agreed to the request to delay the trial ’s opening until August 3 and said he would gladly give further extensions on request “ to assist in accomplishing any goal of settlement . ”
Gold also set a telephone status conference for July 29 , when he said he hoped the participants would be prepared to say whether the August 3 trial would take place as scheduled .
“ UBS welcomes Judge Gold ’s decision to approve a temporary stay of the litigation .
It is a positive development that the governments will now engage in intensive discussions over the next two weeks and attempt to negotiate a resolution , ” the bank said in a statement .
The case , seen as key to the future of the global offshore banking industry , seeks to force UBS to reveal the identities of 52,000 rich Americans suspected of using secret bank accounts to dodge taxes .
This would be in breach of Swiss bank secrecy laws .
A source familiar with the situation told Reuters the talks led by the U.S. and Swiss governments were aimed at finding a way to allow the transfer of bank client data without breaching Swiss law .
The source did not rule out a payment from UBS .
“ The likely scenario will be a compromise where there may be some limited information provided to the U.S. government , ( but ) it wo n’t be what the U.S. government is looking for , ” said Keith Wirtz , president and chief investment officer of Cincinnati , Ohio - based Fifth Third Asset Management .
The Justice Department , which cautioned it remained ready to ratchet up its legal fight with UBS , said any settlement would include the bank providing data on a significant number of its U.S. clients .
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters last week that , to circumvent Swiss law , the Swiss government could agree to disclose UBS bank client data indirectly , possibly by helping the U.S. Internal Revenue Service cross-check U.S. banks ’ data about transfers from Switzerland and UBS .
Any settlement is likely to dent Swiss privacy laws , however .
It could involve the transfer of some client data , but would help UBS move on from a damaging row that is hurting its brand and deflecting it from its aim to return to profit .
“ This is one of those nagging clouds over UBS that if it gets lifted allows UBS to function like a normal bank , ” Wirtz said .
The bank ’s shares rose 4.75 percent to 13.23 Swiss francs on Monday , but they are still down almost 15 percent in 2009 .
FINANCIAL PENALTY
UBS Chairman Kaspar Villiger said last week the focus of the discussions was the client data , not a possible fine and said that speculation of UBS having to pay billions of dollars in the tax dispute were completely unfounded .
Many analysts still expect UBS to be saddled with a big financial penalty , though .
Earlier this year , the bank agreed to pay $ 780 million and to disclose around 250 U.S. client names when it settled a separate but linked criminal case in the United States .
“ At the end of the day this is a tax case , ” said Tom Cardamone , a managing director at Global Financial Integrity , a think tank that monitors global illegal financial flows .
“ If the assumption is the owners of these 52,000 accounts have n’t paid their back taxes forever ... there has to be some adjustment for that , ” he said .
UBS Chairman Kaspar Villiger arrives for a speech during the general shareholders meeting in Zurich , April 15 , 2009 .

The UBS case comes during a global fight against tax cheats supported by the U.S. administration .
U.S. tax officials have accused UBS of hiding $ 20 billion of U.S. taxpayers ’ money in undeclared offshore accounts , or just over 1 percent of the bank ’s total wealth under management .
Tax lawyers say European governments are also trying to recoup unpaid tax money from offshore banks .
The subprime debt crisis has led UBS to report the biggest annual loss in Swiss corporate history in 2008 and accept state aid .
It is losing clients at its wealth management division , but a resolution of the tax spat could give it some relief .
“ If the U.S. case settles soon then definitely I believe the net new money flows will improve worldwide , slowly but surely , also in Wealth Management Americas , ” said Vontobel analyst Teresa Nielsen .
UBS manages more than $ 600 billion at its Wealth Management Americas division .
The bank is due to report second - quarter results on August 4 .

EARLY ONE MORNING in August 2005 , a small team of game wardens and deputies climbed through coyote brush and manzanita in the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve outside San Jose , California , searching for an illegal pot farm .
As they crested a ridge , they discovered densely planted rows of cannabis stalks .
Suddenly , a high - powered rifle cracked and an officer fell to the ground , shot through both legs .
Seconds later , another deputy shot and killed a man wielding a sawed - off shotgun .
“ It was literally like a jungle firefight , ” recalls warden John Nores , who fired at the other shooter before he escaped into the woods .
Left behind in a meadow just minutes from the heart of Silicon Valley were 22,000 marijuana plants worth some $ 88 million .
Over the past decade , marijuana patches known as “ grows ” or “ gardens ” have sprung up on public lands across the West , including a third of California ’s national parks and nearly 40 percent of all national forests .
Where hippies once grew just enough weed to peace out , traffickers now cultivate more than 100,000 plants at a time on 30 - acre terraces irrigated by plastic pipe , laced with illegal pesticides , and guarded by men with MAC - 10s and Uzis .
Grows have turned up everywhere from the deepest backcountry to the edges of suburban subdivisions .
Farming pot on public land can be more profitable than smuggling it across the increasingly militarized border .
The 3.1 million pot plants seized in national forests in the year prior to last September had an estimated street value of $ 12.4 billion .
Rangers and game wardens say pot growers are a major threat to California ’s 23,500 square miles of wilderness ( which does n’t include state or regional lands ) .
“ These guys literally create cities within your national forests , ” says Laura Mark , a special agent with the US Forest Service .
Growers clear land year - round , plant crops in the spring , and haul out the harvest in the fall , often leaving behind mounds of trash and dead animals , denuded hillsides , and streams full of sediment and human waste .
Last year , the community of Snow Creek , California , traced feces in its water treatment plant to a grow in the nearby San Bernardino National Forest .
Restoring the 10,000 acres of national forest fouled by pot farms could cost more than $ 30 million .
Pot farmers who till public lands avoid the risk of forfeiting their property if they ’re busted , but they must also ward off competitors .
“ They are going to point guns at you first and ask questions later , ” says Troy Bolen , the Bureau of Land Management ’s head of law enforcement in California .
In the past decade , growers have killed two people who have stumbled upon their fields , held nature lovers at gunpoint , and had numerous shoot - outs with cops .
Last year , in California ’s national forests the state ’s anti-grow task force killed one grower and arrested 177 , 80 percent of whom were Mexican citizens .
Officials believe that Mexican drug cartels control the grows , but proving that is tough .
Last year , Nores caught a pot grower who revealed almost everything about his operation but said he did n’t know whom he worked for .
“ They ’re kind of set up like terrorist cells , ” he observes .
After the bloody 2005 ambush , he says , his team now treats raids like potential battles , bringing along medics and keeping air support on standby — just in case .
Motors and Microcontrollers 101
Electric motors are a key way of converting electrical power ( voltage and current ) into mechanical power ( torque and speed ) , and because electric motors are simple and reliable machines , they can be found all over , in many different shapes and sizes .
Just considering a normal ( gasoline - powered ) car , there are a great number of electric motors :
the powerful starter motor and alternator
alternating windshield wiper motors
intermittent - use power windows and door locks
the blower fan that moves hot and cold air into the cabin
the tiny motors inside the CD player
And I 'm sure you can think of others .
But from an electronics perspective , motors are slightly tricky loads to control -- they 're not just a resistor !
Even for a single applied voltage , their current varies with loading , starting , and stopping , and the energy stored in the magnetic field of the windings means that they are inductive , which can present a danger to other circuit components if it is n't handled properly .
While a full analysis would have to look simultaneously at the motor and the attached mechanical system , in this video tutorial we 're just going to address the electrical side of the system .
This includes some experiments you should try with a DC motor , a model of the system from an electrical perspective , building a MOSFET - based switching circuit , and finally two demos of a microcontroller - operated motor .
This video and webpage specifically addresses a brushed DC motor , and although the specifics are not fully applicable to brushless ( BLDC ) motors , stepper motors , or AC motors , the big ideas about motor modeling and control will be useful in those areas as well .
Here are some photos and drawings related to the video ( click to enlarge ) :
Our final motor control circuit looks like this :
Motor Experiments
Here is an overview of the nine quick motor experiments / observations made during the video .
We highly suggest you try these yourself with a small DC brushed motor to get a better feel for what 's going on .
Spinning the motor makes a voltage .
This is called the back - EMF ( EMF stands for electromotive force , which is just a voltage ) , and the voltage is proportional to the speed of rotation , and it happens because the permanent magnets are moving relative to the coils of the motor .
This is how a permanent magnet motor can be used in reverse as a generator .
Spinning the motor can light an LED .
If an LED is attached and you are able to spin the motor fast enough in one direction to get to the forward voltage of the LED ( about 2 volts ) , the LED will light .
You are then turning mechanical energy into electrical energy and then into optical energy as photons .
Inertia keeps the rotor spinning .
A spinning object such as the rotor likes to keep spinning , and is only slowed down by friction .
When shorted , the rotor is harder to turn .
This may seem strange , but if the motor is electrically shorted , it 's harder to turn the shaft , because the back - EMF generated by the spinning causes a current to flow .
This current produces a torque which opposes the motion of the rotor .
( It must be in this direction for energy conservation to work ! )
Also , the motor no longer spins much after the driving force applied by my hand is released , because its motion is quickly impeded by the motor torque .
This experiment may be the least familiar or intuitive to you out of the nine -- give it a try !
The winding resistance of the motor can be measured .
With a multimeter , we can measure the motor resistance , which for our motor was about 9 ohms .
But the big idea of this video is that the motor is not just a resistance -- there 's other effects going on too , so making decisions only considering the resistive part may lead to trouble .
The operating current under no load is small .
With a multimeter , we measured an operating current of about 0.06 amps when driven from a 9V source , even though the previous measurement of 9 ohms might have suggested 9V / 9 ohms = about 1 amp .
That 's because when the motor is spinning , there 's a large back - EMF voltage , so the actual voltage drop across the 9 ohm resistor is much smaller .
In this case , it 's about ( 9 ohms ) * ( 0.06 amps ) =0.54 volts , which means that only 6 % of the power going into the motor is being dissipated in the winding resistance , and the rest is going into friction or electromagnetic losses .
The current required when starting the motor is larger .
When the motor is first started from rest , there 's zero back - EMF , so the current is many times larger than the operating current .
The stall current , when the shaft is locked , is very large .
If the motor shaft is physically prevented from spinning , we see the stall current , which is really just the operating voltage divided by the winding resistance .
This is the largest current the motor will ever see , and it is an important number to consider when designing the motor control circuit .
A spark can be seen when the motor is switched on / off .
Because energy is stored in the magnetic field due to a current , it 's common to see sparks when the motor is switched on / off , because the energy in the magnetic field has to go somewhere when the current stops .
Sparks mean high voltages -- hundreds or thousands of volts -- and this can be fatal for other circuit elements like transistors and microcontrollers .
Go give them a try !
Particularly for the experiments where current is applied , make sure that you only use a small motor disconnected from any gearing or mechanical loads so you do n't hurt yourself .
The MOSFET as a Switch
While we do talk about using the MOSFET ( Metal - Oxide - Semiconductor Field - Effect Transistor ) as a switch in The NerdKits Guide , we do so mostly in the context of digital logic , so there are a few extra things to think about when using a MOSFET as a high - powered switch .
The basic idea is still the same : for an n-channel MOSFET with three terminals ( gate , drain , and source ) , positive voltage applied from gate to source will allow current to flow between drain and source terminals .
For the 2N7000 n- channel MOSFET we 're using ( which is included with the USB NerdKit ) , these curves from the datasheet tell the story ( click to enlarge ) :
Applying a voltage at the gate selects one of these curves .
With the microcontroller driving it , we 're only able to choose the V GS =5 V curve , leading to a maximum current of about 0.75 amps .
For more information about the MOSFET as a switch , see The NerdKits Guide .
For another example of using the 2N7000 , see our Servo Squirter tutorial .
Bigger Loads and Power MOSFETs
For this case or for driving bigger motors , there are two more things you want to consider .
First is the maximum allowed V DS , which applies when the MOSFET is off .
When the switch is open , the drain terminal rises to match the motor power supply voltage .
For the 2N7000 , the datsheets suggests a " Drain - Source Breakdown Voltage " of at least 60 volts .
This means we should not use the 2N7000 for higher - supply - voltage cases , and it's also typical to allow a safety factor , so perhaps 30 - 40 V would be the maximum useful voltage where we can use the 2N7000 as a switch .
The second is power dissipation in the MOSFET itself , equal to I D *V DS .
For the 2N7000 at 0.75 amps and V GS =5V , the figure above shows a V DS of about 2 volts , meaning that the 2N7000 is dissipating ( 0.75 amps ) * ( 2 volts ) =1.5 Watts .
( In the triode region for small V DS , this curve gets approximated by a " Drain - Source On- Resistance R DS " as a function of V GS . )
This 1.5 Watts might seem small compared to a 100 Watt light bulb , but for all that heat to be dissipated out of such a tiny transistor package would cause a huge temperature rise .
Going from the 2N7000 datasheet , the " Thermal Resistance , Junction - to - Ambient " is more than 300 °C / W , implying that for a 1.5
Watt power dissipation , the transistor would have to be roughly 450 °C above room temperature .
This would clearly just melt the plastic of transistor !
It 's better to keep temperature rise at most 50 °C or less if possible .
However , it is OK to allow the transistor to momentarily pass through such a power dissipation region , because the transistor wo n't heat up instantly ( see the 2N7000 datasheet for more info ) .
So if the motor very briefly draws 0.75 amps while it 's starting , we 're OK , but if it gets stuck or stalls , we 're in real trouble !
A more powerful " Power MOSFET " and a good heatsink are a must for higher - powered designs , and even for a small motor like this , an unintended stall will cause parts to overheat and become damaged .
If you need to guarantee that your circuit will survive a stall ( even if the motor itself might not ) , design it with this in mind .
If you want to control higher - powered loads , here are some other typical MOSFETs you might consider , with a table of important values :
Part Number Max .
Current at V GS =5V [ amps ] R DS at V GS =5V [ ohms ]
Breakdown V DS [ volts ]

FQP50N06 15 0.09 60
Low on - resistance , high current .
There are thousands of varieties out there that have different tradeoffs , typically between cost , current capability , gate capacitance , and a few other factors .
Also , these are only on the n-channel side -- you may occasionally want p-channel MOSFETs for you application to put a switch on the high - voltage side of the load ( but would have to think about voltage levels from your microcontroller ) .
The Flyback Diode
As we discuss in the video , the flyback diode plays an important role in preventing large voltage spikes by providing a current path when the motor is switched from on to off .
( The n-channel MOSFET itself includes a diode which helps handle the spike that may occur when the motor is switched in the other direction , from off to on . )
There are two key parameters of the diode itself that are important when choosing a flyback diode :
Maximum forward current .
The flyback diode must momentarily be able to carry the full motor current , which it does every time the motor is switched from on to off .
Peak repetitive reverse voltage .
When the motor is on , the diode has a reverse voltage across it equal to the power supply voltage ( minus the small V DS drop in the MOSFET ) , and it 's important that the diode does not break down when this voltage is applied .
For this demo , we used a 1N4003 general purpose diode , which is rated for 1 amp and 200 volts repetitive reverse voltage .
You can also look at higher - powered diodes , like the MUR1520 , which is rated for 15 amps , and also important for some applications such as pulse width modulation ( PWM ) speed control is its " ultrafast recovery time " t RR of about 35ns , compared to the 1N4003 which is much slower at a few microseconds .
( This article provides an excellent explanation of reverse recovery time . )
Electrical and Mechanical Power
A motor converts electrical power ( V* I , in volts and amps ) into mechanical power ( T*ω , in Newton - meters and radians / second ) .
There are always losses , like the power lost to heating the resistive wire ( I2R ) , and power lost to mechanical friction ( T friction *ω ) , so the electrical power in will always be more than the mechanical power out .
A perfectly frictionless and lossless motor would have zero no -load current : there would be some initial current as work was done to accelerate the rotor up to speed , but once the back - EMF voltage matched the power supply voltage , there would be no more current .
In reality , however , there is friction , and the no-load current is non-zero because the motor must constantly consume electrical power to make up for the mechanical power lost to friction .
The motor will come to steady - state operation at the speed where the frictional and other power losses ( which increase with speed ) equals the electrical power in ( which decreases with speed , due to the back - EMF effect described earlier ) .
A similar statement can be made when the motor is under some mechanical load .
Pulse Width Modulation ( PWM )
In the second part of the demo we use PWM , or Pulse Width Modulation , to do a very rudimentary control of the speed of the motor .
The concept behind this is pretty simple to understand .
Using a PWM output from one of the microcontroller 's pins , you can have the pin be high some percentage of the time , and low the rest .
If you are pulsing the motor on using half duty cycle ( the pin is only on for half of the time ) the motor is going to spin slower than if you were using a 75 % duty cycle .
A 100 % duty cycle will cause the motor to spin at full speed ( for a particular power supply voltage and load ) .
This pulsing happens so fast that the natural inertia of the motor smooths out the on and off periods , and makes it imperceptible .
So using PWM we can get some control over how fast the motor is spinning .
However , we must use caution here , because this is not actually controlling the speed of the motor , we are just controlling what fraction of the time it is receiving power .
While this does roughly equate to how fast it goes , it is not true speed control .
That is , if you are running at 50 % duty cycle , you will not have exactly half the speed as you will at full duty cycle .
In order to get true speed control you have to either completely work out the dynamics of your motor and friction and load , and how it would react to the input pulse of of different widths ( which would be hard ) , or do some sort of closed loop control where you measure the speed of the motor and adjust your PWM duty cycle in real time to get the speed you want .
We have an explanation of how we generate a PWM pulse using the microcontroller in our Servo Squirter video tutorial .
You should also be aware that using PWM puts far greater stresses on the motor control circuit elements such as the MOSFET and flyback diode ( in comparison to just switching fully on and off ) , because the MOSFET will be passing through its high - loss " not - a- perfect - switch " region many times per second , and also because the flyback diode will be forced to quench the inductive kick many times per second .
Other Motor Control Topics
This video and webpage covers the basics , but this topics goes even deeper .
Consider : power dissipation in the MOSFET and flyback diode , finite MOSFET gate capacitance ( especially with big power MOSFETs or several in parallel ) and turn - on / turn - off times , diode recovery times , PWM operating frequency ( high enough not to hear audibly , but low enough to not hurt efficiency ) , and filtering electrical noise from the motor and its brushes from getting into the rest of your circuit .
Later we can look at H - Bridges , and how we can reverse the direction of the motor .
Power electronics has become an entire field of its own !
It may sound complicated , but with the tools presented here , you 've got the big concepts , so get out there and start playing with motors !
Source Code
Although we highly recommend you experiment with motors on your own , you can download the source code from our demo .
In the same piece of code , two modes of operation are demonstrated :
Pushbutton toggle on / off mode .
A pushbutton ( included with the USB NerdKit ) is connected with its " C " terminal to ground and its " NO " terminal to pin PB4 .
The code " debounces " the input , filtering out unintended button transitions , and then toggles the state of the motor , which is just a digital output on pin PB3 .
Temperature feedback speed control PWM mode .
The LM34 temperature sensor ( also included with our microcontroller kit ) is read by the analog - to - digital convertor ( ADC ) of the microcontroller , and this value is used to adjust the PWM duty cycle .
A PWM digital signal is output on pin PB2 .
The gate of the 2N7000 MOSFET is then connected to either PB2 or PB3 , depending on which mode is being demonstrated .
The LCD is also used for user feedback about the state of the system in both modes .

Israeli troops detail Gaza atrocities as demand grows for war crimes probe
By Bill Van Auken
21 March 2009
The publication of testimony by Israeli soldiers detailing atrocities in which they participated or that they witnessed has lent further weight to the growing demands for an international war crimes tribunal to investigate the three - week Israeli siege of the Gaza Strip last December and January .
The testimony , published Thursday and Friday in the Israeli dailies Haaretz and Maariv , came from a group of soldiers and officers participating in a military training course at the Oranim Academic College in Tivon in February .
The director of the program , Danny Zamir , invited them to discuss their experiences in Gaza .
He recounted that he was " shocked " by what he heard , including reports of random shootings of unarmed civilians and generalized contempt for Palestinian life , and reported the matter to the Israeli Defense Forces command .
Now , weeks later , and with no indication that the IDF has carried out any serious investigation , the publication of sections of the discussion 's transcript has triggered an uproar in Israel .
The Israeli government has long promoted the myth that its army 's conduct is based on a strict code of ethics and blamed the massive Palestinian casualties in Gaza — more than 1,400 killed — on Hamas , claiming that its fighters used the civilian population as " human shields . "
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak reiterated this position in a radio interview Friday , declaring , " We have the most moral army in the world . "
The atrocities testimony grabbed headlines in Israel at precisely the moment in which prime minister - designate Benjamin Netanyahu , of the right - wing Likud Party , is maneuvering to bring Barak , a leader in the Israeli Labor Party , into his cabinet , with the aim of giving his government a more " moderate " cast .
The testimony , however , provides yet more evidence that Barak , who as defense minister directed the attack on Gaza , is guilty of war crimes .
The stories told by the soldiers who participated in Israel 's Operation Cast Lead , however , provide a very different picture of the " morality " of the IDF .
Several of them expressed frustration and remorse over the killing spree in Gaza .
A squad commander identified as " Aviv " testified on the orders his unit was given in occupying houses in the densely populated center of Gaza City .
" We were supposed to go in with an armored personnel carrier called an Achzarit [ literally , " cruel " ] to burst through the lower door , to start shooting inside and then ... I call this murder ... in effect , we were supposed to go up floor by floor , and any person we identified — we were supposed to shoot . "
Senior officers , he continued , argued that such actions were justified because anyone who had not fled the area was , by definition , a " terrorist . "
" I did n't really understand , " the squad commander continued .
" On the one hand they do n't really have anywhere to flee to , but on the other hand they 're telling us they had n't fled so it 's their fault . "
After he convinced his commanders to allow him to warn occupants of the houses to evacuate or be killed , he confronted opposition from soldiers in his unit .
He recalled them telling him , " We need to murder any person who 's in there , " and " Any person who 's in Gaza is a terrorist . "
He said that the general attitude among the troops was that " inside Gaza you are allowed to do anything you want , to break down doors of houses for no reason other than it 's cool ... to write ‘ death to Arabs ' on the walls , to take family pictures and spit on them , just because you can . "
Aviv recounted an incident in which a company commander spotted an old woman walking down the road .
" In the end , he sent people on the roof , to take her out with their weapons ... I simply felt it was murder in cold blood . "
Interrupted by the course director Zamir , who asked why she was shot , Aviv continued : " That 's what is so nice , supposedly , about Gaza :
You see a person on a road , walking along a path .
He does n't have to be with a weapon , you do n't have to identify him with anything and you can just shoot him .
With us it was an old woman , on whom I did n't see any weapon .
The order was to take the person out , that woman , the moment you see her . "
Another soldier , " Ram , " who was with an operations company in the Givati Brigade , told of occupying a house and holding the family that lived there prisoner for several days before being ordered to release them .
" There was a sharpshooters ' position on the roof , " he recalled .
" The platoon commander let the family go and told them to go to the right .
One mother and her two children did n't understand and went to the left , but they forgot to tell the sharpshooter on the roof they had let them go , and it was okay and he should hold his fire and he ... he did what he was supposed to , like he was following his orders . "
Ram added : " I do n't think he felt too bad about it , because after all , as far as he was concerned , he did his job according to the orders he was given .
And the atmosphere in general , from what I understood from most of my men who I talked to ... I do n't know how to describe it ... the lives of Palestinians , let 's say , is something very , very less important than the lives of our soldiers .
So as far as they are concerned they can justify it that way . "
The same soldier also testified on how the military prepared troops for the indiscriminate killing in Gaza by bringing in army rabbis who presented the siege of Gaza as a " religious mission . "
" Their message was very clear , " he said .
" We are the Jewish people , we came to this land by a miracle , God brought us back to this land and now we need to fight to expel the gentiles who are interfering with our conquest of this holy land .
This was the main message , and the whole sense many soldiers had in this operation was of a religious war . "
The reporter who broke the story in Haaretz reported Friday that the military command had responded with an exercise in " damage control " that centered on an attempt to " witch hunt " the school director Zamir and intimidate the soldiers who had spoken out .
Haaretz carried another story Friday indicative of the " morality " of the IDF .
It reported on T - shirts designed by a fabric - printing shop in Tel Aviv for Israeli army units , each with their own unit slogan and design .
" A T - shirt for infantry snipers bears the inscription ‘ Better use Durex , ' [ referring to a brand of condoms ] , next to a picture of a dead Palestinian baby , with his weeping mother and a teddy bear beside him , " according to the report .
" A sharpshooter 's T - shirt from the Givati Brigade 's Shaked battalion shows a pregnant Palestinian woman with a bull 's - eye superimposed on her belly , with the slogan , in English , ‘ 1 shot , 2 kills . ' "
The reporter explained that the designs and slogans were chosen by soldiers after completing their training , but approved by their commanding officers .
On Thursday , as the transcripts of the soldiers ' testimony was being published in Israel , the United Nations human rights investigator for the Palestinian territories issued a report declaring that Israel 's siege of the densely populated Gaza Strip " would seem to constitute a war crime of the gravest magnitude under international law . "
Richard Falk , UN special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories , described the Israeli campaign as a " massive assault on a densely populated urbanized setting " in which Gaza 's entire civilian population had been subjected to " an inhumane form of warfare that kills , maims and inflicts mental harm . "
Falk 's report listed among Israel 's war crimes the " targeting of schools , mosques and ambulances " and the use of white phosphorus shells ( which cause horrific burns ) in densely populated neighborhoods .
Falk added that the war on Gaza was not legally justified and therefore could constitute a " crime against peace , " the principal charge against the Nazi leaders tried at Nuremberg .
In his report , Falk cited newly updated figures for casualties from the 22 - day Gaza operation issued by the Palestinian Center for Human Rights .
The human rights group has compiled a list , including names , with a total of 1,417 victims .
Among those killed , the rights group reports , were 926 civilians — including 313 children and 116 women — 255 police officers and 236 Palestinian fighters .
The total number of Israelis killed in the siege was 13 , several of them by " friendly fire . "
Given that Israel — like the United States — has refused to sign the Rome accords setting up the International Criminal Court , Falk suggested that the United Nations set up a special tribunal to consider charges .
Meanwhile , a group of 16 judges and legal scholars , many of them former members of tribunals formed to hear charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the former Yugoslavia , Darfur , Rwanda and East Timor , issued an open letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and the UN Security Council Monday entitled " Find the truth about Gaza war . "
The letter called for the formation of an international commission to investigate violations of international humanitarian law " by both sides . "
The letter declared , " The events in Gaza have shocked us to the core , " and called for the commission to " provide recommendations as to the appropriate prosecution of those responsible for gross violations of the law . "

The Associated Press is reporting that Daniel Martin , the Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper caught on video throttling paramedic Maurice White Jr. , was put on unpaid suspension for five days .
Martin must also undergo an anger assessment .
Maurice
White ’s attorney said the paramedic was disappointed by the suspension .
A video released by the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety clearly shows Martin assaulting White on the side of the road in Okfuskee County , Oklahoma .
A cell phone video of the assault posted on YouTube received well over a million views and was the second most - watched video on May 30 .
A Fox station in Tulsa filed a Freedom of Information request for the dash cam but the OHP stonewalled the request .
Late on June 12 , the department finally released the video .
It was posted on YouTube on June 13 .
Police initially said the EMT vehicle failed to yield and this was the reason Martin confronted White , assaulted him and threatened to arrest him .
But the police video reveals that the EMT was unable to immediately yield due to a car pulling over in the breakdown lane on the side of the road .
On June 12 , White said he does n’t want to see anyone else in the position he was in .
“ Whatever we have to make sure that that never occurs again and that some definitive light is shed on the problems with the OHP , we will go forward and do it whatever that takes , ” he told NewsOn6 in Oklahoma .

It 's a rare find : an iPhone app that 's both useful and hilarious .
RunPee , an existing website that launched its iPhone app today , checks both those boxes .
Here 's the idea : you 're watching a movie in the theater and need to take a restroom break , but you do n't want to miss the best part .
The RunPee iPhone app has a timer letting you know when it 's safe to take a break , and gives you a summary of what you missed upon your return .
It also lets you know whether you should stay till the end of the credits , since movies like Iron Man include bonus footage afterwards .
You start the timer when the movie begins , and safe break - times are scheduled throughout .
The app costs $ 0.99 [ iTunes link ] .
In an amusing press release for the iPhone app , creator Dan Florio explains :
Some parents worry that videogames might cause their children to become violent and antisocial , but what if the opposite were true ?
What if games could make kids exceedingly likable and fashionable ?
A wave of new games for tween girls seeks to do just that , serving up innocuous gameplay designed to let players become perfect little princesses .
Aimed at that lucrative , Hannah Montana - fueled intersection of childhood and adolescence , these games might give 8 - to 12 - year - olds their first experiences with fashion , make - up , popularity ... even boys .
The weird thing is that you can view these " wholesome " games as being just as bad for girls as Grand Theft Auto 's random bloodshed and rampant criminality is for young , impressionable boys .
And while GTA 's influence on boys has been dissected to death , what about the Nintendo DS ' upcoming avalanche of games for tween girls ?
What kinds of values do preteens learn from these titles ?
Valuable life lessons , or bad habits ?

* The Daring Game for Girls *
( Majesco , October )
__What it 's about :
__This interactive version of the best - selling how - to hardcovers guides players through the book 's suggested activities : everything from spy missions and cave exploration to Double Dutch and basketball .
It also imparts educational facts about famous women in history ; players are tested with pop quizzes .
The goal is to obtain six merit badges in order to earn an adventure to Africa , the Amazon or Mt. McKinley .
__What it teaches girls : __Surprisingly , a lot .
Like the book , the game offers handy tips and facts as well as non-stereotypically female activities , encouraging girls to seek adventure — not boyfriends or cute clothes , for once .
So , of course , no one will actually play it .
Dreamer Series : Top Model
( Dreamcatcher Interactive , July 21 )
What it 's about : Top Model shows what it takes to become ... a top model .
Players can choose their make - up and clothing as well as learn the right poses through various mini-games .
Girls will be able to " glide through the glitter and glamour of a catwalk career " that culminates in " a fabulous photo shoot on a Caribbean island ! "
What it teaches girls :
This game might offer a better example of an aspiring model 's life than , say , America 's Next Top Model .
But we 're guessing the game does n't expose girls to some of the harsh realities of the industry , such as eating disorders , drug - addled rock stars and completely insane reality TV hosts .
And girls , we'd be wary of any " modeling shoot " that promises to take you to a Caribbean island .
Just sayin' .
Imagine : Babyz Fashion
( Ubisoft , October )
What it 's about :
For the tween without enough time to play separate games about babies and fashion , Babyz Fashion combines them .
Appease these fashion - savvy infants by dressing them in the right seasonal clothes ( i.e. light outfits for summer , heavy coats for winter ) and creating designs to their liking .
__What it teaches girls : __First , it 's OK to pluralize words by adding the letter Z to the end of them .
Second , babyz do n't feel good unless they look good , so make sure their outfits match if you want to be a good mom , like the one on Jon & Kate Plus 8 .
Imagine : Detective
( Ubisoft , September )
What it 's about :
As an " independent adventurous feminine heroine , " you solve local mysteries armed with your photographic memory , karate skills and " feminine sixth sense . "
Then you write about everything on your personal blog , where your goal is to raise traffic and collect cash from sponsors .
What it teaches girls : Girls have a " feminine sixth sense , " so do n't forget :
No matter what masculine qualities you have ( solving mysteries , karate ) , you 're still a girl .
Which means you can make way more money blogging .
( If only this were true . )
My Boyfriend
( THQ , Sept. 14 )
__What it 's about : __Players pick various outfits and make - up while they hang out , exercise and gossip with their friends .
But the main object of the game is to create " the love story of your dreams " by choosing from five different guys .
Then , players will have to " charm , chat up and chill out " with each different guy to find true love .
What it teaches girls :
You are incomplete without a man , or at least a digital replica of one .
More specifically , the game instructs that there are only a limited number of potential mates in the world , and the only way to find the right one is to flirt with all of them .
Princess in Love
( THQ , Sept. 14 )
What it 's about : Customize Princess Isabella with clothing and accessories .
As the queen - in - training , players must mind their manners and plan gala balls while searching for Prince Charming , who can be wooed by learning the right dance moves .
__What it teaches girls : __No , really , you need a man .
Being a princess is n't just about wearing pretty dresses and waiting for your knight in shining armor all day :
You 've got to work .
If you want Mr. Right , it 's up to you , not him , to make the first impression .
So get dancin . '

What it 's about :
In Makeover , players use the DSi's camera to take photos of themselves , then superimpose hair and makeup styles over them .
Jewelry Design lets girls create their own jewelry and even upload virtual designs online — then buy replicas of the actual products they made in the game .
__What it teaches girls : __Makeover seems harmless enough ; girls might wonder what their hair looks like with rainbow streaks in it .
But Jewelry Designer is what parents need to worry about .
At a recent demo of the game , we were told that custom jewelry items would cost between $ 10 and $ 25 each .
Maybe My Boyfriend will pay for it .
Style Savvy
( Nintendo , holiday 2009 )
What it 's about :
As a boutique owner , players will manage the store by monitoring inventory , funds and fashion trends to keep up sales .
Players can customize their own character 's looks , and they 'll also help customers style themselves according to their budgets with more than 10,000 in - game items .
What it teaches girls :
All you really need to care about is clothes and how they look on you ( and maybe others ) .
But at least you 're able to manage a retail outlet and make some money , although Nintendo 's virtual cash wo n't buy any $ 25 necklaces from Ubisoft .

Emily Weinstein looks up while making jewelry at her home Monday , July 20 , 2009 , in Portland , Ore . Graduating from college into an economic meltdown , 23 - year - old Weinstein has n't been able to make much money , which has put health insurance out of reach .
Already the least likely of any age group to have coverage , adults in their 20s face brutal job searches and more time uninsured because of the recession .
( AP Photo / Rick Bowmer )
( AP ) -- Emily Weinstein graduated from college into an economic meltdown , and as a self - employed jewelry maker she 'll be lucky to bring in $ 16,000 this year .
Heath insurance is out of reach , so she avoids thinking about what would happen if she got sick , was hurt in a traffic accident or was severely burned while making a silver necklace in her home studio .
" Would I have to declare bankruptcy at age 23 or would my parents have to bail me out ? " asked Weinstein , of Portland , Ore . " What would I do ? "
Like millions of other uninsured adults in their 20s , Weinstein is watching Congress as it advances legislation to overhaul health care .
The recession has deepened young adults ' career struggles .
It has also sharpened their interest in health insurance .
Already the least likely of any age group to have coverage , adults in their 20s face brutal job searches and more time uninsured because of the recession .
Nearly 30 percent , 13.2 million , were uninsured in 2007 , according to the Commonwealth Fund , a New York - based research center .
Many young adults work entry - level jobs without insurance and , despite new laws in some states , they 're eventually too old to stay on their parents ' policies .
Ben Brenner , now 23 , could n't find work in finance , his preferred field .
After a four - month search , he took a part - time job for a small real estate agency in Deerfield , Ill. , for an hourly rate and no health benefits .
He was able to stay insured as a dependent on his stepmother 's plan until December .
Then he went without insurance briefly .
Now he has a $ 5,000 deductible he calls " absurdly high " and pays $ 53 a month through a plan designed for young adults .
He " felt relieved knowing I had an insurance card in my wallet . "
He supports the Obama administration 's push to cover more Americans and lower the cost of health care , but is unsure how he feels about tax increases to pay for it .
He 's in favor of requiring everyone to have health insurance .
" I think it should be mandatory to have insurance because if you 're uninsured and you go to the hospital , the taxpayers are footing the bill anyway , " he said .
A June survey for the Kaiser Family Foundation found young adults do n't vary much from their elders in views on health care , said public opinion researcher Mollyann Brodie of Kaiser .
But twentysomethings were nearly twice as likely as senior citizens to say they would be " better off " if President Barack Obama and Congress reformed the health care system .
People in their 20s were more likely than senior citizens to say they would be willing to pay more so that more Americans could be insured .
The nationally representative random sample of 1,205 adults was conducted by land line and cell phone by Princeton Survey Research Associates .
Some features in the health care plans working their way through Congress would benefit young adults .
Depending on their income , they could qualify for subsidies on insurance premiums or , for the poorest , expansion of Medicaid .
One plan allows them to stay on their parents ' policies until age 26 .
Some young adults learn about insurance the hard way .
Nursing student Sarah Posekany is only 27 , but she 's already filed for bankruptcy because of colon surgery when she was uninsured .
She still owes thousands of dollars in medical bills .
" It 's not fair , " said Posekany of Cedar Falls , Iowa .
" We should learn how to be a strong nation and take care of everybody . "
Posekany now has insurance but must wait a year for her pre-existing condition to be covered .
Katie Miletti , 24 , is a full - time college student studying to work with disabled preschoolers .
A survivor of childhood cancer , she still deals with the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy .
After she became too old for coverage under her mother 's policy , she was uninsured about a month before qualifying for Medicaid , the federal - state health insurance program for the needy and disabled .
" Everyone should have health insurance , " said Miletti , who lives in Cuyahoga Falls , Ohio .
" I do n't think it should matter what your health problems are , how rich you are , or what your income is . "
The insurance industry terms this age group " the young invincibles " because many of them think they 'll never get sick or hurt .
Nick Bernstein used to feel that way .
Marking time during the recession , he worked as a waiter with a plan to pay off college loans and get a graduate degree in wine production .
Leisure time was filled with backpacking , mountain climbing and snowboarding .
On April 1 , at Stevens Pass , Wash . , near Seattle , he hit a rock while snowboarding and landed hard , breaking his collarbone and separating his shoulder .
In the ambulance , Bernstein told the paramedics he did n't know if he had insurance .
Luckily , he was still covered under his stepfather 's plan , so the bill for the first $ 27,000 surgery did n't fall solely to him .
But his coverage may end before he 's well .
Doctors recently diagnosed a staph infection .
Temporarily unable to work , he needs to figure out how to get insurance when he turns 25 in November and is dropped from his stepfather 's policy .
When this age group buys insurance , they often opt for cheaper monthly premiums with high deductibles .
But those deductibles , paid out of pocket before coverage kicks in , can lead them to avoid care , experts say .
Joe San Roman , 26 , of Agoura Hills , Calif. , nursed a broken wrist with shots of tequila through the night so he would n't have to pay for an emergency room visit .
He 's insured , but has a $ 1,500 deductible .
He waited until morning when he could get treatment in a visit to his doctor 's office .
" I did n't want to have to drop $ 1,500 , " he said .
At age 28 , Holly Brown 's adulthood has been shaped by the recession .
Laid off from a job she'd held for four years , she 's been unable to find other work .
" I told my mom I might have to marry somebody for their health insurance , " said Brown of Round Lake , Ill. , who has a chronic lung condition .
She 's managed to stay on her company 's health plan through the government COBRA program .
COBRA allows workers to keep their insurance for 18 months after they leave jobs if they pay the premiums , which can be steep .
Congress is considering extending COBRA eligibility even longer .
Already approved are federal subsidies to lower COBRA premiums for some laid - off workers ; Brown qualified for one .
And , her 85 - year - old grandfather stepped up to pay the remaining amount .
" When I got the check from my grandfather , I cried , " she said .

For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence -- on infiltration instead of invasion , on subversion instead of elections , on intimidation instead of free choice , on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day .
It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit , highly efficient machine that combines military , diplomatic , intelligence , economic , scientific and political operations .
- President John F. Kennedy
Secrecy is the slayer of liberty , it is the essence of which dictatorships are made , of which free societies are suffocated by and of which people are subjugated by .
When that secrecy becomes institutionalized in the most powerful corridors of government then it is only a matter of time until that government becomes a weapon of the powerful to be used against the people .
Today , in mid-2009 we here in the United States of America ( or at least those of us who are awake ) are bearing witness to the last vestiges of a once vibrant democracy slowly strangled to death by a deeply embedded culture of secrecy .
There has been a hijacking of the intentions of the founders who envisioned a free people by a corrupt and immoral oligarchy and those who serve it .
It is backed by the rise of a high - tech police state built on on our backs and enforced by Big Brother style surveillance , incessant propaganda and the vicious undercurrent of social manipulation in order to sow the seeds of hatred necessary for divisiveness and ignorance that are protection for the gangster state .
Our last great leader , President John F. Kennedy once warned of the danger of secrecy in a 1961 speech to the American Newspaper Publishers Association :
The very word " secrecy " is repugnant in a free and open society ; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies , to secret oaths and to secret proceedings .
We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it .
Even today , there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions .
Even today , there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it .
And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment .
That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control .
And no official of my Administration , whether his rank is high or low , civilian or military , should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news , to stifle dissent , to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know .
Contrast those words with the acts of the government today , and of the government and of its agents ( both official and clandestine ) since Kennedy 's public brutal murder in Dealey Plaza which served as a crystal clear message to all that if he could be executed publicly in such a manner that nobody was safe .
In the subsequent administrations following that of JFK's , the power of the state was slowly , incrementally increased so as to not alarm a somnolent citizenry .
The rise of the authoritarian fascists who now are at the very pinnacle of their meticulously planned police state did not occur either quickly or without warning , it has been a well thought out , intricately constructed plan that has succeeded largely due to the immersion of official business in a cloud of secrecy .
The early days were largely the work of a small cabal , a few rogue networks run by the real owners of America to implement a system that would serve their interests alone and to brutally put down challenges .
They would count on the ability of the media and the lies to anesthetize the public at large , amuse them , distract them with emotional appeals , ball games , contests and triviality to provide distractions and to remove the necessary civic involvement for democracy to exist .
Today , as we stumble about in a fog amidst the wreckage of the Bush years , the trap is almost closed , facilitated by that holiest of holies that is 9/11 , jusfification for everything .
Our newly minted Emperor Barack Obama has continued the repressive policies of the post 9/11 fascist state .
Our bondage is now sold to us by a charismatic pitchman with the gleaming smile instead of a sneer , the iron fist is covered by a velvet glove .
Obama is the bookend to JFK , the flipside of the coin , most of the dirty work has already been done and he will close the deal now that the hostile takeover has been completed .
He will now carry out the policies of war , oppression , debt slavery and be a guardian of the oligarchy .
Change has indeed come to America , we are now a lawless , modern feudal state ruled by corporations , banks , arms manufacturers , extortionists , gangsters and corrupted politicians who are protected by paramiltary police forces and a media that no longer even pretends to tell the truth .
This is the story of the Octopus ...
I : Cabazon
I am going to begin this installment where I left off with part three , the story of the strange dealings and murders at the Cabazon Indian Reservation in the California desert .
Emmy award winning investigative reporter Nathan Baca of KESQ , a Palm Springs television station has just come out with his latest installment in the excellent series The Octopus Murders .
The series developed out of a Riverside County Sheriff 's Department cold case squad investigation into the 1981 execution style murders of three people in a Rancho Mirage home and the swirling dark dealings that have been associated with those murders .
Cabazon Indian tribe Vice Chairman Fred Alvarez had grown suspicious of shadowy government operatives and arms dealers using the reservation as a testing and development ground from which to profit through the supply of weapons to third world regimes , the type of countries in which the U.S. funded vicious thugs , death squads , assassinations , black ops and in which the American intelligence services such as the CIA played a hand in training the torturers and killers .
The recent Honduran coup and the revelations that some of the leaders received training at Fort Benning 's notoriously vile School of the Americas puts this sort of destabilization ( which was especially in vogue during the era of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush ) back into the headlines albeit several layers below the ongoing Michael Jackson saturation coverage .
Fred Alvarez was going to blow the whistle on how Cabazon sovereign land was being used for nefarious purposes by national security state operatives and the contracting outfits ( CIA fronts ? )
Wackenhut Corporation and Meridian Arms Company .
When interests of this nature are threatened there is a long history of the ' meddlers ' ending up dead ( typically suicides , accidents or ' heart attacks ' ) but the chances of Alvarez blowing up this particular operation which would prove to be huge and multi-faceted , a veritable nexus of clandestine activity during the Reagan years had to be halted with extreme prejudice .
So on July 1 , 1981 Alvarez along with two friends were professionally executed .
The names of the other victims were Patty Castro and Ralph Boger , just collateral damage to the ice cold killers , professionals when it came to protecting the interests of those they were hired by .
But sometimes things like this come back to haunt , Mr. Boger 's daughter , Rachel Begley has tirelessly investigated the murder of her father ( her website is Desertfae and she also maintains The Octopus Wiki ) and the cold case investigation had worked it's way through the system to the California Department of Justice where it is now effectively stalled .
These murders are the key to a dangerous Pandora 's box that if opened would implicate numerous top political figures , expose the way that the deep state really operates and offer a true glimpse behind the star spangled façade of false morality that America exists behind .
It would also show that the PROMIS software , the legendary , highly advanced program that has been integral in the formation of the police state infrastructure was modified for espionage and profit on Cabazon Indian land .
To say that this is the story of the century is not mere hyperbole , the trail of dead bodies over the years can attest to that and it is time that it be told .
Joseph Daniel Casolaro 1947-1991
II : Danny Casolaro and the Octopus
How much violence was there in Nazi Germany ... before the old Germany , the center of theatre , opera , philosophy , poetry , psychology and medicine was destroyed ?
How many incidents took place that were not coincidental before it was called Fascism ?
What were the transitions ?
How many people ?
Was it when the first tailor disappeared ?
Or librarian ?
Or professor ?
Or when the first press was closed or the first song eliminated ?
Or when the first political science teacher was killed coming home on his bike ?
How many incidents happened that were perfectly normal until people woke up and said , ' Hey , we 're in a police state ! '
- Mae Brussell
According to the book The Octopus : Secret Government and the Death of Danny Casolaro by Kenn Thomas and Jim Keith casolaro had identified a core group of individuals operating within the national security apparatus and their influence in post WW II political history :
Danny Casolaro believed the Octopus responsible for criminal conspiracies , which , linked , formed a virtual history of intelligence double dealing from 1950 to the present .
These events , in Casolaro 's view , included the ousters of US President Richard Nixon , Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam , the Shah of Iran , and the murders of Chilean President Allende , and of course , of President John F. Kennedy .
Casolaro saw the Octopus ' tentacles entwined throughout the creation of the Golden Triangle and the Latin American drug trade , the Cuban Bay of Pigs debacle , the October Surprise , the BCCI banking scandal , and , almost as an afterthought , the theft of PROMIS software .
Casolaro found a " Secret Team " , a high cabal of players operating a clandestine , parallel government , identified previously by other writers [ Col. L. Fletcher Prouty ] .
The cabal had operated beyond the control or scrutiny of elected government , financed by drug- running from Southeast Asia and the Americas .
Other researchers tended to see the Octopus as a fog of political crimes ascribed to the alphabet soup of intelligence agencies , institutions or even the modern terrorist state and its citizenry .
Casolaro's Octopus , however , was no grand , unified mega - conspiracy theory .
Casolaro believed the crimes could best be identified by linking them to a small network of named individuals that made up his Octopus .
He outlined their hierarchy and provided specific detail about their behind - the - scenes role in contemporary political history .
Casolaro named people both familiar and unfamiliar to other researchers .
He deemed the " first level " operatives to be Richard Helms , George Pender , John Philip Nichols and Ray Cline .
The second level included Robert Chasen , E. Howard Hunt , Edwin Wilson , Thomas Clines and Ted Shackley .
Working backward from the PROMIS theft , Casolaro saw them in a new relationship , a nearly organic entity that impacted both past and then current events .
When it comes to the mysterious deaths related to this story , free lance investigative journalist Danny Casolaro , who was ' suicided ' in a Martinsburg , West Virginia hotel room in August 1991 is the most notable for he was getting close to the truth .
His body was found by a maid in the bathtub in a grisly blood - spattered bathroom , his wrists had been deeply slashed numerous times .
In what is a discernable pattern , many of those who threaten the hidden power are found in hotel rooms , allegedly the victims of suicides even though as in Casolaro 's case the victim did not appear to friends , family and associates as being despondent or otherwise suicidal .
In his case it was quite the opposite , Casolaro had been devoted to an investigation into a covert network of spooks , criminals and government officials that he had called ' The Octopus . '
He had been working on a book and according to sources , had gone to West Virginia in pursuit of a final piece of evidence that would break the case .
His files , which he carried everywhere , were missing when his body was discovered .
Adding to the suspicious circumstances , the room where he was found was professionally cleaned preventing further investigation and the body was illegally embalmed before the family could claim his remains .
Casolaro had been putting together connections involving some of the most critical and dangerous elements of the deep state and he was threatening powerful interests .
He had traced an ' dirty old boy ' network of the OSS / CIA that had gotten together for profit in the aftermath of WW II .
That critical period for the U.S. presented an unprecedented opportunity for some to profit from the military industrial complex ( which has never been dismantled despite the ominous warnings from President Eisenhower in his farewell address ) and the wave of anti-communist paranoia that would be used in order to justify the most extreme and immoral conduct by elements connected to the U.S. Government .
It is well documented that the CIA assimilated former Nazi war criminals into the ranks ostensibly to be used in the fight against the red menace but many of the scientists ended up participating in the darkest forms of research involving mind control techniques and the evolution of the American space / defense sector where they worked on weaponry .
Rescued Nazis were also sent to South America where they would assist in supporting right - wing regimes to against the rise of popular movements that could threaten western business interests .
In addition to the merger with some of the most foul remnants of Hitler 's Reich such as the Gehlen Org , the bogeyman of an international communist conspiracy also gave rise to networks of money laundering , drug trafficking and arms dealings that would make the business of the warfare state into a very lucrative trade .
Corrupt insiders were able to play both ends against the middle and had no qualms about cutting deals with some of the most unsavory and violent types .
Danny Casolaro had been able to find a common denominator , a thread that ran through some of the most prevalent schemes and scandals of the time .
Brian 's Hadron Inc , in which he was allied with longtime Reagan crony Edwin Meese would be instrumental in the misappropriation , modification and subsequent sale of PROMIS to foreign governments .
The entire sordid business of what was done is a proverbial snakepit without a bottom and it taps into many elements of the vast criminality that had infected the system .
There is a very good reason for the trail of dead bodies ( including Casolaro ) , wrecked careers , ginned up charges leading to imprisonment and disinformation that has orbited the PROMIS scandal .
But I am getting ahead of myself so I digress ... Danny Casolaro had been able to find a common denominator , a thread that ran through some of the most prevalent schemes and scandals of the time .
Iran -Contra Reagan 's secret wars in Latin America , BCCI The October Surprise , the INSLAW case and PROMIS and was set to visit Indio California and the Cabazon reservation .
He was onto something and it was big enough to put the fear into some very serious people .
Not only was he investigating ties between global arms dealers and government operatives tied to Iran - Contra ( one of the greatest scandals of the 20th century in both audacity and magnitude one which is still not completely understood ) but the very ascension of Reagan to the presidency ( along with the true power that was George H.W. Bush ) which was facilitated when a deal was cut to prolong the Iran hostage crisis until after Jimmy Carter was defeated .
This is high treason of course , something that the Bushes and their ilk are intimately familiar with but the manipulation of the 1980 election could be viewed as a bloodless coup in that it brought the deep state and the shadow government into the White House itself .
Now another person of interest involved in the Iran hostages deal includes a figure named Earl Brian , an intimate of Reagan who was in on the Paris sessions to delay hostage release for political benefit .
For a payment he was allegedly allowed to profit from the sale of the stolen version of INSLAW 's PROMIS software .
Brian 's Hadron Inc , in which he was allied with longtime Reagan crony Edwin Meese would be instrumental in the misappropriation , modification and subsequent sale of PROMIS to foreign governments .
The entire sordid business of what was done is a proverbial snakepit without a bottom and it taps into many elements of the vast criminality that had infected the system .
There is a very good reason for the trail of dead bodies ( including Casolaro ) , wrecked careers , ginned up charges leading to imprisonment and disinformation that has orbited the PROMIS scandal .
Lt. Col. Oliver North also may have been using the program .
According to several intelligence community sources , PROMIS was in use at a 6,100 - square - foot command center built on the sixth floor of the Justice Department .
According to both a contractor who helped design the center and information disclosed during the Iran - Contra hearings , Oliver North had a similar , but smaller , White House operations room that was connected by computer link to the DOJ 's command center .
Using the computers in his command center , North tracked dissidents and potential troublemakers within the United States as part of a domestic emergency preparedness program , commissioned under Reagan 's Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , according to sources and published reports .
Using PROMIS , sources point out , North could have drawn up lists of anyone ever arrested for a political protest , for example , or anyone who had ever refused to pay their taxes .
Compared to PROMIS , Richard Nixon 's enemies list or Sen. Joe McCarthy 's blacklist look downright crude .
This operation was so sensitive that when Rep. Jack Brooks asked North about it during the Iran - Contra hearings , the hearing was immediately suspended pending an executive ( secret ) conference .
When the hearings were reconvened , the issue of North 's FEMA dealings was dropped .
Casolaro had been concentrating on the INSLAW case around the time of his demise .
He had been receiving information from insiders within the intelligence community that would bring to light the use of PROMIS by the government .
One source was a civilian employee of the NSA named Alan Standorf whose body was found in the back seat of his car in an airport parking lot , it was set up to look like he was the victim of a robbery .
Sources say that he may have been providing Casolaro with proof that the NSA was using PROMIS but as with so many others who crossed paths with The Octopus he became collateral damage .
As to who ' suicided ' Danny Casolaro and most importantly why , there may never be an answer .
Casolaro had his fingers in too many pies and the nexus of evil that he was untangling was just too huge for the investigation to have ended any way but badly for him .
III : Common Threads
When researching the shadow government or Deep State it is amazing how so many of the same names keep popping up .
One of those names belongs to Robert Booth Nichols , a longtime player who was recently back in the news .
Mr. Nichols , who died under strange circumstances back in February was involved with the current financial crisis through Sam Israel , one of the thousands of Bernie Madoffs that have been using intricately structured financial instruments , shady hedge funds and offshore banking to destabilize America from within as though it were just another banana republic .
The opaque , above the law , rigged games that have brought the country to the brink of ruination for the benefit of a corrupt oligarchy have working blueprints in CIA / shadow government fronts of the past such as BCCI and the Nugan Hand Bank and there is no reliable way of knowing just how much of the finance , insurance and real estate ( F.I.R.E. ) economy is derived from such shady organizations .
Now back to Robert Booth Nichols who prior to his death was involved in a complex financial scheme with
Now what is of greater interest pertaining to Nichols is that he was deeply involved in the Cabazon Reservation activities as well as tied in to Danny Casolaro 's doomed investigation of The Octopus .
Nichols had contributed much to Casolaro and he had previously worked as a partner of political prisoner
Riconosciuto was the technical wizard who performed the alteration of the PROMIS software on the reservation to include the " back door " feature that would go on to figure so prominently in the espionage activities that it was later used for - political and financial .
With the activities at the reservation including weapons development , training of paramilitaries and money laundering it was a veritable spook nest and the use of sovereign Indian lands for unauthorized purposes is something that needs to be seriously investigated .
Author Joel Bainerman , in his book
With Nichols being a connected guy he would be a hugely important source for Casolaro , or was he a disinformation agent ?
According to sources , Nichols and Casolaro spoke often and at length in the month before Casolaro 's demise .
Nichols , it must be noted also allegedly had organized crime ties to the
The presence of Robert Booth Nichols in the milieu surrounding Casolaro 's research as well as with Bayou Investments and the $ 250 billion treasury note is just another example of the interconnectivity between the underworld and the overworld .
The financial aspects of this cannot be downplayed in the wake of the global meltdown that is largely due to the shadow banking system comprised of offshore banks largely exempt from U.S. laws , money laundering , pools of black money , narcotics / weapons dealing profits and speculative finance that have been a permanent fixture of the oligarchy 's financial matrix .
Any legitimate investigation of power in the U.S. must include an analysis of intricate financial institutions , layered in Enron style subversion and patterned after CIA / Wall Street front companies expressly created for the purpose of funding off the books operations .
I would strongly suspect that the amount of money laundering , involvement with organized crime , narcotics and weapons dealing that is being currently conducted is stunning .
Only the recent high profile cases like that of Alan Stanford who has been tied to such dirty activities as well as Madoff and Israel get the attention but they are the proverbial tip of the iceberg .
Without digressing too much I just want to point out that much of the post WW II intelligence apparatus including the cowboys who were at the heart of the original Octopus were directly tied to the Eastern establishment , Skull and Bones types from which the OSS / CIA was comprised of .
This being said , it is only natural that such grand scale financial chicanery and speculation has come to dominate both the U.S. economy as well as the government itself which is so thoroughly intertwined with the pirates that the schemes of the Wall Street high rollers are preserved at the expense of the millions of lesser beings whose lives are being destroyed by the ongoing greed and the subsidizing of such by a system gone cancerous .
Now back to Robert Booth Nichols who prior to his death was involved in a complex financial scheme with Samuel Israel and Bayou Investments involving a fee of $ 10 million to be paid to Nichols for services rendered for assistance in the locating of a mysterious $ 250 billion U.S. treasury note that is secured by 2,500 metric tons of gold that sits in the Atlanta Federal Reserve .
Israel , who after being convicted for large scale financial fraud faked his own suicide , allegedly jumping off of a bridge and leaving on the hood of his SUV traced in dust the words " Suicide is Painless " never was able to obtain the T - Note ( which was sitting in a London Safe Deposit Company and has been seized ) subsequently sued Nichols for get this , cheating him .
Now here is the kicker , according to papers filed by Nichols the transaction was conducted under the premise of " matters of national interest " and according to a Bloomberg story ( Bayou 's Israel Was Cheated in Scam Investigator Says ) was vouched for by a member of the Bush family , John P. Ellis whose previous claim to fame was calling the rigged 2000 election for George W. Bush while working for FOX News .
When doing an objective review of the myriad scandals and dirty deeds in America over the past 50 or so years it is astounding just how many times that a member of the Bush crime family is involved but more on them later .
Now what is of greater interest pertaining to Nichols is that he was deeply involved in the Cabazon Reservation activities as well as tied in to Danny Casolaro 's doomed investigation of The Octopus .
Nichols had contributed much to Casolaro and he had previously worked as a partner of political prisoner Michael Riconosciuto on projects on weapons development at the Cabazon Indian Reservation and the ongoing activities there through the company Meridian Arms .
Riconosciuto was the technical wizard who performed the alteration of the PROMIS software on the reservation to include the " back door " feature that would go on to figure so prominently in the espionage activities that it was later used for - political and financial .
With the activities at the reservation including weapons development , training of paramilitaries and money laundering it was a veritable spook nest and the use of sovereign Indian lands for unauthorized purposes is something that needs to be seriously investigated .
Author Joel Bainerman , in his book The Crimes of a President referred to the reservation as a " CIA cutout " , with the revelations in Baca 's KESQ series that three other local Indian tribes were also being investigated in the Alvarez murders and the weapons testing activities at the Cabazon reservation the question is to what extent has this sort of piggybacking of black ops on sovereign land existed throughout the and for how long .
With Nichols being a connected guy he would be a hugely important source for Casolaro , or was he a disinformation agent ?
According to sources , Nichols and Casolaro spoke often and at length in the month before Casolaro 's demise .
Nichols , it must be noted also allegedly had organized crime ties to the Gambino crime family as well as to the Japanese Yakuza .
It has already been established that the CIA and Shadow Government had regularly worked with organized crime figures ( see Operation Underworld ) including those who had been burned by Castro 's takeover of Cuba .
Again , the war against communism , Cuba in this case provided blanket justification for lawlessness , nefarious alliances and the deviation from accepted American ideals .
With Nazi war criminals already on board with the CIA , ties with The Syndicate were consistent with the pattern .
In this context , the question must be asked regarding Robert Booth Nichols and whether he was sanctioned as a contact with the organized crime elements on behalf of the establishment .
It should be recognized that the mob played a part in forging the political careers of many an influential U.S. figures , Ronald Reagan and Richard M. Nixon to name a few .
and , it would be naïve to not believe that many of our elected representatives are not just as much in the pockets of organized crime as they are with other interests that threaten the system as a whole .
( I would recommend this piece as food for thought as it references a current influential politican who has been a party to much of the overt criminality of the past several years , primarily as an accomplice ) .
The presence of Robert Booth Nichols in the milieu surrounding Casolaro 's research as well as with Bayou Investments and the $ 250 billion treasury note is just another example of the interconnectivity between the underworld and the overworld .
The financial aspects of this cannot be downplayed in the wake of the global meltdown that is largely due to the shadow banking system comprised of offshore banks largely exempt from U.S. laws , money laundering , pools of black money , narcotics / weapons dealing profits and speculative finance that have been a permanent fixture of the oligarchy 's financial matrix .

IV : Tentacles of the Octopus
" We will know that we have succeeded when everything the public believes is false . "
- William J. Casey
It must be understood that there has always been a powerful segment of this country that has been enamored with fascism as the perfect sort of government that would support the long - term evolution of capitalism itself .
Fortune Magazine once featured a fawning cover story extolling the virtues of Benito Mussolini 's corporatist / fascist state in pre-WW II Italy and even Hitler had ardent admirers in America .
It can not be emphasized strongly enough that the precursors to today 's Wall Street ruling elite were perfectly willing to do business with the Nazi regime as long as it was in their short term financial interests to do so .
Let me be emphatic that this is NOT an attack on capitalism itself but rather on those who are able to use the system to advance their interests and agendas and to destroy any and all impediments and obstacles .
I would like to opine that the system is fatally flawed and like communism , contains the seeds of its own demise , what is going on right now is a testament to that
The conditions for the creation of the Octopus , or as In order for the bastardized form of capitalism that exists today ( largely through the machinations of those that I am addressing in this section ) to continue to evolve it mush become much more authoritarian in nature , the early forms of fascism are too ostentatious for the more sophisticated era in which we now live so we need to look more to China as the current role model .
For profit prisons , all encompassing surveillance , a militarized police state , compromised courts and above all the possibility of disappearance into a gulag system with no trial and the nearly codified indefinite detention along with torture must be a tool for which to exercise control over the dissenters and the rabble .
The conditions for the creation of the Octopus , or as Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty would refer to it , a Secret Team were set into motion with Harry S. Truman 's much maligned creation of the National Security State with the signing into law of the National Security Act of 1947 .
This set into up the post WW II world and allowed for the use of the intelligence services to be used to perpetuate their wartime stance into a permanent fixture of U.S. policy .
The act also created the CIA although its original mandate would be expanded to include the anti-democratic functions that it has since become known for .
In creating the CIA , the successor of the wartime Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) there would be no end to the warfare state , only a redirection into clandestine and covert activities that would include destabilization of governments deemed ' unfriendly ' to U.S. interests , propaganda , sabotage , training and support of paramilitary forces and above all snooping .
Being that the OSS largely grew out of the Eastern Establishment and the Skull and Bones types ( from which it drew recruits ) it would naturally serve the interests of Wall Street finance oligarchs , corporations , industrialists , oil barons and other moguls .
It would also due to the very nature of secrecy under which it existed be a fertile ground for rogue elements , private CIA 's within the CIA so to speak .
created to serve as an enforcement arm for the Wall Street elite and the money power , its primary obligation is not to the United States itself but that element that exists in the shadows .
I recommend reading : I do want to state that the CIA is far from the only U.S. intelligence agency , there are many and too often they are lumped in with the CIA as it is the most prominent .
There are at least sixteen separate intelligence agencies and those are only the ones that we know about and there is often collaboration with foreign intelligence to circumvent laws and ensure plausible deniability .
The CIA though is unique in that it wasto serve as an enforcement arm for the Wall Street elite and the money power , its primary obligation is not to the United States itself but that element that exists in the shadows .
I recommend reading : How the CIA Created a Ruling , Corporate Overclass in America for some very good examples .

But I digress ....
The OSS was also a breeding ground for virulent right - wingers , military men and dyed in the wool fascists with axes to grind against the communist devils .
One of these men was General
, as legend has it , was involved with gold taken from vanquished WW II enemies ( see Now let me make it clear that I personally have an attitude of ambivalence towards mob and organized crime in general , it 's just another line of work as far as I am concerned .
So with that out of the way what I do have a problem with are government bureaucrats , U.S. military and intelligence and elected officials crossing the line into where they become gangsters themselves by working with organized crime .
This is a very important aspect in what has gone seriously wrong in America post WW II in that the lines were not only blurred but the shadow government and the mob ( as well as international organized crime syndicates ) actively joined forces , knowingly and willingly for an agenda that ran counter to long term American interests and the CIA was responsible for allowing this to happen .
But I digress .... The OSS was also a breeding ground for virulent right - wingers , military men and dyed in the wool fascists with axes to grind against the communist devils .
One of these men was General Edward Lansdale , a serious reactionary who was involved in anti-Castro plotting and allegedly , according to some , notably L. Fletcher Prouty was in Dallas on the day of the Kennedy assassination ( as were others including Richard M. Nixon and George H.W. Bush but more on that in the next section ) where he was allegedly seen in the vicinity of the ' three tramps ' .
Other prominent spooks from the OSS would include future CIA chiefs William Colby ( also of the Phoenix Program ) and William Casey whose tenure under Reagan would occur during the Iran - Contra period and intersect with the PROMIS software ordeal .
General Lansdale , as legend has it , was involved with gold taken from vanquished WW II enemies ( see Yamashita 's Gold ) and using it to provide funding for black operations .
The illegal narcotics trade would also prove to be a useful source in providing operational money for secret wars and off the books operations .
Lansdale 's work against the Castro regime would bring him into contact with Theodore Shackley aka The Blond Ghost out of the Miami JMWAVE headquarters [ note that George Bush 's Zapata Corporation also allegedly had ties to this operation , likely a CIA front ] .
Ted Shackley would go on to turn up in an astounding number of scandals and shadow government operations over the years .
Shackley was identified by Danny Casolaro as a part of the dirty old boy network that would become The Octopus so keep that in mind .
When the work against Cuba was no longer a top priority with the Vietnam War ratcheting up ,

To Be Continued ...
Iranian hardliners ' attempts to resist the country 's biggest uprising for decades appeared to be weakening today as popular pressure forced officials to announce a recount of disputed votes from Friday 's presidential elections .
In a move that appeared to represent a further concession from the authorities , the country 's powerful guardian council said it was ready to hold a recount in areas disputed by opposition candidates .
No details of the scope of the recount and who would carry it out were available , though the council said it had rejected opposition demands to annul the official result , which saw the hardline incumbent , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , declared winner by a landslide .
The council , which consists of 12 senior clerics , was reported to have said that a recount could lead to changes in the votes recorded for the candidates , but some analysts said it would not necessarily bring a change in the final result .
The decision by the guardian council follows the first known bloodshed of the crisis .
At least seven people were killed yesterday after a rally in Tehran when tens of thousands of protesters jammed the streets in a show of defiance against the Iranian regime .
A rally scheduled for this afternoon by supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , who came second in the presidential poll according to the official results , was called off hours before it was due to start , but it remains likely that protesters will take to the streets .
Social networking sites used by Mousavi 's supporters had talked of fears that the rally would be attacked by militias they claimed were loyal to Ahmadinejad .
A spokesman for Mousavi was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying : " Mousavi … urged his supporters not to attend today 's rally to protect their lives .
The moderates ' rally has been cancelled . "
The same call for people to stay off the streets was made by Mousavi yesterday , but tens if not hundreds of thousands joined a seemingly spontaneous protest which had been banned by the regime .
A pro-Ahmadinejad rally is also to be held this afternoon , raising further fears of clashes between supporters of the two men .
Iran was again rocked today by a series of fast - moving and complex developments , sometimes seemingly contradictory , as the world watched the efforts of the once all - powerful establishment in the Islamic republic to control events .
In key developments today :
• Two major figures from the reformist movement were arrested .
Mohammad Ali Abtahi and Saeed Hajarian both supported Mousavi and were senior advisers to the former reformist president , Mohammad Khatami .
• Clashes and mass arrests were reported on university campuses of those supporting Mousavi .
• State television claimed that the " main agents " in post-election unrest had been arrested with explosives and guns .
It gave no further details .
• President Ahmadinejad left Iran to attend a summit in Russia where he failed to mention the crisis gripping his country .
This morning , state radio said the deaths of seven people happened when shooting erupted after a group at the protest " tried to attack a military location " in western Tehran .
The first fatality came as shots were fired at supporters of Mousavi who had marched in their thousands through the city centre to Azadi ( Freedom ) Square , demanding that the election result be annulled .
Basij militiamen linked to Iran 's powerful Revolutionary Guard were said to have been responsible for the shooting .
Precise figures for the scale of the demonstration were not available , but some estimates suggested that more than 500,000 people were involved in the protest against the election " theft " .
" Mousavi , we support you !
We will die but regain our votes , " supporters , many wearing the green of the moderate 's election campaign , shouted .
Many carried signs that read : " Where is my vote ? "
Several vehicles were set alight in Tehran 's streets , and there were reports that protesters had taken to city rooftops at nightfall yesterday , shouting " death to the dictator " .
The presence of huge crowds on the streets , and reports of other fatalities , appeared to dash earlier predictions that the unrest of the past three days would fade away .
There was a further twist yesterday when it was announced that Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , had ordered the guardian council to investigate claims of election fraud .
Diplomatic sources said this was not a major shift , suggesting Khamenei had merely warned Mousavi that he should proceed with his fraud complaints carefully , using only " legal " means available to him .
Khamenei endorsed the election result on Saturday , dashing opposition hopes that he might be persuaded to order a recount or even annul the outcome .
The interior ministry , which announced the election result on Saturday , and the president , have rejected charges of fraud .
Ahmadinejad compared protesters to football fans angry that their team had lost .
However , questions were asked about how 40 m Iranian votes had been counted and the results announced so soon after the polls closed .
There was no sign of the anger diminishing .
" Many of my friends are in prison , " Saman Imani , a student who was beaten by police , said .
" Iran is becoming a dictatorship .
Ahmadinejad is denying the Holocaust because he's as brutal as Hitler was . "
Ebrahim Yazdi , the leader of the banned opposition Freedom Movement and a veteran of the revolution , warned that Ahmadinejad 's attacks on his opponents had opened a " Pandora 's box " which had led to a deep crisis within the regime .
" The result of such a crisis now is that the rift among the ... personalities of the revolution is getting deeper , " he said .
" It is also between people and their government ... a rift between state and the nation .
It is the biggest crisis since the revolution . "
Further reports told of people in Isfahan , Ahwaz , Zahedan , Yazd and Mashhad shouting " Allahu Akbar [ God is great ] " in support of the Tehran demonstrations .
Governments around the world were watching the situation closely .
" The implications are not yet clear , " David Miliband , the foreign secretary , said .
The US president , Barack Obama , said he was " deeply troubled " by the post-election violence .
" It is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran 's leaders will be , " he said .
" We respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran . "
‘ It started out like a normal cage fight .
They had this guy in the ring called Straight Dave .
He was all dressed up in camouflage with a beard and looked like Ted Nugent .
He had these t- shirts he was throwing into the crowd that were vulgar and very anti-gay .
Anyway this Straight Dave , who was really getting the crowd going , was Sacha ; not that anyone knew that .
Then Straight Dave said , when the crowd were really worked up : ‘ If there ’s any gay person out there I ’ll fight you right now ’ .
He had a plant in the crowd who at this point climbed into the ring .
They pretended to fight for a few moments .
Then they started to make out in the cage .
A Spanish bakery accused of barbaric behaviour towards an illegal worker will face " the full weight of the law " , the government has vowed .
The statement comes amid shock over the case of a Bolivian worker whose arm was cut off in an accident at work .
Bosses at the bakery in Valencia are accused of dumping him 100 m ( 330 feet ) from the hospital entrance and throwing the severed limb in a rubbish bin .
A Spanish trade union has lodged a complaint against the bakery .
The union - the Workers Commissions ( CCOO ) - claims that in the early hours of 28 May , the arm of Franns Rilles was severed in a kneading machine while he was working .
It was allegedly dumped in a rubbish bin and only discovered by police the following day , by which time it was too late to reattach it .
Investigation
Mr Rilles was allegedly warned by the son of the bakery owner not to tell doctors where his accident had taken place , and was left a distance of some 100 m from the hospital entrance , while bleeding heavily .
Mr Rilles , 33 , had worked 12 - hour days at the bakery , earning 23 euros a day ( £ 20 ; $ 32 ) under no contract , for about a year and a half , the union says .
He is recovering in hospital , reported Spanish news agency Efe .
Police are investigating allegations of mistreatment .
The case has made national headlines , and on Thursday Work and Immigration Minister Celestino Corbacho vowed that " the weight of the law " would come down on the bakery if the allegations are substantiated .
Mr Corbacho said abusive practices were on the rise as workers ' vulnerability jobs increased amid the economic downturn .
The bakery has reportedly been shut down and two bosses detained .
The government is considering granting Mr Rilles temporary residency in Spain on exceptional humanitarian grounds , Spain 's El Pais newpaper reported .
CARLISLE , ENGLAND — Sylvia Hodges has not yet decided how to cast her vote in elections next month to the European Parliament , but she knows who she wo n’t support .
“ Certainly not Labor or the Conservatives , ” said Ms. Hodges , a 76 - year - old retired office worker , referring to the two main parties in Britain , whose representatives in Parliament have been engulfed in a scandal over their expense accounts .
“ It ’s disgusting for them to stand there and say they have done nothing wrong , ” she said , standing on the doorstep of her home in a neat row of houses in this city not far from the border of Scotland .
Ms. Hodges is so angry with London politicians that she is considering a vote for the far - right British National Party , one of several smaller parties hoping to capitalize on an extraordinary tide of discontent with established leaders .
Amazing Photos of Gargoyles and Grotesques
Choosing interesting topics to shoot is one of the obvious keys of photography , but turning interesting subjects into awesome photos is easier said than done .
This selection of cool Gargoyles and Grotesques , we think , makes that transition .
As you might expect with any set of photos of Gargoyles , black and white imagery has a fairly prominent place in this set .
Something about the Gothic subject matter makes it almost obligatory .
But you might be a little surprised at the eeriness of the colour photos in the set .
We thought they were more than worthy of inclusion too .
Some of these shots also had a helping hand with Photoshop and we ’re sure you will agree that the artists did a pretty good job of bringing out the haunting feeling of the subject .
Tenants ' in most debt since 80s '
By Brian Milligan
Business reporter , BBC News
Pressures are mounting on both landlords and tenants UK housing tenants are more in debt than at any time since the late 1980s , a landlords group has said .
Hundreds of thousands are falling behind with rental payments , largely due to rising unemployment , according to the National Landlords Association .
The situation was " pretty dire " with at least a third of members owed money , the association added .
In the past year , the association has taken more than 20,000 calls from landlords worried about rent arrears .
' Stressful ' Landlord Rukhsana Kashmiri is owed nearly £ 9,000 in rent on her property in north London , after both her tenants lost their jobs .
" I 'm on anti-depressants and pain - killers , " she says .
" My health is not good , and my whole body is aching . "
However tenants are also coming under severe strain .
Zoe Abbey , 21 , from Watford , fell behind with her rent after failing to find a job .
Landlords should talk to their tenants - give them a breathing space
Duncan Shrubsole
Crisis
And she said the process of being evicted from her flat was extremely stressful .
" It was n't very nice .
You 've got the landlord on the door all the time , and you 're getting letters . "
Apart from rising unemployment , another issue is that housing benefit is now paid directly to tenants .
Many landlords used to receive the payments themselves .
There can also be a delay of up to two months before housing benefit comes through .
Sympathy plea Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Adam Sampson , of the housing charity Shelter , said the government should now offer support to tenants in the same way it has given help to debt - laden homeowners .
" The government needs to look to see how the payment of housing benefit can be speeded up .
Otherwise more tenants are likely to become homeless . "
Landlords are also being urged to be sympathetic to the plight of tenants who lose their jobs , and cannot pay their rent as a result .
" They should talk to their tenants - give them a breathing space , " said Duncan Shrubsole from the charity Crisis .
With unemployment expected to rise further over the coming months , most expect rental arrears to go up too , with observers saying this will inevitably also lead to more evictions as well .

History and Culture
If you needed to pick one day in history to sum up Diego Maradona ’s life , it would easily be June 22 , 1986 .
In front of a crowd of almost 115,000 people in Mexico City ’s Estadio Azteca , the Legend from Lanús was leading the Argentine National Soccer Team against rival England in a quarterfinal match of the FIFA World Cup Tournament .
Most athletes would be happy to make just one of the most memorable moments in the history of their sports on its biggest stage .
But on this day in 1986 , a single moment of glory was n’t enough for Maradona .
Then again , very few people would have the cajones to claim that Maradona is anything like most other athletes .
It all started six minutes into the second half , with the two football powerhouses deadlocked in a scoreless tie .
A fellow teammate tried to set up Maradona , but the pass went awry , ending up at the foot of an English defenseman .
Attempting to clear the ball out of the zone , the Brit connected awkwardly and unintentionally lobbed it towards the goalkeeper .
As the ball hung in the air , Maradona , whose listed height of 5 ’ 5 ” may be as generous as that of Mother Theresa , broke for it and jumped in front of the goalie .
With his arm tucked close to his body , the Argentine reached out and poked the ball with his fist , sending it over the goalkeeper and bouncing into the goal .
Though it seems obvious on television replays and YouTube videos , it was then impossible for the referee to see what had happened in real time .
Maradona would say after the game that the goal was scored partially with his own head , and partially with the “ Hand of God . ”
While this is the goal that most Londoners prefer to talk about , what happened next was even more amazing .
Four minutes after the “ Hand of God ” goal , Maradona received the ball about ten yards from the middle of the field .
He then proceeded to run 60 meters , making more than half of the English team look foolish as they tried to stop him .
( Just in case their kids or grandkids are reading , the embarrassed British players were : Stephen Hodge , Peter Beardsley , Peter Reid , Terry Butcher , Terry Fenwick and goalie Peter Shilton . )
Ten seconds later , the ball was again in England ’s goal , and Argentina had a 2 - 0 lead .
This amazing feat was voted “ The Goal of the Century ” by FIFA in 2002 .
Argentina won the game 2 - 1 , and went on to win the World Cup , though some England fans still claim that the victory was illegitimate .
Argentina supporters often retort that the British should have been disqualified for playing two different men named “ Terry . ”
Nevertheless , the game serves as the perfect metaphor for the life of Maradona .
Only he could mix excellence and controversy so perfectly , and have so much fun doing so .
Maradona ’s incredible skill , humble beginnings and outspoken nature have made him a mythical and irreplaceable figure in Argentine culture .
For example , since Maradona ’s jersey bore the number 10 , cashiers routinely ask for “ un Diego ” when selling goods costing $ 10 pesos .
This football legend ’s only real competition to the title “ Greatest Footballer Ever ” is Pelé , although most knowledgeable soccer fans who are not already loyal to Brazil know that this comparison is n’t even close .
As the rest of the world attempts to anoint the fleet - footed Leo Messi as the heir apparent , Argentines scoff at the notion , knowing that there will only every be one true Number 10 .
Whether he was starting for Argentinos Juniors , Napoli or the Argentine National Team , there has always been more to Maradona than just football .
The public often loves watching their heroes fail , possibly so they can feel , if just for a second , a little closer to greatness .
Maradona has given his fans plenty of these opportunities .
Mixing financial problems , custody disputes and health issues , his personal life has kept Argentina enthralled for decades .
Perhaps the most publicized of these issues is his drug use .
He has had alcohol and cocaine problems throughout the years , and was kicked out of the 1994 World Cup for testing positive for illegal ephedrine doping .
Maradona claimed innocence , though his sordid past did not help his image in front of the FIFA jury .
Maradona has always been outspoken about his political beliefs .
A vociferous supporter of both Carlos Menem and Hugo Chavez , he has a picture of Fidel Castro tattooed on his left leg to match the Che Guevara tattoo on his right arm .
He has spoken out publicly against the United States and former President George W. Bush ( though , who has n’t done that ? ) .
Even more recently , Maradona expressed his support for Iran by sending an autographed shirt to be displayed in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Museum .
His frankness has only added to his legend and has transformed him into a character that really is bigger than life .
As the current head coach of the Argentine National Team , Maradona has been given a new pulpit from which he can speak his mind .
Although after years of controversy and glory , Maradona ’s hijinks are rarely surprising .
Not long ago , Pelé questioned his longtime rival ’s status as a role model for children , citing his history of drug abuse .
Maradona responded by saying that Pelé “ lost his virginity to a man . ”
Nobody even blinked .
If anyone else would have said that , chances are he would lose his job .
With Maradona , however , it ’s just another day at the office .
Maradona ’s popularity is not limited to Argentina .
He is one of the most well - known celebrities in the entire world , and continues to inspire awe in those who watched him play .
For instance , the Church of Maradona was founded in Rosario in 1998 .
Today the church has over 100,000 registered members , from more than 60 different countries .
Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho admitted to wanting an autograph for his son when he heard Maradona was coming to Italy to watch a game .
Likewise , Scottish halfback Alan Hutton made a similar request leading up to an international friendly against Argentina .
With the 2010 World Cup fast approaching , Maradona will likely garner even more attention and will certainly add to his ever - growing legend .
He will have even more microphones shoved in his face , and will be in the center of the world .
And that ’s right where the world , especially Argentina , wants him to be .

Want to see an Argentine football game for yourself ?
You can now book tickets through us !
The following blog post , unless otherwise noted , was written by a member of Gamasutras community .
The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company .
Yesterday Jim Greer ( CEO of Kongregate ) and I gave a talk at Casual Connect in Seattle titled Fatal Flaws in Flash Games .
I also talked a bit about common flaws in entry - level Flash development philosophies and practices .
There are already a few summaries of the talk , and I thought I ’d take a moment to post my raw preparation notes , which include some stuff that I did n’t get a chance to discuss .
# 1 You 're Making a Game , Not a Homework Assignment
We live in a culture of being assigned a task , producing something that is asked of us , and being evaluated based on the level of quality of that product .
We 've spent at least a decade writing book reports , solving math equations , and analyzing the reasons behind the American Civil War .
Once we enter the real world , in most jobs , this mindset transfers over pretty well .
Your boss gives you an assignment , you get it done , and the timeliness and level of quality is evaluated .
This does n't cut it with making games .
Your player only cares about how fun your game is , not the amount of work you put into it .
They do n't even necessarily care about its objective level of quality .
The distinction is important .
Rarely does a 7th grade teacher mark down a book report on account of it being too boring , but that ’s the # 1 potential failure that you now face .
When making games , you must toss aside your lifelong training regarding what 's important in a product .
There 's a scenario I see time and time again – a game that 's well - made , but simply not fun to play .
Sponsors rarely offer significant money for them , and players rarely react well to them .
Developers are often shocked , and respond to uninterested sponsors with , " But I spent X amount of time on this . "
But we do n't care how long you spent on it .
It was n't a homework assignment .
We only care about whether your game is enjoyable to play .
Whether it took one day or six months is irrelevant .
Just as a great game is n’t penalized for being developed quickly , a poor one is not credited for being developed slowly .
# 2 Ask the People Who Matter
If your sister told you one day that she had been studying Flash and she managed to put something together , odds are pretty good that you'd be legitimately impressed by her work regardless of how the game actually turned out .
We all look upon work more favorably if it 's done by someone we know , care about , or can simply relate to .
These are not the people you should be relying on for feedback for your game .
No matter how bad a game is , it almost always has its fan group of friends and family beta testers .
These people build up a developer 's confidence about his game without ever conveying honest criticisms , intentionally or not .
Find people you do n't know .
Talk to other developers , or even just random people on a forum .
Get them to play your game , and ask a million questions about their experience .
Get a feel for their patience level .
Your mom will carefully read the instructions to understand the counterintuitive controls of your game , but the average player will not .
# 3 " Controls , Controls , You Must Learn Controls " - Yoda ( paraphrased )
No one reads instructions , ever .
In fact , if someone somehow IS reading the instructions of your game , then it is likely because they are already confused and frustrated .
Developers love to place the blame on players who do n't read instructions – but it is the game that is being made for the sake of the player 's enjoyment .
The player does not " owe " the game anything .
Intuitive controls are critical .
If movement is done with WASD , and the arrow keys are not being used for anything , why can the arrow keys not also be used for movement ?
Tinker with your interface to make something quick to pick up ; merely providing instructions for a confusing control scheme is NOT an excuse .
If the player skips an optional tutorial and ignores the instructions , have a quick message flash on the screen with the buttons anyway .
Have signs in the background that explain the game 's controls .
If the player picks up a new weapon , have a dialogue box pop up with a BRIEF explanation of how to use that weapon .
The longer and more out of the way something is , the less likely the player is to read it .
When long - winded instructions for counterintuitive controls are tucked away on a menu screen , you 're virtually guaranteeing that the player has a negative first impression with your game .
# 4 Calling Your Game Art / Hardcore Is Not an Excuse
There is absolutely no reason for beautiful and artistic games to be mutually exclusive with fun and intuitive ones .
It 's a common defense that developers have .
If a player is confused by their game , they ’ll say , " Well , it 's my artistic vision – I do n't expect everyone to get it . "
Really ?
Since when is giving the player easy access to the control scheme compromising an artistic vision ?
What exactly about having user - friendly progress checkpoints and save files is less artistic than forcing the player to enter a password or restart the entire game upon death ?
When you create a great game , you earn the right to call it art .
When you create a poor game , calling it art does not earn you the right to excuse giving it another coat of polish and implementing common beta tester requests .
Additionally , making your game hard just for the sake of being hard does not automatically make you and your players hardcore ( with some exceptions , including “ I Wanna Be the Guy ” ) .
Anyone can take their game and give the player fewer lives , or less health , or less damage , etc. , and make it more difficult .
There is nothing hard about making a game hard – the difficulty comes from making your game actually fun .
There is a true art form to creating a game with a proper difficulty curve – a game that starts out simple , gets progressively more difficult , and makes the player feel challenged and rewarded without feeling frustrated ( there is indeed a very significant distinction between challenge and frustration , and it all has to do with the player ’s perception of fairness within the game ’s rules , how much control he has over the situation , and how harshly he is punished for failing ) .
Striking this balance is incredibly difficult , and no , " I'm hardcore " is not a free ticket out of having to do it .
There is a way to transcend this principle , however .
If you make a game that ’s incredibly good with extremely smooth controls and a very high SKILL component , then you can likely get away with making it stupidly difficult , but only if you ’re quite sure that the player will feel rewarded from this difficulty .
“ N : The Way of the Ninja ” is a game that pulls this off extremely well , but if the controls were any less tight , the experience would be miserable .
Conversely , if a game has a very low skill component to progression ( such as a traditional single - player RPG in which your character ’s power is based more on experience points than on player input ) , then high difficulty is more likely to frustrate than to intrigue .
# 5 Start from the Bottom Up , Not the Top Down
Why is anyone playing your game ?
It 's not because they 're broke and your game is free or cheap – almost everyone on Kongregate has console titles .
They have Halo sitting a few feet away .
So why are they playing your game instead ?
The answer : because it 's fun .
And why is it fun ?
That 's a question that needs to be answered BEFORE development has begun .
Start with the fun , then add the graphics and music later – not the other way around .
Begin with your central idea – the hook to your game .
Play around with it without any graphics .
See if it 's fun .
If it 's not , tweak it .
Figure out what works and what does n't , and build on that core mechanic .
Do n't start with the character artwork , the music , the level tilesets , etc .
You can spend months doing this for a game that is ultimately simply not enjoyable to play .
When that happens , you 'll likely end up with is a game that would get an A + as a homework assignment , but not such a stellar review from someone looking for actual entertainment .
# 6 Focus on Your Strengths , Not Your Weaknesses – Do n’t Try to Do Everything
Final Fantasy X - 2 director Motomu Toriyama once said that FFX - 2 was packed with minigames because " if you bought FFX - 2 , you would n't need any other game . "
It ’s a completely absurd idea .
We all loved the snowboarding minigame in Final Fantasy 7 , but I do n't think a single person on the planet loaded it up and immediately thought , " Sweet , now I do n't need to buy SSX ! "
But Toriyama 's mindset is one that 's incredibly common among game developers , even if they do n't explicitly realize how they 're thinking .
Game developers want to be good at everything .
They want to be the best at every genre .
If there were a nuclear holocaust tomorrow , they'd want to be able to supply the cave - dwelling survivors with every type of game they 'd ever want to play .
They want to have true , diehard fans – people who will play their games and ONLY their games .
It 's a flawed , inefficient mentality , and one that should be broken as soon as possible ( sorry Dirge of Cerberus ) .
If you 're great at making shooter games but terrible at making platformers , then do n't make platformers .
Let other people make them – no one expects you to dip your talents into every imaginable genre .
Knowing your true strengths and weaknesses is one of the most important things you can learn about yourself .
Figure out what you 're good at , then do it .
Do n't waste time trying to be the Renaissance Man of game developers .
Sure , if you keep releasing the same game over and over again , people will get tired of it , but that does n't mean that your games can't share a common theme that highlights what you do best .
Just because you spend all your time making games of a similar genre does n't mean that players have to spend all their time playing them .
Do n't develop tunnel vision with regard to the diversity of experiences that your player will be having across the entire industry .
Keep in mind , also , that even if you do create a successful game , this does not mean that you can do no wrong .
At least 90 % of your players will have absolutely no idea what your past games were .
If you make a really successful shooter game , this does not mean that your next RPG project will also be automatically successful .
It ’s extremely common for developers to build something they ’re good at , have a big success , get cocky , then do something completely different , only to be completely shocked that they ’re still very much capable of failure .
# 7 The Player Does What 's Efficient , Not What 's Fun
Your goal is to make a game that is fun .
But somewhat contrary to intuition , having fun is NOT the goal of the player .
The goal of the player is to conquer whatever the game throws at him .
Fun is the expected byproduct of this endeavor .
The player wants to have fun without having to seek it out .
The player will do what is most efficient and effective , short of doing what he perceives as cheating .
Consider a side - scrolling brawler in which the player has two attacks .
The first attack causes the character to leap into the air , dive down onto an enemy , grab him , spin him around , then toss him into a group of other enemies , knocking them down .
A developer could put quite a lot of time into tweaking this maneuver , and have lots of fun executing it during playtesting .
The second attack is a simple punch .
But here 's the problem – the simple punch deals five times the damage .
Why would the player bother using the former attack when the punch is so effective ?
" Because it 's so much fun ! " the developer would interject .
Then why are you not forcing the player to use it ?
We 've all played a game like this .
We 're having lots of fun using a bunch of really cool attacks , abilities , maneuvers , etc .
Then we find the infinite ammo rocket launcher that kills everything onscreen instantly , and the game is suddenly less fun .
But why ?
We could always choose to put the weapon away .
The problem is that manually handicapping ourselves within the game 's rule structure is not fun either .
When testing your game , play it to win .
Do n't play it to have fun .
It 's your job to make sure that the two overlap .
There are exceptions to this , of course , where players will just mess around with a game to have fun rather than to progress .
But the players who reach this point of exception are the people who are already hooked into your game .
It 's the new players who need to be won over .
Force them to have fun , whether they like it or not !
# 8 Show that You 're Human
Humor and personality go a long , long way with Flash games .
Give the player something they can relate to , make them laugh , and make sure they know that you 're an indie developer .
Games like Button Hunt , Achievement Unlocked and Upgrade Complete were big hits on Kongregate purely for their humor element – the latter two games targeting their humor specifically at the over - achievement - ing of every game recently made , and the necessity for all Flash games to be filled with copious upgrade screens .
And yes , your game CAN look " too good . "
You can not impress your audience .
They 're playing Halo .
They know what amazing graphics look like , and you can't touch that in Flash .
No matter how long you spend on your 3D models , you will probably never create something that makes the player truly say " wow . "
In fact , more likely than not , you will simply alienate your players with graphics that are between indie and truly professional .
What you CAN do is create something aesthetically pleasing and still relatable .
" Sonny " is an RPG that strikes the perfect aesthetic balance of looking great , but still believable as something that was created by a single college student .
" World of Goo " is probably the greatest example of a success in this area .
The game looks great , but it still retains a down - to - earth cartoony style .
Plus , the game is completely overflowing with humor and personality – and it was all built on a core mechanic that ’s fun just on its own , even without these things .
# 9 The Final 10 % Is Most Important
When your game is technically done , there 's a tremendous urge to release it immediately .
It 's like finishing a book report and not wanting to proofread it .
It 's done !
I can turn it in !
I can be finished !
The light is here !
But resist it .
The final 10 % of polish is by far the most efficient use of your time , even if it 's the most annoying and feels the least productive ( since you 're changing things rather than building them ) .
But its importance cannot be understated .
Maybe the boss on level 1 has too much health , and 40 % of the people who play your game give up at that point .
Five minutes of tweaking a health number could have been the best five minutes of time you ever spent in your entire life .
Do n’t forget to add the little things !
Having a mute button ( separate for sound and music ) and an intuitive save system will go a long way in making players like your game ( or , more accurately , in preventing them from hating it ) .
Play your game .
Play it again and again and again .
Get others to play it .
Get their feedback .
Tweak , tweak , tweak .
Continue polishing and ironing out bugs .
Do n't be afraid to cut something out entirely if it's not beneficial to the game – yeah , I know , you already put the work into it , but the player does n't care how much work you 've put into it .
If something is there that 's not fun , it simply should n't be there .
There is no advantage to your game being big and long purely for the sake of being big and long .
Again , it 's not a homework assignment .

Note that these ‘ tracks ’ were photographed in 1967 BEFORE any probe landed on the Moon !
Artifacts On The Moon
Moon Towers
More New Moon Anomalies
Moon cities ?
Or could they be vestiges of an ancient ET civilization ?
Here are a few of the strangest images taken by various probes that show intriguing objects on the Moon and Mars that are as mysterious as they come .
There has been much discussion on a few of these images but there have been no firm conclusions as to what these objects really are or how they could possibly have been produced by natural geological processes .
Or even how the strange ‘ shadows ’ have been produced .
Some of these images are new as I ’ve just spotted them , mostly in Dr Robinson ’s album of images taken by the Lunar Orbiter .
Space Imaging expert , Keith Laney , who worked for NASA / AMES for the 2003 Mars Exploration Rovers mission , has himself mentioned that these LO images are uncensored and has also found scores of other anomalies that are ‘ devastating ’ !
And this coming from an expert in the field .
Most debunkers and skeptics go to great lengths explaining these away as camera glitches , or are just rocks and their shadows .
But look closely .
Invoking Occam ’s razor , there could be much simpler explanations - like alien artifacts ?
If these cannot be explained as natural occurrences , is there a possibility that what we ’re looking at are alien artifacts or man made structures , implying that there could be or was a base of sorts on the Moon / Mars ?
Far fetched on the face of it .
But do we know EVERYTHING that ’s going on around us or out there ?
Making an attempt or even trying to provide out - of - the - box explanations is blasphemy , as it does not conform to our scientific paradigms !
Having said that , lets get started !
Here ’s an image of Mars taken from the Opportunity camera in Jan 07 .
There are six objects you can clearly see that I ’ve marked in red squares .
They are all equi-distant !
Can this be possible in nature ?
Are they just stones lying around , or are these artificial constructs ?
( There are more objects in a straight line in the original Opportunity image which I have cropped ) .
Here are three strange objectson Terra Meridiani !!
Natural stone formation ?
You be the judge !
This next image is near 86.8 °S , 341.3°W .
This is an area termed ‘ Anomaly 502 ’ .
Note the ‘ craters ’ on the upper right of the image on the left .
The B/W pic on the right which I ’ve reoriented to match the image on the left , is purportedly a radar contour image of the same area where one can clearly see the ‘ craters ’ .
But they all seemRare for a natural phenomenon !
Here ’s a very strange structure that resembles a helmet !
Notice that the lower edge overhangs the cliff .
Looks like an artificial dome - like construction !
And here are a couple of images of what look like alien cities on Mars !
There has been a lot of discussion on these images , with some contending that this is the result of pixilation , compression , 3D overlay artifacts etc .
Some image experts have contended that this has nothing to do with any of the above explanations .
It could be the real deal !
Below is an image comparison decorrelated by Keith Laney .
On the right is thewith false color enhancement in the Cydonia area .
Does the IR image look like a city scape ?
You bet it does !
No pixellation / compression artifacts here !
Here is a nighttime infrared image of a portion in Hydaspis .
The lighter areas are heat sources .
Considering their geometric design , it seems to be an artificial layout !
Another interesting image is the crater with a golf ball like structure inside .
This one defies the usual explanations ….
And here ’s the Amundson Scott South Polar Station on the left .
Notice the resemblance with the Mars ‘ Golf Ball ’ structure on the right ?
In the image below that I have cropped from the original image inweb site , I discovered what look like parallel ‘ tracks ’ that run up the mountain from the valley floor , following thein Candor Chasma .
Though it ’s a 3 - D overlay , it does not explain why these have formed .
The image joint which is in a straight line is also clearly visible below the ‘ tracks ’ .
So these ‘ furrows can not be the result of a joint .
Compare what look like ‘ tracks ’ on Mars as well as the Moon .
The Mars image ( below ) is the Mojave crater in the Xanthe Terra region .
The second image is as viewed through the IAS viewer .
Notice the almost perfect arc of a circle formed by one of the objects !
Note that these semicircular ‘ tracks ’ are going up - hill .
The tracks seen going across are on the top of a ridge which is more or less flat .
Not enough incline to make a stone roll across loose soil !
Zorgon had showed these images to his source at NASA who said that thesebe rolling boulders but he was n’t too sure , but nonetheless were pretty intriguing !
The two images below are what I found whilst studying the Lunar Orbiter images from Prof Robinson ’s collections .
So these cannot be explained away as tracks made by a Lunar Rover .
Here are four photographs from the Lunar Orbiter showing what look like towers .
Here ’s an anomaly found by ziggystar60 in one of the images from Dr Robinson ’s collection of Lunar Orbiter images .
Shown below , colorized , are two images containing weird land forms that look like they have been designed as such .
Natural geological formations having such geometric shapes are difficult to imagine .
But then again , we are n’t sure as to what natural processes could have produced these on the Moon .
So can all these be explained away as just rocks and shadows ?
Or geological formations or processes on Mars and the Moon - of which we have n’t the faintest clue ?
I leave it to you to decide !

News of the episode ridiculing Mr Brown comes after one of the worst weeks for Labour since he became Prime Minister .
A Sunday Telegraph poll put Labour 's support at just 26 per cent , with the Tories 17 points ahead on 43 per cent and heading for a Commons majority of 120 .
SHANGHAI 
Thirty years after China began enforcing a one - child policy , this city is actively encouraging young couples to have a second child .
City officials are planning to visit homes , slip leaflets under doors and offer emotional counseling and financial incentives .
The world ’s most populous country , it seems , wants to be a little bigger .
The new push , which aims to tackle growing worries about the country ’s shrinking work force and aging population , is the most public effort yet to counter a policy that is considered both a tremendous success and a terrible failure .
While it has kept population growth under control , it has also led to forced abortions .
China is not doing away with the one - child policy , which still largely applies to urban residents , but is allowing more exceptions to the rule .
Shanghai , with 20 million residents one of China ’s biggest cities , is leading the effort .
Core - collapse ( or gravitational ) supernovae are among the most energetic and violent events in the universe .
They constitute the final tremendous explosions that end the life cycles of stars more massive than approximately 8 times the Sun .
After running out of fuel , the core of such a star collapses and forms a neutron star or a black hole .
At the same time , the outer layers are ejected at high velocity ( up to 10 % of the speed of light ) and shine as brightly as billions of stars together .
The total energy suddenly released by such a typical supernova exceeds the total energy release of the Sun during its whole past and future life time of 10 billion years .
However , some core - collapse supernovae are up to 100 times less energetic and luminous than usual .
These low - power explosions normally show the presence of hydrogen gas , but a new event , supernova SN 2008 ha , is the first dim supernova in which no hydrogen could be detected .
This research has been performed by an international team lead by the Italian astronomer Stefano Valenti ( Queen 's University in Belfast , United Kingdom ) , including scientists from Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics ( Germany ) , the National Institute for Astrophysics ( Italy ) , and various other institutions .
The results , recently published in the scientific journal Nature , are based on data gathered at Calar Alto Observatory ( Andalusia , Spain ) , the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo ( TNG ) , Nordic Optical Telescope ( NOT ) and Liverpool Telescope ( all in Canary Islands , Spain ) , the Copernico Telescope ( Asiago Observatory , Italy ) , and other smaller observational facilities .
Taken together , the dimness and lack of hydrogen leave room for two scenarios for the origin of SN 2008 ha .
One possibility is that the progenitor star may have been a moderately massive star in a binary system , which lost its outer layers through the interaction with the companion .
Alternatively , the explosion may be due to a very massive star which shed its envelope through stellar winds and formed a black hole upon core collapse .
If the latter scenario should prove to be correct , SN 2008 ha may be of particular importance in our understanding of the connection between supernovae and a group of gamma-ray bursts .
The tale of SN 2008 ha is one more step in an ongoing research program whose goal is to unveil the secrets of these cosmic explosions .
This project involves an international team of scientists from many institutions and relies on observational data from different observatories and instruments .
No doubt this exploration will produce more exciting news in the near future .
Last week , in The Times and on my blog , I 've been ranting about one particularly blatant money - grab by U.S. cellphone carriers : the mandatory 15 - second voicemail instructions .
Suppose you call my cell to leave me a message .
First you hear my own voice : " Hi , it 's David Pogue .
Leave a message , and I 'll get back to you " -- and THEN you hear a 15 - second canned carrier message .
Continue reading ...
ADVERTISEMENT
* Sprint : " [ Phone number ] is not available right now .
Please leave a detailed message after the tone .
When you have finished recording , you may hang up , or press pound for more options . "
* Verizon : " At the tone , please record your message .
When you have finished recording , you may hang up , or press 1 for more options .
To leave a callback number , press 5 . ( Beep ) "
* AT&T : " To page this person , press five now .
At the tone , please record your message .
When you are finished , you may hang up , or press one for more options . "
* T - Mobile : " Record your message after the tone .
To send a numeric page , press five .
When you are finished recording , hang up , or for delivery options , press pound . "
( You hear a similar message when you call in to hear your own messages .
" You .
Have .
15 . Messages .
To listen to your messages , press 1 . " WHY ELSE WOULD I BE CALLING ? )
I , the voicemailbox owner , cannot turn off this additional greeting message .
You , the caller , can bypass it , but only if you know the secret keypress -- and it 's different for each carrier .
So you 'd have to know which cellphone carrier I use , and that of every person you 'll ever call ; in other words , this trick is no solution .
These messages are outrageous for two reasons .
First , they waste your time .
Good heavens : it 's 2009 .
WE KNOW WHAT TO DO AT THE BEEP .
Do we really need to be told to hang up when we 're finished !?
Would anyone , ever , want to " send a numeric page ? "
Who still carries a pager , for heaven 's sake ?
Or what about " leave a callback number ? "
We can SEE the callback number right on our phones !
Second , we 're PAYING for these messages .
These little 15 - second waits add up - - bigtime .
If Verizon 's 70 million customers leave or check messages twice a weekday , Verizon rakes in about $ 620 million a year .
That 's your money .
And your time : three hours of your time a year , just sitting there listening to the same message over and over again every year .
In 2007 , I spoke at an international cellular conference in Italy .
The big buzzword was ARPU -- Average Revenue Per User .
The seminars all had titles like , " Maximizing ARPU In a Digital Age . "
And yes , several attendees ( cell executives ) admitted to me , point - blank , that the voicemail instructions exist primarily to make you use up airtime , thereby maximizing ARPU .
Right now , the carriers continue to enjoy their billion - dollar scam only because we 're not organized enough to do anything about it .
But it does n't have to be this way .
You do n't have to sit there , waiting to leave your message , listening to a speech recorded by a third - grade teacher on Ambien .
Let 's push back , and hard .
We want those time - wasting , money - leaking messages eliminated , or at least made optional .
I asked my Twitter followers for help coming up with a war cry , a slogan , to identify this campaign .
They came up with some good ones :
" Where 's the Beep ? "
" Let it Beep "
" We Know . Let 's Go . "
" Lose the Wait "
" My Voicemail , My Recording "
" Hell , no , we wo n't hold ! "
My favorite , though , is the one that sounds like a call to action : " Take Back the Beep . "
And here 's how we 're going to do it .
We 're going to descend , en masse , on our carriers .
Send them a complaint , politely but firmly .
Together , we 'll send them a LOT of complaints .
If enough of us make our unhappiness known , I 'll bet they 'll change .
I 've told each of the four major carriers that they 'll be hearing from us .
They 've told us where to send the messages :
* Verizon :
Post a complaint here : http://bit.ly/FJncH.
* AT&T : Send e-mail to Mark Siegel , executive director of media relations : MS8460@att.com .
* Sprint : Post a complaint here : http://bit.ly/9CmrZ
* T - Mobile : Post a complaint here : http://bit.ly/2rKy0u
Three of the four carriers are just directing us to their general Web forums .
Smells like a cop-out , I know .
( As for AT&T : Props to the guy for letting me publish his e-mail address !
Hope he knows what he 's in for ! )
Yet all four carriers promise that they 'll read and consider our posts .
And we have two things going for us .
First , I have a feeling that the volume of complaints will be too big for them to ignore .
To that end , I hope you 'll pass these instructions along , blog them , Twitter them , and spread the word .
( Gizmodo , Consumerist and others have agreed to help out . )
And I hope you 'll take the time to complain yourself .
Do it now , before you forget .
Second , we 'll all be watching .
I 'll be reporting on the carriers ' responses .
If they ignore us , we 'll shame them .
If they respond , we 'll celebrate them .
Either way , it 's time to rise up .
It 's time for this crass , time - wasting money - grab to end for good .
Three people have been accused of letting rats bite a six - week - old baby girl and chew off her toes at their cluttered mobile home .
Pike County prosecutor Rob Junk said the baby 's toes on one foot were gone when sheriff 's deputies went to the Ohio home on Sunday after receiving an anonymous tip - off .
The baby was said to be in a fair condition at a Columbus hospital today .
A married couple and the 18 - year - old boyfriend of the baby 's mother , charged with child endangering , appeared in court for an initial hearing yesterday .
They were remanded in custody until a plea hearing in two weeks .
Mr Junk said they all lived in the mobile home west of Piketon , a village noted for its old uranium enrichment plant .
He said the baby 's mother was a juvenile and would not identify her or say if she would be charged .

Harvey Milk awarded presidential medal
SFGate : Politics Blog ^ |
7/30/9 | Carolyn Lochhead , Chronicle Washington Bureau
Posted on by SmithL
The late San Francisco supervisor Harvey Milk received the presidential Medal of Freedom award today with 15 other recipients ranging across the professional and ideological spectrum , from the late supply sider Jack Kemp to tennis star Billy Jean King to Sen.
Edward Kennedy , whose absence from the health care debate due to brain cancer treatments has weighed heavily on the White House .
The medal is the country 's highest civilian honor .
President Obama said all the recipients " share one overarching trait : Each has been an agent of change .
Each saw an imperfect world and set about improving it , often overcoming great obstacles along the way .
Their relentless devotion to breaking down barriers and lifting up their fellow citizens sets a standard to which we all should strive . "
Milk , celebrated in an award - winning film , became in 1977 the first openly - gay elected official in a major U.S. city .
He and Mayor George Moscone were shot and killed by former supervisor Dan White in 1978 .
Then board of supervisors president Dianne Feinstein was among the first on the scene , leaving an indelible impression on her , while opening her path to becoming Mayor of San Francisco , one - time candidate for governor and now U.S. Senator .
The White House praised Milk for encouraging lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender citizens " to live their lives openly "

Back in 2007 , the Z - Cult FM comic book tracker experienced difficulties when it came under legal pressure from Marvel and DC Comics to remove torrents linking to their copyright works .
The site complied and extended this service to other publishers but in the end , this courtesy ended up draining the life from the site .
In 2007 we reported on the difficulties experienced by comic book tracker , Z - Cult FM .
Around since 2004 , the site was put under pressure by comic giants DC and Marvel , and eventually took action to remove torrents linking to works to which these publishers held the copyright .
The site continued to run until recently but then saddened users received a message from the administrator , Serj , who confirmed their fears .
Along with thanks to the staff , members and supporters of the site past and present , the message explained that Z - Cult FM would be closed down , marking the final chapter of what Serj called the “ soap opera ” of Z - Cult FM .
So what caused the closure of the site – more pressure from Marvel , more threats from DC ?
Torrent Freak spoke with owner Serj for the lowdown .
“ Well , a decision was just made to call it a day .
We had no legal threats since all those ones you covered but the site was dead in the water due to no Marvel or DC comics etc .
After Marvel and DC tried to sue us , we decided to remove those [ links to ] comics , then every other publisher started sending us e-mails so we removed those too .
In end we were left with a tracker but not many torrents on it . ”
Of course , a site like Z - Cult FM costs money to run just like any other , and this was a factor in its closure .
“ The site is costing me cash for a server that is n’t really put to much use anymore so I just decided it was time to call it quits , back the site up and kill the server , ” Serj told Torrent Freak .
“ If we do come back it will be after a little break but that ’s just an IF and if we do it will be just a message board , ” he added .
There was also an interesting addition to Serj ’s discussion with us .
Although Z - Cult FM has been operating in the BitTorrent / comic scene since 2004 , these days that particular sector is changing – and not for the better says Serj .
“ These days most comics are pirated on DC ++ or sites such as Rapidshare , ” he explained .
“ Live links are becoming the most popular because uploaders are being paid for the number of people who download their comics from Rapidshare etc , its a sad turn of events in the scene . ”
The BitTorrent and comics combination is less popular these days , Serj told us .
“ So we are leaving now . ”
As the New York Times points out , the use of the military on US soil is prohibited by both the Fourth Amendment and by the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 .
Yet , this proposal was advanced by Dick Cheney , David Addington , and unnamed Defense Department officials .
Opposed were Condoleezza Rice , then the national security adviser ; John B. Bellinger III , the top lawyer at the National Security Council ; Robert S. Mueller III , the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ; and Michael Chertoff , then the head of the Justice Department ’s criminal division .
The legal basis of the claim that to use the military in this case was , naturally , the Yoo / Delahunty memo of Oct. 23 , 2001 .
The lawless impulses of Dick Cheney have been well - documented , and of course this comes as no surprise .
But what always shocks me , and what is of course absent from the NYT article , is any explanation as to the why .
Why do this ?
What was the virtue , beyond a naked grasp for executive power , in doing this ?
What threat did the so - called Lackawanna
Six pose that could not be handled by the FBI ?
What is the benefit to the American people if we choose to use our armed forces this way ?
I have no idea .
Years after the abuses instigated by Cheney first came to light , I still have n't the slightest understanding of what his motives were .
And I do n't suppose I 'll ever know .
Updated to add : Many of you have made excellent points about the will to power , the fetish for nationalism , and the codification of executive power .
They are all plausible explanations of his immediate motives .
But ultimately , I think they fail to satisfy .
There have been many ultra-nationalists and authoritarians who have occupied the Oval Office .
None have shown the repeated and reckless disregard for established US law and principle demonstrated time and again by Cheney .
It is all too easy , with all that has happened , to view Cheney as a cartoon villain , like the Commie Nazis from McBain .
But he 's a human , and there must be a more human explanation out there .

Ultrafast broadband will be available in Wellington and Christchurch next year , allowing consumers to watch high - definition internet television and video - conference with friends and workmates .
TelstraClear chief executive Allan Freeth announced last night the company would upgrade its InHome cable networks to deliver download speeds of 100 megabits per second .
That is 20 times the speed enjoyed by the average New Zealand broadband user and 10 times the highest speed previously offered on the Wellington cable network which covers most of city , the Hutt Valley and the Kapiti Coast .
The upgrade will take about a year and cost $ 10 million .
Dr Freeth said TelstraClear would then offer 100 M bps plans as soon as there was a demand from customers .
TelstraClear plans to soon begin selling high - tech set - top boxes to the 80,000 households on its InHome networks that would let them view programmes downloaded over the internet on their TVs .
Ultrafast broadband would also be of use to businesses , doctors ' surgeries and telecommuters , Dr Freeth said .
There was now no point in the Government rolling out fibre - optic cable to homes and businesses in Wellington and Christchurch through its '' yet to be confirmed ' ' $ 1.5 billion broadband investment initiative , he said .
The $ 400 m earmarked for the two cities under the scheme would be better spent elsewhere .
'' We strongly do n't believe taxpayers ' and ratepayers ' money should be used to compete against us in areas where we have spent hundreds of millions of dollars . ''
Communications Minister Steven Joyce could not say whether the investment would influence the Government 's ultrafast broadband plan .
'' Any private sector investment that brings broadband speeds up is really good and my personal preference would be that the private sector saw the need to do the whole thing , but I think that is unlikely . ''
Details of the service that would follow the upgrade were not yet clear , there were parts of Wellington and Christchurch that TelstraClear 's networks did not reach and 100 M bps might not be sufficient to meet the future needs of schools , he said .
Australian telecommunications analyst Paul Budde said Telstra had announced similar cable network upgrades , '' squarely
aimed to undermine the Australian 's government plan for a national broadband network ' ' .
Any improvement was welcome , but TelstraClear 's cable networks were a ' ' dead - end technology ' ' , he said .
There was a good chance they would need to be replaced with fibre within the next five to 10 years as fibre was '' more flexible and cheaper to maintain ' ' .
Dr Freeth rejected that .
" We do n't buy into much of Paul 's stuff . "
The Government 's election commitment was to roll out fibre cable to schools , businesses and three - quarters of homes within 10 years .
Unlike TelstraClear 's cable , the fibre network would also let people upload information at 100 Mbps .
Dr Freeth was dismissive , suggesting few needed that .
TelstraClear 's cable networks would allow uploads at 10 Mbps .
TelstraClear did not plan to let other telecommunications companies retail services over its cable network , but Dr Freeth would not rule that out .
A key feature of the Government 's proposed fibre network is that it would be open to all .
Harcourts Wellington managing director Marty Scott said houses that had access to good broadband could be easier to sell .
For some buyers , especially those that worked from home , ultrafast broadband might feature among the top three things they decided they could not do without .
Cindy Sheehan , who drew national attention for camping outside former President George W. Bush 's ranch in protest of the Iraq War , is following him to Dallas .
Sheehan will lead a demonstration Monday protesting " crimes against humanity . "
" We can't allow George Bush 's crimes to be forgotten just because he is not in office anymore , " she said in an e-mail .
But while most people in Preston Hollow have gone out of their way to welcome the former president and first lady home , they 're not exactly rolling out the welcome mat for Sheehan .
" Go away , " resident Kathie Taub said .
" Go back !
Leave us alone ! "
Taub said Sheehan had already protested and should " now leave everybody alone . "
" She has already made her opinion known , and it is getting old , " Michael Taub said .
" She needs to go back to wherever she came from . "
Neighbor Victor Toledo echoed the sentiment .
" There ’s a lot of decent people that call this home , and I ’d rather not see that , " he said .
The march begins at Preston Road and Royal Lane at 4:30 p.m. and ends on Daria Drive , outside the secure entrance to Bush 's Preston Hollow neighborhood .
It is not scheduled to cross any major intersections .
Secret Service agents will block anyone from going down Daria Drive , which leads to the cul - de-sac where the Bush 's live .
It was not clear if Bush or his wife will be at home this weekend , according to the Dallas Morning News .
Neither the Dallas Police Department nor the U.S. Secret Service will reveal any specifics about security for Monday 's event .
A spokesman for the Secret Service calls it the " first test " of their security measures at the former president 's home since he left office .
" Officers will be very visible " says Sgt Warren Mitchell with the Dallas Police Department , comparing the department 's expected response with the force shown at the recent Exxon Mobil shareholders meeting , when police outnumbered protesters .
Sheehan , whose son , Army Spc. Casey Sheehan , was killed in the Iraq War , camped outside Bush 's Crawford ranch in 2005 in protest of the war .
She also ran unsuccessfully last year for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's congressional seat .
On a global average , the amount of mercury falling out of the sky has tripled since the Industrial Revolution , primarily because of the burning of fossil fuels .
Although this atmospheric deposition has long been considered the key vector for the widespread contamination of freshwater and coastal ecosystems , some scientists are focusing on another potential source : subterranean flows of terrestrial groundwater .
A report published in ES&T ( DOI 10.1021/es900539c ) found that groundwater entering the ocean at two sites on the central California coast injects substantially more mercury , including surprisingly large amounts of methylmercury ( MeHg ) , into coastal waters than local airborne deposition does .
Many facets of mercury ’s cycling through ocean ecosystems continue to perplex scientists , particularly the origins of the highly toxic organic form , MeHg .
The prevailing assumption has been that inorganic mercury is converted to the methyl form by sulfur - and iron - reducing bacteria in seafloor sediments and released through the water by processes of diffusion and advection .
However , researchers recently proposed ( Global Biogeochem .
Cycles2009 , DOI 10.1029/2008GB003425 ) that such bacterial conversion may occur with the decomposition of sinking organic material in the mercury - laced midwater depths of the ocean .
Another recent study suggested that in some locations submarine groundwater discharges carry considerably more mercury than previously thought .
However , the amounts of MeHg in such discharges and how much reaches the ocean have remained a mystery .
Biogeochemist Frank Black , now at Princeton University , and his colleagues investigated this question along the central California coast .
“ There were plenty of reasons to suspect high mercury levels there , ” Black says , “ including historical mercury mining in the nearby coastal mountains and the proximity of the San Andreas Fault system , with its associated oil deposits , geothermal activity , and mercury mineralization .
Coastal wetlands , known hotspots for bacterial MeHg generation , are also present . ”
At two characteristically different locations — Stinson Beach , an ocean - facing beach with a small town close by , and Elkhorn Slough , a tidally flushed estuary emptying into Monterey Bay — the researchers collected 42 groundwater samples during October 2007 and July 2008 .
Comparing measurements of terrestrial radium levels in these samples with levels in coastal water , the scientists calculated the amounts of groundwater entering the ocean .
Then , using analytical chemistry techniques , they estimated the average concentrations of total Hg and MeHg at each site .
Despite the sites ’ differences , the levels were similar , Black says , and unexpectedly high .
“ Total Hg was an order of magnitude greater than estimated quantities from atmospheric deposition in nearby San Francisco Bay , ” he explains .
Inputs of MeHg were similar to those from surface sediments , which are widely considered the predominant MeHg source for coastal waters .
The researchers suspect that bacterial activity in septic tanks near Stinson Beach is a key MeHg contributor there , while at Elkhorn Slough groundwater likely is flushing the pollutant out from sediments and wetlands .
Carl Lamborg , a marine chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , found the study ’s implication of septic effluent as a potential component in the synthesis of MeHg intriguing .
“ This could represent another important way in which Hg loadings to the coastal zone via groundwater are different than those in surface water , ” he says .
“ There is a growing consensus that MeHg production in estuaries and coastal zones is sufficient to support its bioaccumulation in coastal fisheries , and perhaps to contribute to offshore fisheries , ” comments Cynthia Gilmour , a microbial ecologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center .
However , she says , “ The much larger overall area of sediments than of groundwater discharge probably means that MeHg production in coastal sediments is a larger contributor in many coastal ecosystems . ”
To sort out this issue , “ it will be important to better quantify all fluxes within a few specific systems , such as Chesapeake and San Francisco bays . ”
Black predicts that submarine groundwater flows may prove to be significant sources of mercury wherever groundwater concentrations are high and flow volumes large .
“ The big questions are , to what extent is groundwater mercury influenced by human activities , and how much of it is biologically available to be taken up by fish and other marine life . ”

O.P.K .
The United Industrial Corporation , a Russian manufacturer , said this week that the world ’s first floating nuclear power plant will go into operation on Russia ’s eastern coast by the end of 2012 .
The manufacturer , known also as O.P.K. , told Green Inc. that the first model would be used to help power Viluchinsk , a city on the Kamchatka peninsula that serves as an atomic submarine base .
O.P.K. said similar models could power other cities in northern Russia in the future .
But according to nuclear experts , mining companies are likely to use Russian - built floating reactors to power operations to extract oil and gas and valuable minerals from the Arctic and other remote regions .
O.P.K. is building the plant in the shape of a ship 144 meters ( 472 feet ) in length and 30 meters ( 98 feet ) wide to accommodate two 35 - megawatt reactors .
Construction of the plant , called KLT - 40C , began in February this year .
Concern Energoatom , a nuclear power plant operator , signed a contract this month to buy the first model , worth 226.8 million euros , O.P.K. said .
The cost of the reactors per kilowatt hour would be equal to building a hydropower station and “ exploitation of such a particular plant will be much in demand both in industrial and developing regions , ” O.P.K. said .
The advantages of floating nuclear plants include maneuverability of the machines so that they can be serviced , as well as the ability to be towed near remote settlements or sites of energy - intensive industries — like water desalination — where need is greatest for electricity .
Other potential benefits include the offshore locale , away from population areas where residents might otherwise object to the presence of nuclear power .
But putting reactors at sea is likely to raise concerns about the safety in extreme weather conditions , vulnerability to terrorism , and disposal of the radioactive waste they produce .

As far as I can tell , I am the most active female poster on Less Wrong .
( AnnaSalamon has higher karma than I , but she has n't commented on anything for two months now . )
There are not many of us .
This is usually immaterial .
Heck , sometimes people do n't even notice in spite of my girly username , my self - introduction , and the fact that I 'm now apparently the feminism police of Less Wrong .
My life is not about being a girl .
In fact , I 'm less preoccupied with feminism and women 's special interest issues than most of the women I know , and some of the men .
It 's not my pet topic .
I do not focus on feminist philosophy in school .
I took an " Early Modern Women Philosophers " course because I needed the history credit , had room for a suitable class in a semester when one was offered , and heard the teacher was nice , and I was pretty bored .
I wound up doing my midterm paper on Malebranche in that class because we 'd covered him to give context to Mary Astell , and he was more interesting than she was .
I did n't vote for Hilary Clinton in the primary .
Given the choice , I have lots of things I 'd rather be doing than ferreting out hidden or less - than - hidden sexism on one of my favorite websites .
Unfortunately , nobody else seems to want to do it either , and I 'm not content to leave it undone .
I suppose I could abandon the site and leave it even more masculine so the guys could all talk in their own language , unimpeded by stupid chicks being stupidly offended by completely unproblematic things like objectification and just plain jerkitude .
I would almost certainly have vacated the site already if feminism were my pet issue , or if I were more easily offended .
( In general , I 'm very hard to offend .
The fact that people here have succeeded in doing so anyway without even , apparently , going out of their way to do it should be a great big red flag that something 's up . )
If you 're wondering why half of the potential audience of the site seems to be conspicuously not here , this may have something to do with it .
So can I get some help ?
Some lovely people have thrown in their support , but usually after I or , more rarely , someone else sounds the alarm , and usually without much persistence or apparent investment .
There is still conspicuous karmic support for some comments that perpetuate the problems , which does nothing to disincentivize being piggish around here - some people seem to earnestly care about the problem , but this is n't enforced by the community at large , it 's just a preexisting disposition ( near as I can tell ) .
I would like help reducing the incidence of :
Comments and posts that casually objectify women or encourage the objectification of women .
" Objectification " is what happens when a person is treated or discussed as an object , not as an autonomous being .
( Non -women can also be objectified , and that too should be stopped . )
Casual use of masculine and / or heteronormative examples in posts and comments that are n't explicitly about gender .
It 's just not that hard to come up with an unsexed example .
Be especially careful when using the second person .
If you need to use an example with a gender , there 's no reason to consider male the default - consider choosing randomly , or you could use a real person as an example ( who is n't presumed to archetypically represent anyone in the audience ) instead of a hypothetical one ( who might be ) .
Sweeping generalizations about women , if they are not backed up by overwhelming hard data ( responsibly gathered and interpreted ) .
The cost of being wrong about this sort of thing is high , even if the culprits do n't bear it themselves , and extreme care should be taken .
Fawning admiration of pickup artists who attain their fame by the systematic manipulation of women .
If it is necessary to refer admiringly to a pickup artist or pickup strategy ( I 'm not sure why it would be , but if ) , care should be taken to choose one whose methods are explicitly non-depersonalizing , and disclaim that specifically in the comment .
We could use more of the following :
Thoughtful use of qualifiers and disclaimers in talk about sex and gender .
Robin is not right .
Attention to the privileges of masculinity and attempts to reduce that disparity .
( Note that of course there are also female privileges , but until Less Wrong hosts custody battles or we start suspecting that some of us might be violent criminals , they are unlikely to come into play nearly so much in this location . )
Thank you for your attention and , hopefully , your assistance .
About Natural Dentistry
Natural dentistry is an original concept conceived from holistic dentistry , biological dentistry and environmentally - conscious dentistry .
Through this approach we strive not only to get people out of pain , but also to do it using the most natural and most conservative way possible .
If one has an infection or a dead tooth , we remove it with great care AND treat the underlying infection .
If one has a cavity , then we take out the decay without damaging the fragile tooth by using advanced techniques and technology to keep our patient safe from harm .
Finally , we help our patients get better without sacrificing mother Earth .
If that goal requires the use of non -toxic chemicals to minimizing mercury into the environment , then we will take those extra measures .
La economía mexicana registró en el quinto mes del año un estancamiento , de acuerdo con lo divulgado por el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía ( Inegi ) , pese a las estimaciones de una caída en la actividad económica .
El Indicador Global de la Actividad Económica ( IGAE ) , el cual da un seguimiento mensual a la economía , permaneció sin variación respecto al mes de abril , cuando la economía registró un crecimiento de apenas 0.1 % , con cifras desestacionalizadas .
“ Es una mala noticia , pero dada la expectativa de que anticipaban una caída más significativa , logra sortear ligeramente el peor escenario .
El dato da una pista de que es muy probable que la primera mitad del año se haya quedado con un escaso crecimiento ” , acotó James Salazar , subdirector de Análisis Económico de CiBanco .
Al interior del reporte , se puede observar que el sector servicios fue el que mejor desempeño mostró , con una tasa de 0.8 % mensual tras la contracción de 0.3 % de abril .
Dentro de esta actividad , el comercio al por menor revirtió la caída de 0.7 % registrada en abril al crecer 2.4 % en mayo .
En el caso de las actividades primarias , éstas se recuperaron tras dos meses consecutivos de contracciones .
En mayo , la tasa de expansión mensual que registraron fue de 0.7 por ciento .
Sin embargo , el sector de industrias registró una contracción de 2.1 % , que es la primera en el año .
Esto fue resultado de las caídas que presentaron las cuatro actividades que la componen ; la construcción mostró la más pronunciada con 6.2 por ciento .
La contracción de la construcción , indicó Alejandro Saldaña , gerente de Análisis Económico de Ve por Más , se explica por una menor obra pública e inversión en este tipo de proyectos por parte del gobierno .
En su comparación anual , el IGAE registró una contracción de 0.3 % , la segunda del año .
En marzo , la economía registró una contracción de 0.6 por ciento .
Difícil , la meta de hacienda
Analistas refirieron que es poco probable que la economía pueda cumplir con el pronóstico de la Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público , la cual prevé una expansión de entre 1.1 y 2.1 % al cierre de este año .
James Salazar explicó que será muy difícil alcanzar un crecimiento dentro de ese rango , o incluso el promedio de 1.6 % , ello debido a que esperan un crecimiento de 0.3 % para la primera mitad del año , por lo cual el país necesitaría crecer al menos 2.8 % en la segunda mitad para alcanzar la previsión ; no obstante , no ve una recesión este año .
“ Todavía no estamos en una recesión , hay aún cifras positivas en consumo y empleo .
El problema es que la percepción es así , se cree que ya vamos encaminados a una y la mayoría de las decisiones se toma por expectativas .
Si esa percepción no logra revertirse , probablemente el país pueda caer en una recesión , no en este año , pero tal vez en la primera mitad del siguiente ” , expuso .

They call their home Silicone City – and for good reason .
Chantal Marshall and four of her daughters have had NINE boob jobs between them .
That makes them the British family to have had the most breast surgery – bra , er , bar none .
While most mums and their daughters enjoy shopping trips together , Chantal , 50 , and her daughters have spent nearly £ 40,000 on visits to cosmetic surgeons to have their breasts enlarged .
Ripley , 18 , Tara , 22 , Terri , 25 , Emma , 28 , and mum - of - nine Chantal , of Kirkby - in - Ashfield , Notts , now boast chest sizes ranging from 34 DD to 32GG .
On one occasion , Emma and Ripley even ended up having breast enhancement surgery on the same day and at the same clinic as their mum .
Tara had booked her consultation aged 17 so she could have the op as soon as she reached the age of 18 .
The sisters – all with matching blonde hair just like their mum – say that like most siblings they have always copied each other .
But they insist that when it comes their chest sizes , they are n’t at all competitive .
They reckon their desire for bigger boobs was inspired by Chantal – who is often mistaken by strangers for their sister .
Here they share their stories ...
Mum Chantal
Age : 50 ; No of ops : 3 ; Spent : £ 13,500
CARER and mum - of - nine Chantal is a petite Size 10 and was 34B before her first op .
She is now a 34DD .
She says : “ Having nine children left my boobs looking like milk bottles .
In 1996 , after I had my seventh child , I had my first set of implants but I ended up even more unhappy .
“ They looked like balls in socks rather than the pert , round breasts I had imagined .
I was quite traumatised .
So when Emma said she was going to have a boob job I was terrified .
But when I saw how great they looked it made me brave enough to consider having mine done again and in February 2004 I had them enlarged to 34DD .
“ Two years down the line I wanted to perk them up .
So when Emma and my second youngest daughter Ripley said they were going to get theirs done I suggested we all went together .
“ My daughters say I inspired them to have boob jobs but I ’ve got them to thank for encouraging me to get mine done again .
There ’s no mistaking the family resemblance – but now we ’ve got the boobs to match too ! ”
EMMA
Age : 28 ; No of ops : 2 ; Spent : £ 9,500
Emma is a beauty therapist and is a Size 12 .
Before her first enlargement she was a 34B .
She is now a 34 F .
She says : “ We all laugh it ’s Silicone City round our house .
It ’s amazing we ’re the family with the most boob jobs in Britain – and we ’re all really happy with the results .
“ I first got my boobs done 10 years ago when I was just 18 .
I had a good figure but longed for more curves .
“ I ’d look at Baywatch on TV and think ‘ they look stunning ’ .
Then I ’d look in the mirror and imagine myself with a bigger pair .
“ I knew it would give me more confidence .
So I got a loan and got my 34B cup enlarged to a D cup .
I felt so much happier as they suited my curvy frame .
“ I did n’t have any problems but they say you should have implants replaced after 10 years , which is why I went under the knife again .
I went for my second op with my mum and sister Ripley .
“ One of the first things we said when we came round from the anaesthetic was , ‘ Let ’s have a look at yours ! ’ ”
RIPLEY
Age : 18 ; No of ops : 1 ; Spent : £ 4,500
Ripley , 18 , fashion and design student and trained nail technician .
She is a Size 8 .
Before surgery in March she was a 34C .
She went up to a 34DD .
She says : “ I ’m the youngest in our family to have a boob job .
Some sisters are competitive – but I ’m as delighted by my sisters ’ and mum ’s boob jobs as I am my own .
“ It ’s brought us closer together – I could n’t wait to get mine done .
“ Although I ’m a Size 8 I do n’t like the ironing board figure like Keira Knightley ’s .
I prefer the womanly curves of J - Lo .
I ’d buy bigger bras and then pad them out with chicken fillets and padding .
“ After seeing my sisters and the way they felt about having theirs done , I wanted to do the same .
“ I managed to save up half the money I needed and then got a loan .
“ Emma and I investigated on the internet and found surgeon Dr Hicham Mouallem at The Wimpole Clinic in London .
He was brilliant . ”
TERRI
Age : 25 ; No of ops : 1 ; Spent : £ 4,500
Terri , 25 , is a dancer and lives in Papplewick , Notts .
She is a Size 10 .
Before her boob job she was a 32 DD .
She is now a 32GG .
She says : “ I once had a jokey argument with my sister Emma about who had the biggest boobs .
But it was all friendly – there ’s never been sibling rivalry as we ’re very close .
“ I had my boob job after my sister Emma .
When I saw hers I knew I had to go and get mine done .
They looked amazing and I was so jealous .
“ I ’ve always had quite big boobs but I wanted to go bigger .
So I booked myself in with the same surgeon just one month later .
“ Some people might think I ’m crazy but it ’s what I wanted .
I saved up and luckily my boyfriend Paul helped towards the cost .
“ I had no trepidations about going – I ’d rather get my boobs done than go to the dentist .
I ’d hate to be flat - chested .
Put it this way , if I was , I ’d be putting 10 chicken fillets in my boobs and be wearing a jelly - bra . ”
TARA
Age : 22 ; No of ops : 2 ; Spent : £ 8,000
Tara , a receptionist , is a Size 10 .
Before her first boob job she was a 34A .
She is now a 34E .
She says : “ Looks - wise my sisters and I share nearly everything .
We ’ve all got similar hair and facial features but when it came to boobs I was no way near as blessed .
“ I never got any bigger than an A - cup and my boobs looked like two little eggs .
Everyone said I looked fine but I felt I looked pear - shaped .
“ I knew bigger boobs would make me happy but rather than getting upset about it , I decided that as soon as I was old enough I ’d save up and have breast implants .
“ I managed to save up the money I needed and as soon as I was 17 I booked a consultation .
“ I had the op when I turned 18 and I was so excited that I almost fell off the hospital bed beforehand .
“ After I had my daughter in 2005 I decided to have them done again .
I love the fake look so I decided to go for a 34E .
I feel amazing . ”
More wind than we thought ?
A new study of the global potential for wind - generated electricity ( Lu et al. 2009 ) concludes that windmills can meet the world ’s energy demand with plenty of power to spare .
The open access paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences claims that a global network of windmills operating at 20 % of capacity could produce 2,470 exajoules ( EJ ) — about five times the current commercial energy consumption of the planet ( ~500 EJ ) .
The latest estimate is much higher than the first evaluation of global wind power ( Archer and Jacobson 2005 ) , which estimated a similar network ’s output at 443 EJ .
The paper ’s state - by - state analysis of the potential for wind power in the US offers some surprises .
The area where wind generation looks like a feasible alternative to fossil fuel power has grown dramatically .
The old US - Department of Energy map ( right ) shows places like Kentucky , Tennessee , and Mississippi as blank slates of white with no real potential for wind power .
The new analysis ( below ) colors these states yellow , and concludes that each of them could replace their fossil fuel consumption entirely with wind power and have energy to spare .
Building the windmill network necessary to realize this potential would be a massive undertaking .
Each turbine in the network would have the capacity to generate 2.5 MW , with blades 100 m in diameter , perched on a 100 m tower .
Windmills even larger are already in use .
The video below shows one such windmill — the Enercon E - 126 — which has a diameter of 126 m and a capacity of 6 MW .
It would be wonderful to see thousands of windmills eliminate fossil fuel consumption , but a network of such gigantic structures could have some pretty substantial environmental impacts of their own .
The paper discusses the possibility that large - scale wind harvesting could alter atmospheric circulation and reduce temperatures at higher latitudes .
It does n’t mention the potential effect on birds and bats , already hit hard by habitat loss , but this article claims that large turbines are actually less dangerous to our flying friends than little ones .
When I watch the slow rotation of the large windmills in the video I can see why .
While contemplating wind mega - projects , it ’s also interesting to imagine what could be done at the micro scale .
Large wind turbines tend to be much more efficient than small turbines .
Small windmills do n’t even harvest enough energy to pay back the energy used in their manufacture .
Humdinger Wind Energy is a recent start - up proposing an interesting solution .
Instead of small wind turbines , Humdinger proposes vibrating belts for micro-scale wind harvesting .
They even offer instructions to make your own windbelt , using about $ 5 worth of commonly available materials .
Perhaps more of our farms should be harvesting wind , in addition to sunlight .
I ’ve been using wordpress for awhile and it seems that whenever I find a useful plugin or theme on the web the author always seems to embed some affiliate link or some other garbage on my main page .
Usually they make sure that these links show up on every page and sometimes they even make other features of the software depend on it .
Usually when I try to edit out the code it ’s not as easy as removing an anchor or a bit of javascript .
They always seem to obfuscate what they are doing as much as possible .
The most popular way to do this is to use a combination of gzinflate , base64 _decodes , eval , and str_rot13 .
For most users this is really difficult to decode to figure out what is really going on .
I wrote this function to hopefully make peoples lives easier ( or harder , depending on who you are ) .
Usually the obfuscated code is written in the wordpress add - on like this :
$ coded_string = " eval ( gzinflate ( base64_decode (' FZfFDs..sdff/7nr/8B ' ) ) ) ; "
function decode_goofy_string ( $coded_string ) { while ( preg_match ( " / eval \( gzinflate / " , $ coded_string ) ) { $ contents=preg_replace ( " /<\?|\?>/ " , " " , $ coded_string ) ; eval ( preg_replace ( " / eval / " , " \$coded_string= " , $ coded_string ) ) ; } return trim ( $ coded_string ) ; }
If your string looks like that then the function that follows should take decode it and return the html code pretty easily .
This function is pretty straight forward but if anyone has any troubles then leave a comment or send me an email at cody@codytaylor.org
The U.S. Economy : Increasingly Marginal Returns ( January 15 , 2009 )
" Marginal returns " refers to ever greater inputs being required to boost output .
It also describes the way in which the U.S. economy is investing ever greater resources in regulatory and paperwork structures which have little or no measurable value .
The concept of " marginal returns " is intuitive .
We all know the feeling of working ever harder on something just to keep it going .
( That 's the way I feel about this blog , actually ... )
Measurable increases in output require ever - larger inputs of energy , time and effort , eventually exhausting the resources available .
Author / thinker Jeremy Rifkin describes this mechanism extremely well in his fascinating book The Hydrogen Economy .
He illustrates the concept on a global scale by using the Roman Empire as an example .
Rome 's early conquests yielded huge returns on " investment " : large tracts of fertile cropland , significant treasure , productive populaces , etc .
But as time progressed , more and more of the Empires ' wealth flowed to the citizenry of Rome , and conquests of distant lands such as Britain yielded less and less return ; garrisoning these distant territories began costing more than they produced .
Eventually even holding onto the now - exhausted croplands and restive populations exceeded Rome 's dwindling wealth , and the Empire collapsed .
There are many ways of accounting for empire - collapse , be it Roman or Mayan , but certainly " marginal returns " describes one element .
Here is how Rifkin applies the concept to U.S. farming practices :
The pesticides also destroy the remaining soil .
The soil contains millions of microscopic bacteria , fungi , algae , and protozoa , as well as worms and anthropods .
These organisms maintain the fertility and structure of the soil .
Pesticides destroy these organisms and their complex habitats , hastening the process of soil depletion and erosion .
American farms lose more than four billion tons of topsoil annually , much of it because of the high - tech farming practices introduced over the past half century .
By the 1970s , the U.S. had lost more than one - third of its agricultural topsoil .
The depletion and erosion , in turn , have required the use of ever - increasing amounts of petrochemical fertilizers to maintain agricultural output .
Marginal returns have set in .
More and more energy inputs are required to produce smaller gains in net energy yield ...
My friend A.G. uses the steam locomotive as an example of the same idea .
Toward the end of the steam locomotive 's era of dominance , manufacturers were expending ever greater sums on ever smaller refinements to a system whose top efficiency was very low .
When the diesel - electric locomotive came on the scene with efficiencies far higher than the old steam behemoths could ever achieve , the entire steam locomotive industry faded away as quickly as the buggy whip .
The steam - based manufacturers were so focued on squeezing an ever smaller marginal return out of their antiquated technology that they completely missed the advent of a far - superior technology .
Here is an example of diminishing / marginal returns run amok .
A friend is currently engaged in a huge renovation of a two - story hillside home , the key feature of which is a new concrete foundation .
The city required him to hire a special private - industry inspector during the concrete pours to ensure that the concrete was being laid down in such a fashion that it would reach the specified strength ( 3000 psi , etc. ) .
Now this makes sense when you 're constructing a 20 - story building , but a wood - frame two - story house is a comparatively lightweight structure .
The concrete and reinforcing bar ( rebar ) in this foundation was massively over - engineered ( i.e. easily enough to support a 4 - 5 floor structure ) , so the question arises : what benefit accrued from the hundreds of dollars spent to hire this inspector ?
One way to answer this is to ask : 1 . how many two - story wood - frame dwellings collapsed in the past two major earthquakes due to catastrophic failure of their concrete foundations or retaining walls due to failure of the actual concrete ?
( i.e. not if the walls did not have enough rebar due to faulty engineering . )
Answer : zero .
2 . how many residents were killed by the failure of foundations beneath two - story wood - frame dwellings in the past 100 years ?
How many were injured ?
Answer : zero and zero .
So exactly what benefit results when the problem supposedly " solved " -- loss of life due to collapsing foundations of two - story wood - frame homes due to failure of the concrete to reach specified strength -- does not even exist ?
This " overkill " is endemic to governmental regulations which have no feedback mechanism , either price ( price is no object because the government is n't paying ) or utility ( we say this over - engineering is a good thing because it " lowers risk " , even when we can't quantify the risk , because it's " free " for government to specify it ) .
I submit that this feedback - free mechanism of marginal returns has burrowed into the very heart of the American economy and government .
Blinders ( the steam locomotive analogy ) work in private industry ( let 's spend $ 70 per barrel extracting shale oil , and then $ 80 , $ 90 and $ 100 / barrel in ever more marginal oil exploration / production ) while price / utility - feedback - free government loads every remaining industry in the U.S. down with ever - more extensive and confusing , overlapping regulations until either that industry is driven out of business or becomes uncompetitive with non-U.S. suppliers .
Correspondent Michael Goodfellow provided an example with this comment : Interesting reading .
Everyone gripes about foreign competition and low salaries in places like China .
Sometimes they add " and they have no environmental laws . "
But I do n't think people really realize what American regulation has come to .
Clark foam / surfboards closes its doors .
Think this is extreme ?
Think again .
A recent story here in town described a resident who was fined $ 3,000 for erecting a greenhouse on his roof without obtaining a proper permit .
OK , fair enough ; life safety issues are legitimate concerns .
But then the city demanded a $ 4,000 non-refundable fee to review his permit application , all for a 12 - foot square greenhouse which cost far less than the non-refundable deposit -- which is not the actual permit fee , of course , just a review fee the city keeps even if they do n't issue a permit .
All this needs to be a completely All - American story is a couple of lawsuits which cost ten or twenty times the value of the offending greenhouse -- lawsuits which completely miss the irony of the " green " intent of the owner .
" This guy is THE leading visionary on reality .
He routinely discusses things which no one else has talked about , yet , turn out to be quite relevant months later . "

‘ LOST ” fanatics , start saving your dough now .
Come May 2010 , you ’ll need it to bid on iconic pieces of “ Lost ” memorabilia , including genuine props like Hurley ’s winning Lotto ticket , Charlie ’s guitar , Kate ’s toy plane , Sawyer ’s letter and Locke ’s hunting knife .
ABC is teaming up with Profiles in History to sell off iconic props , sets , costumes and other collectible artifacts from “ Lost ” after its fifth ( and final ) season airs .
Fans at San Diego Comic - Con today will get a sneak peek at what ’s available .
Expect the “ Lost ” items to go for a pretty penny , judging from previous Profiles in History sales figures : The Cowardly Lion costume from “ The Wizard of Oz ” went for $ 805,000 , while Capt .
Kirk ’s “ Star Trek ” command chair sold for $ 304,750 and the original “ Lost in Space ” robot cleared $ 264,500 .
Selling off outmoded TV series props is becoming a burgeoning business for production studios , looking to recoup some money or clear out shelf space in their warehouses .
Last year , NBC held a live auction for “ Passions ” props when the soap went off the air .
And , when “ Battlestar Galactica ” ended in May , Syfy sold off a plethora of props from the acclaimed sci- fi series through Propworx , with profits being shared with various charities .
But , the biggest newsmaker was CBS and Paramount ’s 2006 Christie ’s “ Star Trek ” prop and costume auction , which raked it in big time , landing $ 7 million .
The number of politicians and their advisers on the UK public payroll now tops 29,000 , BBC research has found .
The figure includes councillors , MPs , peers , MEPs , members of the Scottish Parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies and their staff .
Their total cost is estimated at more than £ 499 m for the year 2007 / 8 .
The figures , from Freedom of Information requests for BBC Radio 4's The Political Club , suggests numbers have increased 10 - fold in 30 years .
' Vast bill '
The programme found that the total cost of MPs ' and ministers ' pay plus their Commons staff , expenses and allowances , policy development grants and " Short payments " to opposition parties stood at £ 167 m in 2007 / 8 .
The total cost for salaries , expenses and payments to the opposition in the Lords was approximately £ 19.1 m .
There is this huge bill that 's actually grown very quietly without ever really consulting people .
Mark Wallace
Taxpayers ' Alliance
Listen : The Political Club Equivalent costs for devolved institutions was £ 19 m for the Scottish Parliament , £ 10.3 m for the Welsh Assembly , £ 13.3 m for the Northern Ireland Assembly and £ 5.4 m for the London Mayor and Assembly .
For the UK's 22,737 councillors and their assistants , the bill for pay and allowances was £ 254.6 m .
COUNCIL BY COUNCIL
Find out the details for your council , and see how they compare Download the statistics [ Excel , 248 kb ] MEP 's salaries cost £ 4,821,960 , the programme found - but the European Parliament would not disclose the bill for their expenses .
Some 73 special advisers to UK government ministers also cost approximately £ 5.9 m .
Mark Wallace , campaigns director of the Taxpayers '
Alliance , described the sums involved as " huge " .
' Gutter politics '
He added : " This is a vast bill that I think a lot of people will find extremely shocking when they hear about it .
" The fact is people do n't mind paying a reasonable amount for good work , but what they do mind is the idea that there is this huge bill that 's actually grown very quietly without ever really consulting people . "
As part of a practice known as " tithing " , all of the main political parties expect their representatives to make contributions to party funds .
For example , Liberal Democrat councillors are expected to donate 10 % of their council pay to the party or face being dropped .
Labour also imposes a compulsory levy on its representatives .
It seems to me entirely reasonable that if you expect to be a public representative of the party you then are asked for a contribution
Simon Hughes MP
The Conservatives say they have banned tithing , but Conservative councillors told the programme 's presenter , BBC Newsnight 's political editor Michael Crick , that there was a moral pressure to contribute to the party .
Concerns have been expressed about the practice , described by Mr Wallace as " extremely dubious " and " effectively state funding of political parties by the back door " .
The programme also spoke to Richard Hall , who was a Lib Dem councillor in North Yorkshire until 2008 when he refused to accept the party 's 10 % tithe .
He said : " I would not stoop to the level of gutter politics to be forced to buy my approval with public money sourced from the taxpayer , it 's as simple as that . "
' Entirely reasonable ' Sir Jeremy Beecham , who was chair of Labour 's National Executive Committee when the rules were changed , confirmed it was not possible to be an elected representative for the party without giving it money .
He added : " It is expected of Labour public representatives that we should contribute to the party to which we belong and whom we seek to represent and to help secure the support that we need to do our job as Labour party - or it may be Lib Dem or Conservative - representatives . "
Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes insisted : " It seems to me entirely reasonable that if you expect to be a public representative of the party you then are asked for a contribution . "
A statement by the Conservative Party said : " It is up to each MP to justify their expenses claims to the public and their constituents , and all MPs have a duty to ensure that their arrangements for holding those surgeries are open , transparent and represent value for money for taxpayers .
" Additionally , all claims now have to go through a much more rigorous process of audit and assurance . "
* The Political Club is broadcast at 1100 BST on 13 July on BBC Radio 4 .

Joel is on his way back from Italy .
For today , we give you Vijay Ravindran , a Postie who is fairly new to town and in need of a hot car .
My Futile Effort to Help the American Auto Industry
By Vijay Ravindran
I wanted a Chevy Camaro .
I 'd never really liked American sports cars before .
But the 2010 Camaro -- a revival Chevrolet has been talking up since 2006 -- is so much more sleek than your typical muscle car .
And since my BMW 330 started showing its age ( nine ) around the same time that the death of the U.S. auto industry hit the headlines , I thought :
Why not do a little something to help ?
So , after seeing a newspaper ad promoting Camaros at a local Chevy dealer , I called and left a voicemail saying I was interested in a test drive .
I never heard back .
I was shocked .
Here I was , ready to buy , while GM was in financial straits .
I thought they'd be all over me .
Turns out it 's not so easy to obtain a piece of the American dream .
The next week , I decided to widen my search .
I e-mailed four Chevy dealers in the area .
Two never wrote back .
One replied that they had no Camaros , and ended the correspondence right there .
The fourth said they'd have one soon -- just stay tuned .
Dealer 4 began to check in periodically -- pitching Camaros that I could buy sight unseen .
I reminded him of my request for a test drive .
Then I reiterated my request for a test drive .
Then I absolutely insisted on a test drive .
And , eventually , I ended up with an appointment .
But after driving 45 minutes to the dealer , I found that the one Camaro they 'd gotten in was an automatic ( I 'd asked for a manual transmission ) and that I would n't be allowed to drive it , just sit in it on the lot .
The sales person tried to get me in a Corvette and to convince me that transmission is the same ( it 's not ) .
I left the dealership , dejected , but not yet ready to give up .
Three days later , I got an e-mail :
Hello Vijay ,
I know that we have been diligent in our follow - up , however , we have not reached an agreeable time for you to come in .
Is there something more we can give you ?
If not , can we assume that you are no longer in the market to purchase a vehicle and be taken out of our follow - up system ?
Thanks .
The last of my dealers had abandoned me .
And so I abandoned my effort as well .
I still hope that someday I may get a Camaro .
I 'm just hoping my BMW holds out long enough for supply to catch up to demand .

Under the " breakthrough " in the House , there will be no vote on health care before the August recess .
Politico adds :
Republicans , meanwhile , are ready to use the August recess to rip the bill apart and attack Democrats in their home districts .
Democrats need to explain the bill .
No argument there .
But they should n't devote 100 % of the time to defense .
There should also be a strong coordinated attack on Republicans ( or Dems ) for opposing " reform , " for providing no alternative , for standing with insurance companies , etc .
I suppose it might hurt some feelings , but we should n't individualize politics .
It is n't about feelings and egos and wooing .
It 's more structural than that .
Politicians vote for things they feel pressure to vote for .
They oppose things they feel pressure to vote against .
If you want to win , you have to create the right incentives .
If the Dems spend the entire recess trying to fight off every attack , health coverage reform is in jeopardy .
If they attack Republicans ' defense of the status quo -- if they make it a liability -- reform becomes much more likely .
Here , I describe basic tips to configure and manage systems , mostly from the console .
In a screen session , all keyboard inputs are sent to your current window except for the command keystroke .
All screen command keystrokes are entered by typing ^A ( " Control - A " ) plus a single key [ plus any parameters ] .
Here are important ones to remember .
You can save connection fees with screen for metered network connections such as dial - up and packet ones , because you can leave a process active while disconnected , and then re-attach it later when you connect again .
screen magically reattaches all previous screen windows with all actively running programs .
You log in again to the same remote machine ( even from a different terminal ) .
Type ^A DD ( " Control - A " followed by " DD " ) to have screen detach and log you out
Type ^A d ( " Control - A " followed by " d " ) and manually logging out from the remote connection
You may detach the screen session by any methods .
Suddenly you need to leave your terminal , but you do n't want to lose your active work by keeping the connection .
You switch among the multiple screen windows by ^A n ( " Control - A " followed by " n " ) .
You execute multiple programs in screen windows created with ^A c ( " Control - A " followed by " c " ) .
screen ( 1 ) not only allows one terminal window to work with multiple processes , but also allows remote shell process to survive interrupted connections .
Here is a typical use scenario of screen ( 1 ) .
screen ( 1 ) is a very useful tool for people to access remote sites via unreliable or intermittent connections since it supports interrupted network connections .
You can browse the change history of " /etc " by executing " sudo GIT_DIR= / etc /.git gitk " with clear view for new installed packages , removed packages , and version changes of packages .
As you change your configuration , you can use git ( 1 ) normally to record them .
It automatically records changes nicely every time you run package management commands , too .
Essentially , running " sudo etckeeper init " initializes the git repository for " /etc " just like the process explained in Section 10.6.5 , “ Git for recording configuration history ” but with special hook scripts for more thorough setups .
I recommend to use the etckeeper package with git ( 1 ) which put entire " /etc " under VCS control .
Its installation guide and tutorial are found in " /usr / share/doc/etckeeper/README.gz " .
Table 9.6 .
List of packages to record configuration history in VCS
There are specialized tools to record changes in configuration files with help of DVCS system .
There are few ways to record the graphic image of an X application , including an xterm display .
For Emacs , as follows .
For Vim , as follows .
You can record the editor activities for complex repeats .
You can turn off these colorizing aliases in the interactive environment by invoking shell with " TERM =dumb bash " .
The use of alias limits color effects to the interactive command usage .
It has advantage over exporting environment variable " export GREP_OPTIONS ='-- color=auto ' " since color can be seen under pager programs such as less ( 1 ) .
If you wish to suppress color when piping to other programs , use " -- color=auto " instead in the above example for " ~ /.bashrc " .
Colorized commands are handy for inspecting their output in the interactive environment .
I include the following in my " ~/.bashrc " .
For example , try the following
Shell echo to most modern terminals can be colorized using ANSI escape code ( see " /usr / share/doc/xterm/ctlseqs.txt.gz " ) .
ISO 8601 is followed for these iso - formats .
You can eliminate typing long option on commandline using command alias , e.g. " alias ls='ls -- time - style=+%d. %m. %y \ %H:%M ' " ( see Section 1.5.9 , “ Command alias ” ) .
Table 9.4 .
Display examples of time and date for the " ls -l " command for wheezy
If you really wish to customize this display format of time and date beyond the locale , you should set the time style value by the " - - time - style " argument or by the " $ TIME_STYLE " value ( see ls ( 1 ) , date ( 1 ) , " info coreutils 'ls invocation ' " ) .
The actual default display format for each locale depends on the version of the standard C library ( the libc6 package ) used .
I.e. , different releases of Debian had different defaults .
The default display format of time and date by the " ls -l " command depends on the locale ( see Section 1.2.6 , “ Timestamps ” for value ) .
The " $ LANG " variable is referred first and it can be overridden by the " $ LC_TIME " variable .
For vim ( 1 ) and its pager mode alias view ( 1 ) , " : set hls " enables highlighted search .
You may use emacs ( 1 ) with " M-x shell " , " M-x eshell " , or " M-x term " to perform recording of console .
You may later use " C-x C-w " to write the buffer to a file .
You may use screen ( 1 ) with " ^A H " ( see Section 9.1.2 , “ Key bindings for the screen command ” ) to perform recording of console .
Some x-terminal - emulator such as gnome - terminal can record .
You may wish to extend line buffer for scrollback .
If you do n't have script ( for example , during the boot process in the initramfs ) , you can use the following instead .
Do whatever … and press Ctrl - D to exit script .
The simple use of script ( 1 ) ( see Section 1.4.9 , “ Recording the shell activities ” ) to record shell activity produces a file with control characters .
This can be avoided by using col ( 1 ) as the following .
CRM114 provides language infrastructure to write fuzzy filters with the TRE regex library .
Its popular use is spam mail filter but it can be used as log analyzer .
Here are notable log analyzers ( " ~ Gsecurity : : log- analyzer " in aptitude ( 8 ) ) .
Many programs record their activities under the " / var / log / " directory .
9.3 . Monitoring , controlling , and starting program activities
Program activities can be monitored and controlled using specialized tools .
Tip
The procps packages provide very basics of monitoring , controlling , and starting program activities .
You should learn all of them .
9.3.1 . Timing a process Display time used by the process invoked by the command .
# time some_command >/dev/null real 0m0.035s # time on wall clock ( elapsed real time ) user 0m0.000s # time in user mode sys 0m0.020s # time in kernel mode
9.3.2 .
The scheduling priority A nice value is used to control the scheduling priority for the process .
Table 9.8 .
List of nice values for the scheduling priority nice value scheduling priority 19 lowest priority process ( nice ) 0 very high priority process for user - 20 very high priority process for root ( not- nice )
# nice - 19 top # very nice # nice -- 20 wodim - v - eject speed =2 dev=0,0 disk.img # very fast Sometimes an extreme nice value does more harm than good to the system .
Use this command carefully .
9.3.3 .
The ps command The ps ( 1 ) command on a Debian system support both BSD and SystemV features and helps to identify the process activity statically .
Table 9.9 .
List of ps command styles style typical command feature BSD ps aux display %CPU %MEM System V ps -efH display PPID
For the zombie ( defunct ) children process , you can kill them by the parent process ID identified in the " PPID " field .
The pstree ( 1 ) command display a tree of processes .
9.3.4 . The top command top ( 1 ) on the Debian system has rich features and helps to identify what process is acting funny dynamically .
It is an interactive full screen program .
You can get its usage help press by pressing the " h " - key and terminate it by pressing the " q " - key .
9.3.5 . Listing files opened by a process
You can list all files opened by a process with a process ID ( PID ) , e.g. 1 , by the following .
$ sudo lsof -p 1 PID=1 is usually the init program .
9.3.6 . Tracing program activities
You can trace program activity with strace ( 1 ) , ltrace ( 1 ) , or xtrace ( 1 ) for system calls and signals , library calls , or communication between X11 client and server .
You can trace system calls of the ls command as the following .
$ sudo strace ls
9.3.7 . Identification of processes using files or sockets
You can also identify processes using files by fuser ( 1 ) , e.g. for " /var/log/mail.log " by the following .
$ sudo fuser -v /var/log/mail.log USER PID ACCESS COMMAND /var/log/mail.log : root 2946 F.... rsyslogd
You see that file " / var /log/ mail.log " is open for writing by the rsyslogd ( 8 ) command .
You can also identify processes using sockets by fuser ( 1 ) , e.g. for " smtp/tcp " by the following .
$ sudo fuser -v smtp/tcp USER PID ACCESS COMMAND smtp/tcp : Debian - exim 3379 F.... exim4
Now you know your system runs exim4 ( 8 ) to handle TCP connections to SMTP port ( 25 ) .
9.3.8 . Repeating a command with a constant interval watch ( 1 ) executes a program repeatedly with a constant interval while showing its output in fullscreen .
$ watch w
This displays who is logged on to the system updated every 2 seconds .
9.3.9 .
Repeating a command looping over files
There are several ways to repeat a command looping over files matching some condition , e.g. matching glob pattern " *.ext " .
Shell for - loop method ( see Section 12.1.4 , “ Shell loops ” ) : for x in *.ext ; do if [ -f " $ x " ] ; then command " $x " ; fi ; done find ( 1 ) and xargs ( 1 ) combination : find .
- type f - maxdepth 1 - name '*. ext ' - print0 | xargs - 0 -n 1 command find ( 1 ) with " - exec " option with a command : find .
- type f - maxdepth 1 - name '*. ext ' - exec command ' {} ' \ ; find ( 1 ) with " - exec " option with a short shell script : find .
- type f - maxdepth 1 - name '*. ext ' - exec sh -c " command ' {} ' && echo ' successful ' " \;
The above examples are written to ensure proper handling of funny file names such as ones containing spaces .
See Section 10.1.5 , “ Idioms for the selection of files ” for more advance uses of find ( 1 ) .
9.3.10 .
Starting a program from GUI
For the command - line interface ( CLI ) , the first program with the matching name found in the directories specified in the $ PATH environment variable is executed .
See Section 1.5.3 , “ The " $ PATH " variable ” .
For the graphical user interface ( GUI ) compliant to the freedesktop.org standards , the *.desktop files in the /usr / share / applications / directory provide necessary attributes for the GUI menu display of each program .
See Section 7.2.2 , “ Freedesktop.org menu ” .
For example , the chromium .
desktop file defines attributes for the " Chromium Web Browser " such as " Name " for the program name , " Exec " for the program execution path and arguments , " Icon " for the icon used , etc. ( see the Desktop Entry Specification ) as follows : [ Desktop Entry ] Version =1.0 Name=Chromium Web Browser GenericName=Web Browser Comment=Access the Internet Comment[ fr ]
=Explorer le Web Exec=/usr / bin/ chromium %U Terminal=false X-MultipleArgs=false Type=Application Icon=chromium Categories =Network ; WebBrowser ; MimeType=text/html;text/xml;application/xhtml_xml;x-scheme-handler/http;x-scheme-handler/https ;
StartupWMClass=Chromium StartupNotify=true
This is an oversimplified description .
The *. desktop files are scanned as follows .
The desktop environment sets $ XDG_DATA_HOME and $ XDG_DATA_DIR environment variables .
For example , under the GNOME 3 : $ XDG_DATA_HOME is unset .
( The default value of $ HOME / . local / share is used . )
$ XDG_DATA_DIRS is set to /usr / share / gnome:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/ .
So the base directories ( see XDG Base Directory Specification ) and the applications directories are as follows .
$ HOME /.local / share / → $ HOME /.local / share / applications /
/usr/share /gnome/ → /usr/share/gnome/applications/
/usr/local / share / → /usr/local / share / applications /
/usr / share / → /usr / share / applications /
The *. desktop files are scanned in these applications directories in this order .
Tip A user custom GUI menu entry can be created by adding a *. desktop file in the $ HOME / . local / share / applications / directory .
Tip Similarly , if a *. desktop file is created in the autostart directory under these base directories , the specified program in the *. desktop file is executed automatically when the desktop environment is started .
See Desktop Application Autostart Specification .
Tip Similarly , if a *. desktop file is created in the $ HOME / Desktop directory and the Desktop environment is configured to support the desktop icon launcher feature , the specified program in it is executed upon clicking the icon .
Please note that the actual name of the $ HOME / Desktop directory is locale dependent .
See xdg-user - dirs - update ( 1 ) .
9.3.11 .
Customizing program to be started Some programs start another program automatically .
Here are check points for customizing this process .
Application configuration menu : GNOME3 desktop : " Settings " → " System " → " Details " → " Default Applications " KDE desktop : " K " → " Control Center " → " KDE Components " → " Component Chooser " Iceweasel browser : " Edit " → " Preferences " → " Applications " mc( 1 ) : " /etc/mc/mc.ext "
Environment variables such as " $ BROWSER " , " $ EDITOR " , " $ VISUAL " , and " $ PAGER " ( see eviro n ( 7 ) )
The update - alternatives ( 1 ) system for programs such as " editor " , " view " , " x - www - browser " , " gnome - www - browser " , and " www - browser " ( see Section 1.4.7 , “ Setting a default text editor ” )
the " ~/.mailcap " and " /etc / mailcap " file contents which associate MIME type with program ( see mailcap ( 5 ) )
The " ~/.mime.types " and " /etc/ mime.types " file contents which associate file name extension with MIME type ( see run-mailcap ( 1 ) ) Tip update - mime ( 8 ) updates the " /etc / mailcap " file using " /etc/mailcap.order " file ( see mailcap.order ( 5 ) ) .
Tip
The debianutils package provides sensible - browser ( 1 ) , sensible - editor ( 1 ) , and sensible - pager ( 1 ) which make sensible decisions on which editor , pager , and web browser to call , respectively .
I recommend you to read these shell scripts .
Tip
In order to run a console application such as mutt under X as your preferred application , you should create an X application as following and set " /usr / local / bin / mutt - term " as your preferred application to be started as described .
# cat /usr / local / bin/mutt - term << EOF #!/bin/sh gnome - terminal -e " mutt \$@ " EOF chmod 755 /usr/ local/bin/mutt-term
9.3.12 . Killing a process Use kill ( 1 ) to kill ( or send a signal to ) a process by the process ID .
Use killall ( 1 ) or pkill ( 1 ) to do the same by the process command name and other attributes .
Table 9.10 .
List of frequently used signals for kill command signal value signal name function 1 HUP restart daemon 15 TERM normal kill 9 KILL kill hard
9.3.13 .
Scheduling tasks once Run the at ( 1 ) command to schedule a one - time job by the following .
$ echo ' command - args '| at 3:40 monday
9.3.14 . Scheduling tasks regularly Use cron( 8 ) to schedule tasks regularly .
See crontab ( 1 ) and crontab ( 5 ) .
You can schedule to run processes as a normal user , e.g. foo by creating a crontab ( 5 ) file as " /var/spool / cron/crontabs / foo " with " crontab -e " command .
Here is an example of a crontab ( 5 ) file .
# use / bin / sh to run commands , no matter what /etc / passwd says SHELL= / bin/sh # mail any output to paul , no matter whose crontab this is MAILTO=paul # Min Hour DayOfMonth Month DayOfWeek command ( Day ... are OR'ed ) # run at 00:05 , every day 5 0 * * * $ HOME/bin/daily.job >>
$ HOME / tmp/ out 2>&1 # run at 14:15 on the first of every month -- output mailed to paul 15 14 1 * * $ HOME / bin / monthly # run at 22:00 on weekdays ( 1 - 5 ) , annoy Joe. % for newline , last % for cc : 0 22 * * 1 - 5 mail -s " It 's 10 pm " joe % Joe , % % Where are your kids ? % . %% 23 */2 1 2 * echo " run 23 minutes after 0 am , 2 am , 4 am ... , on Feb 1 " 5 4 * * sun echo " run at 04:05 every Sunday " # run at 03:40 on the first Monday of each month 40 3 1 - 7 * * [ " $ ( date + %a ) " == " Mon " ] && command - args Tip For the system not running continuously , install the anacron package to schedule periodic commands at the specified intervals as closely as machine - uptime permits .
See anacron ( 8 ) and anacrontab ( 5 ) .
Tip
For scheduled system maintenance scripts , you can run them periodically from root account by placing such scripts in " /etc/cron.hourly / " , " /etc/cron.daily / " , " /etc/cron.weekly / " , or " /etc/cron.monthly / " .
Execution timings of these scripts can be customized by " /etc/ crontab " and " /etc/anacrontab " .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - New investment in clean energy will total $ 95 to $ 115 billion in 2009 , representing a drop of 26 - 39 percent from last year ’s total of $ 155 billion , data published by research group New Energy Finance showed on Friday .

The clean energy sector including wind and solar power enjoyed more than fourthfold growth in investment since 2004 but has suffered a sharp fall as a result of the financial crisis .
“ It is disappointing that 2009 will look likely to show such a significant fall in new investment in clean energy .
However , the good news is that it does look as though the worst is past , ” Michael Liebreich , chairman and chief executive of New Energy Finance said in a statement .
Investment in the second quarter of the year has already surpassed the first quarter by a third , the group said .
But the first quarter was “ disastrous ” as investment shrank by 44 percent compared to the fourth quarter and 53 percent from the corresponding period last year .
On the plus side , the first quarter was probably the lowest point for clean energy investment in the economic downturn .
“ The biggest single obstacle facing the sector this year - the sudden shortage of debt finance for wind farm , solar parks and other clean energy projects caused by the banking crisis - may also be past its worst , ” the group said in a report .
Bankers are more optimistic about a gradual improvement in the availability of project debt during the rest of this year , the group said .
In the second quarter there have been some signs of recovery .
Investment in clean energy companies through the public markets has rallied sharply , with over $ 2 billion of completed secondary issues by companies such as SunPower , Q - Cells , Evergreen Solar and SunTech Power .
Added to that , the arrival of “ green stimulus funds ” from governments should help the sector .
Since last September , major economies have announced a total of $ 184.9 billion of stimulus funds aimed at clean energy or energy efficiency .
New Energy
Finance estimates that more than two thirds of this money will be spent in 2010 and 2011 , with 15 percent less , or around $ 28 billion , being spent this year .
“ The bulk of ( the money ) is likely to arrive next year and thereafter , by which time the clean energy sector may be well on the way to recovery under its own steam , ” Liebreich said .
MMMMM ! Bayyyy - connn !

Funny Ad from New Zealand
The space shuttle Atlantis is less than a week away from blasting off to overhaul the Hubble Space Telescope for the fifth and final time in its nearly 20 - year lifetime , but this last flight stands out from the pack in more ways than one .
Atlantis and a crew of seven astronauts are slated to launch toward Hubble on May 11 at 2:01 p.m. EDT ( 1801 GMT ) from NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral , Fla .
Their mission is packed with five back - to - back spacewalks to repair vital systems and boost Hubble 's vision into the universe .
NASA has even primed a second space shuttle to serve as a rescue ship in the unlikely event that Atlantis suffers critical damage space junk and strands its crew in orbit .
Here are reader questions asked in a recent Live Forum hosted by SPACE.com reporters , along with a few others on the nuts and bolts of the mission :
Why does Hubble need this last overhaul flight ?
It 's been seven years since NASA 's last Hubble servicing mission ( STS - 109 in 2002 ) and the space telescope was designed to typically go only three years between overhauls .
Because of the long gap , several systems have experiences some failures and need repair .
NASA had already built new cameras , instruments and maintenance gear to support this flight , too .
Why is this NASA 's last mission to Hubble ?
Under NASA 's current plan , the agency will retire its aging three space shuttles in 2010 after completing construction of the International Space Station .
There will then no vehicle large enough to carry new instruments to Hubble or return broken components to Earth .
The shuttles typically carry seven people on two - week flights .
Each has a cavernous cargo bay 15 feet ( 4.5 - meters ) wide and 60 feet ( 18 meters ) long .
NASA 's shuttle replacement , the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle , is a smaller , capsule - based spacecraft currently designed to launch four astronauts to the space station or on lunar missions .
Did n't NASA cancel this final shuttle flight to Hubble ?
What happened ?
Yes .
NASA canceled Atlantis ' STS - 125 mission to extend Hubble 's operational life in January 2004 after a review board found it too risky in the wake of the 2003 Columbia tragedy that killed seven astronauts .
The board directed NASA to fly only missions that kept shuttle astronauts within reach of the International Space Station , where they could take refuge if their spacecraft was damaged .
But the cancellation was met by fierce opposition from the public and science community .
In 2005 , NASA considered sending a robot to perform the Hubble repairs and upgrades , but ultimately found it infeasible .
By September 2006 , NASA had successfully resumed space shuttle launches and flown the first two missions since the Columbia accident .
That success , coupled with new heat shield and repair tools , led NASA to reconsider — and later approve — the final Hubble servicing mission .
If it was approved , why is there a rescue shuttle for the Hubble servicing mission ?
While NASA is confident Atlantis ' mission to Hubble will go well , the agency is also prepared in case it does n't .
Because the shuttle must fly higher and in a different inclination than the space station to reach Hubble , it does not have enough fuel to reach both the space telescope and orbiting lab .
Atlantis pilot Gregory C. Johnson has said the shuttle will spend nearly half its propellant just to reach Hubble , leaving it very little margin to return home .
That is a standard feature of all Hubble repair missions because of the telescope 's high orbit ( 300 miles up , whereas the space station is around 220 miles above the planet ) .
So , the shuttle Endeavour is already poised on a second launch pad .
NASA plans to have Endeavour and a small crew of four astronauts ready to launch within seven days of any possible declared emergency .
What new science will the upgrades allow for Hubble ?
Hubble can currently see distant galaxies and stars that were forming when the universe was just 700 million years old .
The universe is currently 13.7 billion years old , and with the upgrade during STS - 125 , astronomers hope Hubble will be able to see the universe at time about 500 million years after the theoretical Big Bang that started it all .
Astronomers are hopeful the new gear will allow Hubble to see infant galaxies among other new findings .
When would the first images from Hubble be released ?
If all goes well with the Hubble repair mission , the first new image is expected to be released around September .
The telescope 's control center at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , plans about 10 weeks of tests and checkouts to make sure the telescope is fully operationally .
What are the main goals for the Atlantis ' STS - 125 Hubble Servicing Mission ?
The following is a basic rundown of work to be performed during five spacewalks .
New Instruments and Gear :
Installing the Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) : a new and more powerful main camera that bests its predecessors by seeing in both ultraviolet and near infrared as well as visible light .
Hubble would be able to see 90 times more objects than it did at launch in April 1990 .
This instrument will replace Hubble 's current Wide Field Camera 2 , which will be brought back to Earth .
Adding the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ( COS ) :
This instrument uses the ultraviolet range to find out the temperature , density , chemical composition and velocity of intergalactic gas and galaxies , with ten times the sensitivity of current Hubble instruments .
This device will replace Hubble 's corrective lens — COSTAR — which fixed the blurry vision caused by the telescope 's flawed main mirror .
The corrective optics are no longer required because all of Hubble 's new instruments automatically compensate for the mirror 's flaw .
Attaching the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System :
This docking port will allow a future spacecraft , most likely robotic , to latch onto Hubble in order to guide it to a fiery demise in Earth 's atmosphere or up to the relative safety of a graveyard — or ' museum ' — orbit .
Maintenance work :
Replacing six Rate Sensor Units ( RSU ) :
The gyroscopes help keep Hubble pointed precisely at distant stars and galaxies for hours at a time .
Hubble can technically limp by on two or even one gyroscope , but the fresh exchange ensures that the science keeps flowing .
Replace one of three Fine Guidance Sensors : Hubble has three Fine Guidance Sensors used to keep the telescope stead for long - duration observations .
They are also used for astrometry , which studies the precise position and motion of stars .
Replacing six Nickel Hydrogen Batteries :
The suitcase - sized batteries get swapped out for the first time in 16 years , giving Hubble an extra lease on life for the next 5 to 10 years .
The batteries keep Hubble humming during the night portion of its orbit .
Replacing Thermal Insulation :
The multilayer insulation on Hubble has become torn and broken by the harsh environment of space .
The new thermal blankets protect the damaged insulation and helps maintain a steady temperature for Hubble .
Vital Repairs :
Repairing the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer ( STIS ) :
A two - sided instrument that uniquely scans across all light wavelengths of objects such as planets , comets , stars and galaxies .
Spacewalkers will replace a failed power converter to restore one side of the damaged device .
Replacing the Fine Guidance Sensor ( FGS ) :
One of three optical sensors that help Hubble lock onto targets with a system of mirrors and lenses .
The old FGS returns home after being removed from Hubble during an earlier servicing mission .
Fixing the Advance Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) : A highly efficient survey tool with a wide field of view that became damaged .
Astronauts hope to repair some of its capabilities since it failed last year .
Repairing the Science Instrument Command & Data Handling Unit :
This repair will restore full redundancy to Hubble 's vital data handling unit , which serves as the central relay that beams telescope imagery and data back to Earth .
How many days will the shuttle be docked with Hubble during the mission / repair ?
Atlantis will arrive at Hubble on the third day of the 11 - day mission and cast off on Flight Day 9 , so it will be attached for about a week .
Five of those consecutive days include spacewalks .
How would the rescue mission work , if needed , and how long would it last ?
A rescue mission to Atlantis — called STS - 400 — would last about a week .
Endeavour would launch from Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center with shuttle commander Chris Ferguson , pilot Eric Boe and spacewalkers Shane Kimbrough and Stephen Bowen .
The rescue crew consists of the same four astronauts who last launched on Endeavour 's flight deck during its most recent flight , STS - 126 in November 2008 .
The astronauts would fly Endeavour to Atlantis , and grapple the stricken ship with Endeavour 's robotic arm .
They would then perform a complicated series of three spacewalks to move the seven astronauts from the damaged Atlantis into Endeavour , with Atlantis commander Scott Altman the last to leave .
After a day to rest , the astronauts would perform their standard prelanding heat shield inspection and return to Earth a day or so later .
NASA considers the need for such a rescue mission as extremely unlikely , but wanted to have an option just in case .
What is the greatest risk to Atlantis ' crew ?
NASA officials have repeatedly said that the STS - 125 mission to Hubble faces a higher risk of severe damage from space junk and micrometeorites .
Initially , that risk was about a 1 - in - 185 chance , which exceeded NASA 's safety rules that call for a maximum risk of a 1 - in - 200 chance .
Since then , NASA has found ways to reduce the risk further by flying Atlantis in a tail - first orientation with its payload bay facing the Earth as much as possible .
The shuttle will also fire its engines to move to a safer orbit just after releasing Hubble near the end of its mission .
Altogether , NASA 's management efforts now set the risk at about a 1 - in - 229 chance of critical damage from space junk , despite recent spikes in debris levels from a Feb. 10 satellite collision and China 's 2007 anti-satellite test .
The current 1 - in - 229 chance puts the risk on par with other risks associated with human spaceflight , NASA officials have said .
How does the Delta V profile for this mission differ from a " normal " ISS flight ?
Atlantis will launch due east from NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Central Florida .
It is destined for an orbit of about 300 miles ( 482 km ) , or about 100 miles higher than the International Space Station , which has an inclination — or tilt with respect to the Earth 's equator — of about 28.5 degrees .
On space station missions , a space shuttle launches to a high inclination of 51.6 along a northeasterly track to reach the outpost 's 220 - mile ( 354 - km ) orbit .
How much longer will Hubble last ?
It seems like it 's been up there forever !
It 's certainly has been up there for awhile !
The mission engineers say that if everything goes according to plan and they get the necessary repairs done , Hubble will last for at least another five years , or through at least 2014 — possibly longer .
Hubble launched aboard the space shuttle Discovery on April 24 , 1990 and celebrated its 19th birthday in orbit last month .
What could spell the death of Hubble ?
Without the upcoming STS - 125 mission , Hubble is one failure away ( the data handling unit they revived last fall ) from being space junk .
With it , it has a good chance of going at least through 2014 , but some of the repaired gear will be single string only .
So that can fail .
Even a wayward space rock or orbital trash could pose a real , and unexpected threat down the road .
Is this really NASA 's final service call to Hubble or could a future spacecraft like Orion attempt some type of flight ?
From what the mission scientists said , this really is the last call .
Orion wo n't be in place until no earlier than 2015 , and Hubble is meant to be serviced every three years ( this is the longest it has gone — seven years — without servicing ) .
They also have n't commissioned any new parts and those would take awhile to build if they did want to send anything new up there .
Looking to the future , how will Hubble be decommissioned ?
Will they capture it and return it to Earth when it is finally ready to be taken offline ?
Or , is it a situation where as long as it's healthy , it will stay in service like the Mars rovers ?
NASA originally discussed plans to return Hubble to Earth at the end of its mission , but with the shuttle fleet retiring that 's not in the cards now .
Lead STS - 125 spacewalker John Grunsfeld has said even if NASA wanted to , Hubble may now be too big and heavy ( with all the added hardware over the last 19 years ) to fit in a shuttle payload bay .
During the STS - 125 mission , spacewalkers will attach a soft docking mechanism , a docking port for a future robotic spacecraft that — at the end of Hubble 's mission — could latch on and then steer the school bus -sized space telescope into a controlled re-entry .
A sort of space cremation , most likely over the Pacific Ocean .
Grunsfeld said the jury is still out on this .
NASA could also attach a motor and boost it into a graveyard , or museum orbit .
NASA hopes Hubble will last well beyond 2014 , but the STS - 125 mission should extend its mission at least that much .
Will the Atlantis crew return any keepsakes of Hubble for the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum ?
On this mission , the astronauts are actually going to bring back the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 and NASA scientists are hoping it'll be up in the National Air & Space Museum before too long .
Among the other items returning to Earth aboard Atlantis is the COSTAR , the corrective optics that served as Hubble 's first contact lens to correct its blurry vision after its initial launch .
All of Hubble 's new instruments automatically compensate for the mirror defect that caused the blurry vision .
In terms of the decommissioning , is n't it true that the robotic vehicle that would use the soft - docking mechanism for Hubble is not even built yet ?
Yes .
Right now , NASA 's plan is to use a generic soft - docking mechanism , one it has developed for spacecraft like Orion and others at the International Space Station .
The robotic craft envisioned to steer Hubble down to its death or a graveyard orbit is not yet built .
How much will the mission to Hubble cost ?
According to Ed Weiler , NASA 's science mission directorate chief , this last Hubble servicing mission is expected to cost about $ 1.1 billion .
That is an increase from the estimated $ 900 million price tag NASA initially announced in 2006 when the agency committed to the STS - 125 mission .
The cost has swelled due to the last few years of delays .
Can NASA save money and risk by building a new space telescope to replace Hubble instead of flying the servicing mission ?
Weiler has said that while the cost of the mission is one that can be criticized , even attempting to build a new space telescope would face the same scrutiny later on because cost overages would most assuredly follow then too .
Hubble was initially slated to cost about $ 400 million , but by the time of its 1990 launch it had increased to several times that .
To date , NASA has spent about $ 10 billion to build Hubble and keep it operating in space for the last 19 years .
However , a future space telescope — like a daughter of Hubble — would cost much more , be larger and require a new launch vehicle ( like NASA 's heavy - lift Ares V ) that does not yet exist .
TASMANIAN students who skip school could soon face more than lunchtime detention under a Liberals plan .
Liberal leader Will Hodgman wants to stop students with bad school records getting their driver 's licence for up to two years .
Those with high absenteeism rates , suspensions or expulsions could have to wait until after they turn 18 to apply for a learner 's permit .
Driving was a privilege , not a right , Mr Hodgman told The Mercury .
" If we can't trust students behind the desk , how can we trust them behind the wheel ? " he said .
Teenagers currently can sit the written learner driver 's test at 16 .
If the Liberals win government on March 20 next year , they would make a school driving course a prerequisite to get a licence .
" If students want to play up and play truant , then why should we trust them with a driver 's licence before they are legally an adult ? "
Mr Hodgman said .
Road Safety Taskforce chairman Paul Hogan said strategies needed to be evidence - based .
" I know everyone is grasping for ideas of what to do given the state 's road toll is now 50 but I would be cautious of suggestions that are not evidence - based , " Mr Hogan said .
Mr Hodgman said his proposal was modelled on US laws , which had successfully linked school behaviour to licences .
Alabama schools have a points system where for every point accrued for disciplinary actions , the student has a week added to the age at which they are eligible to apply for a licence .

“ Three Rules of Work : Out of clutter find simplicity ; From discord find harmony ;
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity . ” – Albert Einstein
By Leo Babauta
Recently I published the Four Laws of Simplicity , which talked in part about decluttering your home and office … and it seemed to strike a chord with many of you .
Clutter , apparently , has invaded all of our lives .
And the inevitable fact is that , no matter how much we simplify our lives , even after a huge decluttering session and after a vow not to buy anything ever ever ever again … entropy always always sets in .
It starts out as one item on the floor .
Just a simple box , or a toy , or a piece of clothing .
Such a little thing , nothing to worry about .
But that one little thing will attract a second , and then a third , and soon clutter will grow insidiously in our homes until it overwhelms us .
And then we ’re back to square one .
Do n’t let it happen .
Be vigilant .
Here are my favorite tips for beating clutter entropy , for the minimalists among you .
1 . One in , two out .
Make it a rule : for every new item that comes into your life , you need to remove two .
That means gifts , clothes , shoes , books , magazines , anything .
It ’s great to have a place where you put things you ’re going to get rid of … whether to give to other people or to donate to charity or to take to a used book store .
Then you can just grab the stuff on your way out to do errands .
2. Limited storage .
I like this rule because it fits in with my philosophy of self - set limitations : do n’t allow yourself to have tons of storage space .
The more storage you have , the more stuff you ’ll keep .
Instead , have limited storage and if stuff does n’t fit in there , get rid of it .
That forces you to make choices .
They key is making those choices … if you do n’t , you ’ll end up with clutter .
3. Clear floors and flat surfaces .
Keep them clear .
A room looks so much cleaner if all flat surfaces , from the floor to tabletops to countertops , are clear of clutter .
Remove everything from these surfaces except perhaps one or two decorative items ( do n’t clutter with knick knacks ) .
If you find stuff making its way here , clear it out .
Clearing surfaces once a day or every couple days is a good routine .
4. Designate a home for everything , and be fanatic .
When you find stuff on flat surfaces , or draping over a chair , it might be because you do n’t have a designated spot for that kind of thing .
If you do n’t , designate a spot for it immediately .
If stuff does n’t have a home in your home , you need to get rid of it , or it will forever wander around the house .
The other problem might be that you have already designated a spot for it , but you ’re just not good at putting it away .
In that case , take a month to build up the habit of putting things where they belong immediately .
It ’ll make a huge difference .
5. Regular decluttering sessions .
Put in your calendar .
Even the best of us need to declutter regularly .
If you ’ve decluttered your home , things might be great now , but you ’ll need to do clutter maintenance .
Put it in your calendar : perhaps once a month , once a week , or once every few months .
Experiment to see what interval works for your life .
Be content with what you have , rejoice in the way things are .
When you realize there is nothing lacking , the whole world belongs to you .
– Lao Tzu
6. Reduce your desires for more .
If clutter is coming into your life at a rate that ’s too great for you to handle , you might need to look at your buying habits .
Do you go shopping for clothes or gadgets or shoes or books every week ( or more ) ?
Are you always buying stuff online ?
If so , is it out of real necessity , or do you just like to buy stuff ?
It ’s important that you take a look at these desires , and see if you can address them .
Reducing your desires will go a long way to reducing your need to fight clutter .
7. 30 - day list .
This is really a way to control the desires I mentioned in No. 6 above .
Make a list : anytime you want to buy something ( other than absolute necessities ) , put it on the list with the date you added it .
Then , do n’t allow yourself to buy something until it ’s been on the list for 30 days .
By then , your desire for that item might have passed .
It ’s a great way to control that impulse to buy .
( A cool alternative : the Want book . )
“ We ca n’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them . ” – Albert Einstein
8. Change your habits .
Clutter did n’t create itself .
It ’s there because you put it there .
What habits do you have that created the clutter ?
There may be many of them , some of them already mentioned above : you buy a lot , you do n’t designate a home for things , you do n’t put things away , you buy but do n’t remove things … you may have other habits that create clutter .
Change those habits , one at a time .
Take 30 days and focus on a clutter habit , and see if you can create a new habit that will reduce your clutter .
On May 22nd I posted a piece here on Spacing about the fairy tale war on the car .
It was at the height of the rhetorical volleys surrounding the decision to remove the middle lane on Jarvis to make way for pedestrian and cyclist improvements .
In it I suggested that car culture has always been at war with itself : city driving has never been pleasant , not in the good - old - days in the 1960s with fat arterial roads , expanding suburbs and less cars on the road , and certainly is n’t pleasant today .
Bike lanes have become a convenient scapegoat for drivers .
Enter Toronto Star columnist Bob Hepburn and a piece he wrote two weeks ago called “ Time to stop nutty war on cars . ”
Here ’s how he opened :
As I inched my car along Wellesley St. East in morning traffic earlier this week , I watched a lone bicyclist merrily speed by me in his designated bike lane .
For cyclists like him , the recently installed bike lane on Wellesley is a welcome development .
But for fuming motorists like me , the bike lane is an unmitigated disaster because it has narrowed the street , slowing traffic and significantly increasing commuting time .
And then there ’s all the extra pollution caused by having our cars and trucks stuck longer in traffic .
The Wellesley bike lane — used only by that one cyclist as I sat idling in traffic — is just another scrimmage in the rapidly escalating “ war on cars ” raging these days across Toronto .
Currently , the anti-car crowd is winning the war .
It ’s as if Hepburn was trying to prove my thesis .
He calls the Wellesley lane “ an unmitigated disaster ” .
As anybody who has driven or biked on Wellesley before and after the bike lanes were installed last year ( I have and continue to use both methods of transportation along Wellesley often enough ) , they know this is absolutely not true .
Wellesley , during anything close to busy times , was always a disaster .
A small , urban street that could not handle very much traffic .
It was backed up and slow and many times I ’ve inched along from Queens Park to Jarvis or even as far as Sherbourne in single file gridlock then and now .
Most of Wellesley was one ( extra wide ) lane to begin with — the bike lane simple turned them into normal sized lanes and as Now Magazine pointed out , they are n’t particularly good bike lanes since they end before each intersection .
Wellesley still has left turn lanes for cars and yet is as crappy a street to drive on as it ever was .
Now there is somebody to blame — the merry bicyclist — rather than the cars themselves .
Though Hepburn makes some good points in his piece about the need for more transit , his repeated use of the word war , and his claims that war has been declared against cars , reminds me of another situation where the media declared war when there was no war .
I emailed Hepburn for explanation of his claim that the Wellesley bike lane is a “ disaster ” when there is no change ( in fact , there might be more order on Wellesley now that car lanes are clearly marked ) but I received a form letter that said , in part : “ I have received an overwhelming number of comments from readers from Toronto , and in many cases across the country , with most of them agreeing with the main points in the column , but with a good number sharply disagreeing .
One thing is clear from all of the comments and that is how passionate readers feel about this issue . ”
As we said in grade school “ no guff ” — there has been passion over this issue for months now , that is n’t news — but when a reporter / columnist uses words like “ disaster ” and “ war ” as loose as Hepburn did , of course readers who trust the writer will be in agreement .
As I said in my initial piece on the 22nd , this is exactly the kind of rhetoric we ca n’t let them get away with because is extinguishes the possibility of a reasonable conversation and debate between cars , transit , bikes and pedestrians that needs to take place in Toronto .
Remove the incendiary rhetoric , and that conversation can easily take place .

In a recent article , we covered reasons why threads should strive to make their data private and communicate using asynchronous messages .
[ 1 ]
Each thread that needs to receive input should have an inbound message queue and organize its work around an event - driven message pump mainline that services the queue requests , idealized as follows :
//
An idealized thread mainline // do { message = queue.pop ( ) // get the message // ( might wait ) message ->run ( ) ; // and execute it } while ( ! done ) ; // check for exit
But what happens when this thread must remain responsive to new incoming messages that have to be handled quickly , even when we 're in the middle of servicing an earlier lower - priority message that may take a long time to process ?
If all the messages must be handled on this same thread , then we have a problem .
Fortunately , we also have two good solutions , both of which follow the same basic strategy : somehow break apart the large piece of work to allow the thread to perform other work in between , interleaved between the chunks of the large item .
Let 's consider the two major ways to implement that interleaving , and their respective tradeoffs in the areas of fairness and performance .
Example : Breaking Up a Potentially Long- Running Operation
Consider this potentially expensive message we might be asked to execute :
// A simplified message type to accomplish some // long operation // class LongOperation : public Message { public : void run ( ) { LongHelper helper = GetHelper ( ) ; // issue : what if this loop could take a long time ?
for ( int i = 0 ; i < items.size ( ) ; ++i ) { helper -> render ( items [ i ] ) ; } helper -> print ( ) ; } }
This thread may be a background worker that runs all the work we want to get off the GUI thread ( see [ 1 ] ) .
Alternatively , in cases where it is impossible to obey the good hygiene of getting all significant work off the GUI thread ( for example , because for some reason the work may need to happen on the GUI thread itself for legacy or OS - specific reasons ) , this thread may be the GUI itself .
Whatever the case , what matters is that to remain responsive to other messages we need to break up LongOperation .run into smaller pieces and interleave them with the processing of other messages .
Botnets are n't just dangerous because they can steal massive amounts of personal data and launch denial - of - service attacks — they can also self - destruct , leaving the owners of affected machines in the dust .
The controllers of one such botnet recently hit the kill switch for one reason or another , taking down some 100,000 infected computers with it .
The Washington Post recently profiled the case of Zeus / Zbot — a software kit that sprung up in March that harvests financial and personal data from PCs through the use of a Trojan .
Zeus , unlike many other malware programs , managed to make each installation appear different to virus trackers so that it would be more difficult to remove .
But Zeus had another interesting feature — one that is n't terribly uncommon among botnet software , it turns out .
A command was built into the software to kos — or " kill operating system " — and it was apparently executed some time last month .
The reason for BSODing 100,000 machines is n't quite clear , but several security experts have offered up their opinions .
S21sec wrote on its blog that those behind Zeus might have wanted more time to exploit the financial data they had harvested by removing the user 's ability to get online and see that money was being transferred .
On the other hand , 21 - year - old Roman H�ssy had just begun running Zeustracker , a website ( that is apparently down right now thanks to a DDoS attack ) meant to track the servers being used by the Zeus botnet , when he saw the kos command get issued .
" Maybe the botnet was hijacked by another crime group , " H�ssy told the Post .
Or , he postulated , perhaps those behind Zeus were just dumb .
" Many cyber criminals ... using the Zeus crimeware kit are n't very skilled . "
S21sec notes , however , that invoking the kos command only results in a bluescreen and subsequent difficulty booting the OS .
There appears to be no significant data loss and neither the Trojan binaries nor the startup registries are removed , indicating that Zeus is n't trying to keep itself from being dissected by researchers .
It could also mean that , once those hundred thousand or so users manage to get back online , Zeus will get back to work stealing passwords and credit card info .
I remember once buying the stock of a small company and I could n't believe my luck .
Every time my fund bought more shares the stock would go up .
So we bought even more and the stock kept climbing .
When we finally built our full position and stopped buying the stock started dropping , ending up at a price below where we started buying it .
We were the market .
Just about every policy move to right the U.S. economy after the subprime sinking of the banking system has been a bust .
We saved Bear Stearns .
We let Lehman Brothers go ....
Prohibition and over regulation only creates a black market for the goods and services they are trying to prohibit .
Please let people make up their own mind .

Pascal ’s Wager about God
Blaise Pascal ( 1623 -1662 ) offers a pragmatic reason for believing in God : even under the assumption that God ’s existence is unlikely , the potential benefits of believing are so vast as to make betting on theism rational .
The super - dominance form of the argument conveys the basic Pascalian idea , the expectations argument refines it , and the dominating expectations argument gives a more sophisticated version still .
Critics in turn have raised a number of now - classic challenges .
( i ) According to intellectualism , deliberately choosing which beliefs to hold is practically impossible .
Intellectualism , however , appears to be not only questionable but irrelevant .
( ii ) According to the many - gods objection , Pascal ’s wager begs the question and hence is irrational .
It assumes that if God exists then God must take a rather specific form , which few open - minded agnostics would accept .
Pascalians reply by invoking the notion of a genuine option ( which is not defined ) , by devising run -off decision theory ( which is not justified ) , by claiming that Pascal was understandably unaware of other cultures ( which is not true ) , and by appealing to generic theism ( which does not solve the problem ) .
( iii ) According to evidentialism , Pascalian reasoning is epistemically irresponsible and hence immoral .
One development of this argument , suggesting that God is an evidentialist , amounts to a variant of the many - gods objection .
Another development , suggesting that we should be evidentialists , hinges on the outcome of larger moral theory .
( iv ) According to various paradoxes , reference to infinite values is decision - theoretic non-sense .
Table of Contents
1. A Reason for Believing in God
There are two kinds of argument for theism .
Traditional , epistemic arguments hold that God exists ; examples include arguments from cosmology , design , ontology , and experience .
Modern , pragmatic arguments hold that , regardless of whether God exists , believing in God is good for us , or is the right thing to do ; examples include William James ’s will to believe and Blaise Pascal ’s wager .
Pascal — French philosopher , scientist , mathematician and probability theorist ( 1623 - 1662 ) — argues that if we do not know whether God exists then we should play it safe rather than risk being sorry .
The argument comes in three versions ( Hacking 1972 ) , all of them employing decision theory .
For those who are unfamiliar with decision theory , the idea can be illustrated by considering a lottery .
Suppose there are 100 tickets at $ 1 each and a jackpot of $ 1000 .
Is it rational to play ?
If you total the earnings and the expenses for all the tickets ( $ 1000 – $ 100 ) , then divide by the number of tickets , you find that on average each ticket nets $ 9 .
In comparison , not playing involves zero expense and zero payoff .
Since $ 9 is preferable to $ 0 , it is rational to play .
Alternately , suppose there are 1000 tickets costing $ 2 each , a grand prize of $ 1000 , and a consolation prize of $ 500 .
Then the total earnings and expenses ( $ 1500 – $ 2000 ) , divided by the number of tickets , yields a net loss of fifty cents for the average ticket .
In this case , unless you have some reason to believe that a given ticket is not average , playing the game is irrational .
To put the matter more generally : a given action ( say , buying a ticket ) is associated with a set of possible outcomes ( say , winning the grand prize , winning the consolation prize , or losing ) ; each outcome has a certain value or “ utility ” ( the utility of winning might be the value of the prize minus the cost of the ticket ) ; the “ expectation ” for each outcome is equal to its utility multiplied by the probability of its happening ; the expectation for a given action is the sum of the expectations for each possible associated outcome .
The course of action having the maximum expectation is the rational one to follow .
a. The Super - Dominance Argument
Pascal begins with a two - by - two matrix : either God exists or does not , and either you believe or do not .
– Table I– God exists
God does not exist
You believe in God ( a ) infinite reward ( c ) 250 utiles
You do not believe in God ( b ) infinite punishment ( d ) 200 utiles
If God exists then theists will enjoy eternal bliss ( cell a ) , while atheists will suffer eternal damnation ( cell b ) .
If God does not exist then theists will enjoy finite happiness before they die ( say 250 units worth ) , and atheists will enjoy finite happiness too , though not so much because they will experience angst rather than the comforts of religion .
Regardless of whether God exists , then , theists have it better than atheists ; hence belief in God is the most rational belief to have .
b. The Expectations Argument
What if the atheist is a happy hedonist , or if the theist is a miserable puritan ?
In that case the value of cell ( d ) is greater than that of ( c ) , and the dominance argument no longer works .
However , if there is a 50 - 50 chance that God exists then we can calculate the expectations as follows :
– Table II– God exists
God does not exist
You believe in God +infinity something finite
You do not believe in God - infinity something finite
Using the table , the expectation for believing in God = ( positive infinity x ½ ) + ( a finite value x ½ ) = positive infinity ; and the expectation for not believing = ( negative infinity x ½ ) + ( a finite value x ½ ) = negative infinity .
Hence it is rational to believe in God .
c. The Dominating Expectations Argument
It ’s unlikely that the probability of God ’s existing is exactly one - half , but this does not matter .
Due to the infinite value in cell ( a ) , if God ’s existence has any finite probability then the expectation for believing in God will be infinite .
Furthermore , this infinity will swamp the values in cells ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , so long as ( c ) is not infinitely negative and neither ( b ) nor ( d ) is infinitely positive .
2. The Intellectualist Objection : Is Belief a Matter of Choice ?
According to doxastic voluntarism , believing and disbelieving are choices that are up to us to make .
Intellectualists deny this ; they say it is impossible to adopt a belief simply because we decide to .
If I offered to pay you $ 1000 for believing the sky is green , for instance , could you sincerely adopt this belief simply by wishing to ?
Evidently not .
Therefore , some say , Pascal ’s wager does not give legitimate grounds for believing in God .
But although we cannot adopt a belief simply by deciding to , the same is true for other actions .
For instance , we cannot go to school simply by deciding to ; rather , we have to wake up by a certain time ( which may mean first developing a certain kind of habit ) , we must get dressed , we must put one foot in front of another , and so forth .
Then if we are lucky we will end up at our destination , though this is far from guaranteed .
So it goes for any other endeavor in life : one chooses to become a doctor , or to marry by age 30 , or to live in the tropics — the attainment of such goals can be facilitated , though not purely willed , by appropriate micro-steps that are more nearly under voluntary control .
Indeed , even twitching your little finger is not entirely a matter of volition , as its success depends on a functioning neural system running from your brain , through your spine , and down your arm .
Your minutest action is a joint product of internal volition and external contingencies .
The same applies to theistic belief : although you cannot simply decide to be a theist , you can choose to read one - sided literature , you can choose to join a highly religious community , you can try to induce mystical experiences by ingesting psychedelic drugs like LSD , and you can choose to chant and pray .
No mere exercise of will can guarantee that you will end up believing in God , but neither can any exercise of will guarantee that you succeed in doing anything else you decide to do .
If there is a difference between our ability to voluntarily believe something and our ability to voluntarily wiggle our toe , it is a difference in degree of likely success , and not a difference in logical kind .
Yet a difference in degree may be significant , and it is worth noting that theists and atheists may disagree on the power of prayer to change one ’s beliefs .
Theists generally think that prayer tends to bring one into contact with God , in which case one is likely to notice , recognize , and believe in God ’s existence .
Atheists , on the other hand , have no particular reason to think that mere praying should notably effect conversion .
An agnostic would do well then to try ; for it would be precisely in the case where success matters that trying is likely to be most efficacious .
Indeed , it might not matter whether we can choose to have the beliefs we have .
If Tables I or II be right then the fact would remain that it is pragmatically better to believe in God than not , insofar as theists , taken across all possible worlds , are on average better off than atheists .
It does not matter whether theism results from personal will - power , God ’s grace , or cosmic luck — regardless , being better off is being better off .
Thus , Pascal ’s wager need not succeed as a tool of persuasion for it to serve as a tool of assessment ( Mougin & Sober 1994 ) .
3. The Many - Gods Objection : Do Rival Religious Options Undermine Each Other ?
Pascal ’s compatriot Denis Diderot replied to the wager that an ayatollah or “ imam could just as well reason the same way . ”
His point is that decision theory cannot decide among the various religions practiced in the world ; it gives no warrant for believing in Pascal ’s Catholicism , or even in a generic Judeo - Christianity .
The reason is that Tables I and II beg the question in favor of a certain kind of theism ; a more complete matrix must consider at least the following possibilities .
– Table III– Yahweh exists Allah exists
You worship Yahweh infinite reward infinite punishment
You worship Allah infinite punishment infinite reward
In reply , Pascalians offer a number of defenses .
a. Genuine Options
Some Pascalians insist that only certain theological possibilities count as “ genuine options ” ( James 1897 , Jordan 1994b ) , although this notion is never clearly defined .
Perhaps a proposition P is a genuine option for some subject S only if S is likely to succeed in believing P , should S choose to .
However , the relevance of volition is questionable , as discussed in the previous section .
Alternatively , perhaps P is a genuine option for S unless P strikes S as “ bizarre ” or untraditional ( Jordan 1994 b ) .
The difficulty here lies in distinguishing this position from emotional prejudice ( Saka 2001 ) .
Finally , it may be that a genuine option is one that possesses sufficient evidential support , in which case it can then participate in a run-off decision procedure .
b. Run-off Decision Theory
Some Pascalians propose combining pragmatic and epistemic factors in a two - stage process .
First , one uses epistemic considerations in selecting a limited set of belief options , then one uses prudential considerations in choosing among them ( Jordan 1994 b ) .
Alternatively , one first uses prudential considerations to choose religion over non-religion , and then uses epistemic considerations to choose a particular religion ( Schlesinger 1994 , Jordan 1993 ) .
In order to be at all plausible , this approach must answer two questions .
First , what is the justification for deliberately excluding some possibilities , no matter how improbable , from prudential reasoning ?
It seems irrational to dismiss some options that are acknowledged to be possible , even be they unlikely , so long as the stakes are sufficiently high ( Sorensen 1994 ) .
Second , can epistemic considerations work without begging the question ?
Schlesinger argues that the Principle of Sufficient Reason gives some support for believing in God , but in a Pascalian context this is questionable .
If you subscribe to a suitable form of the Principle of Sufficient Reason ( one that leads to a given kind of theism ) , you are likely to be a theist already and hence Pascal ’s wager does not apply to you ; on the other hand , if you do not believe in the right kind of Principle of Sufficient Reason , then you will not think that it makes theism more probable than atheistic Buddhism , or anthropomorphic theism more probable than deism .
Other epistemic considerations , such as Schlesinger ’s appeal to testimony , simplicity , and sublimity , meet with analogous challenges ( Amico 1994 , Saka 2001 ) .
c. Relativism
Some Pascalians , while acknowledging that the Wager might be unsound for today ’s multi-culturally sophisticated audience , maintain that the Wager is sound relative to Pascal and his peers in the 1600s , when Catholicism and agnosticism were the only possibilities ( Rescher 1985 , Franklin 1998 ) .
But the Crusades in the 1100s taught the French of Islam , the Renaissance in the 1400s taught the French of Greco - Roman paganism , the discoveries of the 1500s taught the French of new - world paganism , and several wars of religion taught the French of Protestantism .
To claim that the educated French of the 1600s rightfully rejected alien beliefs without consideration appears to endorse rank prejudice .
d. Generic Theism
Some acknowledge that Pascal ’s wager cannot decide among religions , yet maintain that “ it at least gets us to theism ” ( Jordan 1994 b , Armour - Garb 1999 ) .
The idea is that Catholics , Protestants , Jews , Moslems , and devil - worshippers can all legitimately use decision theory to conclude that it is best to believe in some supreme being .
Against this there are two objections .
First , it disregards theological possibilities such as the Professor ’s God .
The Professor ’s God rewards those who humbly remain skeptical in the absence of evidence , and punishes those who adopt theism on the basis of self - interest ( Martin 1975 , 1990 ; Mackie 1982 ) .
Second , the claim that Pascal ’s wager yields generic theism assumes that all religions are theistic .
But consider the following sort of atheistic Buddhism : if you clear your mind then you will attain nirvana and otherwise you will not — that is , if you fill your mind with thoughts and desires , such as believing that God exists or living God , then you will not attain salvation ( Saka 2001 ) .
4. The Evidentialist Objection : Is Prudential Reasoning Ethical
There are two versions of this objection that need to be kept distinct .
The first one suggests that Pascalian reasoners are manipulative egoists whom God might take exception to , and they wo n’t be rewarded after all ( Nicholl 1978 ) .
Schlesinger 1994 responds by saying that any reasoning that gets us to believe in God , if God exists , can not be bad .
But this argument seems to depend on the nature of God .
If God holds that results are all that matter , that the ends justify the means , then Schlesinger is right .
But maybe
God holds that true beliefs count as meritorious only if they are based on good evidence ; maybe God rewards only evidentialists .
In short , this form of the objection is just another version of the many - gods objection .
Another form of evidentialism refers not to God ’s character but to our own .
Regardless of how God might or might not reward our decisions , it may be categorically , epistemically or otherwise wrong — “ absolutely wicked ” , in the words of G.E. Moore — for us to base any belief on decision - theoretic self - interest ( Clifford 1879 , Nicholls 1978 ) .
Since utilitarians would tend to favor Pascalian reasoning while Kantians and virtue ethicists would not , the issue at stake belongs to a much larger debate in moral philosophy .
5 . The Paradox Objection : Is Decision Theory Coherent ?
a. The Equi-utility Paradox
If you regularly brush your teeth , there is some chance you will go to heaven and enjoy infinite bliss .
On the other hand , there is some chance you will enjoy infinite heavenly bliss even if you do not brush your teeth .
Therefore the expectation of brushing your teeth ( infinity plus a little extra due to oral health = infinity ) is the same as that of not brushing your teeth ( infinity minus a bit due to cavities and gingivitis = infinity ) , from which it follows that dental hygiene is not a particularly prudent course of action .
In fact , as soon as we allow infinite utilities , decision theory tells us that any course of action is as good as any other ( Duff 1986 ) .
Hence we have a reductio ad absurdum against decision theory , at least when it ’s extended to infinite cases .
In reply to such difficulties , Jordan 1993 proposes a run-off decision theory as described above .
b. The St. Petersburg Paradox
Imagine tossing a coin until it lands heads - up , and suppose that the payoff grows exponentially according to the number of tosses you make .
If the coin lands heads - up on the first toss then the payoff is $ 2 ; if it takes two tosses then the payoff is $ 4 ; if it takes three tosses then the payoff is $ 8 ; and so forth , ad infinitum .
Now the odds of the game ending on the first toss is 1 / 2 ; of ending on the second toss , 1/4 ; on the third , 1/8 ; and so forth .
Since there is a one - half chance of winning $ 2 , plus a quarter chance of winning $ 4 , plus a one - eighth chance of winning $ 8 , and so forth , your expectation for playing the game is ( 1/2 x $ 2 ) + ( 1/4 x $ 4 ) + ( 1/8 x $ 8 ) +… , that is , $ 1 + $ 1 + $ 1 … = infinity !
It follows you should be willing to pay any finite amount for the privilege of playing this game .
Yet it clearly seems irrational to pay very much at all .
The conclusion is that decision theory is a bad guide when infinite values are involved ( for discussion of this very old paradox , see Sorensen 1994 ) .
Byl ( 1994 ) points out that instead of referring to infinite payoffs we can speak of arbitrarily high ones .
No matter how improbable be the existence of God , it is still decision - theoretically rational to believe in God if the reward for doing so is sufficiently , yet only finitely , high .
However , this does not address the heart of the problem , for the St. Petersburg paradox too may be cast in terms of an arbitrarily high limit .
Intuitively , one would not be willing to pay a million dollars , say , for the privilege of playing a game capped at one - million - and - one coin tosses , and it is not just because of the diminishing value of money .
There is something unsettling about decision theory , at least as applied to extreme cases , and so we might be skeptical about using it as a basis for religious commitment .

If poverty comes to be defined relatively for all purposes of public policy — households with less than 60 per cent of the median income , says the government — then poverty and inequality become the same thing .
This is a common claim .
But it is plain wrong , not as a matter of opinion , but as a matter of fact .
My table should explain .
It shows incomes for nine people in three societies , with the same aggregate income .
Take society A. Median income here is 50 .
If we define poverty as the number of people with incomes below 60 % of the median ( 30 ) , then four people live in poverty .
Inequality , as measured by the Gini coefficient , is 30.7 % ; there are , of course , other measures of inequality , but let ’s keep things simple .
Now , imagine this changes to society B .
Here , the rich are richer and the poor are poorer .
Inequality is greater - a Gini coefficient of 41.8 % .
But no - one lives in poverty .
This is because median incomes have fallen , so the poverty line has dropped to 18 ( 60 % of 30 ) , and everyone is above this .
You can think of this society as being more of a “ winner take all ” economy ; the rich do really well , at the expense of those on lower incomes .
Or imagine society C . This is the same as A , except that the very poorest are poorer , whilst the less poor are better off .
Inequality is greater , but fewer live below the poverty line - though those that do are poorer .
You can get to this society from society A if ( say ) the government provides in - work support , paid for by a lump - sum tax on everyone , but two people lose their jobs .
These examples suffice to show that poverty and inequality are not the same things .
Society B has less poverty than A , but more inequality .
So does society C . And C has more poverty and less inequality than B.
Of course , in practice , poverty and inequality often rise and fall together .
But it ai n’t necessarily so .
This much should be obvious to anyone who sits down and thinks .
Which Charles Moore obviously has n’t .
Now , there ’s nothing wrong with not thinking about issues ; I do n’t think about most things .
What is wrong , however , is drawing a wage for spouting unthinking gibber , and expecting people to take you seriously .
A group of young people who claim an " atmospheric soup of toxic materials " released when an old steelworks was redeveloped caused their birth defects won a landmark ruling today when it was found that the local council had been negligent in its handling of the site .
The high court decision clears the way for 16 successful claimants , who are aged between 11 and 22 and have missing or underdeveloped fingers or deformities to their feet , to set out to prove their individual disabilities were caused by Corby borough council 's failings when reclaiming the former British Steel plant .
Compensation could run into millions of pounds if they succeed .
In an action thought to be the first of its kind since the Thalidomide scandal of the 1960s , they allege their disabilities were caused in the early stages of foetal development , when their mothers either lived or regularly visited Corby during the time the council undertook massive demolition , excavation and redevelopment works on the site .
Mr Justice Akenhead , who described the Northamptonshire council 's approach as one of " dig and dump " , said there was an extended period between 1983 and August 1997 when it was " extensively negligent " in its control and management of the sites .
That negligence , and breach of the council 's statutory duty from 1992 , led to contaminated mud and dust being spread around Corby and in homes in the town , the judge ruled , and those contaminants could realistically have caused the types of birth defects suffered by the claimants – of which there was a " statistically significant " cluster between 1989 and 1999 .
The council had denied it was negligent or that there was a link between the removal of waste to a quarry north of the site , and deformities .
But the judge accepted the evidence of waste management expert Roger Braithwaite , who said that more than 15 years of poorly regulated " muck shifting " polluted the environment of the town .
Braithwaite was rightly appalled at the way the council had conducted itself , Akenhead said .
" [ The council ] bit off more than it could chew and did not really appreciate the enormity , ramifications and difficulty of what it was setting out to achieve in terms of removing and depositing very substantial quantities of contaminated material , " he ruled in his 919 - paragraph judgment .
The 680 - acre Corby site had four blast furnaces and two coke oven complexes , and closed in 1980 with the loss of 10,000 jobs .
The council said it was surprised and disappointed by the ruling and was considering whether to appeal .
If it does not , the cases to decide whether each child 's deformity was caused by the council 's negligence will go ahead individually , a process which could take another two or three years .
Lawyers said it was unlikely that the compensation claim of even the least disabled child would be less than £ 100,000 , with others being considerably more .
The sums to be evaluated are not only for the physical and emotional effects of the disabilities , but also future losses , including the effect on their employment .
The judge 's finding that there were no breaches of duty after August 1997 means that two other children , aged nine and 10 , on whose behalf cases were brought cannot proceed .
The firm representing the claimants , Collins Solicitors , says it knows of dozens more young people in the area who have birth defects , although they would not necessarily all wish to take legal action .
It called on Corby council to settle its 16 clients ' claims out of court .
Lawyer Des Collins said : " Prior to the trial , the council maintained that a thorough investigation had led it to the conclusion that there was no link between the reclamation work and the children 's birth defects .
" It also maintained that had any convincing evidence been shown that the children had good claims , then the council would have wanted to compensate them appropriately without going to trial .
Today that link has been established and the evidence provided .
The children now call upon the council to fulfil their pretrial promises without delay .
" The council got it wrong , " he added .
" They should simply put their hands up now and admit it .
We will have to fight on , but we are quite determined to do that . "
The council said it was not prepared to apologise unless a causal link was proved between the reclamation works and the defects suffered by the claimants .
" We are not yet at the point of saying sorry because nobody yet is responsible , " chief executive Chris Mallender said .
" Our position has always been that there was no link between the reclamation work that was carried out in Corby in past decades and these children 's birth defects .
That is still our position . "
He said the council , which had already run up legal costs of £ 1.9 m and now faces a claim from the families ' solicitors for an additional £ 4.7 m , offered the opportunity of independent arbitration but it was declined by the parents .
" We continue to sympathise with their circumstances .
We regret that they have had to pursue this case over so many years and we , like they , would hope we can now draw this to a conclusion and everybody can move on . "

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Facebook will likely be posting billions of dollars in revenue in five years , up from about $ 500 million ( 300 million pounds ) this year , according to Silicon Valley entrepreneur Mark Andreessen who sits on Facebook ’s board .
Mark Zuckerberg , founder and CEO of Facebook , delivers a keynote address at the company 's annual conference in San Francisco , July 23 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kimberly
White
Andreessen told Reuters that the world ’s most popular online social network could pile up $ 1 billion in revenue this year if it pushed harder on selling advertising .
But he added that it was more important at this stage for social sites like Facebook and Twitter to retain and grow their user base and capture market share , rather than worry too much about making lots of money right away .
“ This calendar year they ’ll do over $ 500 million , ” Andreessen said in an interview , noting that Facebook has more than 225 million users , so revenue per user is still small .
“ If they pushed the throttle forward on monetization they would be doing more than a billion this year , ” said Andreessen , who made the cover of Time Magazine as founder of the world ’s first Web browser company , Netscape .
Privately held Facebook -- which counts venture capitalist Peter Thiel , Accel Partners , Microsoft Corp and Russian Internet investment firm Digital Sky Technologies among its investors -- has never disclosed its revenue except to say it expects 70 percent growth this year .
“ There ’s every reason to expect in my view that the thing can be doing billions in revenue five years from now , ” Andreessen said .
Andreessen , who is starting his own venture capital fund with Netscape executive Ben Horowitz , regrets not investing in Facebook .
“ I probably could have if I had tried hard but I did n’t , ” he said , recalling that he has known the founders of Facebook from the beginning .
Andreessen has invested in Twitter , the fast - growing micro-blogging site that lets users share 140 - character messages known as tweets .
Twitter famously makes no money , and Horowitz and Andreessen think that that is okay for now because the site needs to focus on increasing its number of users and improve the features it offers so that no rival can swoop in .
“ They have to take the market , ” said Horowitz .
“ There is no investor in Twitter who will tell you : ‘ Boy , those guys are screwing up , there ’s no revenue yet . ’ ”
Horowitz and Andreessen point to the once - leading social network MySpace , which has fallen behind since it was acquired by Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp .
MySpace focussed too much on selling advertisements -- to contribute to News Corp ’s bottom line -- and not enough on developing the platform , leaving room for Facebook to come in and take market share , they said .
“ If the revenue degraded the user experience then that was a very dangerous thing to do , ” Horowitz said .
Andreessen said it will be difficult , but not impossible , for MySpace to rebound now that Facebook has such a big following .
Both he and Horowitz say they do not expect Twitter to make the same kinds of mistakes that MySpace did .
Twitter was a high profile
Web start - up even before it shot into the headlines during the Iran election crisis , when the U.S. State Department called on it to reschedule planned maintenance because it considered Twitter a vital communications channel for protesters .
As for Facebook , Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told Reuters in May that an initial public offering was not in the cards for at least a few years .
Instead , the company is allowing some shareholders to sell their shares to Digital Sky .
“ Generally speaking , people who are selling their stock in Facebook now are making a mistake , ” Andreessen said .
A Denver police officer faces felony menacing and weapons charges based on an allegation he pointed a pistol to speed up his order at an Aurora McDonald ’s in May .
An employee at the McDonald ’s at 18181 E. Hampden Ave. told investigators two Denver police officers were waiting for their order at the drive - through window in the early - morning hours when Derrick Curtis Saunders , 29 , grew impatient and pulled a weapon .
In addition to the menacing and weapons charges , Saunders is also charged with prohibited use of a weapon , reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct , the Aurora Police Department said Monday .
Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson said Saunders has been suspended with pay during the investigation , but would be put on unpaid leave once the department is formally notified of the charges .
Jackson said neither he nor Police Chief Gerald Whitman would comment on the case .
“ It would be inappropriate for us to make any comment about another department ’s case , especially an ongoing , active investigation , ” Jackson said .
Saunders was most recently assigned to Denver International Airport .
His booking photograph was not available from Aurora police Monday .
Oakland marijuana activists are moving forward on a possible 2010 marijuana legalization initiative .
Led by Oaksterdam University 's Richard Lee and former Oakland Cannabis Buyers ' Co-op head Jeff Jones , proponents today filed a proposed ballot measure with the California attorney general 's office that would allow people aged 21 and over to legally possess up to an ounce of pot and grow their own on garden plots no larger than 25 square feet .
marijuana " California 's laws criminalizing cannabis have failed and need to be reformed , " said Lee .
" Cannabis is safer than alcohol , " says Lee .
" Cannabis does n't cause overdose deaths or make people violent like alcohol .
It makes sense to regulate cannabis like alcohol , instead of prohibiting it completely . "
The initiative would also let cities and counties decide whether or not to tax and regulate cannabis sales and commercial cultivation .
If a city or county decides not to , sales and cultivation within area limits would remain illegal , but possession and consumption of small amounts would be allowed .
To make the November 2010 ballot , organizers must gather 434,000 valid voter signatures by December .
That will be the first major test of the initiative 's viability .
Another indicator of the measure 's support will be if major funders step up to back it .
When the Chronicle wrote last month about initial planning for the initiative , drug reform organizations were apprehensive that the proposed initiative was too soon , that the polling numbers were n't high enough , and that a loss could take the steam out of the legalization push for years to come .
This week , the Chronicle will be revisiting those groups to see where they now stand .
The Drug Policy Alliance said Tuesday it would have preferred to wait until 2012 , but hopes it wins .
" The momentum to end decades of failed marijuana prohibition just keeps building , " said Stephen Gutwillig .
" While the Drug Policy Alliance would prefer such an initiative to appear on the ballot in 2012 , when public support will likely be even greater than it is now , we'd of course like to see it win .
There 's simply no denying the intense groundswell for change . "
With anti-piracy outfits warning those who share copyrighted content and ISPs threatening to pull the plug on alleged offenders , many file - sharers have decided to protect themselves by going anonymous .
To accommodate this growing demand , ItsHidden is now offering a free VPN targeted at those who want to protect their privacy online .
With an increasing number of BitTorrent users seeking solutions to hide their identities from the outside world , privacy services have seen a spike in customers recently .
The most common and widely used privacy services are VPNs that allow users to connect to the Internet while hiding their own IP - address .
These services , such as The Pirate Bay ’s Ipredator , usually charge a recurring monthly fee to pay for bandwidth and hardware bills .
However , this week a new player entered the VPN market , offering their services for free – no strings attached .
Named ItsHidden , the free VPN solution has opened up a BETA test to the public , who can now privatize their Internet traffic – including BitTorrent transfers – in next to no time .
ItsHidden was set up with torrent users in mind , allowing them to hide their identities from ‘ third parties ’ who choose to snoop on their activities .
“ It has been created to put some rights back in the favor of the user and that includes us , ” David from ItsHidden explained to TorrentFreak .
“ There are so many bodies , mostly unelected that seem to have full access to the most intimate of online details with little or no justification and more importantly , no evidence . ”
The service encrypts the connection between the user and ItsHidden ’s servers and prevents anyone from reading this data as it is sent or received .
We were further assured that no data logs are kept of the user ’s transfers .
The best news is of course that it ’s totally free , and they hope to keep it like this in the future .
“ It is a free service , we will of course have to limit in some way eventually to stop the whole lot collapsing , but we will always have a free account .
The paid account would be geared at about $ 5 and will add port forwarding and other features , ” David said .
During the BETA phase the service uses shared IP - addresses , but once they have completed more testing ItsHidden will be able to issue static IPs .
The servers are all located in The Netherlands at present , but they will spread to other locations once the service is out of BETA .
We have of course tried ItsHidden ourselves and the service is offering good speeds for a VPN , although this might differ based on the user ’s location and the load on the network .
Right now , we are hoping that it wont collapse once thousands of new users flood the network .
Fingers crossed .
Gabby Ornelas , a former teller at the giant Bank of America Corp. , remembers the training sessions .
And she remembers her marching orders : “ Sell , sell , sell . ”
Ornelas was instructed to use her Spanish - language skills and Latino heritage to sign up customers for as many kinds of banking services as possible , she said -- services that led to lucrative fees for the bank and financial entanglement for many customers .
“ We were coached every day to push multiple checking accounts , credit cards and debit cards even when the customer did n’t understand how to use them , ” said Ornelas , who lives in Landover Hills , Md. , a town with a large immigrant population and a per-capita income of less than $ 19,000 .
In one case , she described a Central American mother of three who came back to see her at the bank , distressed about $ 300 in overdraft fees incurred after Ornelas persuaded the woman to open a second checking account .

Ornelas and eight of her colleagues leveled the accusations in recent interviews .
They are being backed in their whistle - blowing by the Service Employees International Union , which is trying to organize BofA , the nation ’s largest bank .
Bank of America officials flatly rejected the allegations , saying their policies are legal , adhere to industry standards and are helpful to customers , including immigrants seeking a toehold in the United States .
“ Bank of America believes the SEIU ’s claims misrepresent the bank ’s relationship with its customers and its associates , ” said Anne Pace , a bank spokeswoman .
The former workers said they were going public to lay out what they saw as a little - known side of BofA ’s business model : encouraging working - class customers to sign up for high - interest - rate credit and cash advance services and structuring an array of check and debit card services to maximize overdraft fees and other charges .

The campaign will be launched publicly this week , with workers scheduled to tell their stories in news conference calls and meetings with members of Congress .
The union is seeking to pressure the bank and to build support for legislation now stalled in the Senate that would make it easier for union members to organize .
BofA said the former employees were a disgruntled minority and that internal surveys showed that most employees of the company were overwhelmingly satisfied .
Other critics of the SEIU said the union might have a conflict of interest because it has outstanding loans with the bank .
Many of the workers speaking out were fired from the bank , most before they took their complaints public .
One worker has said her firing was related to her interest in the union .
One worker is still employed at BofA .

BofA ’s
Pace said that all of the bank ’s activities were not only legal but also useful to consumers , particularly those who have recently arrived in the U.S .
“ We believe a checking account is the cornerstone to establishing financial security in this country , ” Pace said in an e-mail .
“ We offer innovative financial services to meet the needs of all of our customers , including Hispanic customers . ”
Pace also said the bank had taken steps to help customers facing “ financial challenges . ”
For example , she said , the bank waives certain monthly fees for customers who have lost their jobs and has reduced penalty fees for customers who overdraw their accounts by less than $ 5 .
Although BofA denies wrongdoing , it recently paid $ 35 million to settle a class - action suit in California that alleged it deliberately ranked customer debits by order of size rather than by the time of day they occurred in order to maximize overdraft charges .

Pace said that the settlement does not include any acknowledgment of wrongdoing or even of the practices alleged in the suit , and that the bank paid the $ 35 million to avoid excessive legal bills .
Consumer advocates see it differently .
“ Bank of America has moved to the top of the charts for fees being charged to consumers by big banks , ” said Jean Ann Fox , director of financial services for the Consumer Federation of America .
Ornelas and three other former BofA tellers , all Latinas , said they and co-workers were repeatedly instructed to seek potential new Spanish - speaking customers outside the bank .
Some were instructed to go to embassies where recent emigres often wait in line for visa and passport services .

Other tellers were asked to go to neighborhood stores , clinics and child welfare centers , and several were asked to recruit customers at a religiously oriented Mother ’s Day celebration , they said .
“ We were told to push them to sign up for multiple checking accounts , which they did n’t need , ” said Ambar Sandoval , a former teller at a BofA branch in Central Los Angeles who said she repeatedly resisted pressure to recruit customers at a center for single mothers in Los Angeles .
The ex-employees provided some documentation for their claims , including internal bank memos showing a schedule of opportunities to solicit accounts among the crowds at Central American embassies and Latino community events .
The documents also showed details of the sales goals pressed on branch employees .
Consumer advocate
Fox was particularly critical of banks ’ practice of recording debits by order of magnitude , which half the country ’s leading banks do .
Fox said the practice makes it more likely that even careful consumers will overdraw their account .
Advertisement
BofA defends the practice , saying it assures customers that their largest , most important payments have priority .
Fox said it ’s a tactic banks use to make sure their fee revenues remain high .
She said consumers unwittingly and unfairly incur overdraft fees when using a debit card .
“ People think that if they use their debit card , they will only spend money that they have in their accounts .
But Bank of America and other big banks have found ways to turn your debit card into a credit instrument with which you can rack up extreme debt , ” she said .
For example , BofA permits a customer using a debit card to spend , say , $ 20 at a grocery store even if the bank account is depleted .
Without informing the customer , the bank automatically imposes an overdraft fee of $ 35 .
An additional $ 35 fee is imposed less than a week later if the account is still out of balance .

These rates mean that consumers are in effect paying $ 70 for a $ 20 extension of credit at the grocery store , Fox said .
Pace said BofA offers overdraft protection and other services to “ give our customers more control and flexibility to effectively manage their accounts and prevent fees . ”

As President Obama names more policy czars to his White House team -- high - level staff members who will help oversee the administration ’s top initiatives -- some lawmakers and Washington interest groups are raising concerns that he may be subverting the authority of Congress and concentrating too much power in the presidency .
The idea of these “ super aides , ” who will work across agency lines to push the president ’s agenda , is not a new one .
President Nixon may have named the first “ czar ” with his appointment of William E. Simon to handle the 1970s energy crisis .
Other presidents have followed suit .
But none has embraced the concept , presidential scholars say , to the extent that Obama has .
He has appointed special advisors who will work from inside the White House on healthcare , the economy , energy and urban issues , with more to come .
Advertisement
“ The challenges coming at us are bigger than anything we ’ve seen since the Depression , ” said Jim Messina , deputy White House chief of staff .
“ It ’s crucial to have people in these positions who can help us meet them head - on . ”
But some lawmakers and outside experts fear that Obama is setting up a system that is not subject to congressional oversight and creates the potential for conflict among his many advisors .
Sen. Robert C. Byrd ( D - W.Va . ) became concerned enough to send a cautionary letter to Obama last week .
At times , he said , past White House staffers have assumed duties that should be the responsibility of officials cleared through the Senate confirmation process .
He cited President Bush ’s naming of homeland security czar Tom Ridge as an example .
“ They rarely testify before congressional committees and often shield the information and decision - making process behind the assertion of executive privilege , ” Byrd wrote of past czars and White House staffers in similar positions .
At times , he said , one outcome has been to “ inhibit openness and transparency , and reduce accountability . ”
Advertisement
“ The rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the constitutional system of checks and balances , ” Byrd said .
It ’s far too early to tell whether Obama ’s quest for efficiency will lead to overstepping the bounds of presidential authority , but the latest appointment announcement could offer a few clues .
This week , he named two women to lead his effort to overhaul the nation ’s healthcare system .
One of them , Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas , was tapped to be Health and Human Services secretary .
At her confirmation hearings , senators will be able to probe her views on health policy and demand detailed documentation of her credentials .
But the other , Nancy - Ann DeParle , who was named health czar , can begin work right away , without outside review of her abilities or opinions .
And whereas lawmakers can ask Sebelius for testimony in the future and control her budget , DeParle may remain largely outside the gaze of Congress .
Advertisement
Paul Light of New York University , an expert on the presidency , said Byrd has a valid constitutional concern about Obama ’s use of czars .
Light too is worried about Obama ’s expansion of the czar system , but his apprehension is focused on more - practical concerns .
He points out that previous presidential czars became frustrated because they had no permanent staff , and their power was diffuse and unclear .
Besides , he said , “ there are so many czars in this White House , they ’ll be constantly bumping in to each other . ”
In addition to naming DeParle to coordinate healthcare policy , Obama has tapped Carol Browner to be White House energy czar , a post that could overlap with the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency , the Energy Department and other agencies .
Adolfo Carrion Jr. , a former Bronx borough president , is urban affairs czar , a job that may dovetail with the functions of the Department of Housing and Urban Development .
And Paul A. Volcker , Obama ’s big - picture economic czar , must coordinate with the Treasury Department and other agencies .
The confusion about competing roles played by czars and their Cabinet counterparts was on display Monday as White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs tried to explain how authority would be divided between DeParle and Sebelius as they steer health reform through Congress .
Advertisement
At first , he declared that DeParle “ will be in charge . ”
Then he acknowledged a role for Sebelius and others .
“ I think obviously this is something that spans across many platforms , not unlike , say , something like energy independence , that a lot of people that work in this building and in different agencies will be involved in , ” he said , pledging to get back to reporters with details about how the health policy team will work .
Before Inauguration Day , transition director John Podesta said in an interview that Obama deliberately was building a strong , centralized White House organization , one that grew naturally out of his disciplined presidential campaign .
For example , Podesta said , a coherent White House energy policy “ needs input not just from the Energy Department , ” but also from the EPA and the Interior , Commerce and Agriculture departments .
Thus , an energy czar made sense .
Advertisement
Podesta saw little potential for the czars to undermine the authority of Cabinet agencies .
“ As long as the White House staff is respectful of the power and authority of the people in the Cabinet , as I know they will be , I think it will be a very workable model , ” he said in January .
Now that the White House is launching the system , aides are refining the description a bit .
Messina emphasized that the czar positions rank below Cabinet positions .
He said the confirmation - free appointments do not violate the Constitution because the czars are aides to the president and his team .
“ They ’re super - staffers and report to the president and to Rahm , ” he said , referring to Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel .
“ I meet with them .
I do n’t meet with Cabinet secretaries ; they ’re above me . ”
Czars mainly will do their coordination work behind the scenes , and secretaries will serve more as what Messina calls the “ public faces ” of the administration .
That description does not allay Byrd ’s concerns , said his spokesman , Jesse Jacobs .
Advertisement
“ If the czars are working behind the scenes and the secretaries will be the mouthpieces of the administration , it calls into question who is actually making the policy decision , ” he said .
“ Whoever is making the policy decisions needs to be accountable and available to Congress and the American public . ”
It ’s still very early in the Obama presidency , but others also question the czar setup .
Browner , whose title is special advisor to Obama on climate change and energy , told reporters two weeks ago that the administration soon would propose new rules to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from a variety of industries .
Obama ’s EPA administrator had hinted at such a possibility , but had not made it clear how things would unfold .
Browner ’s statement set off a nervous response among a few Washington interest groups that objected to the executive branch unilaterally taking the lead on regulating a substance as ubiquitous as carbon .
Advertisement
“ The issues are important enough that you have to have the give and the take of the congressional process -- and do this in the open , ” said former Michigan Gov. John Engler , who heads the National Assn. of Manufacturers .
At least one senator wanted to ask Browner about exactly that in a confirmation hearing .
As a czar and not a Cabinet secretary , however , she did not have to answer questions on Capitol Hill .
“ The overall concern is , Carol Browner has been appointed to coordinate all this energy policy , ” said Sen. John Barrasso ( R - Wyo . ) .
“ What ’s her role going to be ?
She ’s not going to be going through a confirmation process .
While [ agency directors ] had to come to Congress and answer questions , she did n’t . ”

Microsoft founder Bill Gates last week injected $ 50 million into a programme to circumcise up to 650,000 men in Swaziland and Zambia .
The goal of the project is to curb the transmission of HIV in two of the AIDS hotspots of the world , as circumcision has been shown to more than halve the risk of men becoming infected .
Funded for five years through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the programme is the first to massively scale up provision of circumcision by fully trained medical practitioners .
Traditional methods of circumcision sometimes harm and even kill boys and young men .
The network of 250 teams of providers will be managed by Population Services International , a global health organisation based in Washington , DC .

“ It ’s great news , and this is exactly what ’s needed , ” says Catherine Hankins , chief scientific adviser at UNAIDS .
“ We ’ve been working on development of guidance and technical support , and these development partners are now being funded to take it forward , ” says Haskins .
Hankins said that Kenya has the most advanced programme , with 20,000 men newly circumcised , and plans are also well - advanced in Botswana and Namibia .
But she stressed that circumcision can’t alone protect men or women against HIV , and that circumcised men should still take additional precautions , such as wearing condoms and not engaging in risky or promiscuous sex .
“ Ensuring they understand how to maintain safe behaviours is key , and the procedure would be 100 - per- cent accompanied by education to that end ” , says a PSI spokesman .

Earlier this month Matthew Goldstein of Reuters broke the story of Sergey Aleynikov , a naturalized Russian immigrant who ’s been charged with stealing trade secrets from Goldman Sachs .
The secret in question was computer code .
In particular , according to the feds , it was 32 megabytes of code that Aleynikov encrypted and uploaded to a UK - owned website in Germany prior to leaving Goldman to go work for a competitor at a much , much higher salary .
And what did this incredibly valuable code do ?
Answer : it ran Goldman ’s high frequency trading operation , and it ’s drawn attention to the shadowy but wildly lucrative HFT trading sector .
Basically , HFT relies on speed .
Traders buy and sell stock thousands of times a second and their profits rely on being able make their trades slightly before ordinary traders make theirs .
Speed is so important that a key component of HFT — aside from fast computers , big pipes , and rocket science code — is colocation of their servers .
That is , they set up their operations physically close to stock exchange data centers so that trading data has less distance to travel before it gets to them .
A few milliseconds in reduced latency time makes all the difference .
And that ’s not all : you ’ll be unsurprised to learn that there ’s a regulatory loophole that provides HFT traders with yet another advantage over ordinary schmoes .
The New York Times provides an example today of how it all works :
It was July 15 , and Intel , the computer chip giant , had reporting robust earnings the night before .
Some investors , smelling opportunity , set out to buy shares in the semiconductor company Broadcom .
( Their activities were described by an investor at a major Wall Street firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his job . )
The slower traders faced a quandary :
If they sought to buy a large number of shares at once , they would tip their hand and risk driving up Broadcom ’s price .
So , as is often the case on Wall Street , they divided their orders into dozens of small batches , hoping to cover their tracks .
One second after the market opened , shares of Broadcom started changing hands at $ 26.20 .
The slower traders began issuing buy orders .
But rather than being shown to all potential sellers at the same time , some of those orders were most likely routed to a collection of high - frequency traders for just 30 milliseconds — 0.03 seconds — in what are known as flash orders .
While markets are supposed to ensure transparency by showing orders to everyone simultaneously , a loophole in regulations allows marketplaces like Nasdaq to show traders some orders ahead of everyone else in exchange for a fee .
In less than half a second , high - frequency traders gained a valuable insight : the hunger for Broadcom was growing .
Their computers began buying up Broadcom shares and then reselling them to the slower investors at higher prices .
The overall price of Broadcom began to rise .
Soon , thousands of orders began flooding the markets as high - frequency software went into high gear .
Automatic programs began issuing and canceling tiny orders within milliseconds to determine how much the slower traders were willing to pay .
The high - frequency computers quickly determined that some investors ’ upper limit was $ 26.40 .
The price shot to $ 26.39 , and high - frequency programs began offering to sell hundreds of thousands of shares .
The result is that the slower - moving investors paid $ 1.4 million for about 56,000 shares , or $ 7,800 more than if they had been able to move as quickly as the high - frequency traders .
Tyler Durden has been all over this for a while and estimates that HFT might account for as much as a quarter of Goldman ’s total earnings .
And here I always thought that fixed income trading was where all the money was .
Live and learn .
Anyway , HFT has turned into an arms race , but it ’s an arms race that only the elite are allowed to play .
You and I just get to foot the bill , a tenth of a cent at a time .
Sound familiar ?

You tell me how large a file to make and send me $ 100 .
I make it and send it to you .
You send me a compressed file and a decompressor which together are less than the size of my uncompressed file , and which can together regenerate the original uncompressed file .
I send you $ 5,000 .
If you fail , you send me another $ 100 and try again .

I meant can I send you a compressor and several compressed files whose total file size is less than the original uncompressed file and from which I can regenerate the original uncompressed file .

I 'm still thinking about the best file size but I do n't think it will be really massive , probably less than 1 Gb .
Could you put it on an anonymous ftp site somewhere ?

If you want to give me a login and password to an FTP site where I can send this , and it is less than 1 GB , I will upload it to you once your check clears and I have had a chance to create the datafile .
It will take me a few days to do this , most likely , however I wo n't take any more time than necessary .

The problem is I am living in Japan at the moment .
I have been looking on the web for a way to send a money order online using a credit card .
I found sendmoneyorder.com , but they require you to send a photocopy of your credit card and a letter of authorization before you can send $ 100 .
Do you know of any site that will allow me to do this from Japan ?
Alternatively I could just send $ 100 cash .
I also have a bank account in England so I could send you an English check ( they do n't have checks in Japan ) for the equivalent in British pounds ( plus a bit extra for the inconvenience ) .

It is there : original .dat .
The md5sum of this file is 17be33ede31902098b4dd92613b7c891 and the file size is 3145728 .
In order to meet the challenge you must provide to me a compressed file and a decompressor which together total less than the size of this original .dat , and which can generate a file identical to original .dat .
Now that you have the data with which you will be working , I am still curious to know what techniques you will be trying to compress this file .
Also , do you have an estimated time when you will expect to complete this challenge ?
Good luck , Patrick .

Newsgroups : comp.compression From : Mike Goldman Subject : Compression of random data Date : Mon , 02 Apr 2001 17:32:46 - 0400 Organization : Posted via Supernews , http://www.supernews.com
Quick update ...
My compression challenge ( which can be found in the comp.compression faq in part 1 , section 8 ) has been accepted .
The contestant has sent me $ 100 as a processing fee and requested that I generate a 3 megabyte file for him to attempt to compress .
According to the rules of the contest , he must send me back a compressed file and a decompressor which together total in size less than the original file , and which can correctly regenerate the original uncompressed file .
If he can do so , he will receive $ 5,000 plus refund of his processing fee .
Thanks to random.org for providing me with a source of high - quality true random values for use in this contest .
Before naming the individual and giving additional details of our correspondence , I would like to give him some time to analyze the data I will be sending him .
It would be very easy to point out to him the impossibility of his task , but far more interesting to see how long he will struggle with the problem before realizing it for himself .
I am supposing that one of his fellow co-workers probably referred him to my challenge , as I cannot fathom that someone would read the comp.compression faq first and then want to participate after understanding the futility of the effort .
On the other hand , some people just do n't understand information theory too well .
I 'll try to give him a complete explanation of his error after a week or so , I guess . :)

All the files you require are in the out directory of the ftp server you logged onto last time , the password has now changed to *****
The decompressor is called dfi and the compressed files are called comp , comp.0 , comp.1 , ... comp.217 .
Download everything in the out directory to the same directory .
You will probably need to make the decompressor executable , e.g. chmod +x dfi
You then decompress your file by running ./ dfi comp
The total file size of the compressed files ( wc - b comp * ) is 3145528 bytes
The decompressor is 156 bytes Making a total of 3145684 bytes
The original file is 3145728 bytes
Which means the total file size of the decompressor and compressed files is 44 bytes less than the uncompressed file and I have completed the challenge .
I have tested the decompressor on the following operating systems : Linux AIX SunOS IRIX Digital Linux Windows ( with cygwin tools installed ) and found it to work correctly .
When you have confirmed that I have completed the challenge , I will tell you how you can send me the $ 5000 Thanks Patrick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rest of the files in the directory ( comp.0 through comp.217 inclusive ) I have not touched .
You may ascertain that this is true if you wish to view your ftp server logs .
Note that dfi is unable to reconstruct the original .dat file from comp .
Contrary to the requirements of the challenge , a textual analysis of the " decompressor " reveals that you did absolutely nothing whatsoever even to attempt compression of the data which I previously sent you .
Rather , you simply split the file into 218 parts ending with the character " 5 " and then stripped that final character from each part .
Thus the " decompressor " is nothing more than a reassembler , concatenating the parts and reappending the character " 5 " after each .
While I have not downloaded the said 218 parts , it is a certainty that they are either exactly as I have described them to be , or else they are not capable of being reassembled into the original data by the dfi script you provided .
In further point of fact , the 218 parts together must occupy more space than the original file ( original.dat ) that you were given .
Each file requires space for a directory entry , and each such directory entry requires in excess of one byte of space .
Thus you have in actuality expanded the data which you were given to compress .
You have compressed no data .
It does not appear that you ever intended to do so .
Perhaps you misunderstood the terms or the objective of the challenge .
If so , and you promptly submit your withdrawal of your challenge acceptance , I shall refund your $ 100 processing fee in consideration of this misunderstanding .
If you insist on pressing your request for $ 5,000 I shall be forced to defend against any such claim on the basis that you did not satisfy the requirements of the challenge , and , if necessary , for fraud .

The Challenge had nothing to do with compressing data , it was simply to recreate the original file from several " compressed " files and a " decompressor " whose total file size was less than the original file .
I think anyone would agree that if you sent me an uncompressed file of size 1000 bytes and I sent you a decompressor of size 400 bytes and a compressed file of size 599 bytes , I would have met the challenge in spite of the fact that these two files will take up more disk space than the original file .

Obviously , I would like you to send me the $ 5000 as promised , but I never really expected you to .
I 'm surprised we went as far as we did .
I thought you were going to pull out the morning after the original emails after realising your mistake .
You can keep the $ 100 .
By the way , I think I could theoretically complete the original challenge , but the uncompressed file would be impossible large and you would probably argue that the files were n't really a compressed file and a decompressor anyway .
I would rather you did n't reveal my identity or give additional details of our correspondence to the comp.compression newsgroup .

The challenge was specifically regarding data compression .
Perhaps it will be necessary to restate the terms in a legalistic form which is not open to this sort of miscommunication , but I believe the intention was clear from the plain English wording .
One can engage in " data hiding " through a number of approaches , and it is true that you took a somewhat novel approach to this in your own case .
One might likewise shift part of the data to the filename of the " compressed " file and / or to that of the " decompressor " itself .
Much in this way does gzip retain the filename of the uncompressed original -- by creating a new file with the characters " .gz " appended .
However this would also not qualify as data compression -- it is moving data from one part of the filesystem to another , but no data is saved .
( Gzip does perform data compression in many cases , but it does not perform filename compression . )
Likewise in your case , the use of 218 separate files implicitly does nothing more than set an equivalency of EOF = " 5 " , and then makes such a substitution .
However , EOF does not consume less space than " 5 " , no compression has occurred , data has been shifted or " hidden " from the file itself to another part of the filesystem .
By contrast , if your " decompressor " did not make use of such tricks as this , as in your example of having a compressed file of 599 bytes and a decompressor of 400 bytes , I believe the terms of the challenge would be met .
The question is whether real compression took place .

I think that I did not make a mistake except to believe that you truly intended to attempt to compress the data I was sending you .
I do appreciate your graciousness in this , my offer to return the $ 100 stands if you change your mind , as this was never intended as a money making enterprise but merely a discouragement to insincere challengers from wasting my time .
Alternately , you could still take up the original challenge if you like , with the understanding that you must actually compress data to meet the requirements .
I have heard the argument that given a suffiently large dataset it should be possible to find a more efficient representation , however this is not true .
From an information theoretic standpoint when dealing with true random data that has been skew - corrected , the most efficient representation for the value of each bit is precisely one bit , not more and not less .
Flagging any slightly compressible portion of the data stream will require more overhead bytes than will be gained in compression .
This would obviously have to consider using the filesystem for doing the flagging as part of the overhead , at minimum to consider the EOF = flag substitution to consume a byte ( actually it must consume at least 9 bits ) .
I would gladly submit any such submission to an impartial ombudsman to determine the question of whether data compression has occurred . >

I will respect your wishes regarding your identity in consideration of your request .
I would still like to summarize this exchange in some manner , in particular to show how the terms of the challenge might be misconstrued by a clever individual , and therefore restating the challenge in terms which allow of no reoccurrance of this sort of thing .

I do n't know much about compression theory , but I would define a compressed file as a file that contained less data than the original file and from which , by use of a decompressor , the original file could be regenerated .
I would define a decompressor as a program that could restore original files from compressed files by the use of information or algorithms internal to the decompressor . > >

I will withdraw my claim to the $ 5000 and allow you to use any of our correspondence provided you do the following : 1 . Do n't reveal my identity or information regarding the ftp server .
2 . State that you allowed me to use multiple compressed files before I accepted the challenge .
3 . Explain how I " completed " the challenge and show the contents of the dfi and comp files .
You can say whatever you like about the method as long as you explain how it works .
4 . Do n't do any " creative editing " of our emails in order to change their original meaning .
Might generate a bit of discussion about what constitutes a compressed file and a decompressor ;-)

The FAQ clearly outlines that filesystem exploits are not true compression .
I think it may have been short - sighted of Goldman to allow multiple ' compressed ' files , however , having the challenge worded so loosely makes things interesting . :)
And yes , very good show Patrick .

Mike knew he lost when Patrick sent him the files .
From that point on the emails were Mike trying to weasel out of the bet .
He know He lost them pretended to not understand by saying he checked the 2 files and that Patrick failed .
He knew he lost but tried to change the rules after the action was over .

The way I read it , it 's fairly clear that Patrick 's main reason for accepting the challenge was to show Mike how dangerous it can be to make carelessly - worded challenges .

To show compression , you need to show space savings , which has not been done here .
In fact , the disk space required for the " compressed " data is substantially larger than the disk space for the original data , since many more inodes / directory entries are required .
It all goes back to " hiding information " in the file length , which has been discussed here over and over .

PRINCETON , NJ -- U.S. President Barack Obama averaged a 61 % job approval rating for the month of June , down from his 65 % average in May , and one point below his previous monthly low of 62 % , recorded in March .
Obama 's June average is based on 14,914 Gallup Poll Daily tracking interviews conducted in June .
The 61 % average represents a five percentage - point drop compared to his 66 % average for his first 11 days in office , Jan. 21-31 , 2009 .
These two time periods -- Jan. 21-31 and the month of June -- are respectively the highest and the lowest monthly averages for Obama so far .
This fairly narrow range underscores the fact that there has not been a great deal of change in Obama 's approval rating since he was inaugurated .
( While Obama 's approval rating has remained fairly steady , there has been significantly more change in the percentage of Americans who have no opinion of Obama , down from 19 % in January to 7 % in June , and those who disapprove of his job performance , up from 15 % to 32 % .
Thus , the overall pattern has been a fairly stable positive rating of Obama 's job performance , coupled with an increase in negatives occurring concomitantly with a drop in those with no opinion . )
Republicans account for most of the change in Obama 's approval ratings from January through June , with their approval shifting downward from 40 % in January to 25 % today .
Most of the change among Republicans came between January and March ; Republicans ' assessments of Obama have stayed fairly stable since .
Democrats ' approval of Obama has remained steady -- and very high -- throughout his presidency , while independents ' approval ratings have dropped by three points since January .
Among conservatives , the January - to - June comparison shows a significant drop from 48 % to 37 % approval of Obama , coupled with a three - point drop among moderates and a three - point gain among liberals .
All in all , as can be seen from the accompanying graphs , the portrait of Obama 's job approval rating across the month of June reflects a typical partisan and ideological pattern .
Obama 's approval rating ranges from highs of 89 % among Democrats and 88 % among liberals to lows of 25 % among Republicans and 37 % among conservatives .
There is also a large range of approval across demographic and regional population segments .
Among these groups , Obama finds his highest job approval ratings among blacks , nonwhites in general , Hispanics , young Americans aged 18 - 29 , those who are not married , those with incomes under $ 24,000 a year , those living in the East , and those who seldom or never attend church .
Obama does least well among those who attend church weekly , whites , those who are married , Americans aged 65 and older , and those living in the South .
Gallup tracks President Obama 's job approval daily and updates approval ratings among demographic groups each week .
Monthly results are based on telephone interviews with samples of 14,000 to 16,000 national adults , aged 18 and older , per month conducted February through June , 2009 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking , and a sample of 5,733 national adults conducted Jan. 21-31 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error for each month is ±1 percentage point .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

A burrow photographed from above , showing a cross section , with the entrance on the right side and chamber on the left
The world 's oldest dinosaur burrows have been discovered in Australia .
Three separate burrows have been found in all , the biggest 2 m long , each built to a similar design and just big enough to hold the body of a small dinosaur .
The 106 - million - year - old burrows , the first to be found outside of North America , would have been much closer to the South Pole when they were created .
That supports the idea that dinosaurs living in cold , harsh climates burrowed underground to survive .
The only other known dinosaur burrow was discovered in 2005 in Montana , US .
Described two years later , this burrow dated from 95 million years ago and contained the bones of an adult and two juveniles of a small new species of dinosaur called Oryctodromeus cubicularis .
It provides an alternative explanation for how small dinosaurs might have overwintered in polar environments
Palaeontologist Anthony Martin
Now the older burrows have been found by one of the researchers who made the original Montana discovery .
" Like many discoveries in palaeontology , it happened by a combination of serendipity and previous knowledge , " says Anthony Martin of Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia , US .
" In May 2006 , I hiked into the field site with a group of graduate students with the intention of looking for dinosaur tracks .
We did indeed find a few dinosaur tracks that day , but while there I also noted a few intriguing structures . "
Martin returned to the site , a place dubbed Knowledge Creek that lies 240 km from Melbourne , Victoria , to study these structures , once in July 2007 and again in May this year .
His first reaction was one of astonishment .
" I was scanning the outcrop for trace fossils , and was very surprised to see the same type of structure I had seen in Cretaceous rocks of Montana the previous year , " says Martin .
That original structure turned out to be the burrow of O. cubicularis , which Martin described with colleagues David Varricchio from Montana State University , Bozeman , US , and Yoshi Katsura of Gifu Prefectural Museum in Seki City , Japan .
" So to walk up to the outcrop and see such a strikingly similar structure , in rocks only slightly older , but in another hemisphere , was rather eerie . "
Twisting structures
Within the rock , which forms part of the so - called Otway group of rocks that have yielded a rich diversity of vertebrate fossils , Martin found three separate burrows less than 3 m apart , which he describes in the journal Cretaceous Research .
Two of the burrows formed a semi-helix , twisting down into the rock that was once soil .
The largest and best preserved , dubbed tunnel A , turns twice before ending in a larger chamber .
In total , it is more than 2.1 m long .
Martin calculates that an animal around 10kg in size would have made each burrow .
Modern animals which create such burrows include aardwolves , alligators , coyotes , gopher tortoises and striped hyenas .
Twisting burrows can help stop predators getting in and keep the temperature and humidity constant .
Martin can't be sure which species of dinosaur made the burrows , but he is struck by how similar their designs are to the burrow made by O. cubicularis .
A variety of small ornithopod dinosaurs were also known to have lived in the area during the same time in the Cretaceous .
These ornithopods stood upright on their hind legs and were about the size of a large , modern - day iguana .
Surviving the cold Martin has ruled out a variety of other factors that could have created the burrows .
The fact that they were made by dinosaurs makes sense , he says .
Twenty years ago , researchers in Australia , including Patricia Vickers - Rich of Monash University in Clayton and Thomas Rich of the Museum of Victoria , first proposed that some dinosaurs may have climbed into burrows to survive harsh climates they could n't escape from by migrating .
" It gives us yet another example of how dinosaurs evolved certain adaptive behaviours in accordance with their ecosystems , " Martin says .
" Polar dinosaurs in particular must have possessed special adaptations to deal with polar winters , and one of their behavioural options was burrowing .
It provides an alternative explanation for how small dinosaurs might have overwintered in polar environments . "
Martin now hopes that palaeontologists will be on the look out for a range of different types of dinosaur burrow , and for dinosaurs that are physically adapted to burrowing into soil .

Prof Henry Louis Gates is a prominent Harvard scholar
The US president has said police acted " stupidly " when they arrested a black Harvard scholar outside his own home .
Prof Henry Louis Gates was held last week in Cambridge , Massachusetts , home to the top university where he teaches .
Barack Obama said the US had a long history of African - Americans being disproportionately stopped by police .
Officers were called to Prof Gates 's house after a woman reported seeing two black males - the professor and his driver - trying to force entry .
Although the exact facts of the incident are disputed , Prof Gates was asked to provide the officer with identification .
He was then asked to step outside his house and was arrested .
Mr Obama said : " I think it 's fair to say , number one , any of us would be pretty angry .
" Number two ... the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home . "

An initial disorderly conduct charge was dropped and Cambridge police called the arrest " regrettable and unfortunate " .
' Rogue policeman '
Mr Obama said federal officials should work with local police to " improve policing techniques so that we 're eliminating potential bias " .
He said that when he was in the Illinois state legislature , he had worked towards a racial profiling bill because there was indisputable evidence that African - Americans and Hispanics were being stopped disproportionately .
" And that is a sign , an example of how race remains a factor in the society , " he said .
Prof Gates has said he was " outraged " by the arrest and called the officer , Sgt James Crowley , a " rogue policeman " .
Sgt Crowley has refused to apologise .
During the confrontation between the two men , the 58 - year - old professor reportedly said : " This is what happens to black men in America . "
His lawyer said Prof Gates had just returned from a trip overseas and , upon arriving at the property with a driver , found his front door jammed and had to force it open .
By the time police arrived at the house , he and the driver had managed to get inside the property .
According to police , Prof Gates shouted at the officer and accused him of racial bias .

MINGORA , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Pakistani helicopter gunships and warplanes hit Taliban positions in the militants ’
Swat Valley stronghold Saturday , while a curfew prevented civilians from fleeing the fighting .
The struggle in the northwestern valley 130 km ( 80 miles ) from Islamabad has become a test of Pakistan ’s resolve to fight a growing insurgency that has alarmed the West .
The military said up to 55 militants were killed in the day ’s clashes in Swat and four soldiers wounded , and that several militants had died in separate clashes close to the Afghan border .
The figures could not be independently confirmed .
Pakistan ’s army went on a full - scale offensive after the government ordered troops to flush out militants from the Islamist stronghold , once an exotic tourist destination .
Fighting had picked up earlier in the week , triggering a civilian exodus .
Fears are growing for those still trapped .
“ We are feeling so helpless , we want to go but ca n’t as there is a curfew , ” said Sallahudin Khan by telephone from Mingora , Swat ’s main town .
“ We tried to leave yesterday after authorities relaxed the curfew for a few hours , but could n’t as the main road leading out of Mingora was literally jammed with the flood of fleeing people , ” he said as gunship fire boomed in the background .
Helicopters and warplanes targeted militant hideouts in Mingora and other areas in Swat , military officials said .
Militants fired rockets at an army base in Mingora .
Swat administrator Khushal Khan told Reuters the curfew would remain in force throughout the day .
The U.N. refugee agency has said a “ massive displacement ” is under way .
Citing provincial government estimates , it said on Friday up to 200,000 people had left their homes in recent days with a further 300,000 on the move or about to move .
They join 555,000 people displaced from other areas because of fighting since August , the agency said .
Many stay with relatives or friends or find shelter on their own , but officials fear if the crisis is protracted they will join tens of thousands in camps , further straining resources .

LOOTING
Pakistan ’s private Express TV station reported looting at one camp Saturday , showing scenes of scuffles over supplies , but said the situation had been brought under control .
Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani said the government would seek international help for the displaced and the military would do its best to avoid hurting civilians .
“ This is not a normal war .
This is a guerrilla war .
But it is our resolve , it is the resolve of the army that there should be minimum collateral damage , ” he told a news conference .

The fight against militants based near the border with Afghanistan is seen as vital to defeating the Afghan insurgency .
While Swat is not on the border , analysts say it could also become a base for Afghan insurgents as well as for efforts to destabilize nuclear - armed Pakistan ’s government .
Up to 15,000 troops have been pitched against between 4,000 - 5,000 battle - hardened militants in the valley .
“ In my area , there is no government , it ’s all Taliban , ” said Ibrahim Khan , a farmer in the militant stronghold of Matta town .
“ They are in full control . ”
In an incident that could hurt government efforts to rally support for the offensive , suspected pilotless U.S. drone aircraft fired missiles Saturday at targets in South Waziristan , an al Qaeda and Taliban sanctuary on the Afghanistan border , intelligence officials said .
One official as well as a Taliban source said the missiles killed five militants .
Another intelligence official put the death toll at as high as 20 .
Hours later , Pakistani security forces killed 18 militants in the same region , the military said .
The shootout erupted after militants attacked a military convoy , killing one soldier and wounding two .
U.S. attacks have been criticized for killing civilians and violating sovereignty , and have caused opposition to Islamabad cooperating with Washington in fighting militants .
Cruel windfall :
How wars , plagues , and urban disease propelled Europe ’s rise to riches
Hans -Joachim Voth , Nico Voigtländer
In modern economic thinking , peace and prosperity go hand in hand .
However , there are good reasons why in pre-modern societies , the opposite relationship held true – war , disease , and urban death spelled high incomes .
This column explains why Europe ’s rise to riches in the early modern period owed much to exceptionally bellicose international politics , urban overcrowding , and frequent epidemics .
In a pre-modern economy , incomes typically stagnate in the long run .
Malthusian regimes are characterised by strongly declining marginal returns to labour .
One - off improvements in technology can temporarily raise output per head .
The additional income is spent on more ( surviving ) children , and population grows .
As a result , output per head declines , and eventually labour productivity returns to its previous level .
That is why , in HG Wells ' phrase , earlier generations " spent the great gifts of science as rapidly as it got them in a mere insensate multiplication of the common life " ( Wells , 1905 ) .
How could an economy ever escape from this trap ?
To learn more about this question , we should look more closely at the continent that managed to overcome stagnation first .
Long before growth accelerated for good in most countries , a first divergence occurred .
European incomes by 1700 exceeded those in the rest of the world by a large margin .
We explain the emergence of this income gap by a number of uniquely European features – an unusually high frequency of war , particularly unhealthy cities , and numerous deadly disease outbreaks .
The puzzle :
The first divergence in worldwide incomes
European incomes by 1700 were markedly higher than they had been in 1500 .
According to the figures compiled by Angus Maddison ( 2001 ) , all European countries including Mediterranean ones saw income growth of 35 % to 180 % .
Within Europe , the northwest did markedly better than the rest .
English and Dutch real wages surged during the early modern period .
How exceptional was this performance ?
Pomeranz ( 2000 ) claimed that the Yangtze Delta in China was just as productive as England .
Detailed work on output statistics suggests that his claims must be rejected .
While real wages in terms of grain were some 15 - 170 % higher in England , English silver wages exceeded those of China by 120 % to 550 % .
Since grain was effectively an untraded good internationally before 1800 , the proper standard of comparison is the silver wage .
Estimates for India suggest a similar gap vis -à - vis Europe ( Broadberry and Dasgupta , 2006 ) .
Urbanisation figures support this conclusion .
They serve as a good proxy since people in towns need to be fed by farmers in the countryside .
This requires a surplus of food production , which implies high labour productivity .
Since agriculture is the largest single sector in all pre-modern economies , a productive agricultural sector is equivalent to high per capita output overall .
Figure 1 compares European and Chinese urbanisation rates after the year 1000 AD .
Independent of the series used , European rates increase rapidly during the early modern period .
Our preferred measure – the DeVries series – increases from 5 % to nearly 10 % between 1500 and 1800 .
The contrast with China is striking .
There , urbanisation stagnated near the 3 % mark .
Figure 1 . Europe versus China urbanisation rates , 1000 - 1800
In a Malthusian world , a divergence in living standards should be puzzling .
Income gains from one - off inventions should have been temporary .
Even ongoing productivity gains cannot account for the “ first divergence ” – TFP growth probably did not exceed 0.2 % , and cannot explain the marked rise in output per capita .
The answer : Rising death rates and lower fertility
In a Malthusian world , incomes can increase if birth rates fall or death rates increase ( Clark , 2007 ) .
Figure 2 illustrates the basic logic .
Incomes are pinned down by the intersection of birth and death schedules ( denoted b and d ) .
The initial equilibrium is E 0 .
If death rates shift out , to d’ , incomes rise to the new equilibrium Ed 1 .
Similarly , lower birth rates at any given level of income will lead to higher per capita incomes .
In combination , shifts of the birth and death schedules to b’ and d’ will move the economy to equilibrium point E 2 .
Figure 2 . Birth and death rates , and equilibrium per capita income
We argue that there were three factors – which we call the “ Three Horsemen of Riches ” – that shifted Europe ’s death schedule outwards : wars , epidemics , and urban disease .
Wars were unusually frequent .
Epidemics were common , with devastating consequences .
Finally , cities were particularly unhealthy , with death rates there exceeding birth rates by a large margin – without in - migration , European cities before 1850 would have disappeared .
Figure 3 shows the percentage of the European population affected by wars ( defined as those living in areas where wars were fought ) .
It rises from a little over 10 % to 60 % by the late seventeenth century .
Tilly ( 1992 ) estimated that , on average , there was a war being fought somewhere in nine out of every ten years in Europe in the early modern period .
Political fragmentation combined with religious strife after 1500 to form a potent mix that produced almost constant military conflict .
While the fighting itself only killed few people , armies marching across Europe spread diseases .
It has been estimated that a single army of 6,000 men , dispatched from La Rochelle to fight in the Mantuan war , killed up to a million people by spreading the plague ( Landers , 2003 ) .
Figure 3 . Share of European population in war zones
European cities were much unhealthier than their Far Eastern counterparts .
They probably had death rates that exceeded rural ones by 50 % .
In China , the rates were broadly the same in urban and rural areas .
The reason has to do with differences in diets , urban densities , and sanitation :
Europeans ate more meat , and hence kept more animals in close proximity ,
European cities were protected by walls due to frequent wars , which could not be moved without major expense , and
Europeans dumped their chamber pots out of their windows , while human refuse was collected in Chinese cities and used as fertiliser in the countryside .
Epidemics were also frequent .
The plague did not disappear from Europe after 1348 .
Indeed , plague outbreaks continued until the 1720s , peaking at over 700 per decade in the early 17th century .
In addition to wars , epidemics were spread by trade .
The last outbreak of the plague in Western Europe occurred in Marseille in 1720 ; a merchant vessel from the Levant spread the disease , causing 100,000 men and women to perish .
Since Europe has much greater variety in terms of geography and climate than China , disease pools remained largely separate .
When they became increasingly connected as a result of more trade and wars , mortality spiked .
Triggering European “ exceptionalism ”
In combination , the “ Three Horsemen ” – war , urbanisation , and trade - driven disease – probably raised death rates by one percentage point by 1700 .
Once death rates were higher , incomes could remain at an elevated level even in a Malthusian world .
The crucial question then becomes why Europe developed such a particular set of factors driving up mortality .
We argue that the Great Plague of 1348 - 50 was the key .
Between one third and one half of Europeans died .
With land - labour ratios now higher , per capita output and wages surged .
Since population losses were massive , they could not be compensated quickly .
For a few generations , the old continent experienced a “ golden age of labour ” .
British real wages only recovered their 1450s peak in the age of Queen Victoria ( Phelps - Brown and Hopkins , 1981 ) .
Temporarily higher wages changed the nature of demand .
Despite having more children , people had more income than necessary for mere subsistence – population losses were too large to be absorbed entirely by the demographic response .
Some of the surplus income was spent on manufactured goods .
These goods were mainly produced in cities .
Thus , urban centres grew in size .
Higher incomes also generated more trade .
Finally , the increasing number and wealth of cities expanded the size of the monetised sector of the economy .
The wealth of cities could be taxed or seized by rulers .
Resources available for fighting wars increased – war was effectively a superior good for early modern princes .
Therefore , as per capita incomes increased , death rates rose in parallel .
This generates a potential for multiple equilibria .
Figure 4 illustrates the mechanism .
The death rate increases over some part of the income range , which maps into urbanisation rates .
Starting at E 0 , a sufficiently large shock will move the economy to point E H , where population is again stable .
Figure 4 . Equilibria with “ Horsemen effect ”
In the discussion paper , we calibrate our model .
The effect of higher mortality on living standards is large .
We find that we can account for more than half of Europe ’s precocious rise in per capita incomes until 1700 .
Conclusions
To raise incomes in a Malthusian setting , death rates have to rise or fertility rates have to decline .
We argue that a number of uniquely European characteristics – the fragmented nature of politics , unhealthy cities , and a geographically heterogeneous terrain – interacted with the shock of the 1348 plague to create exceptionally high mortality rates .
These underpinned a high level of per capita income , but the riches were bought at a high cost in terms of human lives .
At the same time , there are good reasons to think that it is not entirely accidental that the countries ( and regions ) that were ahead in per capita income terms in 1700 were also the first to industrialise .
How the world could escape the Malthusian trap at all has become a matter of intense interest to economists in recent years ( Galor and Weil , 2000 , Jones , 2001 , Hansen and Prescott , 2002 ) .
In a related paper , we calibrate a simple growth model to show why high per capita income at an early stage may have been key for Europe ’s rise after 1800 ( Voigtländer and Voth , 2006 ) .
In the “ Three Horsemen of Riches ” , we ask how Europe got to be rich in the first place .
Our answer is best summarised by the smuggler Harry Lime , played by Orson Welles in the 1948 classic “ The Third Man “ :
" In Italy , for thirty years under the Borgias , they had warfare , terror , murder , bloodshed , but they produced Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance .
In Switzerland , they had brotherly love ; they had 500 years of democracy and peace – and what did that produce ?
The cuckoo clock . "
We argue that a similar logic held in economic terms before the Industrial Revolution .
Europe ’s exceptional rise to early riches owed much to forces of destruction – war , aided by frequent disease outbreaks and deadly cities .

Bryant was frozen .
Suddenly , the Los Angeles Lakers ' march to a 15th NBA title -- and his dream of a fourth -- would be much tougher .
Lee 's last - second shot went up , and went out .
Lucky .
The Lakers remain in control of the NBA Finals -- just barely .
Lee missed a potential game - winning alley - oop as regulation ended , giving Los Angeles another shot it did n't waste .
Pau Gasol scored seven points in overtime and Bryant finished with 29 as the Lakers , so dominant in the series opener , survived with a 101 - 96 win over the Magic in Game 2 on Sunday night .
" I was obviously relieved when he missed that shot , " Gasol said .
" It could have been a heartbreaker and right now we could be in a totally different situation . "
If Orlando does n't come back and win this series , Lee 's miss may go down as one of the biggest gaffes in finals history .
He had a chance to give the Magic its first finals win .
" We missed it .
I do n't know what else to say , " Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said .
" We executed well , Hedo [ Turkoglu ] made a great pass .
I 'm not trying to be a pain ...
Hedo made a great pass and he just missed it . "
Orlando may not get a better shot to beat the Lakers .
Alley - oops .
" We blew a lot of assignments tonight -- a lot of assignments -- and we still managed to get a win , " Bryant said .
When it was finally over , Bryant , Derek Fisher and the Lakers jogged to the locker room , smiling and high - fiving fans along the way .
Hedo Turkoglu , who threw the perfect lob pass on Lee 's ill - fated shot , trudged through the tunnel dejected , a towel hanging from his head .
Gasol added 24 and 10 rebounds and Lamar Odom 19 points for the Lakers , who won Game 1 by 25 but needed 53 minutes to put away the Magic .
Rashard Lewis scored 34 -- 18 in the second quarter alone -- and Dwight Howard had 17 points and 16 rebounds for Orlando .
Game 3 is Tuesday night at Orlando's Amway Arena , which will be hosting a finals game for the first time since June 9 , 1995 .
With the score tied at 88 - 88 in regulation , Lee missed the first of two late - game shots when he drove the lane and misfired on a contested layup with 10.5 seconds remaining .
Sean Hannity creepily interviewed Sarah Palin in some wooded area of Long Island , where Sarah proceeded to do what Sarah does — - Spewed out a maddening but hilariously folksy word soup that translates to " I told you so ! "
Yes , Sarah tried to warn you America , but you all refused to listen to her , probably because you did n't understand what the hell kind of jibberish was coming out of her mouth , but still , you did n't listen .
Communist China is taking over America RIGHT NOW , just as Barack Hussein Allah Lucifer Obama planned all along , which SARAH TRIED TO WARN YOU ABOUT , but of course , you were too busy shopping at the Gap and eating Hot Pockets while watching The Biggest Loser and whatnot , and you just did n't get the message .
Yes , just stop and take a look around yourselves and the horrible , wretched , pathetic lives you find yourselves currently mired in and you 'll see how truly awful things are in this country , much worse than when Bush was president you see , and 10,000,000 times worse than if Sarah and the mean old man with the funny arms had been named King and Queen of America .
As Sarah emphatically points out in the interview , " We 're borrowing from China ! ! ! "
If we did n't know any better , we 'd swear that Sarah is completely oblivious to the fact that we 've been doing this for years , and of course Hannity does n't raise a finger to point that out either , but whatever , it 's probably just an oversight on both of their parts .
Either way , you should probably get online and order your Rosetta Stone Chinese software .
We suppose the only question is whether you should learn Mandarin or Cantonese ?
Better learn them both just to be safe .
Finally , regarding Sean Hannity 's wooded interview with Sarah Palin , we think that this exchange pretty much sums the whole thing up rather well .
Sarah : " Our country could evolve into something we do not even recognize ... "
Sean : " Socialism ? "
Sarah : " Well , that 's where we are headed . "
Yep , that about sums it all up perfectly .
Consider yourselves warned .

Amanda Terkel of Think Progress ( 6/18/09 ) has posted video and transcript of an MSNBC segment in which Joe Scarborough asked CNBC ‘s Jim Cramer about “ a stunning poll the New York Times has this morning suggesting that Americans are more concerned about deficits than stimulus ” :
Cramer claimed that Americans are n’t buying into healthcare reform right now because “ it just means tax increases , and there ’s got to be someone who pays for it . ”
According to Cramer , the solution that “ everybody ” wants is for Obama to “ go away ” : “ But until we get the economy moving again , I think everybody wishes that Obama would just kind of go away for a little bit . ”
If Cramer looked closer at the poll , it also shows that 57 percent of the American public approve of what Obama is doing on the economy overall .
Of course , Cramer is someone who claimed that Obama ’s policies have resulted in ‘ the most , greatest wealth destruction I ’ve seen by a presidentÃ ƒ Æ ’Â ¢ÃƒÂ ¢ ” Å¡Â ¬Ãƒâ€ šÂ  and is known for his irresponsible financial cheerleading ( e.g. , ‘ Bear Stearns is not in trouble ‘ ) .
Terkel has to wonder if , in actuality , “ maybe it ’s not Obama who Americans want to ‘ just kind of go away for a little bit .

The world 's emissions of the greenhouse gases causing global warming should peak in 2020 and then start to decline , the British Government is proposing in the run-up to the global climate conference taking place at Copenhagen in December .
Emissions from developed nations such as Britain and the US should reach their highest point even earlier , by 2015 , the Energy and Climate Change Secretary , Ed Miliband , suggested to other countries in a meeting in Mexico this week , in the first move to make the crucial issue of a " carbon peak " an official target of the Copenhagen agreement .
Emissions of gases such as carbon dioxide have been rising at a far faster rate than was predicted even a decade ago , and research published by the UK Met Office last year showed that the point at which they begin to decline as a whole is absolutely vital in bringing rising temperatures under control .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A few years ' delay in the peak can mean the world is committed to a significantly higher rise than would otherwise be the case , and computer simulations by the Met Office Hadley Centre indicate that for every ten years the peak is postponed , another half degree of temperature increase becomes unavoidable .
Hitherto , the issue of the " global peak " has largely remained a theoretical one , but this week Mr Miliband and British officials put it on the table at a meeting in Mexico of the Major Economies Forum on Climate and Energy ( MEF ) , a new , pre-Copenhagen high - level discussion group which has been convened by the US President Barack Obama .
The MEF meetings will culminate in a world leaders ' summit on climate change which will take place alongside the G8 meeting in Italy in July , and which will be a critical moment in the push towards a Copenhagen climate deal .
Yesterday Mr Miliband said the issue of a global peak in emissions had so far been " significantly under-emphasised " .
If it could be agreed , it would " irreversibly break the trend towards rising emissions , " he said , adding : " It would show that something had changed .
We are arguing very strongly for a 2020 global peak . "
Dr Vicky Pope , the Hadley Centre 's head of climate change advice , said yesterday : " Even if emissions peak in the next ten years and then decline rapidly , temperatures are still likely to rise to around two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century .
Every 10 - year delay in starting reductions will result in a further 0.5 degree increase in the most likely temperature rise , so the need for action is urgent . "
The Hadley Centre 's simulations last year indicated a most likely two degree rise with a 2015 peak ( and world carbon emissions subsequently declining at three per cent a year to 2050 ) , a 2.5 degree rise with a 2025 peak and a similar decline , and a three degree rise with a 2030 peak .
In each case the temperature rise is a best guess - a 50 - 50 chance - and there are possibilities that it could be lower , or indeed , significantly higher .
All countries , including the UK , must be more ambitious in commitments to cut greenhouse gases , Mr Miliband said , ahead of the launch today of the Government 's own manifesto on what needs to be achieved in Copenhagen .
Greater public pressure would play a part in ensuring the politics of negotiating a new deal catches up with the science of what needs to be done , he said .
From today the Government is distributing pamphlets setting out the importance of Copenhagen , which will be sent to public bodies such as schools and hospitals , and launching a website www.ActOnCopenhagen.gov.uk.

She went on to serve a long apprenticeship in repertory theatre before television gave her a taste of fame - and it was while treading the boards in 1956 that she met her husband .
They married two years later , when she was 35 and he was 39 .
Their twin sons were born six years later .
Sugden found early TV success with comedy series Hugh and I in 1962 and in Coronation Street as the gossiping Nellie Harvey .
Sugden starred alongside Wendy Richard in Are You Being Served ?
But it was The Liver Birds in the late 1960s and early 1970s that enabled her to make her first real impact , as Nerys Hughes ' snobbish mother Mrs Hutchinson .
And then in 1972 came Are You Being Served ?
and the role she became best known for - the blue - rinsed Betty Slocombe , with her affectation of middle - class gentility and her outrageous use of the double - entendre .
Sugden went on to have her own slot on consumer programme
That 's Life and even found new fame in the US where re-runs of Are You Being Served ?
transformed both Sugden and co-star John Inman into cult figures in the early 1990s .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Obama 's top antitrust official said Monday that the administration will aggressively crack down on antitrust violations , reversing a Bush - era policy that had weakened the government 's ability to take on monopolies .
" As antitrust enforcers , we can no longer sit on the sidelines , " said Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney , speaking Monday at the Center for American Progress in Washington .
As part of her remarks , Varney retracted a September 2008 report that amended Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
Section 2 deemed it illegal to make any attempt at creating a monopoly but the amendment had loosened those rules .
" The report ... raised too many hurdles to government antitrust enforcement , " Varney said .
" Withdrawing the report is a shift in philosophy and the clearest way to let everyone know that the Antitrust Division will be aggressively pursuing cases where monopolists try to use their dominance in the marketplace to stifle competition and harm consumers . "
Though the report had followed more than a year of hearings conducted by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission , the FTC never actually signed the document .
Changing landscape : The Bush administration brought historically few antitrust cases to trial .
But Varney said those days are over .
She promised a return to " tried and true case law and Supreme Court precedent . "
For example , Varney said the United States could start seeing more cases like the 1998 - 2001 United States vs. Microsoft case in which the software giant was found to have forced out Internet browser competition like Netscape and Opera .
There 's a good chance that the Justice Department 's decision will not only lead to more antitrust complaints but also to a more receptive ear , said Joe Angland , partner in White & Case 's antitrust practice .
" The administration signaled that , in certain areas , it will adopt stricter rules to deal with dominant firms , " he said .
" It will likely lead to more investigations of the firms ' abilities to deal with competitors . "
But Angland added that the decision does not herald a return to the " bad old days " of the 1950s and ' 60s , when the government aimed to take down corporations it deemed too large .
He said the repeal of the report likely means a return to Clinton - era policies which he described as " stricter , but not anti-business . "
Angland also believes that the Obama administration is not looking to target any specific companies or sectors .
Instead , the shift will likely lead to more investigations of loyalty discounts and refusals to deal with competitors -- two areas in which the Supreme Court has not issued a ruling .
" The administration can't change Supreme Court decisions ; they can only step in where there is not a ruling , " said Angland .
Varney will be delivering the same speech Tuesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which represents a broad spectrum of companies .
" The chamber is all for competition in the marketplace , but without knowing what the new standard is , without prescribed policies , it 's tough to articulate whether the administration 's plans are favorable or unfavorable position for businesses , " said Sean Heather , executive director of global regulatory cooperation at the Chamber of Commerce .
" Enforcement of policy needs to be grounded in sound economic analysis and hard evidence of harm to consumers , " he added .
European shift : After Bush became president in 2001 , many plaintiffs started opting to take antitrust cases to European courts .
Among the bigger cases , Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) was fined $ 1.2 billion by the European Commission in February 2008 after it was found to be pricing out rivals and refusing to comply with the court 's previous antitrust decision .
Similarly , European Union antitrust regulators are expected to say Wednesday that Intel Corp. ( INTC , Fortune 500 ) unfairly paid computer makers to delay or even cancel products that contained chips made by rival AMD ( AMD , Fortune 500 ) , according to reports .
Varney , a former FTC commissioner under the Clinton administration , said the U.S. Justice Department plans to closely align itself with the European Union to streamline antitrust regulation .
" I do n't think you 'll get a better result from one jurisdiction than another , " she said .
Angland said the Justice Department 's new antitrust enforcement will slow the movement of cases to European courts , but not end it completely .
Too big to fail ... really ?
Varney said a major failure of the previous administration was allowing corporations to grow to such an extent that they essentially did become too big to fail .
That 's because many had become so intertwined with other businesses within their industry that a failure would have posed a systemic risk to the entire sector .
" Too big to fail [ is ] a failure of antitrust , " Varney said .
" The recent developments in the marketplace should make it clear that we can no longer rely upon the marketplace alone to ensure that competition and consumers will be protected . "
Varney suggested a " back - to - basics " approach to antitrust enforcement .
" When companies compete , you get better programs at lower prices , " she said .

The New Nuri al - Maliki
The circumstances surrounding Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s visit to Washington this week could not be more different from the last time he was in town .
In July 2006 , Maliki was largely unknown , both in Iraq and in the West , and lacked a constituency .
Today , he is the dominant force in Iraqi politics , has consolidated much of the emerging Iraqi state into his own hands , and has won a measure of democratic legitimacy after January ’s provincial elections .
In 2006 , with Iraq on the verge of state failure , it was Maliki ’s indecisiveness that troubled Washington .
Today , with his country emerging as a sovereign power , his assertiveness is what ’s worrying .
Three months before his last visit , Maliki had been chosen as prime minister precisely because he seemed weak .
Iraq ’s first elections under the new constitutional order were held in December 2005 , yet the negotiations to form a government stretched on for months .
The United Iraqi Alliance ( UIA ) , the majority coalition of Shiite parties , was unable to agree on a candidate for prime minister .
The face - off between the two dominant blocs in the coalition — the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq ( ISCI ) and the Sadrists — produced gridlock , each group refusing to accept the other ’s preferred candidate .
Maliki was chosen as a compromise candidate to resolve the impasse .
A career Dawa Party operative who had spent decades in exile , Maliki was viewed as a threat to no one , without a popular base , lacking a militia , and unable to exert control even over UIA members .
In 2006 , Iraq ’s new political order was bankrupt .
Violence raged following the bombing of the Askariya shrine in Samarra in February 2006 .
There was no " state " to which Iraqis could be loyal , nor one they could be confident would even be around a month or a year later .
Shiite militias , often wearing government uniforms , ran amok , driving Sunni families from their homes , and murdering and extorting the Iraqi people .
Al Qaeda operated with ease and near impunity .
U.S. officials , most notably National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley in an internal memo leaked to the press in November 2006 , complained that Maliki was weak and indecisive and could not stand up to violent actors , even those to which he was politically connected such as the Sadrists and other Shiite militants .
But that was only half of the story .
The state Maliki commanded faced a profound crisis of legitimacy and was no match for the maelstrom of violence .
What changed the equation were primarily the U.S. troop surge and the accompanying shift in U.S. policy .
Although much has been made of the United States ’ improved counterinsurgency approach , the most meaningful change was more elemental :
The United States shifted its primary goal from transitioning control of Iraq to the Iraqis to taking the lead in establishing security itself .
The United States decimated Maliki ’s enemies , the insurgents and militias who were tearing Iraq apart .
The Iraqi Army , trained and constructed by the United States , improved in confidence , capability , and cohesion .
Iraq ’s new political order gradually gained legitimacy as those who rejected it and sought to bring it down with violence were killed , co-opted , or otherwise coerced into accepting it .
This process was also enabled by the Sunni " awakening " against al Qaeda , which preceded the surge , as well as by the fact that the violence had to some extent burned itself out by the beginning of 2007 .
But the surge was the key , as it decisively tipped the balance in favor of one side — the Iraqi state — in a many - sided conflict .
As Maliki ’s enemies were defeated , the state he commanded gained legitimacy , and as his own army became more powerful , his confidence grew .
Starting in late 2006 and continuing through 2007 , Maliki distanced himself politically from the Sadrists , first tolerating and then encouraging U.S. strikes against them .
Eventually , starting with the Basra operation in March 2008 and continuing in Sadr City , Maysan , Mosul , Diyala , and beyond , Maliki took the initiative away from the United States and began to set security priorities on his own .
Over the course of 2008 , Maliki began pushing away the members of his own governing coalition , the Kurds and ISCI .
He not only challenged them rhetorically and sought to claim the credit for Iraq ’s security improvement , but also began to centralize more control of the government into his own hands .
For example , he subverted the civilian ministries responsible for security and intervened directly in security matters himself , while working to secure the appointment of officers loyal to him in the security forces .
Moreover , he used the resources available to his office to cultivate the indigenous support base he had previously lacked .
He used state funds for " reconciliation " efforts , most notably the formation of " tribal support councils " whose ostensible purpose was to bring Iraqi tribes into the government fold but also were a means of giving funds to political supporters .
The man who in 2006 had been derided for his weakness by late 2008 was being called a " strongman " in the international press , and Maliki ’s political opponents and some foreign analysts began to express concerns about a return to authoritarian government in Iraq .
As Maliki ’s power grew , his relationship with the United States became increasingly contradictory .
Just as his rise was enabled by U.S. support , his government ’s dependence on U.S. help — particularly in the security field — continues to this day .
The Iraqi Army , for instance , still depends on U.S. air support , communications , procurement , and logistics in order to function .
But Maliki has never really acknowledged this fact .
Instead , he has become more nationalistic and anti-American in his public rhetoric .
Although it seemed paradoxical to many observers at the time , during the negotiations surrounding the U.S. - Iraq Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) , Maliki was aggressive in asserting Iraq ’s sovereign rights .
He forced the Bush administration to accept an unconditional timeline for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of 2011 and stated his willingness to accept immediate withdrawal if the United States did not accede to his terms .
Since the signing of the agreement , Maliki has touted it as a heroically won expulsion of foreign forces from Iraqi soil .
His nationalist stance continues today , as shown by the ostentatious celebrations he organized for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraqi cities on June 30 .
Up to a point , the United States has welcomed Maliki ’s tough stance .
One of the main reasons insurgents and violent actors are no longer able to find support among the Iraqi population is that most Iraqis think that the state has returned for good .
Maintaining the public image of a strengthening , self - sufficient Iraqi government is thus a security priority for the United States and will be essential for the planned withdrawal of troops over the coming years .
Most U.S. policymakers also accept Iraqi political realities , particularly as Iraq heads into January 2010 ’s parliamentary elections , which will be critical for the long - term political future of Iraq .
Indeed , the idea that the United States could invade an Arab country , topple its government , and establish a new one that would earn democratic legitimacy and be an ally of the United States was always unlikely given regional political dynamics and Iraq ’s history , which require some degree of distance from Washington .
Still , behind closed doors , many Iraqi leaders , including the prime minister ’s advisors , express their desire for a close long - term relationship with the United States .
They think Iraq will need U.S. military support well beyond 2011 ( requiring a negotiation of a new agreement superseding the SOFA ) and would like the very favorable terms on which Uncle Sam provides this support to continue .
Moreover , every Iraqi who comes through Washington these days , or who catches the ear of an American in Baghdad , stresses the importance of implementing the strategic framework agreement ( SFA ) , a document committing the United States to support Iraq in economic , diplomatic , cultural , and even security fields .
Maliki himself on his current trip to Washington will co-chair , along with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , a meeting of the higher coordinating committee for SFA implementation .
But of course , the other important difference between Maliki ’s current visit and the last one is the occupant of the White House .
To a great extent , Maliki owes his current dominance to the Bush administration ’s recommitment to Iraq through the surge .
More broadly , Bush made the U.S. effort in Iraq the centerpiece of his administration .
There was no question that Bush viewed the long - term U.S. relationship with Iraq as strategically critical to U.S. interests .
Iraq is further down on President Barack Obama ’s list of priorities , coming after Afghanistan , Iran , the global economic crisis , and a range of domestic initiatives .
Although Obama has wisely allowed the Iraq policy he inherited from Bush to continue for the near term , he lacks Bush ’s enthusiasm for the war and his belief in the strategic importance of the long - term U.S. - Iraq relationship .
As for Maliki himself , Obama ’s advisors have made clear their belief that Bush was too close to the prime minister as an individual and that U.S. support is for Iraqi institutions rather than particular leaders .
This week , Maliki will meet a president whose support for a democratic Iraq is genuine , but not guaranteed .
U.S. officials are annoyed at what they regard as Maliki ’s overconfidence , demonstrated in particular by his celebratory handling of the recent withdrawal and the strict implementation of new rules restraining U.S. forces .
Obama and his administration want a strong alliance with Iraq , but also a more balanced one that involves responsibilities and obligations on both sides .
For the new president , Iraq is important for U.S. interests but not critical , and he casts a more skeptical eye on the benefits the United States receives in return for its massive support .
The burden is on Maliki to make his case that both he and the U.S. - Iraq relationship more generally are still worth America ’ time and trouble .
Sensitive information about the technical infrastructure of the New York Stock Exchange computer network was left unsecured on a public server for possibly more than a year , Wired.com has learned .
The data was removed after Wired.com disclosed the situation to the NYSE .
It included several directories of files containing logs , server names , IP addresses , lists of hardware , lists of software versions running on the network , and configuration and patch histories ( including which patches have not yet been installed ) .
It was all available on a publicly accessible , unprotected FTP server maintained by EMC , a company that sells storage systems and managed services to the NYSE and other companies .
" We have discussed the matter with EMC , and at this point we believe that there has been no impact on our operations or our customers , " said NYSE spokeswoman Mirtha Medina in an e-mail .
" Unless the NYSE knows that this stuff is out there and has approved for it to be out there ( highly doubtful ) , I see no good reason why EMC is allowing this to happen , " said an information - security specialist via e-mail .
He asked not to be named because he works in the financial industry .
" Leaving information like this in a ' public ' place definitely would make a bad guy 's job somewhat easier . "
The information could allow an intruder to map the NYSE 's network architecture and determine what vulnerabilities exist in the system .
For example , one of the documents posted on the server was an Excel spreadsheet , called a " heat report , " which consisted of a long list of low - level and high - level warnings , some of them indicating where patches had not yet been installed , such as the one below :
WARNING : Solaris 5.9 kernel patch fix 122300 is not installed .
It 's unclear how long the information was left unprotected on the server , but a note posted amid the files by an EMC employee named Dan Sferas read , " This directory contains all relevant data to the NYSE account . "
The note was dated April 2 , 2008 .
A spokesman for EMC said the data exposed on the site was not sensitive , although the company locked the data behind a password gateway to protect it from public access shortly after Wired.com spoke with the NYSE .
It has since moved the data to another location .
" We 've discussed the situation with the NYSE , " said EMC spokesman Paul Farmer in an e-mail .
" We 're confident that the information exchanged on our FTP site is not sensitive and will have no impact on NYSE Euronext systems or its customers . "
A source knowledgeable about the leak , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that the FTP server was used to share configuration information among EMC engineers , vendors and customers .
" This was a breakdown of process within EMC , and normally that information would not be accessible to the public , " said the source .
The network - security expert , who examined a few of the files for Wired.com , said it was unclear whether the data was limited to the stock exchange 's public network , or if it also included information that would help someone access its trading network , which would normally be segregated from the internet .
" I would think they would / should be totally separate , " he said , " but I do n't know enough about their network topology to know for sure . "
EMC spokesman Farmer did not respond to questions on how long the information was available on the site or whether the data included information about the NYSE 's trading network .
EMC 's executive team includes Art Coviello , executive vice president .
He is also president of RSA Security , one of the top computer security firms in the country , which EMC bought in 2006 .
Mastigias jellyfish flood Jellyfish Lake , a marine lake in Palau , an island nation in the Pacific Ocean .
Here , researchers found that pulsating jellyfish stir up the oceans with as much vigor as tides and winds , making them major players in ocean mixing .
Pulsating jellyfish and their swim pals stir up the oceans with as much vigor as tides and winds , scientists have found .
Their study also found that the shape of the aquatic blobs affects their mixing abilities .
Until now , oceanographers had dismissed the idea that such tiny ocean creatures could play a role in mixing various layers of ocean water on a large scale .
The argument was based on evidence that any swishing from fish tails , say , would get dampened by the ocean 's viscosity ( a measure of a fluid 's resistance to flow — honey has a high viscosity compared with water ) .
But the new study , which is published in the July 30 issue of the journal Nature , reveals a mixing mechanism first described by Charles Darwin 's grandson that is actually enhanced by the ocean 's viscosity , making these tiny sea critters major players in ocean mixing .
" We 've been studying swimming animals for quite some time , " said John Dabiri , a Caltech assistant professor of aeronautics and bioengineering .
" The perspective we usually take is that of how the ocean — by its currents , temperature , and chemistry — is affecting the animals .
But there have been increasing suggestions that the inverse is also important — how the animals themselves , via swimming , might impact the ocean environment . "
After all , each day , billions of tiny krill and some jellyfish migrate hundreds of meters from the depths of the ocean toward the surface where they feed .
And with swarms of the gelatinous organisms popping up across the world 's oceans , if the swimmers do indeed mix the water their impact could be major .
" There are enough of these animals in the ocean , " Dabiri said , " that , on the whole , the global power input from this process is as much as a trillion watts of energy — comparable to that of wind forcing and tidal forcing . "
Biologic blender
Dabiri and Caltech graduate student Kakani Katija discovered the jellyfish mixing with computer simulations and field measurements of jellyfish swimming in a lake in Palau in the Pacific Ocean .
In their field experiments , the researchers squirt fluorescent dye into the water in front of the Mastigias jellyfish and watched what happened as the animals swam through the dyed water .
Rather than being left behind as the jellyfish swam by , the dyed water travelled along with the swimming creatures .
{{ video = " LS_090729_JellyFish " title= " Jellyfish Mix Up Ocean Water " caption =
" As the jellyfish swims , water gets pulled along with the animal , seen as swirls of red or green dye that was injected into the water . "
}}
Here 's how the researchers think it works :
As a jellyfish swims , it pushes water aside and creates a high - pressure area ahead of the animal .
The region behind the jellyfish becomes a low - pressure zone .
Then , the ocean water rushes in behind the animal to fill in this lower pressure gap .
The result : Jellyfish drag water with them as they swim .
" What 's really cool about these jellies [ is ] they have huge variation in their body shapes , " Katija told LiveScience .
And they found such differences can impact the amount of water that hitches a ride with the jellies .
For instance , moon jellyfish ( the kind typically seen at aquariums ) have saucer - shaped bodies and can carry a lot of water with them .
But other bullet - shaped jellyfish would drag smaller volumes of water .
Global impact
The ocean churning has broader implications .
Without any mixing , the surface of the ocean would lack nutrients , as any food gets gobbled up immediately , while the ocean bottom would remain deplete of oxygen .
" With this mechanism , through mixing the animals can pull nutrient - rich fluid up to nutrient - poor areas and pull oxygen - rich fluid down to oxygen - poor regions , " Katija said .
And on larger scales , the biologic blender could impact the ocean circulation , which affects the Earth 's climate .
Dabiri and Katija say such mixing effects should be incorporated into computer models of the global ocean circulation .

One - Armed Spiral Galaxy NGC 4725
Credit & Copyright : Mike Siniscalchi
Explanation :
While most spiral galaxies , including our own Milky Way , have two or more spiral arms , NGC 4725 seems to have only one .
In this sharp color image , the solo spira mirabilis is tightly wound , traced by bluish , newborn star clusters .
The odd galaxy also sports obscuring dust lanes , a prominent ring , and a yellowish central bar structure composed of an older population of stars .
NGC 4725 is over 100 thousand light - years across and lies 41 million light - years away in the well - groomed constellation Coma Berenices .
Computer simulations of the formation of single spiral arms suggest that they can be either leading or trailing arms with respect to a galaxy 's overall rotation .

In spite of massive spending on efforts to counter HIV / AIDS , experts warn that many young
Thais are still having unsafe sex .
The problem , according to Sittichok Chaisupasin , a 16 - year - old peer educator , is not a lack of knowledge about HIV , but a lack of interest among young people in acting on what they know .
" Many people know HIV is transmitted by having sex , " he said .
" We also know we should stand up and give our seat to old people on the bus , but we do n't do it , " he said .
Survey findings confirm Chaisupasin ’s observation .
While young people consistently demonstrate extremely high levels of knowledge about HIV in surveys , only about 25 percent of young men report using condoms when engaging in casual or risky sex , often because they do not view sex with other young people as risky .
" The real challenge is one of pushing Thai youth ( and their elders as well ) into converting their ' knowledge ' or ' awareness ' of HIV risk into changes in their own individual behaviour , " said Patrick Brenny , UNAIDS Thailand country director .
Scott Bamber , head of HIV / AIDS for the UN Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) in Thailand , agreed and noted that while young people were aware of the risks of HIV , they often lacked access to life - skills training and services that would help them translate knowledge into behavioural change .
They did n't know , for instance , how to negotiate condom use with a reluctant partner .
Since Thailand reported its first HIV case in 1984 , the country has succeeded in reducing the number of new infections from 140,000 a year a decade ago to about 14,000 in 2007 .
Thailand 's goal is to cut new HIV infections by a further 50 percent by 2010 , but there has been an increase in incidence among commercial sex workers , men who have sex with men , and young people , according to UNAIDS .
Unprotected sex accounts for an estimated 90 percent of all new infections .
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria recently gave almost US $ 100 million to support Thailand 's prevention and treatment strategy over the next six years and some inroads are being made .
Through its Teenpath project , PATH , a nonprofit global health organisation , is training young people to work as informal sex educators at schools .
" Many young people do n't prepare themselves when they 're in a relationship , because sex education focuses more on anatomy and not on real - life situations .
That 's why we support teachers to develop a sex education curriculum , " explained Arisa Sumamal , a Teenpath project assistant in Bangkok .
Teenpath sex educator , Saranya Thinvilai , 16 , said some of her peers were having sex with as many as four different partners a week , with condom usage infrequent at best .
" Young people think other people will get [ HIV ] not them , " Thinvilai told IRIN / PlusNews .
" For first love relationships , many people do n't use condoms because they trust their partners .
It 's not good , because you do n't know how many partners they 've had before . "

As we noted a few days ago , Israel 's creation of a " Warsaw Ghetto " in Gaza continues apace , using control of the food supply as a primary weapon against the civilian population .
Haaretz takes up the case again in a new story :
Every time Gazans sit down for a meal , they face a depressing reality .
The selection of foods available to them is dictated almost entirely by a harsh policy imposed by the Israeli government , which , as of late , has even refused to allow such innocuous - seeming foods as pumpkins , pasta or beans to cross the border .
The goal behind Israel 's tight control of Gazans ' dietary regime is definitely not improving their health .
Rather , the government argues that allowing " luxury " foods into Gaza would only add to the popularity of Hamas ' leaders , enabling them to better feed their constituency .
But , in the eyes of many observers , Israel 's policy of limiting foods that enter the Strip is almost tantamount to starvation , and comes dangerously close to collective punishment , both of which are not only illegal and immoral methods to use in pursuit of Israeli security , but also do little to improve that security .
It is in fact , in law , in truth and in reality collective punishment , not just " dangerously close " to it .
It is an all - out , astonishing brazen war crime -- a clear echo of Nazi policies on provisioning the Jewish ghettos in Poland after the Germans conquered the country .
But let 's move on :
Indeed , what long - term Israeli interest is served by having pregnant women and children suffer anemia , which causes well - documented damage to fetal and juvenile development ?
Limiting their access to iron does not improve Israeli security .
Rather , it constitutes a gross violation of our own basic human values and the morality of Israeli society .
Can the experts please explain :
Why does the Health Ministry recommendation for the diet of Israeli infants and toddlers - " soft fruit such as bananas and avocado , cooked chicken and beef , and cheese cubes " - not apply to Palestinian children ?
These particular items are all strictly forbidden from entering Gaza , while rice and a limited selection of meat and produce are the only food items in fact allowed to enter .
Several months ago , ministry officials approached the United Nations to consult with them about their dietary plan for the Gaza Strip .
The UN officials - as one might guess - politely told them to go to hell , refusing to have anything to do with such a policy .
The Israelis then turned to a Health Ministry dietician , whose advice might have led to the present policy according to which , as Israeli officials have stated , " the minimal requirements for the sustenance of Gaza Strip residents are being observed without inflicting a humanitarian disaster . "
The participation of medical experts in drawing up the menus for Palestinians in Gaza - if they knew what policy their advice would help produce - is a grave violation of medical ethics .

Mild noninvasive electrical current to brain could help stroke patients
A simple , inexpensive device that delivers electrical current to the brain noninvasively could help stroke patients recover lost motor ability .
According to a new study , the treatment –transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) – in combination with occupational therapy boosted recovery better than either treatment on its own .
Many patients spontaneously recover some function in the weeks and months after suffering a stroke , as their brains reorganize to compensate for the damaged area .
Scientists are searching for ways to both boost and focus this innate plasticity , thus improving neural repair .
Electrical activity is one option under study : electrical current applied to the brain can modulate brain - cell activity–a crucial component of neural remodeling .
In tDCS , an electrical current is passed directly to the brain through the scalp and skull .
( The treatment generates just a slight tingle , if anything , in the patient . )
Previous research has shown that applying tDCS to the motor cortex can improve motor performance in healthy people and , to some extent , in stroke patients .
But most previous studies have tested just a single treatment , and few have used it in conjunction with rehabilitation exercises .
In the current study , Gottfried Schlaug and his collaborators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , in Boston , tested 20 patients who had suffered a stroke an average of 2.5 years previously and still had moderate to severe impairments .
Patients performed 60 minutes of occupational therapy each day for five days , while also receiving a 30 - minute session of either active electrical stimulation or a placebo–a fake treatment designed to mimic electrical stimulation .
The researchers used a simple device–a nine - volt battery connected to large flat sponges that are moistened and then applied to the head–that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for delivering drugs across the skin .
( The current encourages the movement of charged drug molecules across the skin . )
A week after the start of the experiment , patients given the real treatment performed much better on a number of motor tests –including tests of strength , range of movement , and practical functions such as grasping a cup–than those who received the fake treatment , improving by about 12 to 15 percent versus about 3 to 5 percent , says Schlaug .
He presented the research at a conference in San Francisco this week sponsored by the Organization for Human Brain Mapping .
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , the researchers also found that activity in the injured part of the brain increased after the course of treatment .
While it ’s not yet clear exactly how tDCS improves motor function after stroke , one theory is that it helps repair an imbalance in the interactions between the two hemispheres of the brain .
In the healthy brain , the left and right sides of the motor cortex continually inhibit each other in order to carry out one - sided movements , such as writing or brushing one ’s teeth .
If one side is damaged by stroke , it can no longer effectively inhibit the healthy side , which in turn leads to increased inhibition of the stroke - damaged hemisphere .
“ There is some thought that this imbalance of inhibition actually hinders stroke recovery , ” says Schlaug .
“ Noninvasive brain stimulation offers a potential solution to this , or at least a way to test this hypothesis . ”

Sad news , nonconsensual bukkake aficionados .
In one of the shortest debates to occur in the Oregon House , a specific type of gang initiation was called into question this week .
A proposed new law would make it a second - degree sex abuse crime to fling " a dangerous substance at another person " in the state of Oregon .
Said substance is semen or other bodily fluids tossed out of sexual desire or otherwise .
( Think of that scene in Silence of the Lambs where that loony inmate hisses to Jodie Foster , " I can smell your [ flower ] , " then tosses his juice at her . )
Here 's how the debate went down :
" Good bill .
I urge your aye vote , " Rep. Chris Garrett , D - Lake Oswego , said Tuesday about House Bill 2478 .
Any closing remarks ?
" No , " Garrett said firmly .
The new proposed law follows a vile moment last June when a potential gang member threw his semen on a Portland mother inside a Target store .
While the creep was convicted of assault , many thought the crime " should fall into the category of a sexual assault . "
The bill passed 57 - 0 and now moves to the Senate .
In related news : Oregon has gangs ?
How adorable .
Metal is not immune to trends , and it's had its fair share of horrid ones .
Does anyone really want to revisit funk metal anytime soon ?
That said there are still eras in its history that can and should be kept alive .
In the last few years , a new front of bands has brought back the thrash sound that first crept into the scene in the early - to - mid 1980s with bands like Testament , Anthrax and Razor .
These days it 's not uncommon to be in your local record store and find a new album with an Ed Repka ( renowned artist who has done worshiped covers for the likes of Megadeth and Evil Dead ) cover and a band photo where every member is wearing a pair of Reebok high tops .
Yes folks , it feels like 1987 all over again .
With so many groups sprouting up lately , Noisecreep has compiled a list of newer thrash bands that deserve some attention .
We 've tried to touch upon a wide spectrum of styles and sounds , and we admittedly could n't include everything here .
We 're sure you 'll let us know which bands we 've missed , but that 's another testament ( no pun intended ) to the scene 's rich diversity .
So get your denim vests and Vio-lence shirts ready , here 's our list of 10 new school thrash metal bands you should check out !
Municipal Waste
Unquestionably the most popular and best band of the thrash renaissance , Municipal Waste has helped influence many of the acts on this list .
The Richmond , Va. - based group takes the lighthearted spin bands like Tankard and Wehrmacht favored in the 1980s and mix it with the crossover punch of greats like D.R.I. and Excel , coming up with an intoxicating blend of speed and infectious songwriting .
Albums like ' Hazardous Mutation ' and the upcoming ' Massive Aggressive ' pack one monster riff after the other , but it 's the live show where they earn their bulletproof reputation .
Going to see Municipal Waste live is an event .
One second you 'll see someone boogie - boarding over the crowd , and the next moment you turn around and see vocalist Tony Foresta busting out a beer bong in the middle of a song .
In a metal scene where too many bands take themselves way too seriously , MW prove that it 's OK to have some fun while you sing about the ills of the world .
Violator
Like Sepultura , Dorsal Atlantica and RDP , Brazil 's Violator proves that their country 's dire econo - political situation can inspire some truly vital songwriting .
The group 's technical take on thrash is heavy on guitars and lean on melody .
On 2006's ' Chemical Assault , ' the quartet proved that they were one the underground 's brightest hopes – even though the record flew under the radar .
Now signed to Earache Records in Europe , Violator finally has the muscle behind them to get their musical output the press and public attention it deserves .
Keep your eyes out for these dudes !
Warbringer
If you took the average 30 - something - year - old that loved thrash back in its golden days and played them Warbringer , they probably would n't know it was a newer band .
That 's how much these California maniacs stay true to the style .
John Kevill 's bark is quintessential thrash , bringing to mind the work of Steve Souza ( Exodus ) while their twin - guitar assault fuses a deadly balance of grit and melody .
Their recent album ' Waking Into Nightmares ' has been garnering critical raves , and the band has been working the tour circuit hard .
So do n't be surprised if you start hearing more about this band in the coming months .
Merciless Death
Merciless
Death 's purist handling of the genre is gimmick - free and has made the power trio one of the leaders of the new scene .
The band 's tireless work ethic has not only shown their unflinching commitment to – and love for – the sound , it 's also helped the scene grow up and down the west coast here in the U.S. However , Merciless Death plays a faster , more straight - forward style that owes a greater debt to European bands of the 1980s than a lot of the other bands on this list .
Mantic Ritual
If you long for ' Kill Em ' All ' - era Metallica , this is a band that should already be in your iTunes library .
This Pittsburgh act loves their thrash packed with instantly - memorable guitar riffs and catchy vocal lines .
And that 's evident on the newly - released ' Executioner . '
Vocalist / guitarist Dan Wetmore 's vocals carry the authority of vintage James Hetfield , and songs like " One by One " and " Panic " have all of the stylistic traits that made bands like Exciter , Overkill and Deathrow ( Germany ) so great way back when .
Ramming Speed
Although this Boston unit is n't anywhere near a household name in the metal world yet , that does n't mean they do n't deserve to be .
Already making noise in the DIY hardcore and punk scenes , Ramming Speed 's songwriting reveals a love for groups like Nuclear Assault and early Anthrax .
If you 're looking for complicated arrangements and techy guitars , Ramming Speed is not for you .
But if you want to check out some no - frills , to - the - point thrash , this might be your favorite new band .
Blood Tsunami
Featuring members of the Norwegian death and black metal scene , including Faust ( Emperor , Aborym ) on drums , Blood Tsunami are so dedicated to the sound that they even named their debut album ' Thrash Metal . '
Their material has many writers comparing them to the bands of the German ' Teutonic Thrash ' movement that included legends like Destruction and Sodom .
That means Blood Tsunami play a tightly - wound , dissonant and sped - up style of thrash that does n't include many of the hardcore and punk flavorings American bands colored their songwriting with .
Toxic Holocaust
Originally a solo project by an Oregon musician who calls himself Joel Grind , Toxic Holocaust has evolved into a full time band .
Signed to Relapse Records , TH have become of the busiest and most popular acts on this list .
Like Ramming Speed , Grind showcases his love for punk by threading it into his songwriting .
Even on thrashers like ' Nuke the Cross ' and ' Send Them to Hell , ' you can clearly hear the influence of Discharge and Broken Bones throughout .
Skeletonwitch
With a name like Skeletonwitch , you pretty much know coming in not to expect another happy - go - lucky pop punk band .
These Ohioans released one of the current thrash scene 's strongest full - length efforts in 2007's ' Beyond the Permafrost . '
Besides their menacing guitars and pummeling rhythm section work , it 's Chance Garnette 's vocals that help set the band apart from the crowd .
His guttural growl shows obvious death metal influence , but when it 's crossed with Skeletonwitch 's thrashier playing style , it makes for some chilling moments .
Look for a new album from the band in stores shortly .
Corrupt ( from Sweden )
This Swedish act is the most obscure listed here , but it 's not for a lack of essential material .
Old Kreator and Sepultura have helped inform their music , but shades of death metal also sneak their way in .
In Olof Wikstrand , Corrupt have one of most gifted riff generals in thrash today .
The guy has obviously done his homework , because every guitar part oozes with personality – and there is n't one moment of filler in any of their songs .
Time will tell if these Swedes can raise their profile , but in the meantime anyone reading this should go seek out the band 's work .
Other notable acts include : Exmortus , Cross Examination , SSS , Caustic Strike , Hellish Crossfire , Lethal ( Sweden ) , Eliminator and Lazarus A.D .
The so - called " Prince of Pot " launched his farewell tour in Calgary , Sunday Marc Emery has given up his long fight to avoid extradition to the United States for selling cannabis seeds .
He plans to turn himself - in to authorities in Seattle in September .
When he landed at Calgary International Airport - the first stop on a 32 - city farewell tour - Emery and his wife Jodie where greeted by pot activists .
" I 'm being taken to a U.S. prison for something I did in Canada as innocuous as selling seeds which do n't even have any drug quality .
And yet , I have to face a five year term for that , '' he said .
" It 's difficult to say what will happen in a U.S. federal penitentiary , It 's never very pleasant .
American jails are n't run nearly as well as Canadian jails , '' he told a CTV News reporter .
Emery has been arrested more than a dozen in his 20 years of activism .
He 's on tour to bid farewell to his friends and encourage them to keep up the fight to legalize cannabis .
" I 'm going away for a long time so I expect everybody to do their best and pick up the slack for me , '' Emery said .
Calgary cannabis activist Keith Fagan says Emery 's farewell tour helps keep the issue in the public eye .
" It does help to get the message out there that Marc and I do n't agree on everything .
He is a smoke cannabis out in the public [ advocate ] and I 'm of course not .
But we still work together .
We 're still friends , '' Fagan said .
Emery wants activists to fight Bill C - 15 .
The federal bill will introduce mandatory minimum sentences for marijuana in Canada .
It has passed the House of Commons and it is currently before the Senate .
" Get rid of the Conservatives , I know that 's difficult in Alberta to even succeed in doing , let alone say , but that 's what 's required , '' Emery said .
Emery says the NDP , the Bloc , and the Green Party are all Cannabis - friendly political parties that activists should support .

One reason for limited savings in the first decade is that it would probably take a few years for copycat biologics to reach the market after the law was enacted .
Another factor is that biologics accounted for only 16 percent  about $ 46 billion  of total prescription drug spending last year , according to the market researchers IMS Health .
And pharmaceuticals represent only about 10 percent of the nation ’s overall health care spending .
The real savings might come more than 10 years out , as new biologic drugs appeared and as biologics represented an increasingly greater part of overall spending on drugs .
That ramp - up is already evident : Express Scripts , a pharmacy benefits manager , says its spending on biologics grew 10 percent last year , compared with 2.5 percent for other drugs .
But anyone expecting the price wars that ensue when generic pills come on the market  when prices often drop by more than 60 percent  might be disappointed by the way competition plays out in biologic drugs .
Because it is harder and costlier to make biologic drugs than it is to copy pills , fewer generic competitors are likely to enter the fray .
Many experts , including the Federal Trade Commission , expect price declines of more like 10 to 40 percent in biologics .
Even that would be a substantial savings for the overall health care system .
But for many individuals , a $ 35,000 copycat version of a $ 50,000 cancer drug would still be unaffordable .
Another factor is that generic biologics are likely to undergo greater regulatory scrutiny than generic pills require .
It is difficult or impossible to verify that a copy of a biologic is exactly the same as the original  which is why the drugs are often called “ biosimilars ” rather than generic biologics .
Because even small changes might affect the drug ’s safety or activity , it is likely that makers of biosimilars will have to conduct at least some clinical trials to win F.D.A. approval of their drugs , which makers of generic small - molecule pills are not required to do .
Such trials can cost a lot of money .
Cloud Computing
This year ’s overhyped IT concept is cloud computing .
Also called software as a service ( Saas ) , cloud computing is when you run software over the internet and access it via a browser .
The Salesforce.com customer management software is an example of this .
So is Google Docs .
If you believe the hype , cloud computing is the future .
But , hype aside , cloud computing is nothing new .
It ’s the modern version of the timesharing model from the 1960s , which was eventually killed by the rise of the personal computer .
It ’s what Hotmail and Gmail have been doing all these years , and it ’s social networking sites , remote backup companies , and remote email filtering companies such as MessageLabs .
Any IT outsourcing — network infrastructure , security monitoring , remote hosting — is a form of cloud computing .
The old timesharing model arose because computers were expensive and hard to maintain .
Modern computers and networks are drastically cheaper , but they ’re still hard to maintain .
As networks have become faster , it is again easier to have someone else do the hard work .
Computing has become more of a utility ; users are more concerned with results than technical details , so the tech fades into the background .
But what about security ?
Is n’t it more dangerous to have your email on Hotmail ’s servers , your spreadsheets on Google ’s , your personal conversations on Facebook ’s , and your company ’s sales prospects on salesforce .
com ’s ?
Well , yes and no .
IT security is about trust .
You have to trust your CPU manufacturer , your hardware , operating system and software vendors — and your ISP .
Any one of these can undermine your security : crash your systems , corrupt data , allow an attacker to get access to systems .
We ’ve spent decades dealing with worms and rootkits that target software vulnerabilities .
We ’ve worried about infected chips .
But in the end , we have no choice but to blindly trust the security of the IT providers we use .
Saas moves the trust boundary out one step further — you now have to also trust your software service vendors — but it does n’t fundamentally change anything .
It ’s just another vendor we need to trust .
There is one critical difference .
When a computer is within your network , you can protect it with other security systems such as firewalls and IDSs .
You can build a resilient system that works even if those vendors you have to trust may not be as trustworthy as you like .
With any outsourcing model , whether it be cloud computing or something else , you can ’t .
You have to trust your outsourcer completely .
You not only have to trust the outsourcer ’s security , but its reliability , its availability , and its business continuity .
You do n’t want your critical data to be on some cloud computer that abruptly disappears because its owner goes bankrupt .
You do n’t want the company you ’re using to be sold to your direct competitor .
You do n’t want the company to cut corners , without warning , because times are tight .
Or raise its prices and then refuse to let you have your data back .
These things can happen with software vendors , but the results are n’t as drastic .
There are two different types of cloud computing customers .
The first only pays a nominal fee for these services — and uses them for free in exchange for ads : e.g. , Gmail and Facebook .
These customers have no leverage with their outsourcers .
You can lose everything .
Companies like Google and Amazon wo n’t spend a lot of time caring .
The second type of customer pays considerably for these services : to Salesforce.com , MessageLabs , managed network companies , and so on .
These customers have more leverage , providing they write their service contracts correctly .
Still , nothing is guaranteed .
Trust is a concept as old as humanity , and the solutions are the same as they have always been .
Be careful who you trust , be careful what you trust them with , and be careful how much you trust them .
Outsourcing is the future of computing .
Eventually we ’ll get this right , but you do n’t want to be a casualty along the way .
This essay originally appeared in The Guardian .
EDITED TO ADD ( 6/4 ) : Another opinion .
EDITED TO ADD ( 6/5 ) : A rebuttal .
And an apology for the tone of the rebuttal .
The reason I am talking so much about cloud computing is that reporters and inverviewers keep asking me about it .
I feel kind of dragged into this whole thing .
EDITED TO ADD ( 6/6 ) :
At the Computers , Freedom , and Privacy conference last week , Bob Gellman said ( this , by him , is worth reading ) that the nine most important words in cloud computing are : “ terms of service , ” “ location , location , location , ” and “ provider , provider , provider ” — basically making the same point I did .
You need to make sure the terms of service you sign up to are ones you can live with .
You need to make sure the location of the provider does n’t subject you to any laws that you ca n’t live with .
And you need to make sure your provider is someone you ’re willing to work with .
Basically , if you ’re going to give someone else your data , you need to trust them .

BELFAST ( Reuters ) - Gangs of men have smashed windows and broken the doors of houses occupied by more than 100 Romanians in Belfast , forcing them to flee their homes .
Sectarian violence between pro-British Protestants and pro-Irish Catholics has been a feature of life in the British - controlled province of Northern Ireland for decades , but crime against immigrants from Eastern Europe has been rising .
“ I have no intention of staying in Northern Ireland .
I want to pack up and go back to Romania , ” Maria , one of the victims , told reporters .
She declined to give her last name but said she was acting as a spokeswoman for the group .
“ It has gone on for two weeks .
I have n’t had a week ’s sleep .
It is unbelievable what has happened . ”
The attacks on the Romanians -- including some being threatened at gunpoint -- follow rival fans clashing at a Northern Ireland - Poland World Cup qualifying soccer match in March , the same month two British soldiers and a policeman were killed in renewed attacks by pro-Irish militants .
Police said on Tuesday that they would be stepping up patrols but said they did not believe the attacks against the Romanians were organized .
“ All they want to do is return to Romania , that sends out a very negative message about Northern Ireland , ” Jeffrey Donaldson , a DUP junior minister told reporters .

“ Just as sectarianism in the past has been responsible for violence and division , we cannot allow racism to become the new sectarianism .
We want to leave that behind us . ”
Northern Ireland ’s Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the attacks were an affront to the vast majority of people in Belfast and called for the perpetrators to be punished .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown echoed his comments .
Police assisted support groups in moving the families to a church hall overnight and then to a leisure center , where the local community donated blankets , towels , food and milk .
Officials have helped them find other temporary accommodation .
Judo is derived from Jujutsu .
It was created by Professor Jigoro Kano who was born in Japan on October 28 , 1860 and who died May 4 , 1938 after a lifetime of promoting it .
Mastering several styles of jujutsu including Kito - Ryu and Tenjin - Shinyo Ryu in his youth he began to develop his own system based on modern sports principles .
In 1882 he founded the Kodokan Judo Institute in Tokyo where he began teaching and which still is the international authority .
The name Judo was chosen because it means the “ gentle or yielding way ” .
Kano emphasized the larger educational value of training in attack and defense so that it could be a path or way of life that all people could participate in and benefit from .
He eliminated some of the traditional jujutsu techniques and changed training methods so that most of the moves could be done with full force to create a decisive victory without injury .
The popularity of Judo increased dramatically after a famous contest hosted by the Tokyo police in 1886 where the Judo team defeated the most well - known jujutsu school of the time .
It then became a part of the Japanese physical education system and began its spread around the world .
Dr. Kano , President of the University of Education , Tokyo , dedicated his life , studied these ancient martial art of Jujutsu and integrated what he considered to be the best of their techniques into what is now the modern sport .
It is many things to different people .
It is a fun sport , an art , a discipline , a recreational or social activity , a fitness program , a means of self - defense or combat , and a way of life .
It is all of these and more .
It was introduced into the Olympic Games in 1964 and is practiced by millions of people throughout the world today .
People practice to excel in competition , to stay in shape , to develop self - confidence , and for many other reasons .
But most of all , people do Judo just for the fun of it .
JUDO IS FUN !
As in all sports , it has a strict set of rules that governs competition and ensures safety .
For those who want to test their skills , it offers the opportunity for competition at all skill levels , from club to national tournaments , to the Olympic Games .
There are separate weight divisions for men and women , and boys and girls .
It is best known for it ’s spectacular throwing techniques but also involves considerable grappling on the ground utilizing specialized pins , control holds , arm locks , and Judo choking techniques .
It emphasizes safety , and full physical activity for top conditioning .
It is learned on special mats for comfort and safety .
It is unique in that all age groups , both sexes , and most disabled persons can participate together in learning and practicing the sport .
It is an inexpensive , year - round activity , that appeals to people from all walks of life .
Many people over sixty years of age enjoy the sport , as well as very young boys and girls .
Judo develops self - discipline and respect for oneself and others .
It provides the means for learning self - confidence , concentration , and leadership skills , as well as physical coordination , power , and flexibility .
As a sport that has evolved from a fighting art , it develops complete body control , fine balance , and fast reflexive action .
Above all , it develops a sharp reacting mind well - coordinated with the same kind of body .
Training gives a person an effective self - defense system if the need arises .
It is often a part of the training done by athletes preparing for MMA matches .
THE JUDO RANK SYSTEM
It created the system of ranks , now used in most other martial arts , that recognize a person ’s degree of knowledge , ability , and leadership .
There are separate ranks for juniors ( under 17 ) and seniors .
Judo ranks are identified by colored belts , and ten degrees of advanced grades for black belts .
Regular advancement encourages students to achieve more .
PRINCIPLES AND GOALS OF JUDO
Judo , which is translated as the “ gentle way ” , teaches the principle of flexibility in the application of technique .
This is the flexible or efficient use of balance , leverage , and movement in the performance of Judo throws and other skills .
Skill , technique and timing , rather than the use of brute strength , are the essential ingredients for success .
For example , in classes you may learn how to give way , rather than use force , to overcome a stronger opponent .
The principles of Judo , such as “ Maximum Efficiency ” and “ Mutual Welfare and Benefit ” , can also be used in our dealings with others in life .
The ultimate goal is to develop oneself to the maximum extent possible , always striving for perfection , so that you can contribute something of value to the world .
Owner required : A blind border collie called Clyde who comes with his own guide dog ( called Bonnie )
Bonnie and Clyde do everything together , from walking and wagging to bounding and burying .
But Clyde is always just one faltering step behind .
That 's because he is blind - and his fellow border collie Bonnie acts as his guide dog .
She leads him to food or water , and lets him rest his head on her haunches when he feels a bit lost .
They are inseparable , and if Bonnie is n't nearby Clyde refuses to move a paw .
Partners in crime : Bonnie ( left ) and Clyde , who is blind , with Meadow Green Dog Rescue assistant Katie Duffy .
They need a new home , but must stay together
The pair were rescued as strays three weeks ago and are looking for a new home together .
Cherie Cootes , 40 , at the Meadow Green Dog Rescue Centre in Loddon , Norfolk , said : ' Clyde relies on Bonnie the whole time .
When she walks she tends to stop and make sure he 's there - she does look out for him .
They really are the most lovely pair of dogs .
' There 's absolutely no option of homing them separately , they have to go as a pair . '
Bonnie , two , and Clyde , five , were rescued after being abandoned on a street in the middle of a storm three weeks ago .
No one has claimed them .
Miss Cootes said they would make ideal pets in a home with a large , secure garden away from busy roads .
Waveney District Council placed the dogs , who have no identifying collars or chips , with the rescue centre but no owners have come forward to claim them .
Ms Cootes described the dogs as ' typical high - spirited collies ' and said they would make ideal pets in a home with a large , secure garden away from busy roads .
Bonnie , two , and Clyde , five , were rescued after being abandoned on a street in the middle of a storm three weeks ago
Long - haired border collie Clyde has a friendly face while short - haired Bonnie is much smaller .
' They 've got very nice manners and they walk well on the lead .
They really are a very sweet pair of dogs , ' Ms Cootes said .
' Clyde 's going to have to have a more rural type of home purely because of traffic .
It would be fantastic if someone had a large garden so he can have his exercise . '
Sue Cootes , 59 , who runs the rescue centre with her daughter Cherie , said it was incredible to see how Bonnie took care of Clyde .
' She 's a little darling and he just follows her everywhere , ' she said .
' It 's just instinctive with them to help each other and it 's marvellous to see animals doing this together .
' We get them outside and on walks as much as possible because Clyde may be blind but Bonnie certainly is n't .
We have large paddocks and they potter around together out there . '
The Cootes family took over the rescue centre five years ago and now look after 45 abandoned dogs .
Vicky Bell , a spokeswoman for Guide Dogs for the Blind Association , said she had never heard of a dog voluntarily acting as a guide dog for another dog .
' This is a very unusual case - it 's such a lovely story , ' she said .
' Some dogs take to guiding better than others because they naturally have the right temperament .
Unlike Oprah , Letterman Does Not Even Pretend to Like–Or Even Know–Twitter
Here ’s a priceless video segment from David Letterman ’s “ Late Show ” last night , as he is taught how to use Twitter by actor Kevin Spacey .
After asking how much it costs and noting that he could get anyone on Manhattan ’s 57th Street to say hello just as much as Spacey could get tweets from his 800,000 followers , Letterman officially declares Twitter a “ waste of time . ”
Perhaps so , but it also makes for great talk - show schtick .

For the first time , the Federal Trade Commission is shuttering an internet service provider it alleges , " recruits , knowingly hosts , and actively participates in the distribution of illegal , malicious and harmful electronic content " such as botnets and child porn .
The company , doing business as 3 fn. net and APS Telecom , " actively recruited " to its hosting service thousands of " rogue " and " black hat " web sites distributing " illegal , malicious , and harmful electronic content including child pornography , spyware , viruses , trojan horses , phishing , botnet command and control servers , and pornography featuring violence , bestiality , and incest . "
A San Jose , California federal judge , responding to the FTC 's lawsuit , has ordered ( .pdf ) upstream internet providers and data centers to stop servicing the company , also known as Pricewert , which is based in Oregon .
Its operators live in Belize .
The company had thousands of servers in the San Jose area .
Many of the thousands of sites it hosted were based in Russia , where admins on Thursday were scrambling to resume service .
The complaint alleges Pricewert officials helped its member sites create and configure botnets .
According to the FTC 's lawsuit , ( .pdf ) the company " hosts very little legitimate content and vast quantities of illegal , malicious , and harmful content , including child pornography , botnet command and control servers , spyware , viruses , trojans , phishing - related sites , illegal online pharmacies , investment and other web - based scams , and pornography featuring violence , bestiality , and incest . "
The lawsuit alleges that Pricewert " actively shields its criminal clientele by either ignoring take - down requests issued by the online security community or shifting its criminal clients to other internet protocol addresses controlled by Pricewert so that they may evade detection . "
Commission chairman Jonathon Leibowitz told the Washington Post that " Anything bad on the internet , they were involved in it . "

AROUND 20 retired gardai are still living in their old stations with the full permission of the force .
The gardai have refused to say who pays the lighting , heating , electricity and rent bills on behalf of retired gardai living in the stations , which are owned by the Office of Public Works .
The nationwide practice has never come to public attention before .
But the focus on the country 's garda stations has intensified following the recommendation of An Bord Snip Nua that half of them should be scrapped to save money .
The Office of Public Works confirmed there were about 20 cases of retired gardai living in state accommodation out of a total of 703 garda stations .
It is not known whether these stations are still open to the public , through having a serving garda on site , as is the case with the station in Ballyferriter , Co Kerry -- which is opened for a few hours a day by a garda based in Dingle .
Traditionally , gardai move out of a station immediately after their retirement , so that a new member can replace them .
But it appears that there have been exceptions to this rule in small " one- man " rural stations , where the replacement garda may prefer to live away from an ageing garda station .
Every rank - and - file garda gets an untaxed rent allowance payment of € 4,162 per year , even if they are living in their own house .
An OPW spokesman said the responsibility for asking retired members to leave the stations lay with An Garda Siochana .
" It 's their process to tell the guard to move on , or out of the way , before we would even try to go into a legal element to progress it , " he said .
Garda management has provided the OPW with a list of the 20 or so stations which are still being occupied by retired gardai , but has given no indication , so far , that it is preparing to ask the occupants to leave .
It is understood that , in some cases , retired gardai have offered to make a payment but were turned down by the force .
Accepted
Garda Representative Association president Michael O'Boyce said he was aware of a number of situations where retired gardai were living in station accommodation , but he had never had any complaints about it .
" My understanding was that they remained on because no one asked them to leave . "
Mr O'Boyce said this was probably because no garda asked to move into the station .
" Whoever was responsible says , ' Well if there 's no one looking for it , I 'm not going to be the one who goes knocking ' . "
The Garda Press Office did not wish to comment further when provided with questions .

El jugador estadounidense Jimmy Conrad habló en su cuenta en Twitter contra el " Vasco " Aguirre
Después del medio día de hoy , Conrad , bajó el comentario de la red social
México y Estados Unidos compartieron avión rumbo a Nueva York
Aún no silban el inicio de la Final de la Copa Oro y Estados Unidos ya hizo el primer embate contra la Selección Mexicana .
Jimmy Conrad , quien suele jugar como lateral derecho en la defensa estadounidense , fungió este día como el “ creativo ” que originó la primera ofensiva americana y en la que paradójicamente , el agraviado fue alguien que ni siquiera está dentro del terreno de juego : el “ Vasco ” Javier Aguirre .
Mediante una cuenta en twitter que está registrada con el nombre de Jimmy e incluso tiene la foto del jugador de la Selección de Estados Unidos , Conrad redactó este jueves que a su equipo le tocaría compartir el avión con el representativo mexicano rumbo a Nueva York , donde se disputará el domingo la Final de la Copa Oro 2009 , pero el hecho le provocaba un severo temor ... que el “ Vasco ” intentara patearlo a su paso .
Si Javier creía que la polémica por la patada que le propinó al jugador al panameño Ricardo Phillips se había acabado está muy equivocado , ya que Conrad se echó la puntada de recordarle al estratega el detallito , justo a unas horas de que Aguirre regrese al área técnica a dirigir a sus muchachos tras tres juegos de suspensión .
“ Apparently , we ’re sharing a plane with the Mexican National Team .
I hope the Mexico coach does n’t kick me when I walk past him in the aisle ” , se puede leer en la cuenta de twitter de conrad .
Traducido al castellano , la frase dice algo así como “ aparentemente , vamos a compartir el vuelo con la Selección Mexicana .
Espero que el entrenador de México no me patee cuando pase junto a él en el pasillo ” .
Si Aguirre no contemplaba ya la opción de agredir a un jugador , tal vez con esta primera embestida vuelva a considerarlo , después de todo el “ Vasco ” y Conrad compartirán la banda derecha el próximo en la Final de la Copa Oro 2009 .
Errol Morris 's unique documentary dramatically re-enacts the crime scene and investigation of a police officer 's murder in Dallas , Texas .
Briefly , a drifter ( Randall Adams ) ran out of gas and was picked up by a 16 - year - old runaway ( David Harris ) .
Later that night , they drank some beer , smoked some marijuana , and went to the movies .
Then , their stories diverged .
Adams claimed that he left for his motel , where he was staying with his brother , and went to sleep .
Harris , however , said that they were stopped by police late that night , and Adams suddenly shot the officer approaching their car .
The film shows the audience the evidence gathered by the police , who were under extreme pressure to clear the case .
It strongly makes a point that the circumstantial evidence was very flimsy .
In fact , it becomes apparent that Harris was a much more likely suspect and was in the middle of a crime spree , eventually ending up on Death Row himself for the later commission of other crimes .
Morris implies ... Written by Tad Dibbern < DIBBERN_D@a1.mscf.upenn.edu >
Thousands of politicians and celebrities were allegedly targeted The publisher of the News of the World paid £ 1 m in court costs after its journalists were accused of involvement in phone tapping , it has been claimed .
The Guardian says three cases were settled out of court after journalists allegedly hired private investigators who obtained the information illegally .
It claims News Group paid £ 700,000 in damages and costs to the head of the professional footballers ' association .
News International told the paper the case " means nothing to anyone here " .
A spokesman said : " This particular case means nothing to anyone here , and I 've talked to all the people who would be involved . "
The BBC has yet to receive a response from News International .
Mobile phones
The Guardian claims up to 3,000 high - profile figures were targeted including model Elle Macpherson , former deputy prime minister John Prescott and the publicist Max Clifford .
The News of the World editor at the time , Andy Coulson , said : " This story relates to an alleged payment made after I left the News of the World two and a half years ago .
I have no knowledge whatsoever of any settlement with Gordon Taylor . "
A lot of the stories in the paper were coming from information that was highly private
John Prescott Mr Coulson , now the Conservative Party communications director , declined to comment further .
A spokeswoman for David Cameron said the Conservative leader was " very relaxed " about the story .
" The ramping up of this story is ridiculous - this is about a payment made well after Andy ( Coulson ) left the News of the World , " she said .
The Guardian says evidence alleging journalists used investigators to hack into the mobile phone messages and voicemails of numerous public figures was presented in High Court proceedings .
It claims the investigators went in search of information such as bank statements and tax records .
Mr Prescott told the BBC he had not been told his phone may have been tapped .
" I had no evidence of this though frankly , a lot of the stories in the paper were coming from information that was highly private , " he said .
" It 's quite staggering really . "
Police investigation Former Labour home secretary Charles Clarke said the allegations were " sensational " .
" If they are true , the behaviour of News International and some of its senior executives is disappointing , immoral and probably illegal , " he said .
John Whittingdale , Conservative chairman of the Commons culture committee , said it would consider the alleged revelations tomorrow .
" I have to say I 'm extremely surprised if it is the case that a payment of a million pounds has been made by News International to people who allegedly have had their phones intercepted by an investigator , " he said .
" We were given an absolute assurance when we carried out an inquiry that only one journalist on News of the World had any knowledge of interceptions - Clive Goodman , " he said .
Two years ago , Goodman , the News of the World 's royal reporter , was jailed after pleading guilty to hacking into the phone messages of royal staff .
A private investigator was also jailed and Mr Coulson resigned but he denied being aware of what was going on .
The Guardian now says it has evidence of repeated involvement by the group 's journalists in illegal activity , which could open the way for police inquiries and legal action by the victims .
A Met Police spokesman said an investigation had been carried out into the alleged unlawful interception of telephone calls .
" Two people were charged and subsequently convicted and jailed .
We are not prepared to comment further , " he said .

Advertisement A cat has become such a well - known user of a Devon bus service that its drivers know where to let him off .
Casper has been queuing with other passengers to get the number three service from his home in Plymouth for months , bus company First said .
It added that he often sat in the queue and then quietly padded on board and curled up on a seat for the ride .
Casper 's owner Susan Finden , 55 , who picked him from a rescue home in 2002 , said he had always been a free spirit .
Mrs Finden said she named her pet after Casper the Friendly Ghost , as he has a habit of wandering off .
I do n't know what the attraction is but he loves big vehicles like lorries and buses
Owner Susan Finden
A spokesman for First said that drivers had been bussing Casper around for months , but Mrs Finden said she had only just found out about his use of public transport .
The care worker said : " He 'd always go off and have a wander .
" Once I had to walk a mile - and - a - half with a cat basket to bring him back from a car park .
" He does love people , and I do n't know what the attraction is but he loves big vehicles like lorries and buses . "
A notice has been put up by First in the bus drivers ' rest room in Plymouth bus station asking them to look after the rogue passenger if they spot him sneaking on board .

Because you have me figured out ?
You do n't think they will be show trials ?
That is the point of them .
Read the article .
The disappointment the AG felt when public sentiment did n't swell in favor of prosecution even after the memos he fought hard to get released were released .
I mean he actually celebrated at their release and sat back and waited only to be disappointed .
I want the trials , show or not .
I am not being snide when I say bring it on .
I do n't think they will turn out the way the left imagines , anymore than they did for the right when they went after Clinton .
But I 'm willing to roll the dice in order to know for sure who knew what and when .
I just hope Pelosi 's face does n't crack under the pressure .

Comment # 10 ..... geez Axey ....
Comparing putting the POTUS on trial for lying about a sex act and the Bushies crimes against humanity , the Geneva convention and U.S. law
only that could come from a right winger ...
you guys amaze me .
What Holder has reasserted is the independence of the AG 's office .
The Attorney General of the United States is being returned to an impartial , independent unit of the Federal government ... after 6 - 7 years of being the lap dog of the Bush administration under Alberto Gonzalez ....
The AG 's office wo n't be politically motivated and do " show trials " ... they 'll investigate and prosecute violations of U.S. law .
To quote the article directly ...
" [ I ] n late June Holder asked an aide for a copy of the CIA inspector general 's thick classified report on interrogation abuses .
He cleared his schedule and , over two days , holed up alone in his Justice Depart ment office , immersed himself in what Dick Cheney once referred to as " the dark side . "
He read the report twice , the first time as a lawyer , looking for evidence and instances of transgressions that might call for prosecution .
The second time , he started to absorb what he was reading at a more emotional level .
He was " shocked and saddened , " he told a friend , by what government servants were alleged to have done in America 's name . "
So Axey ... all you get from that is " show trial " ?

http://www.huffingtonpos...ledged-cia_n_228321.html
To my political understanding ... I understand Holder feeling he needs popular political backing ( the people ) to prosecute ... Obama has already wimped out on pursuing this ... It seems Holder feels as the top law enforcer in the Federal government he 's duty bound to prosecute ; despite Obama 's squeamish actions .
I for one say that Mr. Holder should hear from us so he 'll know that prosecutions is what the public wants .

He admitted that the CIA lied about interrogation techniques ?
I missed that .
As you said , as the top law enforcer in the Federal government he 's duty bound to prosecute .
But who will he prosecute ?
Will you be satisfied if he only prosecutes some lowly agent that " ... had gone far beyond what had been authorized in the legal opinions issued by the Justice Department " ?
Were you satisfied that Fitzgerald only got Libby on perjury charges ?
And that the actually person who leaked Plame 's name , Armitage , never saw the inside of a courtroom or the scorn he deserved ?
I know when the right began their witch hunt against the Clintons , they did n't expect to end up with perjury charges about sex .
I know the left was looking to see Cheney and Rove frog marched out of the WH .
It 's the old be careful what you wish for that I was expressing earlier , not a comparison of Clinton 's show trial with the ones the AG is on the verge of .

Axey -
As is consistent with the feelings of most posters here on BB , if there are any Congressional Democrats who have been involved in any ordering of illegal acts , any cover - up of illegal acts , any ' turning away from ' knowledge of illegal acts , I hope they are investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent .
I no more want Obama to think he can subvert the law than I did Bush .
Wanting to know the truth and wanting our government to obey our laws , this is not a partisan desire .
Democrats are responsible for their own spinelessness in the face of the crimes of the Bush Administration , and I hope that a good number of them are challenged and replaced in the next election cycle ... not with Republicans of course , but if it were up to me , it would n't be with Democrats either .
I 'd prefer a good liberal independent mix .

What Holder has reasserted is the independence of the AG 's office .
Well , I think that 's too strong a characterization there .
He has mentioned it , and stated he 's leaning toward asserting it , while griping about not having the political cover that he actually has , so I would caution you to remember to separate what these people only say from what they actually do .
I make a point of this only because I 've witnessed Democrats repeatedly coming out with these teases , much ballyhooed by the people out here panting for something like our country back , and bubkes has come of it every single time .
This NEWSWEEK piece is almost certainly as " independent " as Holder is going to get .
Blood is dripping out of my ears from having to see the piece instead of the fucking prosecutor .
So do n't take my ire as directed at you .
It 's directed at our broken and corrupt government ... at the lot of them .

Re : Axey # 19 Actually , if the probe uncovers Democratic lawbreakers and does n't do likewise for Bush and Cheney ( I find that prospect to be highly unlikely ) I would take that over nothing .
I 'll lean towards some justice rather than no justice .

Almost .

Yours is probably the more reasonable expectation .
Despite my growing daily disappoitment with Obama , I 'm still in the hopeful mode that he or someone in his administration will do the right thing .
Admittedly Obama sold me on his " change we can believe in " .
So I 'm giving this issue of torture prosecutions for the Bushies a " puncher 's chance " ... although your assesment is very likely what the out come will look like ...
But hey I can hope though ; huh ?

The Manhattan Institute could n't find anybody less sickening to represent them ?
The Newsweek article says that a torture investigation may hurt Obama 's domestic priorities , including health care .
Let it !
We all know that under the present system , health care is going nowhere .
If heads start rolling on capitol hill , we may get something that resembles health care later .
If we do n't prosecute these torture crimes , we do n't deserve health care ; it just makes my generation look like we only care about ourselves and that is n't true .
A great many of us have wanted justice too , and worked very hard for it .

Axey ... you 're conflating the issue yet again ...
In comment # 39 you 're conflating " rendition " with torture .
Rendition or it 's legality is n't the topic or focus on the article this discussion .
The heading says ...
" NEWSWEEK : Holder ' May be on Verge ' of Torture Probe "
Not rendition probe .
Your comment # 40 is also extremely deflecting from the issue at hand .
You see Axey ; Torture did n't happen until the W Bush administration ( at least not with offical illegale sanctions ) .
It is that administration that sanctioned and executed those illegalites .
An admitted 185 times .
That 's the issue , should those acts which occured between Jan 21 , 2001 and Jan. 21 , 2009 be prosecuted .
Your deflection of " Clinton and others did it too " is pretty funny actually .... seems right wingers love to blame Clinton for their own shortcomings .

I have more respect for someone who owns the harsh interrogations than someone who farmed it out where real torture took place .
And you would too if you were honest about why you want these show trials .
What happened to the party of " personal responsility "
As I said , Bush owned it .
You want to give Holder a pass ?
I do n't .
This is the same man that had no problem allowing suspected terrorists to be taken , by the same CIA he is now wanting to investigate , to Egyptian prisons to be interrogated / tortured .

No Rendition is an unAmerican , terrible program in my opinion .
But that is beside the point in this case .
If you read the article that this thread is commenting on you 'll see ...
" Holder began to review those policies in April .
As he pored over reports and listened to briefings , he became increasingly troubled .
There were startling indications that some interrogators had gone far beyond what had been authorized in the legal opinions issued by the Justice Department , which were themselves controversial .
He told one intimate that what he saw " turned my stomach . "
It was soon clear to Holder that he might have to launch an investigation to determine whether crimes were committed under the Bush administration and prosecutions warranted .
The obstacles were obvious .
For a new administration to reach back and investigate its predecessor is rare , if not unprecedented . "
Holder is n't questioning how those prisoners got there ... He was concerned about their TREATMENT while in our custody .
That is the issue , not rendition .
Again I say , I despise rendition , but in this discussion rendition is n't the issue .
Talking about torture and rendition ... 2 different vile animals .

No .
Talking about the same thing .
Are Holder 's hands clean because he did n't sign off on the actual interrogation techniques that would be used in those countries ?
If you want to prosecute someone whose hands are dirty when it comes to actual torture , then Holder is your man .
If you are just looking for Bush blood , and you are , then I suspect you 'll get your wish .
Obama 's approval ratings along with his policies , are tanking .
The " rogue " AG is a nice touch , though .

Axey ... here 's the difference ... rendition and torture ...
http://www.brookings.edu.../2007/1019rendition.aspx
" 4 . Rendition is just a euphemism for outsourcing torture .
Well , not historically .
The guidelines for Clinton - era renditions required that subjects could be sent only to countries where they were not likely to be tortured --- countries that gave assurances to that effect and whose compliance was monitored by the State Department and the intelligence community .
It 's impossible to be certain that those standards were upheld every time , but serious efforts were made to see that they were .
At a minimum , countries with indisputably lousy human rights records ( say , Syria ) were off - limits .
Another key difference : Renditions before Bush were carried out to disrupt terrorist activity , not to gather intelligence or interrogate individuals .
Now , though , the Bush team seems to have dramatically eroded such safeguards .
The administration has apparently sent someone to Syria , and Khaled el - Masri , a German citizen , was evidently boosted in Macedonia and interrogated in Afghanistan in a manner that sure sounds like torture .
In light of this and other revelations , the criticism that the administration has " defined down " torture looks pretty persuasive .
It 's probably a good bet that Congress or the next administration will reform the program , or abolish it outright
" Rendition has been used as far back as Reagan ... it was a tool in fighting terrorism .
It did n't include torure ; or at least not torture sanctioned by the WhiteHouse illegally .
It 's not the taking of those suspects that is the issue ... it was their treatment while in our custody .

You can't snake out of torture and hold this administration accountable for it , too .

We have prosecuted , executed , others for doing the same things we have been doing .
The entire world agrees they are crimes of the highest order and if they do not get prosecuted here , we do not have our country back .
We have fascist Italy and Germany .
Have a listen to this quick [ half hour ] history lesson , and tell me if it does n't sound entirely too familiar .
To be a rule of law nation , instead of a fascist nation , you have to prosecute the elite equally with the proletariat , and failing to prosecute them for war crimes , you might agree , makes us , beyond question , a fascist state .
This partisan squabbling is sickening .
Anyone trying to excuse anyone for torture is sickening .

They should be prosecuted if they tortured or renditioned for torture .
Period .
And if you think you 've got your country , you obviously do n't mind oligarchy , corporatism , fascism .
You want to be a friend of the State and let them off the hook for crimes , salute them for their crimes , argue in favor of their immunity from the Rule of Law .
You want the plutocrats to take all the wealth from the people , and let them go jobless , homeless and starve if they can't keep up on the few cents an hour someone is willing to pay for their labor .
THAT is what your country is , and THAT is what the United States was founded to prevent .
THAT is what our troops have died to prevent since the inception of this country .
If you want to protest that this is not true , that you are not a fascist sympathizer , or partisan about the application of the law , then you can't insist Holder be held to account unless you cede that everyone from the last administration be held to account as well .

Ca n't you see that it does n't matter if it 's a Republican fascism or a Democratic fascism ?
If it 's fascism , and it is , it 's not American .
We either fix it or give up .
I suppose if you 're making over a quarter million dollars a year or have many millions in the bank you might be on the side of not bothering to fix it ... but that means you should n't be bothering to argue with people here , or anywhere else .
You 're just causing the process to drag out .
But doing it for a penny or a nickel or a dime or a quarter or even a dollar a post is n't going to get you anywhere either , or your kids , or your grandkids .

99 is spot on as usual .
I do n't give a rat 's ass what party is behind sanctioning torture , or rendition for torture for that matter .
Those who ordered rendition for captives who were then tortured , I believe these people are culpable and should be held to account .
I would like to hold Holder himself to account in this , and if a special prosecutor includes Holder 's directives under Clinton in any investigation , then Holder himself should be indicted , and if we have to drag Clinton , Bush Sr. , and dig up the corpse of Reagan then I 'm willing to go the distance .
The fabric of our constitutional representative government is severely frayed , and I think that a full accounting of crime and application of justice is the only thing that can right this sinking ship .
And quite frankly I do n't think any of us are fully prepared for what overturning that stone will shed light on , regardless of how loony left or wingnut right we may be .
But the stone must be lifted nonetheless .
Consider it akin to a 12 - step program for addiction .
You have to hit rock bottom before you realize you need help .
We are institutionally " addicted " to war , torture , militarism , and all other kinds of heinous crimes - economic , environmental , whatever .
We have to fundamentally reconsider our course as a nation , what it means to be American , what rights and responsibilities we have to humanity .
I see this as a glimmer of hope in that direction , but it will assuredly get far uglier in terms of what we know than it is right now .

The amazing thing about Google is how a business that makes 97 percent of its revenue selling advertising has people convinced that it is a technology company .
And then gets a free pass despite a series of failures outside its core competencies in search and online ad sales .
Right now , Google seems to be flooding the market with products that are not quite finished .
People do not care because the products work well enough and are free .
But , suppose people had to pay for them ?
Then where would Google be ?
( See Related : Top 10 Google Flubs , Flops , and Failures )
Even though Chrome will be a " free " OS , it will still come loaded on a computer people well be asked to spend perhaps $ 300 to $ 400 to purchase .
That puts Google under real pressure to perform , something it has never really faced .
Google 's Android smartphone OS is well - liked by some and seems to be gaining acceptance , even though its yet to prove itself with paying customers .
My impression is that Android will ultimately demonstrate the importance of controlling both hardware and software if you want smartphone success .
Apple , RIM , and Palm have that control , while Google and Microsoft do not .
Besides selling ads and providing search results , what successes has Google actually had in the technology space ?
There 's , er , and , uh , and then what ?
OK , Gmail , but it relies on ad sales tied to content , making it an extension of the core search business .
Gmail does , however , demonstrate that Google is technically more than competent and is capable of real innovation .
Nevertheless , its ability to turn innovation into profits remains tied to ad sales .
Based on results so far , there is little reason to believe Google can make its Chrome OS into the world - changer most everyone already seems to believe it will become .
It may happen , and I would welcome it , but it is not a foregone conclusion .
Google 's applications have n't done terribly well ( especially in attracting paying customers ) , its ventures into selling radio , newspaper , and television advertising have run aground , it 's first adventure into operating systems is moving slowly , and now it 's going head - to - head with Microsoft on netbooks ?
If any other company were doing this , we would say they were daft .
However , being the darling that it is , Google 's Chrome OS is already being treated as a foregone success .
Maybe that will happen .
But , unless Chrome is dramatically more successful than all the Linux - based operating systems that have come before , there is n't a lot of reason to believe Chrome will do more than force netbook pricing concessions from Microsoft .
If that .
My hunch is that Google will manage to get Chrome OS onto a bunch of netbooks and then hit a brick wall of unfulfilled customer expectation , at least initially , because the infrastructure does n't exist to support a mostly web - based computing experience .
The counter argument is that the iPhone has managed to become a real computing platform that , if run on a netbook , could actually get a lot of work done .
Provided people are willing to accept its limitations .
So , if you 're willing to accept a netbook that is able to do whatever Chrome OS can manage , then you 're set .
If , however , you expect a netbook to do what your laptop does , only smaller and less expensively , then you will be disappointed and buy Windows instead of Chrome .
The move to cloud - based computing makes a lot of sense and I am a supporter , but still believe a hybrid computing experience that includes both installed and online applications makes the most sense for most users right now and , probably , for years to come .
To me , that says Windows today and maybe another OS someday , but not right away .
Nevertheless , we have to take Google very seriously .
By decoupling its technology investments from the need to actually produce profits , Google has an ocean of money to spend in search of its next big thing and little pressure for an immediate return on that investment .
Nevertheless , Google has made a number of bets , only a few of them successful , while many more remain in play .
While definitely the most interesting company in technology , Google is not software or online services company in the traditional sense .
That is both Google 's strength and its weakness .

Still , something like the Dalton Minimum  two solar cycles in the early 1800s that peaked at about an average of 50 sunspots  lies in the realm of the possible , Dr. Hathaway said .
( The minimums are named after scientists who helped identify them : Edward W. Maunder and John Dalton . )
With better telescopes on the ground and a fleet of Sun- watching spacecraft , solar scientists know a lot more about the Sun than ever before .
But they do not understand everything .
Solar dynamo models , which seek to capture the dynamics of the magnetic field , cannot yet explain many basic questions , not even why the solar cycles average 11 years in length .
Image ANOTHER VIEW
These photographs show an ultraviolet view of the Sun on the same days : July 19 , 2000 , left , and March 18 , 2009 , right .
Most solar physicists do not think anything odd is going on with the Sun. Credit ...
NASA
Predicting the solar cycle is , in many ways , much like predicting the stock market .
A full understanding of the forces driving solar dynamics is far out of reach , so scientists look to key indicators that correlate with future events and create models based on those .
For example , in 2006 , Dr. Hathaway looked at disturbances in the Earth 's magnetic field that are caused by the Sun , and they were strong .
During past cycles , strong disturbances at minimum indicated strong fields all over the Sun at maximum and a bounty of sunspots .
Because the previous cycles had been shorter than average , Dr. Hathaway thought the next one would be shorter and thus solar minimum was imminent .
He predicted the new solar cycle would be a ferocious one , consistent with a short cycle .
Instead , the new cycle did not arrive as quickly as Dr. Hathaway anticipated , and the disturbances weakened .
His revised prediction is for a smaller - than - average maximum .
Last November , it looked like the new cycle was finally getting started , with the new cycle sunspots in the middle latitudes outnumbering the old sunspots of the dying cycle that are closer to the equator .
After a minimum , solar activity usually takes off quickly , but instead the Sun returned to slumber .
“ There was a long lull of several months of virtually no activity , which had me worried , ” Dr. Hathaway said .
While the plastic surgery perk does not appear to have been embraced in other European countries , in the Czech Republic — which has an obsession for female beauty pageants and where decades of communism shielded the Czechs from the political correctness that has prevailed in the west — the offer of free tummy tucks or remodeled breasts is considered by many of both sexes to be a generous inducement no different from offering a free trip to the Bahamas .
Jiri Schweitzer , managing director of Iscare , the private surgery clinic where Ms. Kalivodova works as a surgical nurse , said there was nothing sexist about helping women look beautiful .
He said that after months of struggling to attract qualified nurses , the plastic surgery offer had helped increase applications by 10 percent over the past three months .
Under the incentive plan at Iscare , nurses can choose from an assortment of cosmetic surgical procedures , ranging from a € 1,425 tummy tuck to a € 1,300 face lift , in return for signing a three - year contract .
Mr. Schweitzer said the cost of the surgical makeovers was less expensive than raising overall salaries .
Of the 50 nurses working at the clinic , Mr. Schweitzer said 10 had opted for plastic surgery , while several more were considering it .
One male doctor is also looking at getting liposuction .
The incentive , Mr. Schweitzer added , had proven to be far more popular than the free German lessons .
“ It helps to improve the morale of both our employees and our patients , ” he said .
He noted that the need to recruit nurses to staff the plastic surgery department had become particularly acute because of a surge in demand for cosmetic procedures by women who said they hoped to improve their job prospects during the financial crisis .
That contrasts with the trend across the Atlantic , where a recent report by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons noted that the recession had contributed to a nine percent decrease in plastic surgery procedures last year in the United States , including declines in breast augmentation , liposuction , eyelid surgery and tummy tucks .
Irena Pejznochova , spokeswoman of the Czech Nurses Association , said she saw nothing wrong with hospitals offering free plastic surgery .
“ There is nothing degrading in this kind of benefit , ” she said .
Our brains can rewire themselves in just seconds to compensate for a break in incoming data , suggesting they are even more flexible than previously thought .
We already knew that the brain is constantly adapting throughout our lives , for example by generating new neurons well into adulthood .
But just how quickly can it adapt – and does it always involve creating new circuits ?
To investigate these questions , Daniel Dilks and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology took advantage of the blind spots that occur naturally in our eyes where the optic nerve exits the retina .
The brain normally combines images captured by both eyes to fill in the resulting gaps in vision , but Dilks prevented this in 48 volunteers by patching one eye .
Blind shapes
After identifying where the blind spot was for each volunteer ’s other eye , he then presented an image of a square right next to it .
The volunteers initially saw a square , but reported that within seconds it had morphed into a rectangle , by extending its edge into the blind spot .
Advertisement
The change in what the volunteers saw was so fast , Dilks says , that it must be due to the brain redirecting signals through pre-existing circuits rather than forging new connections .
The team concludes that the neurons which would normally fill the blind spot using data from the patched eye compensated by stealing data from neighbouring neurons that were “ seeing ” the square , making it appear like a rectangle .

Cronkite Called War " Illegal from the Start , " Slammed Network Silence and Would 've Spoken Out Again from Anchor Desk
Walter Cronkite believed his " proudest " moment as a journalist occurred when he told the nation that the Vietnam War was unwinnable , despite rosy rhetoric from the Johnson White House and Defense Department .
Following his death last week , various network news tributes replayed footage of Cronkite 's influential ' 68 on - air editorial .
Yet scrubbed from the memorializing were similar instances of Cronkite 's journalistic candor regarding Iraq , such as his 2006 call for withdrawal from a war he went on to describe as " illegal from the start , " initiated on " false pretenses " and a " terrible disaster " serving " no purpose " that has " probably made us less safe . "
But the most revealing omission from these tributes -- especially in context to the pageant of eulogies extolling Cronkite 's journalistic integrity -- may be his response to a reporter 's question during a 2006 news conference .
As reported in The Independent UK at the time :
When a reporter asked [ Cronkite ] whether , given the chance , he would offer similar advice on Iraq [ as he had on Vietnam ] , he did not even wait until the end of the question .
" Yes , " he said flatly .
" It 's my belief that we should get out now . "
For Cronkite , the question was simple , his answer emphatic .
No need to chew it over , to seek a mealy - mouthed moderate reaction to address the Bush administration 's unprecedented extremism , brutality and lawlessness .
Doing so would mean that he was operating within their narrative , not his .
It was at this same conference that Cronkite said , " The editorializing that I did on the Tet Offensive in Vietnam and I think helped speed the end of that war , that was — that I 'm proudest of . "
Six weeks later , when asked if his words about the Iraq War would have the same effect as his statement to the nation on Vietnam , he demurred , " Well , I think it 's a little late for that now . "
But then he added , " I would like to think it would be helpful in getting us out of there .
Anybody who can put another match to that fire , to get us out would be , I think , welcome . "
But he certainly was n't holding his breath for any of his network news heirs to strike another match .
As The Nation journalist John Nichols reported last Friday :
As the war in Iraq went horribly awry , I asked Cronkite whether a network anchorman would dare speak out in the same way that he had ?
" I think it could happen , yes .
I do n't think it 's likely to happen , " he said with an audible sigh .
" I think the three networks are still hewing pretty much to that theory .
They do n't even do analysis anymore , which I think is a shame .
They do n't even do background .
They just seem to do headlines , and the less important it seems the more likely they are to get on the air . "
Nichols also asked Cronkite if he thought he would have spoken out against the Iraq War if he were still an anchorman .
Cronkite 's reply is not only , once again , unequivocal but a desperately needed correction to the warped view of journalistic principles that permeate today 's network newsrooms , a sane and responsible recalibration of the meaning of " fair and balanced . "
" Yes , yes I do .
I think that right now it would be critical to do so , " he told me a few months after the invasion in 2003 .
" I think that right now we are in one of the most dangerous periods in our existence .
Not since the Civil War has the state of our democracy been so doubtful .
Our foreign policy has taken a very strange turn .
And I do think I would try to say something about that . "
Nichols reported as well that Cronkite was concerned " that broadcast news -- his medium -- had grown too deferrent [ sic ] to power , too stenographic , too consolidated . "
In his post " Celebrating Cronkite While Ignoring What He Did , " Salon 's Glenn Greenwald rightly criticizes the procession of network news stars who praised Cronkite 's career but have failed to adhere to Cronkite 's journalistic standards and to reflect on the consequential glaring shortcomings of their own performance or that of their colleagues .
Underscoring the widespread abdication of traditional , democratic journalistic principles from network news coverage , Greenwald juxtaposes Cronkite 's on - air Vietnam moment with a quote by Meet the Press moderator and former Bush 43 White House correspondent David Gregory 's 2008 statement deflecting criticism :
" The Vietcong did not win by a knockout [ in the Tet Offensive ] , but neither did we .
The referees of history may make it a draw .
. . .
We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders , both in Vietnam and Washington , to have faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest clouds .
. . .
" For it seems now more certain than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate .
. . .
To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe , in the face of the evidence , the optimists who have been wrong in the past " -- Walter Cronkite , CBS Evening News , February 27 , 1968 .
" I think there are a lot of critics who think that [ in the run-up to the Iraq War ] . . . . if we did not stand up and say this is bogus , and you 're a liar , and why are you doing this , that we did n't do our job .
I respectfully disagree .
It 's not our role " -- David Gregory , MSNBC , May 28 , 2008 .
If reporting facts , providing substantive context and telling us when our elected officials are lying is not Gregory and his colleagues ' role , then I respectfully suggest another title : public relations officer ( PRO ) .
The acronym seems fitting as well .
Incidentally , Cronkite also cautioned America about invading Iraq from the beginning .
Another Iraq War- related casualty in the recreation of Uncle Walter 's journey .
Just as the war was under way , Cronkite spoke at a Drew University forum , where , as reported in the Daily Record , he said " he feared the war would not go smoothly , ripped the ' arrogance ' of Bush and his administration and wondered whether the new U.S. doctrine of ' pre- emptive war ' might lead to unintended , dire consequences . "
And that 's the way it was .

Editor 's Note : Some additional must - read news and views on Cronkite :
Chad at BuzzFlash informs me that Cronkite 's " speaking out for democracy when he could have played it safe " after retirement is what earned him a BuzzFlash Wings of Justice Award .
Reese Erlich reveals Cronkite 's " prescient " views on the then pending Iraq War in " Opinions Walter Cronkite Never Aired " at Truthdig ( h/t Jon at Common Dreams ) , in which Erlich cites excerpts from an unpublished interview he did with Cronkite in 2002 .
Norman Solomon punctures the myth that Cronkite was always " a courageous truth - teller " in his article " Beyond the Hype : Cronkite and the Vietnam War . "
From time to time , I bet , a cable news anchor has told you what to think about what happened .
And I ’d wager , too , that the anchor has asked a reporter or correspondent , “ You agree , right ? ”
It ’s irritating and profoundly misleading .
CNN ’s John Roberts did that again this morning during the American Morning program ’s 6 a.m. hour .
In an exchange with veteran CNN international correspondent Christiane Amanpour regarding events in Iran , Mr. Roberts sought to have her confirm his surmises .
Note the use of the guessing word seems .
First , he offered an opinion :
Mr. ROBERTS : And , Christiane , President Obama seems to be putting a little bit of distance between the White House and the situation in Iran using very , very diplomatic and some people might say standoffish language to describe the situation there .
Here ’s what he said to CNBC .
Let ’s listen .
[ emphasis added ]
Notice the wording .
Seems always says to me someone ’s guessing .
Then some people might say passes for evidence backing his opinion .
But it ’s not : it is wording of artifice intended to validate his guess .
Next , CNN ran a video clip of the president ’s remarks :
BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES :
It ’s important to understand that although there is amazing ferment taking place in Iran , that the difference between Ahmadinejad and Mousavi in terms of their actual policies may not be as great as has been advertised .
Then Mr. Roberts addressed Ms. Amanpour :
ROBERTS :
What ’s behind the strategy like that , Christiane , and particularly this idea as well that the president is saying he does n’t want to be seen to be meddling in Iranian affairs ?
[ emphasis added ]
This idea ?
What idea ?
Whose idea ?
Mr. Roberts spins the president ’s remarks as an attempt to avoid “ meddling in Iranian affairs . ”
He assumes it ’s a “ strategy ” and asks Ms. Amanpour what ’s “ behind ” a “ strategy ” that Mr. Roberts has assumed .
She refused and followed with facts and analysis based on them :
AMANPOUR : Well , I think — look , I am not going to get into the House — ahead of the White House or the president .
I ’m just telling you the facts from the ground that there is actually a difference between Mr. Mousavi and President Ahmadinejad most particularly in domestic policy .
And that is why there ’s a divided nation on the ground right now .
Those huge supporting crowds for President Ahmadinejad and that gathering momentum for reform .
And having experienced Iran for instance over the years of reform under President Hotami and seeing the complete difference in tone and the difference in reaching out to the world in terms of foreign policy and again tone compared to the four years of Ahmadinejad , it ’s almost night and day .
The president , on the other hand , is correct about foreign policy .
There is foreign policy conducted by Ayatollah Khamenei , the supreme leader .
And he is the one who deals with relations with the United States , the military policy , U.S. policy , and other foreign policy .
So that is an important distinction .
But Mr. Mousavi had said that he wants to pursue detente with the rest of the world , including the United States .
Whereas President Ahmadinejad also said that he does want to move forward but his public stance is much , much more confrontational and belligerent particularly over the all - important nuclear policy .
Now , it ’s true that Mr. Mousavi said that our nuclear program is not negotiable .
But then there ’s a difference in how he said that he would allow the international community to verify and lay their fears at rest regarding their fears of militarization .
[ emphasis added ]
Would n’t it be nice if more correspondents would push back against the assumptions and assertions cable - news anchors asked them to confirm ?

Cheap plane tickets have a nasty habit of becoming expensive .
Three years ago I booked a bargain trip from Belfast City to Stansted with Europe 's third - largest budget airline , Air Berlin .
We passengers all turned up at the airport on time , knowing that even a minute 's tardiness is enough to see you offloaded .
But a flight that began with an hour 's delay was , later in the evening , cancelled .
Apparently the plane that was supposed to operate was redeployed to replace a broken aircraft elsewhere on the network .
At that point , I should have in theory have cried " God bless the EU " , as the airline showered me with compensation and arranged my hotel room for the night , plus a taxi to take me there .
After all , a year earlier , the European Commission had introduced rules on compensation and assistance to airline passengers that were intended to provide " Transport with a human face " – and deal with exactly the circumstances I was in .
But almost all my experiences with " EC261/2004 " , as the rules are catchily titled , suggest that many airlines are simply ignoring their obligation .
Instead of meals and accommodation being arranged , the sole Air Berlin rep handed everyone a piece of paper with some out - of - date telephone numbers for hotels and left us to get on with it .
Because I needed to be on the first flight out next day , I quickly racked up a bill for £ 300 , with a couple of hundred more due in compensation for the cancellation .
Not only has Air Berlin " failed to receive " my claim and receipts - it has kept the original £ 23 fare , having correctly predicted that after a few more attempts I would give up and go away .

The Air Transport Users ' Council , which publishes its annual report today , suggests travellers are getting increasingly exasperated by airlines ' behaviour ; complaints to the body are up by 11 per cent .
But I think we protest too much .
Get used to it : air travel lost any glamour years ago .
It is now a safe and often cheap commodity that takes from A ( where you do n't want to be , particularly if it 's Stansted ) , to B , which is somewhere you yearn to be - whether for culture , romance or cheap beer .
It will deliver you to your dream ; just do n't moan if the process becomes a nightmare .
And consult the guidelines here to see if it 's worth making a fuss .
It usually is n't .
The top written complaints to the Air Transport Users ' Council thisyear – and what you can do about them ...
Cancellations ( 45 per cent of total complaints recieved )
As the airlines struggle to contain costs , they are axing flights in the manner of serial killers .
Six months ago I paid British Airways for the privilege of flying from Barcelona to London in October ; the airline believes it is cheaper to keep the plane on the ground and refund my fare than to operate it .
And because BA told me more than two weeks ahead , it does not owe me a penny in compensation nor interest .
Even if your flight is cancelled with less notice , do n't expect the airline to lavish you with cash ; obfuscation is more likely .
Delays ( 17 per cent )
One consequence of the recession is that about 10 per cent fewer flights are operating across Europe - and those that do take off are consequently less likely to be held up because of air - traffic control .
That could explain the decline in complaints about tardiness .
If a plane is late , all you can do is hope that the airline will honour its legal obligation to look after you with refreshment , phone calls and – if a night - stop is necessary – a hotel room .
But do n't count on it : when I have meekly asked for my entitlement , responses have ranged from " Oh , we do n't do that " ( Olympic Airlines ) to " We did n't expect the delay to be longer than two hours " ( British Airways ) ; my italics - the crucial test is the airline 's expectation , not the reality .
Mishandled baggage ( 12 per cent )
To avoid being one of the 10 people a week who complain about losing their bags , do n't check anything in .
If you must consign luggage to the hold , then do n't change planes – transfer points are where most bags go astray .
And assume that every tag will be torn off the outside , and provide your name and address inside the case .
Reservation issues ( nine per cent )
" Incorrect names or dates being entered into the booking " is a growing problem .
Airlines are pernickity about all your details being right .
So Bob , Beth and Billy : make sure your name as it appears on the passport is the one you book under .
And if you , like me , book a flight to Belfast next September rather than this October , you have no - one to blame but yourself .
Read back all the details before you press " Buy now " .
Denied boarding ( six per cent )
If you turn up on time for a flight and are refused a seat , then you are entitled to compensation ; simple as that .
Refund issues ( five per cent )
If you are due a refund , do n't expect the airline to make it top priority ; these cash - strapped days , they need all the free credit they can get .
Baggage allowance ( three per cent )
The pointless conversation at check - in goes like this : " But when I flew out here I had exactly the same bag and weight and I did n't get charged " .
No more Mr / Ms Nice Ground Staff ; you know the rules .
Diverted flight ( three per cent )
A flight reservation constitutes only a vague promise to get you from A to B in the manner of the airlines choosing .
Fog on the Rhine meant that on two occasions when I intended to fly to Baden Baden in Germany , I ended up in France and Switzerland respectively – which , even by Ryanair standards , is stretching geography .

Roguelike Game AI overview
Since I 'm an AI engineer , and since I 'm unemployed right now , and since I 'm interested in roguelike games , I thought I 'd write a series of articles on game AI for roguelikes as a contribution to the community .
Some of these techniques ( Stateless AI 's and State Machines in particular ) are properly " pseudointelligence " rather than " artificial intelligence " , because they do n't involve any actual learning .
But " AI " is how game designers refer to the decision - making code for their artificial antagonists , regardless of its actual status , so I 'm going to use it .
The ground I plan to cover here includes roughly these articles ; I may add an article or two to this or change the order of articles depending on what people are interested in reading .

Overview
Ray Dillinger
Bryan Lee Roberts was born January 24 , 1986 in Madrid , Spain .
He was raised in Hermosa Beach , California and attended Mira Costa High School .
Lee was signed by the Royals this summer as an undrafted free agent after completing his college career at Loyola Marymount University .
In his senior season with the LMU Lions , Lee posted a 7 - 2 record and 3.58 ERA in 103 innings of work .
He struck out 91 while walking only 27 and went at least 6.0 innings in 11 or his 13 starts .
Now a member of the Arizona League Royals , Lee has made eight relief appearances for the team and is making the most of his opportunity .
In 12.0 innings pitched , he has a 1.50 ERA , 1.25 WHIP , and 5.50 K / BB .
His latest appearance came on July 27th when he pitched a clean third of an inning .
Standing 6 ’0 ” and weighing 185 lbs , the right handed pitcher has had quite a journey to get to professional baseball .
Without further delay , lets get on to the questions .
First thing I am curious about is how long were you in Spain before you and your family ended up in California ?
Well , my parents were both in the Air Force and stationed over in Madrid , where I was born .
I was only there for about 2 years and then my parents were done with their stint and we came back to the U. S .
As a kid growing up , what was your favorite sport and who was your favorite MLB team ?
Did you have any opinion of the Kansas City Royals as a kid ?
Growing up in southern California , I was always a fan of the Dodgers .
I went to a lot of games when I was younger and so it was only natural , I suppose , to root for them .
I ’ve also always liked the Red Sox .
They have such a fun history and I hated the Yankees cause everyone else loved them !
I never really had an opinion of the Royals , not being around the team .
Who would have thought that the team that I knew the least about would be the organization that I would be playing for !
It ’s funny how that works .
A bit of trivia , 5 players from Mira Costa HS have been drafted by ML teams including LHP - Joel Garber , who was the Astros 1st round pick in 1992 , but none of them reached the major league level .
While you were in HS , how aware were you of past Mira Costa players and teams and what kind of baseball tradition does the school have ?
There were actually only two players that I remember hearing about .
The first was a pitcher David Johnson , who I believe is still playing in Triple - A .
The other was a big hitter named Ryan Brincat , who I think is done playing but I ’m not sure .
I knew that there has been some good talent that has gone through Mira Costa , but I knew that it was never a real powerhouse in baseball .
I am proud , though , to keep a baseball tradition going and to represent MCHS as I work my way up .
As a senior in high school you earned All - Bay League honors and walked on to the LMU baseball team when you went to college .
You were cut as a freshman and wound up pitching for a local club team .
Your sophomore season you tried again to make the LMU roster and this time succeeded .
Most people would probably have stopped playing after getting cut , for you what was the driving force behind trying out again ?
Well when I was cut freshman year , there was a week of just heartbreak .
The one big constant in my life was all of the sudden gone .
As fate would have it , one of my buddies and I talked about forming an LMU club team so that we could keep playing ball .
My constant was back in my life and I was the Vice President of the club team .
It was at that point where I decided that I was going to work as hard as I could to get better so that I could make the Varsity team the next year .
The club competition was not that great , but I treated each hitter like they were division one hitters and pitched to them as competitively as I could .
It was a pretty fun time in my life and I learned the lesson of not letting a little adversity get in the way of your dreams .
Your career at LMU saw you pitch as a reliever your first 2 years , then your junior season you made 6 starts in addition to 17 relief appearances .
What difficulties did you experience as you transitioned from starter in high school , to reliever at LMU , and then back to a starter for your senior season ?
I think the biggest difficulty that I had switching between roles was more on the mental aspect of those roles .
I liked the idea of knowing when I was going to pitch because then you can develop a rhythm and a routine before each and every start .
Once I was moved into the role of relief , I had to be ready every game to come in and throw .
I felt back at home when I was moved to starter my senior year ; back into my comfortable routine .
It ’s kind of funny because KC now has me back into the late inning relieving role .
So it should be fun to see how many different roles I can get under my belt here !
Statistically you took a huge step forward in your senior season at LMU .
What factor (s ) played into the improvement , or are the statistics misleading ?
The biggest factor was the change in the coaching philosophy .
Coach Jason
Gill was appointed as LMU ’s head coach and with him he brought the idea of actually learning the game .
What I learned from him and my pitching coach , Drew Keehne , was how to utilize all my pitches .
They allowed me to learn the pitching game and gave me the confidence so that I could call my own game and pitch to my strengths .
I have a few questions as we transition from your youth to your professional career as a member of the Royals organization .
My first transitional question , how did you get into baseball ?
I have always had a passion for the game .
I have been batting the ball around since I was two or three years old .
I have been playing ever since I was five years old .
Which person has most influenced your career and why ?
My mom was the one who wanted to put me into baseball .
She has been there since day one and has been to literally almost all of my games .
She has taking countless days off work and sacrificed a lot just to come and support me .
It actually feels a bit weird not having her in the stands right now !
My step - dad also played a huge role in my career , as he was the main person who taught me how to pitch .
He told me to throw strikes from day one and taught me how to throw my curveball , which is the exact same one I am throwing right now .
Do you have any rituals or superstitions you follow before , during , or after you pitch in a game ?
During the game , I groom the mound the same way every time before I throw my first warm - up pitch .
However , I would say that my biggest superstition would be my facial hair .
Even in college I would have a certain style going and as long as I was throwing well , it would stay .
My senior year in college I was rocking the full handle bars .
As for right now , I have a solo mustache that may or may not be waxed up like Clay Zavada’s !
What is your typical pre-game routine ?
Right now we have practice before the game and usually between practice and the game I do about 15 - 20 min of a core workout to start getting my core activated .
Other than that , I play catch before the game and then sit in the pen and wait for the call .
Earlier this spring , you did an interview with the Los Angeles Loyolan and were asked who your favorite MLB player was .
Your response was Greg Maddux .
Aside from being one of the best pitchers of all time , why is Maddux your favorite player ?
Maddux is my favorite pitcher because not only did he know the game , probably better than anyone , but he knew how to use that knowledge to effectively dominate in his years in the bigs .
I try to model myself after him in that I like to try and pick a hitter ’s swing apart by watching their practice swings .
Not only was he brilliant , but he also was not a power pitcher .
He hit his spots with all his pitches and knew what he was going to throw a hitter in his 3rd time facing him in the game .
It is for all these reasons that he is my favorite .
Now that Maddux has retired , who is your favorite active ML player ?
You ca n’t really go wrong with Lincecum or Greinke right now !
haha
Obviously you had a solid senior season at LMU and you finished the year in the top 10 of the West Coast Conference in shutouts ( 1st ) , complete games ( 1st ) , innings pitched ( 1st ) , strikeouts ( 2nd ) , wins ( 5th ) , ERA ( 8th ) .
With your success , prior to the draft this June did you have contact with any ML organization and did you think you had a chance to get drafted ?
I had talked to the Chicago White Sox , the Spanish National Team , and a professional team in the Italian league .
As far as thinking I was going to get drafted , I honestly was not sure .
Towards the end of my college season , I had people telling me that I should be getting picked up but I also knew that very few people actually get drafted .
I just kept an open mind .
How did the process play out for you once you were an undrafted free agent and what went into signing your contract with the Royals ?
I was actually called in the 48th round and told that if nobody else picked me , I would have a job waiting for me .
Not more than two days after the draft , I was on a plane out to Arizona to sign my contract and to start playing in the AZL .
Now that you are part of the Royals organization , what are your expectations for advancement to the next level of the system ?
Has the team given you any indication of what you need to accomplish in the Arizona League before you move up to the next level ?
I am not sure of what the team is going to do with me the rest of the summer .
I know that I am just going to keep going out there and giving it my best .
Hopefully after spring training I can make my way into one of the A class teams , if not sooner .
Along those lines , what does the team have you working on to hone your craft and skills as a pitcher ?
My coaches really like my consistency and ability to locate my pitches .
They are having me work on my core to gain some added stabilization to help hone in my accuracy a bit more while at the same time picking up my velocity a little bit .
What pitches do you throw , and are you working to develop anything new ?
I throw a 4 - seam fastball , 2 - seam / sinker mostly , a 12/6 curve , changeup , and a slider .
The slider , however , is being dropped by my coaches and changing into a cutter .
What have been some of the difficulties of going from college to professional baseball for you ?
The main difficulty of going from college to pro ball is that I am back in the pen and there are quite a few pitchers on the team , especially when some rehab guys are in town .
The innings are so few and far between that it can get frustrating only throwing one inning here and there .
That ’s why when you are given the opportunity to pitch you have to make the best of it to try to get yourself some more innings .
The Royals have you pitching out of the bullpen , but in your college career you were both a starter and reliever .
Which role do you prefer ?
I really like the consistency of starting .
It is great to know what day you are actually throwing so you can prepare yourself properly .
However , I love coming out of the pen because typically when I ’m coming in , there is some big situations and I love the adrenaline rush .
There is no better feeling than coming in with the game on the line with the tying and winning runners on base and no outs and getting out of the inning without a run scored .
It is in those situations that you can really feel like you have helped the team .
What does your typical daily routine consist of ?
Typically I get up around 10:30 - 11:00 am and have some breakfast .
I ’ll maybe watch a little TV or go online and see how my buddies are doing .
We head to the field around 2 pm and grab some lunch .
After lunch we usually have a little over an hour before we have to be outside for practice so a few of the guys and myself play some cards , which has the potential to get really heated if someone is caught cheating .
From there we stretch , throw lightly , and practice for a couple hours and get our conditioning in .
After practice we come back in , I usually go do some extra core work with our trainer and then shower , change , and head off to the game .
When I get back to the apartment , my roommates and I play computer games until we pass out !
Naturally we all hope you have a long and successful career with the Royals , but after you are done with baseball , do you plan on putting your Mechanical Engineering degree to use or do you plan on doing something else ?
Umm , I would like to use my degree and go into aerospace like Northrop Grumman or Boeing .
But my mom has told me that she thinks that I am not going to be using my degree and will probably go into coaching somewhere .
I can see both of those scenarios happening so we will see .
I have a couple of questions that some of KoK ’s most loyal readers are dying to know .
First , if you have one , what is your favorite rain delay memory ?
Haha .
Probably last summer when I was playing for the St. Cloud Riverbats in the Northwoods league .
It was pouring rain and the situation started off nice and relaxed with a game of bowling where you set up some cups infront of both dugouts and each team tries to roll the ball and knock some cups down .
Well from there it escalated quickly cause the other team quickly started the “ Upside Down Running Man ” where a guy put his pants on like a shirt with his shoes on his feet and his jersey on his legs so he looked like he was doing a handstand .
He started sprinting across the outfield , I was dying .
Then we did the “ Bobsled Team ” five of us sat down like we were in a bobsled and all leaned left and right like we were taking the turns of a bobsled course .
Finally to cap it all off , one of our players goes out on the grass infront of the dugout a little bit past first base .
He starts sprinting and head first slides about 40 feet and crashes through our cup bowling pins and just gets covered in mud .
The game ended up being cancelled .
Who is the prankster on the AZL Royals and what is the best prank you have witnessed or have been a part of since the season began ?
There are some pretty funny guys on the team .
Aside from my stache , the most fun thing was probably when a few of us had a full on NERF gun war in Target .
It was savage , there were a couple civilians who were tagged but they thought it was pretty funny .
This one comes courtesy of my 5 year old son Justin .
It ’s time for the Hot Dog Race at Kauffman Stadium , are you picking Ketchup , Mustard , or Relish to win ?
I have some insider information that Mustard has n’t been training very hard because his cat passed away and he is inconsolable .
Relish has just plain gotten too old .
So I would have to pick Ketchup to take the gold .
Lee , thank you so much for taking the time to answer my questions .
You are cemented as Kings of Kauffman ’s favorite minor league player and rest assured we will be following your career closely as it progresses .
In closing , I want to thank Dynasty Athlete Representation for getting me in touch with Lee so the above interview could take place .

ORLANDO , Fla . 
The breast cancer drug Herceptin may now have a role in treating stomach cancer as well , according to study results announced here on Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology .
Scientists also announced that a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors has shown promise against hard - to - treat forms of breast cancer and that a cancer vaccine for non-Hodgkin ’s lymphoma that struck out twice might have succeeded on a third try .
In a study sponsored by Roche , which sells Herceptin , stomach cancer patients who received Herceptin in addition to standard chemotherapy lived a median of 13.8 months compared with 11.1 months for those who treated with standard chemotherapy alone .
Herceptin is used to treat the roughly 20 percent of women whose breast tumors have an abundance of a protein called Her2 .
In the new study , doctors found that 22 percent of 3,807 patients with metastatic stomach cancer also had high amounts of Her2 in their tumors .
The study involved 594 of those Her2 - positive patients .
UCLA scientists and colleagues from UC Riverside and the Human BioMolecular Research Institute have found that a form of vitamin D , together with a chemical found in turmeric spice called curcumin , may help stimulate the immune system to clear the brain of amyloid beta , which forms the plaques considered the hallmark of Alzheimer 's disease .
The early research findings , which appear in the July issue of the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease , may lead to new approaches in preventing and treating Alzheimer 's by utilizing the property of vitamin D3 — a form of vitamin D — both alone and together with natural or synthetic curcumin to boost the immune system in protecting the brain against amyloid beta .
Vitamin D3 is an essential nutrient for bone and immune system health ; its main source is sunshine , and it is synthesized through the skin .
Deficiencies may occur during winter months or in those who spend a lot of time indoors , such as Alzheimer 's patients .
" We hope that vitamin D3 and curcumin , both naturally occurring nutrients , may offer new preventive and treatment possibilities for Alzheimer 's disease , " said Dr. Milan Fiala , study author and a researcher at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System .
Using blood samples from nine Alzheimer 's patients , one patient with mild cognitive impairment and three healthy control subjects , scientists isolated monocyte cells , which transform into macrophages that act as the immune system 's clean - up crew , traveling through the brain and body and gobbling up waste products , including amyloid beta .
Researchers incubated the macrophages with amyloid beta , vitamin D3 and natural or synthetic curcumin .
The synthetic curcuminoid compounds were developed in the laboratory of John Cashman at the Human BioMolecular Research Institute , a nonprofit institute dedicated to research on diseases of the human brain .
Researchers found that naturally occurring curcumin was not readily absorbed , that it tended to break down quickly before it could be utilized and that its potency level was low , making it less effective than the new synthetic curcuminoids .

" We think some of the novel synthetic compounds will get around the shortcomings of curcumin and improve the therapeutic efficacy , " Cashman said .
The team discovered that curcuminoids enhanced the surface binding of amyloid beta to macrophages and that vitamin D strongly stimulated the uptake and absorption of amyloid beta in macrophages in a majority of patients .
Previous research by the team demonstrated that the immune genes MGAT III and TLR - 3 are associated with the immune system 's ability to better ingest amyloid beta .
In this earlier work , Fiala noted , it was shown that there are two types of Alzheimer 's patients :
Type 1 patients , who respond positively to curcuminoids , and Type II patients , who do not .
" Since vitamin D and curcumin work differently with the immune system , we may find that a combination of the two or each used alone may be more effective — depending on the individual patient , " he said .
Fiala noted that this is early laboratory research and that no dosage of vitamin D or curcumin can be recommended at this point .
Larger vitamin D and curcumin studies with more patients are planned .
The study was funded by the Human BioMolecular Research Institute , the Alzheimer 's Association and MP Biomedicals LLC , a global life sciences and diagnostics company dedicated to Alzheimer 's disease research .
Fiala is a consultant for MP Biomedicals and also served in the company 's speakers bureau .
Additional study authors include Ava Masoumi , Ben Goldenson , Hripsime Avagyan , Justin Zaghi , Michelle Mahanian , Martin Hewison , Araceli Espinosa - Jeffrey and Phillip T.

The rumors are true , Intel ’s 2nd generation SSDs are available starting today .
The high level details are pretty interesting :
The new drives will be available in 80GB and 160 GB sizes and are still called the X25 - M and X18 - M. The X18 - M will start shipping later this quarter .
34nm flash ( down from 50nm in the original X25 - M ) , allows Intel to include roughly twice the flash in the same size die .
The enterprise SLC version does n’t get the 34nm treatment at this point .
The smaller flash die results in lower prices , the 80 GB model will sell for $ 225 while the 160 GB version should sell for $ 440 .
Best case read / write latency has been improved ( more details below ) .
The 34nm drives have a new controller and new firmware , also contributing to better performance ( 2 - 2.5 x more 4KB random write IOPS than the old drive ! ) .
Enterprise level workstation / database apps should see an immediate performance benefit , client desktop performance is unknown .
Do n't expect a significant increase in PCMark or SYSMark scores , but in real world usage the new drives could feel faster .
The new controller is Halogen - free ( the old one was n’t ) so Apple could theoretically use the new drives in their systems without being un - green .
TRIM is n’t yet supported , but the 34nm drives will get a firmware update when Windows 7 launches enabling TRIM .
XP and Vista users will get a performance enhancing utility ( read : manual TRIM utility ) .
It seems that 50nm users are SOL with regards to TRIM support .
Bad form Intel , very bad form .
I get my drive this week , so expect a review to follow .
Overall it ’s an evolution of the X25 - M , and not a revolutionary new design .
The focus of the evolution is definitely price .
Intel wants the X25 - M to be used , not only at the high end , but even in mainstream PCs .
At $ 225 for an 80 GB drive , the new X25 - M is currently cheaper than most Indilinx based drives on the market :
Drive NAND Capacity Cost per GB Price Intel X25 - M ( 34nm ) 80 GB $ 2.81 $ 225 Intel X25 - M ( 34nm ) 160 GB $ 2.75 $ 440 OCZ Vertex ( Indilinx ) 64GB $ 3.41 $ 218 OCZ Vertex ( Indilinx ) 128GB $ 3.00 $ 385 Patriot Torqx ( Indilinx ) 64GB $ 3.48 $ 223 Patriot Torqx ( Indilinx ) 128GB $ 2.85 $ 365 OCZ Agility ( Indilinx , non-Samsung Flash ) 64GB $ 2.77 $ 177 OCZ Agility ( Indilinx , non-Samsung Flash ) 128GB $ 2.57 $ 329 OCZ Summit ( Samsung ) 128 GB $ 3.04 $ 389
There ’s going to have to be a price correction from the competition .
We may also see more manufacturers branching out to different flash memory vendors to remain price competitive ( similar to what OCZ did with the Agility line ) .
The Specs Breakdown
The major differences between the 1st and 2nd gen X25 - M are highlighted in the table below :
X25 - M Gen 1 X25 - M Gen 2 Flash Manufacturing Process 50nm 34nm Flash Read Latency 85 µs 65 µs Flash Write Latency 115 µs 85 µs Random 4 KB Reads Up to 35 K IOPS Up to 35 K IOPS Random 4 KB Writes Up to 3.3K IOPS Up to 6.6K IOPS ( 80GB )
Up to 8.6K IOPS ( 160 GB ) Sequential Read Up to 250MB /s Up to 250MB /s Sequential Write Up to 70 MB / s Up to 70 MB / s Halogen - free No Yes Price $ 345 ( 80 GB )
$ 600 - $ 700 ( 160 GB )
$ 225 ( 80 GB )
$ 440 ( 160 GB )
The move to 34nm gives Intel the ability to both decrease costs and increase capacity .
It now costs
Intel the same to make a 160 GB drive as it used to cost to make an 80 GB drive , and about half to make an 80 GB drive .
Given the current cost structure , I ’d say there ’s still more room for Intel to drop prices but there ’s just no need to given the competitive landscape .
Better Performance
The performance of the new drives is improved .
Read and write latency are both improved by around 30 % .
These figures are for a single sequential operation , so you 're looking at best case performance improving on the drive .
Intel also tweaked the controller and its firmware to further improve performance ; the result is much faster 4KB random writes on the new drives .
The real world benefits are difficult to predict .
If you 're running an I / O intensive app on the desktop then you 'll see a definite improvement from the new drive .
More typical desktop / notebook workloads probably wo n't see a tremendous difference between the 1st and 2nd gen drives .
Large file sequential read / write speed remains unchanged and although there have been tweaks to the controller ’s algorithms , the overall architecture has n’t changed either .
I ’ll be able to confirm for sure when I get a drive this week .
Other Spec Changes
There are two other specifications that have changed , one for the better and one for the worse with the new drive :
X25 - M Gen 1 X25 - M Gen 2 Idle Power ( MobileMark 2007 ) 65 mW 75 mW Operational Shock 1,000G for 0.5 msec 1,500G for 0.5 msec
Load power has n't changed between the drives , they are both at 150 mW .
Idle power went up by 10 mW thanks to the new controller .
These are " typical " values while running MobileMark 2007 , so I 'm not sure if things change at all if you 're looking at real world workloads .
Intel claims that the new drive does n't deliver worse battery life than the old one , but I 'll have to verify .
The maximum amount of operational shock that the 34nm drive can take went up by 50 % ; 1500 Gs for 0.5 msec sure seems like a lot .
I 'm not sure if anything changed internally to allow for this higher rating or if it 's simply the result of better manufacturing / improving production .
Halogen Free , Apple Friendly
A little known fact about the original X25 - M was that its controller was n’t Halogen - free .
Because Intel used Halogens in the first controller , companies that had strict environmental restrictions ( e.g. Apple ) would n’t touch the drives .
Apple could n't claim BFR - free on its new MacBook Pro if it used Intel 's 1st gen X25 - M. Bromine is a Halogen .
The new drive has a new controller and it is Halogen free .
For Apple to glance over the X25 - M in its mobile lineup now would be a serious mistake .
How to Tell the Drives Apart
Despite the price drop and internal changes , Intel is still calling these things the X25 - M and X18 - M .
So how do you tell the new drives apart from the old ones ?
It all comes down to the part number ; if the last two digits are a G1 then it ’s the old drive , if they are a G2 it ’s the new one .
If you have them in hand , the new drives are silver , the old ones are black .
X25 - M Gen 1 X25 - M Gen 2 80 GB 2.5 " SSDSA2MH080G1 SSDSA2MH080G2 160 GB 2.5 " SSDSA2MH160G1 SSDSA2MH160G2 80 GB 1.8 " SSDSA1MH080G1 SSDSA1MH080G2 160 GB 1.8 " SSDSA1MH160G1 SSDSA1MH160G2
TRIM Support : Not For 50nm Drives
Part of today ’s announcement is the fact that Intel will enable TRIM on these 34nm drives when Windows 7 ships .
Intel is planning on releasing a user downloadable firmware update that will enable TRIM support .
Windows Vista and XP users will get a performance enhancement tool that presumably will just manually invoke the TRIM command .
I suspect that Intel is waiting until Windows 7 to enable TRIM support is to make sure that everything is thoroughly tested .
As we ’ve seen with other attempts to enable TRIM , it ’s a tricky thing to do .
The disappointing part of the announcement is that there ’s no TRIM support for the first gen 50nm drives .
As far as I can tell , this is n’t a technical limitation of the drives , but rather something Intel is choosing to enable only on the 34nm products .
Final Words ... for now
I 'm still waiting on my 34nm review sample , as soon as I get it I 'll start working on a full review .
I 've already started work on the newest SSDs from the competition , so expect something soon .

I ’ve just found this surprising study in Psychological Science that found a link between the point in the menstrual cycle of 77 white women and various measures of race bias .
Race Bias Tracks Conception Risk Across the Menstrual Cycle. Psychol Sci. 2009 May 4 . [ Epub ahead of print ]
Navarrete CD , Fessler DM , Fleischman DS , Geyer J. Although a considerable body of research explores alterations in women ’s mating - relevant preferences across the menstrual cycle , investigators have yet to examine the potential for the menstrual cycle to influence intergroup attitudes .
We examined the effects of changes in conception risk across the menstrual cycle on intergroup bias and found that increased conception risk was positively associated with several measures of race bias .
This association was particularly strong when perceived vulnerability to sexual coercion was high .
Our findings highlight the potential for hypotheses informed by an evolutionary perspective to generate new knowledge about current social problems - an avenue that may lead to new predictions in the study of intergroup relations .
The research paper is online as a pdf if you want the full details .
The authors explain the findings as suggesting that women show a preference to their ‘ in group ’ , those who more closely match their own background and lifestyle , when most fertile .
Menstrual cycle has been found to influence numerous preferences in women in earlier studies , including dressing attractively , preference for the type of fanciable person , including a preference for more ‘ masculine ’ features .
Indeed , cycles in oestrogen are known to alter dopamine function in the striatum , a deep brain structure .

Following the footsteps of Gradius ReBirth , Konami quietly announced Contra ReBirth on a product page ( thanks for the tips Ishaan and Denpa no Sekai ! ! ) .
The WiiWare game goes on sale in Japan on May 12 for 1,000 Wii Points and has two player co-op play .
Konami says the game is a new work , but it is n’t clear if Contra ReBirth is a remix like Gradius ReBirth .
Seems like Konami is growing a series of a ReBirth arcade games .
I wonder what ’s next …

GUATEMALA CITY , June 17 ( Reuters ) - Guatemala opened its first DNA testing lab on Wednesday hoping that genetic fingerprinting will help solve decades - old civil war crimes as well as more recent murders .
Guatemala 's Forensic Anthropology Foundation opened the $ 1.5 million laboratory funded by international donations to identify victims excavated from hundreds of mass graves from the 1960 - 1996 civil war .
More than a quarter million people -- mostly Mayan villagers -- were killed or disappeared during the civil war that pitted successive right - wing governments against leftist guerrillas .
A U.N. - backed truth Commission found that Guatemalan security forces committed more than 90 percent of the killings but only a few officials have been tried for war crimes .
" This work will allow the families of the victims to answer the questions we have : what happened in Guatemala , who was responsible , and how can we bring them to justice ? " said Julio Solorzano , desperate to find out what happened to his mother who disappeared in December 1980 after being picked up by military police .
Solorzano gave his own DNA sample with an oral swab which will go into a database of victims ' family members to be matched with samples from thousands of bodies exhumed by anthropologists .
While the bulk of the work will focus on past crimes , Guatemalan authorities are eager to use the lab to aid the country 's ailing justice system , which only manages to prosecute 2 percent of the 6,000 murders committed each year .
Since the end of the war , Guatemala 's population of 13 million has been overrun with violence by youth gangs and Mexican cartels increasingly using Central America as a corridor to smuggle drugs north to the United States .

Within 2 minutes , the flames had spread across the single bed he was lying on and were consuming his cotton sweatshirt and trousers .
Around a dozen onlookers were at the scene – including police , fire investigators and death investigators – yet all they did was watch .
That was , after all , their job .
The “ victim ” had in fact died some time ago , having previously donated his remains to medical research .
His body had reached a unique team led by Elayne Pope , a forensic scientist at the University of West Florida in Pensacola .

Getting that sexy black iPhone 3GS from Apple was like hooking up with the lady of my dreams .
And what a night we had .
But when I woke up the next morning with the iPhone beside me , the iTunes in my head had become a symphony of shame and regret .
My wallet was $ 199 lighter , my feverish advances had drained her battery , and instead of the perky " 3G " at the top of her lovely screen , there was the hated " E " -- for EDGE network .
And then I remembered that Madame Bell would be coming after me for another 420 bucks this year for data and texts .
Oy !
What a hangover .
[ Which mobile device is best ?
Find out in our iPhone vs. BlackBerry deathmatch and our iPhone vs. Palm
Pre deathmatch .
| Stay ahead of advances in mobile technology with InfoWorld 's Mobile Edge blog and Mobilize newsletter . ]
Enough with the purple prose .
But my first few days with the iPhone , coming just before Google dropped the Chrome OS bomb , made me realize how far we are from the mobile , Web - based nirvana so often promised .
The technology and the infrastructure are simply not there yet .
It 's time to lower our expectations .
4G ? Do n't hold your breath
Check this out : " Although the carriers will never admit that current 3G and 2.5G data services are anything less than spectacular , they are still prepping their networks for the next generation .
And wireless providers hope 4G technologies will light a fire under the moribund market for data services on cell phones . "
Sound familiar ?
It should .
Those lines were written by an InfoWorld colleague in 2003 .
That 's right , six years ago .
If I cared to , I 'm sure I could find hype - filled 4G stories going back to the turn of the 21st century .
So when I hear Verizon and other carriers go on about yet another superduper telephony technology , I 've got to laugh .
There is one very false note in the paragraph I cited above : the bit about moribund market for data services on cell phones .
These days , that market is anything but moribund .
But the carriers never expected , nor prepared for , the rapid expansion in demand .
Consider my ( admittedly limited ) experience as an iPhone user .
I live in a relatively upscale neighborhood with panoramic views of the Bay Bridge and the East Bay hills .
I do n't mention that to make you jealous -- the point is elevation .
Talk about line of sight .
And there 's lot of demand for tech goodies , but 3G reception is very poor .
It 's better in other parts of town , like the Financial District , and equally crummy in others .
Sure , some of that has to do with our hilly topography , but not all and not by a long shot .
If you look at AT&T's map of ( alleged ) 3G service in San Francisco , it 's all blue -- the color code for " available . "
Well , it 's not .
And let me tell you , using even basic apps like Safari or e-mail are absolutely excruciating on the EDGE network .
It feels just like dial - up .
It 's not just San Francisco .
My colleague Galen Gruman had the same experience in Manhattan recently : mostly EDGE coverage , with a few 3G spots such as in midtown -- and no coverage at all on Wall Street .
I hear the same complaints from AT&T users throughout much of the West and East coasts .
AT&T , which badly underestimated the strain the iPhone would place on its network , is spending billions of dollars to upgrade its 3G capabilities .
But the last I heard , it does n't expect to finish the upgrade until 2010 or 2011 .
Excuse my cynicism , but if it will take that long to build out 3G , it strains credibility to believe that 4G will be here in a similar time frame -- on anyone 's network .
I -- and many others -- have said that consumers would be better off if the iPhone was not held in thrall to AT&T by an exclusive agreement with Apple .
I still think that 's true .
But simply blaming Madame Bell sidesteps the real problem :
Our national infrastructure lags behind demand for high - speed services , and given the costs and the difficult economic conditions , we just have to wait until it catches up .
Which brings me to the Chrome OS .
Sure , it 's great to see another competitor ready to challenge Microsoft in the OS market .
Given Apple 's small market share , additional competition is a very good thing .
There are a lot of reason , of course , to be skeptical about the prospects of the Chrome OS , but in this context , the difficulty lies in the nature of a Web - based operating system .
It will be no better than the service connection to the Web delivered by the carriers , and given their crummy record , how many of us want to depend on them for our basic computing needs ?
Not me .
Battery technology lags as well
I 've been covering this industry for a couple of decades , and I 've heard hundreds of pitches from computer makers about improved battery life .
On the one hand , there 's a pretty big B.S. factor .
But there 's also some truth there .
Batteries have gotten much better .
The problem , though , is the ever increasing demands made upon them by new features .
Take my iPhone :
That big , bright screen sucks power like a baby quaffs milk .
Use a few other features , and suddenly you 're running on empty .
It 's a serious problem for engineers , and it 's only going to get worse .
( There may be a software glitch hurting battery life in the iPhone as well . )
No doubt Apple has made strides in power management .
But the features we pay for simply outstrip the ability to deliver a full day 's usage without resorting to annoying tricks ( you know what they are ) to save juice .
And what 's true of the iPhone is true of laptops and netbooks .
Battery technology , unlike CPU technology , does not dance to Moore 's Law -- and it wo n't for some time .
When Apple or AT&T blow it , they need to hear about it from us , the customers .
But we also need to realize that there is more at play here than just the bozo factor .
I welcome your comments , tips , and suggestions .

Most South Carolinians Say Sanford Should Go
June 25 , 2009
Although South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford promised Wednesday to redouble his focus on state issues after admitting to an extramarital affair , three - fifths of his constituents apparently wish he would just go away .
Sixty percent of South Carolina respondents to a Survey USA poll conducted Wednesday said Sanford should resign his office in the wake of his disclosure of his relationship with a woman in Argentina .
Just more than a third -- 34 percent -- said he should n't resign .
The poll was conducted in conjunction with television station WCSC in Charleston .
Most of the respondents also expressed anger over the two - term Republican governor 's week - long disappearance that preceded his confessional news conference .
[ and so on and on ]
#
Howie passed along this item from yesterday 's CQ Politics with the note : " I wonder how many would care if he was schtupping some nice Baptist gal from Tennessee instead of a foreigner ?
" There are times when the all - infallible Conventional Wisdom lets us down .
As far as I know , there is no established figure for what percent of a governor 's electorate can wish him to quit before he 's in trouble .
The most nearly relevant precedent would be that of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , and in Governor Rod 's case , his feeling seems to have been that it did n't mean nuttin ' till it got to 100 percent , and maybe not even then .
I suspect , though , that 60 percent is not a good number , no matter how you look at it .
Of course Governor Mark is just serving out a term in which he has clearly suffered markedly diminished interest .
After that he was going to be term - limited out of office anyway ; now I suspect his future plans have become a matter of strictly personal interest .
And deservedly so .
This is a man of absolutist views in politics as well as in religion ; in fact , he 's made it clear that for him they 're pretty much the same thing -- though he did keep reminding us in that hallucinatory press conference he held Wednesday that he's " a bottom - line guy , " even as he never seemed to get around to that bottom line .
And of course his head is jammed as firmly up his rectum when it comes to politics as when it comes to religion .
Sorry , I 'm not going to conceal my satisfaction at the fall of the malignant pukeguts .
I really do not like people of an authoritarian mindset who presume to tell other people how to live their lives , especially when their prescriptions are mostly sociopathic BS , and even more so when they wrap themselves in the mantel of God .
The ultimate joke is on them if there really is such a being , of course , because
He must be mightily peeved at all these BS Christians who have devoted their lives to bamboozling dimwitted parishioners for their personal profit ( literal as well as figurative ) .
Is that a scene or what : all those sharks of 21st century American Crap Christianity waving to Jesus , whose they 've spent their lives trashing , in Heaven as they file on down to their destination .
As you probably guessed , the taxpayers of South Carolina , whose best interests the crazed and hypocritical Sanford always claims to have at heart -- even when he 's trying to turn down federal funds for schools and unemployment insurance , were paying for his sexual trysts .
That 's right , the Republican presidential hopeful was stealing money from the state to pay for his uncontrollable lust .
If you think there are many extreme right politicians who are very different from Sanford , you would be terribly wrong .
Prediction : his next job will be that of a Baptist televangelist -- or maybe just a nudist Baptist deacon in Georgia .
Sanford 's wife Jenny , another abused and deceived Christian - Republican wife who bought into all the bullshit , granted her first interview since South Carolina 's governor came back from his latest tango lessons in Buenos Aires .

Awesome HDR Photographic Sketches of Tokyo
Toshiro at HDRi Life has been walking the streets of Tokyo , photographing the people and structures of its urban scenery in HDR .
High dynamic range imaging ( HDRI or just HDR ) is a set of techniques that allows a greater dynamic range of luminances between light and dark areas of a scene than normal digital imaging techniques .
The intention of HDRI is to accurately represent the wide range of intensity levels found in real scenes ranging from direct sunlight to shadows .
Toshiro ’s photos have a unique look and angle .
Shot with ultra - wide - angle and fisheye lenses , his photos present a disconcerting landscape of surreal colors and impossibly bent structures that make Japan ’s megalopolis look more cold and inhospitable than it really is .

Advertisement A 16 - year - old girl from Wales who made history when she had a donor heart grafted onto her own as a baby has made a full recovery .
Doctors say Hannah Clark 's own heart is now in perfect working order three - and - a - half years after her " piggy - back " donor heart was removed .
Sir Magdi Yacoub , who performed Hannah 's original transplant when she was two , said he was " delighted " .
The Lancet medical journal tells her story .
The original operation in 1995 saved Hannah 's life because she had cardiomyopathy - a condition which made her heart double in size and risk giving out within a year .

The donor heart was able to take over most of the role of pumping blood around Hannah 's body , effectively allowing her own beating heart to rest .
But 10 years later , at the age of 12 , Hannah , from Mountain Ash in Rhondda Cynon Taf , was experiencing serious health problems as a side effect of the immunosuppressant drugs she was taking to prevent rejection of the donor organ .
Hannah had developed tumours that had begun to spread and needed chemotherapy treatment .
For this to work , the doctors had to reduce Hannah 's immunosuppressants .
But this led to her body rejecting the donor heart .
Doctors at London 's Great Ormond Street Hospital decided the only option was to disconnect the donor organ .
They found Hannah 's own heart had recovered enough to cope on its own and without daily medication .
I would not have been here today if it was n't for the donor and the surgeons who did my operation .
I 'm really grateful
Hannah Clark
Three years on , Hannah has made a complete recovery , say her surgeons Sir Magdi and Mr Victor Tsang .
Sir Magdi described the recovery of Hannah 's heart as " magic " .
" We did not expect her heart to recover but when it did begin to recover we were absolutely delighted .
" A heart that was not contracting at all now is functioning normally .
" It shows the possibility of recovery of the heart . "
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme Hannah said she felt lucky to be alive .
" I would not have been here today if it was n't for the donor and the surgeons who did my operation .
I 'm really grateful .
" I do n't have to take any medicines now except an inhaler for my asthma .
And I am really excited about starting a job working with animals .
I could n't do that before because the fur could have affected my chest . "
Professor Peter Weissberg , of the British Heart Foundation , said cardiologists have long wondered whether a heart which is failing because of cardiomyopathy might be able to recover if rested .
" This seems to be exactly what has happened in Hannah 's case in which the donor heart allowed her own heart to take a rest and recover .
" This is an exciting discovery since it proves that , in some instances , a weakened heart has the capacity to recover - if it can be helped . "
He said experts were working to perfect a mechanical heart , called a ventricular assist device , that can be used in children temporarily to take over the work of a weak heart while it recovers .
A similar device already exists for adults with heart failure awaiting a donor transplant .

On his FNC program The O’Reilly Factor host Bill O’Reilly debunked CNN ’s Lou Dobbs birther talk about Barack Obama , but argued that Dobbs should not be fired .
First Coulter and now O’Reilly , the Republican is media is running full sprint away from the birthers .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
O’Reilly said , “ Impact segment tonight all has to do with the call for CNN commentator Lou Dobbs to be fired .
It has to do with Mr. Dobbs allowing conversation on his program that alleges President Obama is not a U.S. citizen .
Now this theory has been around for a while .
The Factor investigated and found this theory bogus but Mr. Dobbs is still engaged … Again we found that President Obama was born in Hawaii .
We sent the documents , what do you got to do .
I do n’t know why it ’s still around that was more than a year ago . ”
O’Reilly said that Dobbs is n’t a racist , “ Look , I do n’t mind you coming on and saying that you disagree with him .
It ’s totally absurd .
It ’s wrong to exploit it .
He ’s playing on fears .
There might be a racial component , although I do n’t think Lou Dobbs is a racist at all .
Cohen asked when is enough , enough ?
O’Reilly answered , “ It ’s never enough .
In a freedom of speech society , it ’s never enough is enough .
Freedom of speech allows you to go over , up to the line .
If Lou Dobbs was causing danger to someone then you would be legitimate in calling for his firing .
All he is doing is bloviating .
That ’s all it is . ”
The FNC top dog took at shot both CNN and Dobbs ’ ratings , “ The marketplace takes care of it .
Lou Dobbs ’ ratings are not very good .
CNN is having a very , very hard time .
The folks are deciding , and for you to get on there and demand CNN fire him , number one you help Lou Dobbs , because the people who do n’t like you and like that approach will probably go watch him and see how he responds , so you ’re helping him , and CNN is never going to fire him you know that , so you ’d better off in my humble opinion to make your case , say you do n’t believe it ’s fair , you believe it ’s exploitative , possibly dangerous and walk away . ”
I wish O’Reilly ’s love of the First Amendment expanded beyond his fellow conservatives .
I do n’t believe for a second , either that CNN will fire Dobbs .
He would have to make a remark on their air that was so toxic that they would have no choice , but to dismiss him .
O’Reilly is also probably correct in assuming that Dobbs jumped on the birther train for ratings .
I do n’t think Dobbs should be fired , but if enough people stop watching him , he will be replaced .

Wer bislang annahm , die Piratenpartei sei vor allem für eine Legalisierung von Downloads und damit sicher auch für die Einführung einer Kulturflatrate , wurde heute eines Besseren belehrt .
Im Wahlcheck von Telemedicus erklärte die Partei :
Prinzipiell lehnen wir die Kulturflatrate als untaugliches Mittel ab .
Wir sehen das Problem der Vergütung vorrangig in der Notwendigkeit eines Wandels der Geschäftsmodelle der Verwertungsindustrie begründet .
Mit dem Internet hätten die „ Kulturarbeiter ” erstmals die Kontrolle über ihre eigenen Produktionsmittel .
Die Krise der Medienindustrie sei keine Krise der Urheber , sondern eine der Verwertungsindustrie :
Eine staatliche Kompensation dieser Industrie lässt sich in unseren Augen vor der Gesellschaft nicht rechtfertigen .
Unsere bisherige Beschäftigung mit diesem
Thema lässt uns zu dem begründeten Urteil kommen , dass Urheber auch ohne Kulturflatrate ihre Werke mit marktwirtschaftlichen Mitteln erfolgreich verwerten werden können .
Die Haltung der Konzerne , die den Urhebern zurufen „ wir wollen ein stärkeres Urheberrecht um euch zu schützen ” ist verlogen und scheinheilig .
Die denken nur an ihren eigenen Geldbeutel und werden auch versuchen , sich von einer Kulturflatrate den Löwenanteil zu sichern .
Die Piratenpartei wolle vorhandene Pauschalabgabensysteme aber “ nicht sofort beliebig umkrempeln ” und könnte sich Interimslösungen mit verbesserten Verwertungsgesellschaften vorstellen .
Man sei daher in Sachen Kulturflatrate zumindest “ auch gesprächsbereit ” .
Diese Position der Piraten verrät einiges über ihren ideologischen Unterbau und ihr Verhältnis zu Grünen und SPD .
Letztere Parteien sind erklärtermaßen für die Kulturflatrate .
An diesem programmatischen Angelpunkt lässt sich der deutlich individualistische Impuls der Piratenpartei erkennen .
Die Piraten stehen der kollektivistischen Lösung einer gesellschaftlich organisierten und damit letzlich auch zwangsweise verordneten Kulturflatrate sehr skeptisch gegenüber .
Sie verweisen dagegen auf marktwirtschaftliche Mittel , die den Charme einer deutlich geringeren Regulierungsintensität haben .
Denn Piraten geht es ja gerade um mehr persönliche Freiheit , weniger Staat und weniger Bürokratie .
Hierzu passt letztlich auch folgende Postition der Piraten : Die Partei tritt für eine Abschaffung der GEZ ein und ist gegen die Gebührenpflicht von Computern , wie ihr Vorsitzender Jens Seipenbusch es Carta gerade noch einmal bestätigt hat .
Zugleich gibt sich die Partei kritisch gegenüber Großkonzernen : Diese würden vor allem in die eigene Tasche wirtschaften und die Urheber benachteiligen .
Ein erhebliches Maß Kritik an spätkapitalistischen Strukturen gehört folglich auch zur Identität der Piratenparei .
Die Piratenpartei ist wahrscheinlich noch viel zu jung , um schon von einer ausgereiften ideologischen Basis sprechen zu können .
Es zeigen sich aber schon deutliche Konturen :
Die Piraten sind digiliberal und zugleich konzernkapitalismuskritisch .
Es wäre daher falsch zu sagen , die Partei sei nicht links oder rechts .
Sie ist radikalliberal und establishmentkritisch in einem Atemzug .
Bradley Wiggins was sixth in the Annecy time trial after a headwind slowed him in the final section of the stage but he still has a great chance of finishing on the final podium in Paris .
Wiggins warmed down with a towel covering his head and was initially angry and disappointed with his result until he realised that all the late starters lost time on the final section of the course due to the change in wind .
“ I think there were two races today .
There was the race for the stage win and the race for the GC guys , ” Wiggins said after waiting patiently for Lance Armstrong to finish in anti-doping .
“ I think the conditions changed from the top of the climb to the finish .
For the guys who went off this morning there was no headwind and so it was variable conditions .
For us it was kind of a block headwind all the way back . ”
“ I had a slight problem with my chain and my rear mech but it was the headwind that caused all the difference . ”
“ From what I heard , I lost 12 seconds to Contador on the descent but saying that , if the conditions had been the same Alberto would have still won and I would have been second or third .
And I ’ve had enough second places this year … ”
Wiggins moved past Frank Schleck and Andreas Kloden to fourth overall after the time trial .
He is 4 - 11 behind Alberto Contador ( Astana ) and 1 - 25 behind Andy Schleck ( Saxo Bank ) but he is only 11 seconds behind Lance Armstrong ( Astana ) , who has suffered on the climbs more than Wiggins during the Tour de France .

Bradley Wiggins warms down after stage 18
He knows that the final battle for third will be decided on the slopes of Mount Ventoux on Saturday .
“ It ’s all going to come down to the Ventoux now .
I think Alberto has pretty much won the Tour de France but there ’s a race for second , third and fourth .
One final climb on the stage suits me , a bit like Verbier and Andorra .
It ’s one effort , one time trial up the Ventoux . ”
“ I think everyone is in the same boat and everyone is pretty tired .
Andy Schleck told me that he wishes the race was over now .
I feel sort of the same way . ”
“ If someone said to me do I want to settle with fourth or race up the Ventoux and try and gamble for a little higher , I ’d probably accept fourth at this stage . ”
UPDATED 3:25 PM
NEW YORK , July 22 ( Reuters ) – Tim Geithner deserves a pat on the back , Hank Paulson a kick in the rear .
Goldman Sachs has announced the redemption of its TARP warrants for $ 1.1 billion .
Including dividends , taxpayers will have made a 23 percent annualized return on their TARP investment in the firm .
That ’s not bad considering the great terms Goldman received when Paulson issued the warrants in the first place .
Compare the terms to those Warren Buffett received when Berkshire Hathaway made a similar preferred investment in Goldman .
We got a 5 percent dividend yield .
Buffett got 10 percent .
We were able to redeem our preferred shares for only 100 percent of their par value .
Buffet can redeem his for 110 percent .
The strike price on Buffett ’s warrants is $ 115 , the strike price on ours is $ 122.90 .
In the end we made a 23 percent annualized return while , according to Linus Wilson , assistant professor of finance at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette , Buffett ’s annualized return through July 13 was 105 percent .
Despite the poor terms , we actually did OK .
According to Wilson , the deal for Goldman warrants “ is the best one taxpayers have gotten to date . ”
Previous warrant redemptions have n’t been very favorable for taxpayers .
Here we at least got fair market value .
While it ’s good news that Goldman has paid back TARP , taxpayers should n’t be fooled into believing that the bank is operating free of public support .
The bank has borrowed $ 28 billion at below - market interest rates courtesy of FDIC ’s debt guarantee program ; it received $ 13 billion directly from taxpayers to make good on AIG investment guarantees ; and then there ’s the various emergency lending facilities provided by the Federal Reserve to which Goldman still has access .
And these are just the explicit forms of support that Goldman gets .
As a “ too - big - to - fail ” bank , all of its private obligations carry an implicit taxpayer guarantee .
Because taxpayers continue to insure Goldman ’s liabilities , we need a greater degree of control over the firm ’s assets .
Hopefully regulators exercise this control and exorcise the bank ’s high - risk trading business .
If Goldman guys want to keep running their hedge fund , they should do it somewhere else — not within a federally insured institution .
The web is a perfect playground for lots of creative designers and developers .
Static HTML is just boring and these days the user wants to see some more eye candy from / on the web .
By using and / or combining awesome web techniques like JavaScript ( and of course , jQuery ) , CSS ( 3 ) and Flash ( or Adobe Flex ) this kind of interaction can be achieved .
Since “ the sky is the limit ” with these techniques , the programmers can get really creative and innovative .
Some really like to take it to the next level and want to show off their use of the technique , even if it does n’t have any practical use .
These Proof of Concepts are just created because they CAN .
Most of them are just really for fun or just beautiful to watch .
These PoC’s ( or experiments ) show off some serious power and potential , but do n’t have any real practical use ( yet ) .
They ’re insanely cool to watch , but really seek some better use .
Although not a real experiment , Chris Coyier shows the use of one often forgotten CSS trick using background - attachment .
When checking the demo and resizing the browser , a blurry effect is added by using two images .
Simple , yet effective and this one could actually be implemented more .
Sadly , I have n’t seen it anywhere ( yet ) .
No :
It ’s not a 3d render created with fancy software that you see below .
It is an actual JavaScript “ monster ” .
This wicked Javascript experiment really shows some potential of a functional 3d engine .
Simply check out the demo and be amazed .
The monster is growing , rotating , resizing en you have the power to have influence on it .
BallDroppings is an addicting and noisy play - toy .
It can also be seen as an emergence game .
I first met this program while browsing some cool Mac Apps , but the JavaScript version works just as well .
Balls fall from the top of the screen and bounce off the lines you are drawing with the mouse .
They play a melodic sound when they bounce of the lines .
Useless , yet very addictive and fun .
You got to love these useless JavaScript experiments .
This one , from Kelvin Luck , allows you to load an image and split it to pieces .
The pieces move away when hovering with your mouse , as if they are afraid .
Yet another fun experiment .
This JavaScript experiment has the tagline Possible More Cool Than You Think It Will Be .
When I first stumbled on that page , I really did n’t know what to expect .
After launching the project and creating child windows , I was absolutely stunned .
This experiment allows the user to throw a ball across several windows !
I ’m not sure if this will ever become useful in the future , but it sure is an awesome demonstration of some JavaScript power .
Just like BrowserBall , this JavaScript experiment manipulates the windows of your webbrowser .
This proof of concept is really cool , since it is a bit more interactive .
First , you ’ll need to enable your microphone and grant access to the app .
Launch the app , speak and ( or let others ) be amazed .
Toby Pitman saw a real good experimental use of the CSS3 rotate property .
By combining this CSS3 property with some great jQuery , he managed to create a fully working old school clock in your webbrowser .
Now that ’s something really creative .
It ’s amazing wot CSS can do .
This example of a CSS Puzzle really shows that .
Walk through the maze with your mouse and be amazed .
Not by how difficult the maze is , but just by keeping in mind this example is fully written with CSS without a single line of JavaScript .
This example is actually more than a regular proof of concept .
This jQuery plugin could really be used .
DragCaptcha is created to drag a specified icon on a certain spot to determine if the visitor is an actual human .
This fun experiment is not really userfriendly ( when does CAPTCHA ever become userfriendly ? ) , but it still shows an amazing technique .
Yet another CSS Proof of Concept that really could be used in the wild .
Nick La shows a simple , yet effective technique to decorate an image gallery .
This trick , using only CSS and some images , could make any image gallery outstanding .
With the coming of the iPhone and the rise of Mac OS , gestures have really become part of our lives .
This example shows an image gallery that fully works on the gestures that you make with your mouse .
You can even download this experiment and implement it on your own website !
Sadly , this experiment is n’t that useful , still it does demonstrates an awesome technique .
Check out this sweet little CSS trick from WebDesignerWall .
Creating images from your text , just to achieve a nice gradient , is n’t very search friendly .
Also , the user is n’t able to select the text .
This simple proof of concept shows a way how you can change your normal headings into some fancy gradient headings .
If you do n’t like gradients , there also is a Grunge effect of this technique .
With the use of the jQuery easing methods , Gaya Kessler created a sweet Proof of Concept to simulate some actualy gravity in your webbrowser .
Cut the strings and see the blocks fall down , bouncing up and down untill they stop .
As you could have expect , this has no practical use ( yet ? ) , but it really adds some fun to your website .
Craig Wilson shows an amazingly simple technique using the CSS3 selection property to hide messages on your webpage .
Just read the article , check out the demo and select some text .
You ’ll clearly be able to see the hidden message ; A great way to add sumliminal messages to your site .
This is one technique that I actually do n’t really like .
Not because of the crazy code you would have to write to achieve it , but just because it does n’t look that fancy .
With CSS Image Text Wrap , you can wrap your text around an image , giving the user the feeling that it ’s created outside the box model .
To wrap your text around an image , simply think outside the box !
I absolutely love the parallax effect , it just gives the browser a whole new dimension .
jParallax , a jQuery plugin , allows you to create this effect and act on mousemovement .
Althouh some websites make use of this technique , it could be used in more ways .
If you ’re a MooTools lover , there also is a Mootools version : mParallax .
What ?
Placing an OS inside your webbrowser ?
What ’s the use of that ?
None ( just like creating the iPhone for your browser is useless fun ) !
It just shows the power of jQuery and brings some beauty of the OS to your browser .
Harley did a great job converting a big part of the Leopard Desktop to a webpage , just to show that he can .
Some parts might be useful , most parts of the tutorial are just for fun .
Did you ever thought you could create an actual 3D cube using only CSS ?
Paul Hayes managed to create this effect using the CSS3 transform properties .
Combined with the transition property , these cubes can move too :
All without the help of any JavaScript .
These kind of experiments could give the web a whole new dimension .
A great example using the CSS parallax effect to create an awesome illusion .
You would simply have to check out the demo and be amazed .
You can also learn how to create such an effect of your own to use in any of your future projects .
There are no real practical uses that I can think of , still it ’s pretty cool to see .
Another creative CSS3 and jQuery experiment .
Although pretty cool to use when the CSS3 options are n’t enabled , the real fun of this application is the rotation of the polaroids .
It simply gives you more feel , as if you ’re really tossing those pictures around .
Combined with a neat look , this example could be used when CSS3 will be more of a standard .
For now , this is a real cool proof of concept .
The article from Anthony Calzadilla starts with Why ?.
Like I said in the start of this article , the answer is : Just because it can !
Check out this cute little robot moving and bouncing on your script , mainly using jQuery .
His detailed tutorial even explains how he created the little fella .
Chris Coyier once again makes the name of his website – CSS - Tricks – proud .
Another kind of Secret Message , but now the user only sees the message when scrolling down .
Very easy to implement and use , but not really userfriendly .
Still once again showing some unique uses of CSS .
I learned this little trick from Jacob Cass .
Click on the background of the Facebook website and press the following : Up , Up , Down , Down , Left , Right , Left , Right , b , a , enter , click .
Check it out :
An awesome lens flare !
The combination of pressing the keys is the Konami Code .
Useless ?
Kinda .
Fun ?
Absolutely .
Do you know any proof of concepts out there that are really awesome , but are n’t on the list ?

I ’m not much of a fan of stand - up comedy as an art - form ( or whatever you ’d call it ) , but one guy that I ’ve always thought was really funny is Patton Oswalt .
If you ’re unfamiliar with his stand - up , then you ’ll know him as the voice of the lead rat in Pixar ’s Ratatouille .
See ?
Funny dude .
Well now he ’s headlining a dark - ass drama written and directed by Robert D. Siegel , who supplied the script for Darren Aronofsky ’s The Wrestler .
It looks like it may be a pretty solid character drama , but it looks pretty damn depressing to boot .
The trailer is right below , should you desire to check out the surprisingly solid acting chops of Mr. Oswalt in action .
The film opens in limited release on August 28 .
The genome of complex organisms is stashed away inside each cell 's nucleus , a little like a sovereign shielded from the threatening world outside .
The genome cannot govern from its protective chamber , however , without knowing what 's going on in the realm beyond and having the ability to project power there .
Guarding access to the nuclear chamber is the job of large , intimidating gatekeepers known as nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) , which stud the nuclear membrane , filtering all of the biochemical information passing in or out .
In new research , scientists have for the first time glimpsed in three dimensions an entire subcomplex of the NPC ; it 's the key building block of this little understood and evolutionarily ancient structure , an innovation fundamental to the development of nearly all multicellular life on earth .
The findings , by Martin Kampmann , a graduate student in John D. Rockefeller Jr. Professor Günter Blobel 's Laboratory of Cell Biology , add details to an unfolding picture of cellular evolution that shows a common architecture for the NPC and the vehicles that transport material between different parts of the cell , called coated vesicles .
As early as 1980 , Blobel proposed that internal membranes of cells - such as those encompassing the nucleus and vesicles - evolved from folds or invaginations of the outer cell membrane .
Rockefeller scientists Brian Chait and Michael Rout suggested in a 2004 paper in PLoS Biology that both the NPC and vesicle coats , which contain similar protein folds , evolved from ancient membrane - coating proteins that stabilized these primordial internal membranes .
" So far , it 's been unclear how these ancient folds work in the nuclear pore complex " , Kampmann says .
" Now we can see that the α - solenoid folds form long , flexible arms and hinges that end in the more compact , globular β- propellers .
The same architectural principle is found in clathrin , a common component of vesicle coats . "
In research to be published online Sunday in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology , Kampmann isolated and purified samples of the most fundamental building block of the NPC known as the Nup84 complex , which is composed of seven proteins .
The entire NPC - enormous by molecular standards - consists of 30 different kinds of proteins .
Focusing on the Nup84 complex , Kampmann used an electron microscope ( EM ) to take thousands of images of the complex in different states or conformations , which could reflect a role in the expansion and contraction thought to facilitate the passage of various sized molecules through the NPC .
By computationally averaging these many different views , he reconstructed the first three - dimensional models of the Nup84 complex .
Finally , based on prior work in the Blobel lab using X - ray crystallography to determine the exact atomic structure of individual proteins in the Nup84 complex , he plugged these proteins snugly into the EM structure .
" Because the nuclear pore complex is probably too big and flexible to determine its entire atomic structure by X - ray crystallography , I think this three - dimensional EM approach could be a big help in solving the whole thing , " Kampmann says .
" It allows us to put the crystal structures that we do have in context . "
Kampmann is applying the EM approach to other subunits in hopes of fleshing out the overall picture of one of the most mysterious machines in molecular biology .
" Martin 's data represent an important advance toward piecing together the structure of the NPC , " Blobel says .
Given the central role of the nuclear pore complex in the most basic cell processes , defects in its assembly , structure and function can have lethal consequences .
Its proteins have been associated with viral infection , primary biliary cirrhosis and cancer .
An understanding of how the complex works could lead to treatments for these diseases , and also reveal the evolutionary coup that led to the gene - protecting structure found in every cell more complicated than the simplest single - celled microorganisms : the nucleus .

Details on the company 's legal threats and the truth about Rockstar after the jump .
Facebook closed the groups Rockstar complained about and , in some cases , deleted the user 's account entirely .
Change.org and other bloggers have removed their posts to avoid litigation .
Our Terms of Service gives us the copyright for the version of Michael 's post we published .
We have offered Rockstar 's lawyers a correction to the post , but we 've refused to remove it .
The guest post is currently the most popular article on the site .
In April , guest blogger Michael Jones reported on Rockstar energy drink 's connections with well - known homophobic radio host Michael Savage ( real name : Michael Weiner ) .
About a week ago , Rockstar 's lawyers came calling and threatened legal action if we did n't immediately remove the offending post for " factual inaccuracies . "
The beverage company took issue with two sentences from our guest blogger 's post .
It claims they are untrue and should cause the post to be removed from the archives .
UPDATE : Over the course of the last few weeks , Bilerico Project and Change.org have worked closely with Rockstar Energy Drink to take concrete steps on addressing LGBT rights .
We are pleased to announce though these discussions a bold agreement was reached between Rockstar and several LGBT rights organizations .
This agreement resulted in significant changes to Rockstar Energy Drink 's corporate practices to reflect LGBT - friendly policies , and also saw more than $ 100,000 distributed to four LGBT organizations through a multi-year , systemic gift .
More details here .

Why Does Rockstar Want to Sue Bilerico Project ?
Rockstar 's lawyer complained to me that Michael 's article contained two inaccurate sentences and that the gist of the article was " Michael Savage is a filthy creep and he has deep connections with Rockstar energy drink . "
While the attorney made it perfectly clear he agreed Savage was a disgusting pig , it was unfair to the company to link Rockstar with Savage just because Michael Savage 's son , Russell Weiner , is the current CEO of RockStar .
The two sentences they specifically disputed are :
It [ Rockstar Energy Drink ] was co-founded by conservative radio host Michael Savage .
and
Michael Savage is reaping profits from the selling of Rockstar Energy Drink .
According to Rockstar 's attorney , Savage only advised his son on the drink and not the company .
They dispute that Savage directly profits from sales of the energy drink as well .
Michael Savage 's Facebook group now contains this disclaimer : " ( in no way affiliated with ROCKSTAR * ENERGY DRINK , the world 's most POWERFUL energy drink ! ) "
Who 's Rockstar Energy Drinks ' Daddy ?
When he's not saying that transgender people are " freaks " who are " begging " to be the victims of violence , that lesbians are the equivalent of Nazis who make him " reach " for his " glock " when he sees them ( especially if they 're butch ) , that the " homosexual mafia " is " raping " children 's minds , that gay men should " get AIDS and die , " or advocating the mass murder of Muslim people , Michael Savage is one of " the leading herbalists in the world . "
Rockstar 's website used to tout Savage 's skills on their information about the company page .
" I was very fortunate to have been raised by two of the leading herbalists in the world , Dr. and Mrs. Michael Weiner , Ph.D. ...
From my earliest walking days , I remember exploring the jungles of the South Pacific on expeditions with my parents .
...
My family has taken that spirit and experience - their lifetime journey - and developed the most complete , most unique , most powerful , and most honest energy beverage ever created : RockStar . "
- CEO Russell Goldencloud Weiner
Savage denied co-founding either the drink or the beverage to the San Francisco Chronicle in May 2009 .
After San Fran Mayor Gavin Newsom 's gubernatorial campaign returned a $ 25,000 donation by Weiner , Savage told the paper , " I had nothing to do with the founding or creation of Rockstar . "
Weiner also says that the old promo copy notwithstanding , there 's no connection either .
He told the Chronicle that he'd started the company " with $ 50,000 of my own money .
It has nothing to do with my dad .
He 's not an officer ... he's not the founder or the creator . "
Russell Weiner shares his father 's political views .
When introducing Savage at a concert , young Weiner shouted : " Who 's heterosexual and proud ? [...]
If you 're not , hopefully you will be soon ! "
He then referred to Michael Savage as " our leader . "
The apple does n't fall far from the tree ; together they co-founded the extremely conservative organization , the Paul Revere Society .
If you go to the Rockstar website , the page with CEO Weiner 's compliments for the " leading herbalists " is gone .
If you try to look at an archived version , you get the following message : " We 're sorry , but access to http://web.archive.org/web/20021211144041/ www.rockstar69.com/new/rockstar.html has been blocked by the site owner via robots .

Does Michael Savage Make Money From Rockstar Energy Drinks ?
While it 's unclear whether he 's making royalties off his recipe , Savage does n't have an official role with the company .
He does n't draw a regular paycheck from the beverage maker .
Savage 's wife Janet Weiner , however , brings home what I can only imagine is a hefty paycheck as the company 's listed director , treasurer and secretary .
She is also listed in Nevada state filings as the director , treasurer and secretary of Michael Savage 's entertainment company , Savage Productions .
According to the Nevada Secretary of State , both Rockstar Energy Drinks and Savage Productions are registered at the same street address and mailbox .
Janet Weiner is the only other listed officer other than CEO Russell Weiner .
Janet herself has n't been free from controversy , either .
She famously yelled with her husband that San Francisco was " this filthy , drug- ridden vermin city . "
Does Michael Savage directly profit from the sale of Rockstar energy drinks ?
His lawyers insist that he does n't .
Does his household profit from the sale of Rockstar energy drinks ?
Unless his wife is working for free , he and his wife keep separate bank accounts and finances , or she gives her wages to charity , there 's income flowing back into the Michael and Janet Weiner household .
Why Threatening Bloggers Is a Bad Idea
When Rockstar 's lawyer gave me a jingle , I was polite but firm .
I told him under no circumstances would we be willing to remove the post .
The Editorial Team had a meeting and , like the New York Times does for corrections , we 're willing to put up a correction / update on the post to clarify the two sentences they dispute .
The attorney was n't happy with that result and accused me of not being apologetic enough .
He also said I was holding up a successful resolution of their threat to sue Michael Jones .
As I explained to him , we own the copyright to the article now and not Michael Jones .
It 's our decision and he can't force us to remove the post either .
Holding him hostage for our decision is not only cowardly , but wo n't fly legally .
Instead they 've ticked me off enough that I 'm willing to detail what they 've done to Bilerico Project and other bloggers and Facebook users .
I 'm not the only one telling the tale either .
The Wikipedia entries for both Michael Savage and Rockstar Energy Drink have now been updated to include the story of Rockstar vs Internet .
One goes so far as to suggest that the unintended consequences of Rockstar 's intimidation tactic will be the Streisand Effect - the more you try to suppress something online , the bigger the chance it will go viral as more and more people want to see the forbidden fruit .
To bastardize an old saying about attacking a newspaper reporter , you do n't pick a fight with a guy who buys digital ink by the gigabyte .
Instead of doing the right thing - distancing themselves publicly from Savage 's statements and highlighting inclusive steps they 've taken to ensure their employees and customers are n't discriminated against - they 've chosen to go on the attack .
Because now Rockstar has the clarification they wanted from Bilerico Project .
I 'll update the old post to reflect the updated information with a link to this post .
I hope Rockstar is happy with the result .
In this tutorial , we are going to build a blog page using next - generation techniques from HTML 5 and CSS 3 .
The tutorial aims to demonstrate how we will be building websites when the specifications are finalized and the browser vendors have implemented them .
If you already know HTML and CSS , it should be easy to follow along .
Before we get started , consider using one of our HTML5 Templates or CSS Themes for your next project — that is , if you need a quick and professional solution .
Or you could try one of the experienced developers on Envato Studio who can help you with a wide range of custom HTML5 and CSS projects .
Otherwise , it 's time to dig into these techniques .
1. HTML 5
HTML 5 is the next major version of HTML .
It introduces a bunch of new elements that will make our pages more semantic .
This will make it a lot easier for search engines and screenreaders to navigate our pages , and improve the web experience for everyone .
In addition , HTML 5 will also include fancy APIs for drawing graphics on screen , storing data offline , dragging and dropping , and a lot more .
Let 's get started marking up the blog page .
2. Basic Structure
Before we begin marking up the page we should get the overall structure straight :
In HTML 5 there are specific tags meant for marking up the header , navigation , sidebar and footer .
First , take a look at the markup and I 'll explain afterwards :
It still looks like HTML markup , but there are a few things to note :
In HTML 5 , there is only one doctype .
It is declared in the beginning of the page by <! doctype html > .
It simply tells the browser that it 's dealing with an HTML - document .
The new tag header is wrapped around introductory elements , such as the page title or a logo .
It could also contain a table of contents or a search form .
Every header typically contains a heading tag from < h1 > to < h6 > .
In this case the header is used to introduce the whole page , but we 'll use it to introduce a section of the page a little later .
The nav -tag is used to contain navigational elements , such as the main navigation on a site or more specialized navigation like next / previous - links .
The section - tag is used to denote a section in the document .
It can contain all kinds of markup and multiple sections can be nested inside each other .
aside is used to wrap around content related to the main content of the page that could still stand on it's own and make sense .
In this case we 're using it for the sidebar .
The footer - tag should contain additional information about the main content , such as info about who wrote it , copyright information , links to related documents and so on .
Instead of using divs to contain different sections of the page we are now using appropriate , semantic tags .
They will make it a lot easier for search engines and screen readers to figure out what 's what in a page .
3. Marking Up the Navigation
The navigation is marked up exactly like we would do it in HTML 4 or XHTML , using an unordered list .
The key is that this list is placed inside the nav-tags .
4. Marking Up the Introduction
We have already defined a new section in the document using the section tag .
Now we just need some content .
We add an id to the section tag so we can identify it later when styling .
We use the header tag to wrap around the introductory h2 element .
In addition to describing a whole document , the header - tag should also be used to describe individual sections .
5. Marking Up the Main Content Area
Our main content area consists of three sections : the blog post , the comments and the comment form .
Using our knowledge about the new structural tags in HTML 5 , it should be easy to mark it up .
Marking up the Blog Post
Go through the markup and I 'll explain the new elements afterwards .
We start a new section and wrap the whole blog post in an article - tag .
The article tag is used to denote an independent entry in a blog , discussion , encyclopedia , etc. and is ideal to use here .
Since we are viewing the details of a single post we only have one article , but on the front page of the blog we would wrap each post in an article - tag .
The header element is used to present the header and metadata about the blog post .
We tell the user when the post was written , who wrote it and how many comments it has .
Note that the timestamp is wrapped in a - tag .
This tag is also new to HTML 5 and is used to mark up a specific place in time .
The contents of the datetime attribute should be :
The year followed by a figure dash ( a minus sign to you non-typography nerds )
The month followed by a figure dash
The date A capital T to denote that we are going to specify the local time
The local time in the format hh: mm:ss
The time zone relative to GMT .
I 'm in Denmark which is 1 hour after GMT , so I write +01 .
If you were in Colorado you would be 7 hours behind GMT , and you would write - 07 .
Marking up the Comments
Marking up the comments is pretty straight - forward .
No new tags or attributes are used .
Marking up the Comment Form
Several enhancements to forms have been introduced in HTML 5 .
You longer have to do client - side validation of required fields , emails , etc .
The browser takes care of this for you .
There are new two new types of inputs , email and url .
Email specifies that the user should enter a valid E-mail , and url that the user should enter a valid website address .
If you write required as an attribute , the user cannot submit an empty field .
" Required " is a boolean attribute , new to HTML 5 .
It just means that the attribute is to be declared without a value .
Marking up the Sidebar and Footer
The markup of the sidebar and footer is extremely simple .
A few sections with some content inside the appropriate aside - and footer - tags .
You can view the final , unstyled markup here .
Now for the styling .
6. Styling with CSS 3
CSS 3 builds upon the principles about styles , selectors and the cascade that we know so well from earlier versions of CSS .
It adds loads of new features , including new selectors , pseudo - classes and properties .
Using these new features it becomes a lot easier to set up your layout .
Let 's dive in .
Basic Setup
To start off with we are going to define some basic rules concerning typography , background color of the page , etc .
You 'll recognize all of this from CSS 2.1
First we reset margin- and padding - styles with a simple rule .
In a production environment I would use a more complete CSS Reset such as Eric Meyer 's ( for CSS 2.1 ) but for the scope of the tutorial this will do .
We then tell the browser to render all the new HTML 5 elements as block .
The browsers are fine with elements they do n't recognize ( this is why HTML 5 is somewhat backwards compatible ) , but they do n't know how those elements should be rendered by default .
We have to tell them this until the standard is implemented across the board .
Also note how I 've chosen to size the fonts in pixels instead of ems or % .
This is to maintain the progressive nature of the tutorial .
When the major browsers one day are completely finished implementing HTML 5 and CSS 3 we will all have access to page zooming instead of just text resizing .
This eliminates the need to define sizes in relative units , as the browser will scale the page anyway .
See what the page looks like with the basic styling applied .
Now we can move on to styling the rest of the page .
No additional styles are required for the header , so we 'll go straight to the navigation .
7. Styling the Navigation
It is important to note that the width of the body has been defined as 940px and that it has been centered .
Our navigation bar needs to span the whole width of the window , so we 'll have to apply some additional styles :
We position the nav-element absolutely , align it to the left of the window and make it span the whole width .
We 'll center the nested list to display it within the boundaries of the layout :
Now we 'll define some additional styles to make the navigation items look prettier and align them to the grid the layout is based on .
I 've also included a style for highlighting the page the user is on , and some custom styling for the subscription - link .
8. Styling the Introduction
The markup for the introduction is pretty simple : A section with a heading and a paragraph of text .
However , we 'll use some new CSS 3 tricks to make it look more appealing .
We are using two new properties .
The first one is background - size , which allows you to scale the background - image .
In our case , we scale it to 100 % on both axes .
If the box expands as we add more content to it , the gradient background will scale as well .
This is something that was not possible in CSS 2.1 without non-semantic markup and miscellaneous browser issues .
The second new property is border - radius , which applies rounded corners to the element .
The radius of our rounded corners are 22px in every corner .
You could specify different values for each corner or choose to only round individual corners .
Unfortunately , neither of the properties are fully implemented into the major browsers .
However , we can get some support by using vendor - specific attributes .
Background - size is supported by newer versions of Safari , Opera and Konqueror .
Border - radius is supported by newer versions of Safari and Firefox .
Since we have a background - color defined , there will be no major problems in browsers that do n't support background - size , such as Firefox .
Now we just need to style the heading and the text .
The flower image can be added easily by giving # intro a second background image , something that CSS 3 supports .
We give the two background images explicit dimensions to ensure that they do n't overlap , and we 're set .
Note the shorthand notation of background - size .
Unfortunately , no browser reliably supports this yet , so we 'll have to do it the old - fashioned way : by including an inline image and positioning it using CSS .
See the final example to see how it was done .
9. Styling the Content Area and Sidebar
The content area and sidebar are going to be aligned beside each other .
Traditionally you would do this by using floats , but in CSS 3 we are going to use tables !
" What ?!
Tables ? " you might ask and look confused .
You probably learned years ago that using tables for web layout is a big no - no , and it still is .
You should never use the table - element to mark up a layout .
However , in CSS 3 we can make elements behave like tables without it ever showing in the markup !
To start off with , we 're going to need some divs to group the sections in a little more logical manner .
Everything still makes sense semantically , but now we can style it .
We want the #content div to behave like a table , with #mainContent and aside as table - cells .
With CSS 3 , this is very easy :
That 's all !
No more floating , faux column background images , clearing or collapsing margins .
We 've made the elements behave like a table , and this makes it much easier for us to do layout .
10 . Styling the Blog Post
The styling of the post header is rather trivial so I 'll skip to the fun part : the multi-column layout .
Multiple columns
Multiple columns of text was previously impossible without manually splitting the text , but with CSS 3 it's a piece of cake , although we have to add a div around the multiple paragraphs for this to work with current browsers .
Now we can add two simple properties and call it a day .
We want 2 columns and a gap of 22px between the columns .
The additional div is needed because there is currently no supported way of making an element span more than one column .
In the future , however , you 'll be able to specify the column - span property , and we could just write :
Of course the column - count and column - gap properties are only supported by some browsers , Safari and Firefox .
We have to use the vendor - specific properties for now .
Box shadow
If you look closely at the image in the blog post you 'll see a drop - shadow .
We are able to generate this using CSS 3 and the box - shadow property .
The first " 3 px " tells the browser where we want the shadow to stop horizontally .
The second " 3 px " tells it where we want the shadow to stop vertically .
The last " 7 px " is how blurred the border should be .
If you set it to 0 it will be completely solid .
Last but not least we define the base color of the shadow .
This color is of course faded , depending on how much you blur the shadow .
It probably comes as no surprise that this property is not implemented in all browsers yet .
In fact , it only works in Safari , and you have to use the vendor - specific property .
11 . Zebra-striping the Comments
Zebra-striping , or highlighting every second element in a series , has traditionally involved selecting all the elements via javascript , then looping through them and highlighting all the odd elements .
CSS 3 introduces the pseudo - class " nth - child " , which makes it ridiculously simple to do this without javascript .
We 'll use it to zebra -stripe the comments .
The weird value " 2n+1 " is actually pretty simple if you understand what it stands for :
2n selects every second item .
If you wrote 3n it would select every third item , 4n every fourth item , and so on .
The +1 tells the browser to start at element 1 .
If you are familiar with programming you probably know that all arrays start at 0 , and this is also true here .
This means that element 1 is actually the second element in the series .
Alternatively , you could simply write :
Since the standard includes the two most used values as shorthand , odd and even .
The rest of the comment styling should be simple to understand with your new knowledge .
Styling the Comment Form , Footer and Sidebar
A couple of CSS 3 techniques are reused in the styling of the comment form , footer and sidebar .
In the comment form and the footer I 've used the same type of table layout technique used in the main layout .
In the sidebar border - radius is used to add rounded corners to the different sections .
12 . The Final Design
See the final design with all styling applied .
Compatibility
The page renders correctly in Safari 4 and newer webkit - based browsers , as it is the only rendering engine that supports all of the CSS 3 techniques we have used .
Firefox 3 has some problems applying rounded corners to our flower image and it does n't support background - size , but besides that the layout works .
I 've chosen to ignore Internet Explorer as it requires a bit of hacking to get HTML 5 to work .
You could also define some more rules and get everything working across major browsers , but all of this is outside the scope of the tutorial .
Conclusion
When HTML 5 and CSS 3 are one day implemented in all browsers it will be a lot easier to build websites .
We 'll finally be able to stop using floats for layout ( which they were never meant to be used for ) , and we will spend considerably less time writing javascript to scale our background images or zebra -stripe our tables .
Hopefully we will use all this extra time to study some long - neglected areas of web design , like front end optimization and proper information architecture .

More woes for newly homeless Ruth Madoff , who was last reported to be staying with a friend on Long Island .
Trustee Irving Picard 's going after that last $ 2.5 million .
Patrick Fitzgerald , Wall Street Journal :
The court - appointed official in charge of recovering money for Bernard Madoff 's investors is suing Ruth Madoff for more than $ 44 million , claiming she lived a " life of splendor " on the gains from the fraud perpetrated by her husband .
Irving Picard , the court - appointed trustee , Wednesday sued Ruth Madoff , 68 years old , for at least $ 44.8 million , saying she " knew or should have known " that vast sums of money she received from her husband 's investment firm -- Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , or BLMIS , -- rightly belonged to the firm and to her husband 's customers .
" For decades , Mrs. Madoff lived a life of splendor using the money of BLMIS 's customers , " Mr. Picard said in a lawsuit filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan .
" Regardless of whether or not Mrs. Madoff knew of the fraud her husband perpetrated at BLMIS ... she received tens of millions of dollars from BLMIS for which BLMIS received no corresponding benefit or value and to which Mrs. Madoff had no good faith basis to believe she was entitled . "

A 72 - year - old woman in Texas has threatened to sue police after an officer " tasered " her with an electronic stun gun .
Deputy constable Chris Bieze stopped Kathryn Winkfein on a Highway , where they had a confrontation over a speeding ticket .
The policeman 's superior , Sergeant Major Gary Griffin , said Mrs Winkfein " made a very simple interaction with the police a very difficult task " , but Mrs Winkfein denies being argumentative .
Dinosaurs and People :
We 've already seen that , based on God creating both land animals and Adam on day six , that the Bible is saying that dinosaurs and people must have lived together .
Based on the Bible , is it possible that people and dinosaurs lived together ?
Would n't the dinosaurs just eat all the people ?
The Bible tells us what animals , including dinosaurs , ate .
During day six of creation God said : " Behold , I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth , and every tree which has fruit yielding seed ; it shall be food for you ; and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to every thing that moves on the earth which has life , I have given every green plant for food ; and it was so .
" - Genesis 1:29 - 30 NASB )
God created Adam and Eve , and all the animals as vegetarians !
All of the animals , including dinosaurs , eat plants .
But , what about those BIG , sharp teeth ?
Take T - Rex for example , certainly he was a meat eater .
Big , sharp teeth do not mean an animal is a meat eater .
Bears have teeth that are big and sharp , similar to a lion's .
Yet many bears are mostly vegetation .
Chinese Pandas have very sharp teeth .
They need those sharp teeth because bamboo , their only food , is very hard to chew .
There are numerous examples of animals that only eat plants , and that have very sharp teeth .
An animal with big , sharp teeth just means that it is an animal with big , sharp teeth - - nothing more .
So , Adam and Eve did not have to worry about being eaten by dinosaurs .
By the way , it not until Genesis 9:3 , just after Noah 's flood and about 1500 years after Adam and Eve were created , that God gives the animals to man as food .
From that point on people started eating meat .

As Microsoft prepares a new streaming music service in the U.K. , and a new report indicates a sharp decline in downloads among teenagers in favor of sites like Pandora , what 's an artist to do ?
Reinvent the distribution business , course .
Industry execs may fret about declining traditional sales , but some enterprising artists and labels have devised new ways to sell music that give fans something to collect , even in an age when the music itself can be infinitely duplicated for free .
Or when the cloud makes the very idea of collecting and owning music seem quaint .
It 's a lesson the industry has been learning for about a decade now :
If you can't sell music , sell something else .
( Hey , it beats complaining about " kids today " and their utter disrespect for copyright . )
From soup cans to sonic Buddhas , there is life beyond the stream .
Here are 10 of our favorites .
( Feel free to add your own suggestions below . )
1. Max Tundra 's Limited Edition Kosher Chicken Soup
Purchasers of Domino Records artist Max Tundra 's 2008 album , Parallax Error Beheads
You , have four formats to choose from : compact disc , vinyl , digital , or as a $ 19 soup can that comes with a download code .
Domino calls this " the new kosher format , " due to the nature of the chicken soup contained inside the customized label .
In addition to a food item that can be consumed in the event of lapsed fandom ( or nuclear winter ) , fans who choose the soup can format also get an exclusive digital compilation of Max Tundra 's friends covering his songs .
All of the songs are in the 320 Kbps DRM - free Mp3 format .
Soup cans were assembled by the artist in some sort of sweatshop ( – video ) .
__ 2 . Mogwai's " Tracy " Music Box__Scottish guitar band Mogwai gave its fans ( the author included ) a real treat in the form of a professionally - constructed metal music box that plays their song " Tracy " when you wind a little crank on the side .
It helps that this song 's haunting melody lends itself particularly well to the music box treatment , so other bands considering something similar might also want to choose songs with a simple melody that repeats in the time it takes for a music box 's axle to complete a full revolution .
( Shockingly , this does n't appear to be on eBay , and I 'm working remotely so I could n't take a photo ; this one comes courtesy of plastikwrap . )
__ 3 . Interactive ( Remixable ) Albums__The first artist we spotted to sell an interactive version of an album that allows fans to customize it differently each time they listen was Deadmau5 , whose iPhone app for that purpose blew us away in February .
Another , more popular artist whom we agreed not to name ( update : it 's Soulja Boy Tell ' Em ) plans to offer three songs in remixable iPhone app form Tuesday , and we expect the trend to continue .
But then again , we would say something like that , having been first ( that I know of , anyway ) to predict that iPhone apps would change the way music is sold .
Note to record labels :
It 's more difficult to pirate a remixable iPhone app album than it is to pirate an unprotected CD .
One variant of this idea is selling music as a videogame ( Beatles : Rock Band ; Tap Tap Revenge : Nine Inch Nails Edition ) .
__ 4 . The Mos Def Music Tee__For a mere $ 39 , you too can purchase Mos Def 's latest album , The Ecstatic , in a wearable T - shirt format that , like Tundra 's soup can , comes with a unique download code for grabbing the tracks online .
When Invisible DJ and LNA Clothing unveiled this release strategy with Downtown Music ( updated ) , it was unclear whether Neilsen SoundScan would be able to track sales of the album , because the organization is used to counting sales of discs , not apparel .
However , a compromise was made : redeemed codes will count towards Billboard 's digital albums chart .
Labelmates Santigold and Miike Snow also plan on releasing music T - shirts soon , Invisible DJ has one too , and Amanda Blank is next .
__ 5 . Cheap Trick 's 8 - Track Tape__Releasing an album on 8 - track tape may not have constituted an innovative approach back in the ' 70s , but in 2009 , it 's a bona fide publicity stunt .
Cheap Trick , in a nod to their status as rockers " of a certain age , " are selling their latest album , The Latest , in the ancient 8 - track format , believed to have been the format of choice during the Pleistocene era .
In addition to the $ 30 8 - track , the band is also hawking golf balls , license plate frames , watches , backpacks and bandanas , but those do n't come with music .
If you 'd like to see what an 8 - track player looks like , check out Stephen Colbert 's model in this Colbert Report clip .
__ 6 . Visual Art ( Album and Other ) __When people talk about musicians as " artists , " they generally mean recording artists , but some bands have a strong visual sense that presents the opportunity to bundle other artwork along with music .
Stones
Throw records is a fine example of this approach , offering a $ 100 print by Quasimoto , a $ 68 art book featuring paintings by the guy who makes Madlib 's album covers with three exclusive songs on vinyl , a $ 50 Quasimoto action figure , and $ 10 heart - shaped vinyl version of Mayer Hawthorn 's Just Ain't Gonna Work Out .
My brother 's band , Javelin , is considering an elaboration on this approach in their upcoming release for Thrill Jockey Records : hand - making every album cover using re-purposed vintage album covers , giving each fan a unique copy of the music and saving money on manufacturing .
__ 7 . The FM3 Buddha Machine__The Chinese experimental band FM3 has mystified countless music store shoppers with their FM3 Buddha Machine , which they claim houses a tiny Buddha who emits nine magical drones .
Either the Buddha ( or , more likely , a flash memory chip ) sends these tones to a small speaker .
The first edition became so popular that the band later released a 2.0 version , and now they 've even turned it into an iPhone app .
Variants of the dedicated - device strategy include the U2 iPod and the Journey / Zvue MP3 player .
__ 8 . Cassettes__Now that all the cool kids are listening to vinyl , even cooler kids are moving on to another analog format that has the advantage of portability : the audio cassette , which stores music magnetically on a thin strip of tape .
We 've heard lots of anecdotal evidence that the cassette is making a comeback , and sure enough , SXSW " it " band The Dirty Projectors are selling cassettes that come with download codes .
Lucky Dragons ' website contains the offer " cassettes now available in MP3 form , " and cassette culture is generally on the rise everywhere we looked .
( Photo : Marc Arsenault )
__ 9 . Blatant Patronage__One of the stranger musical acts to emerge from the Bay Area over the past decade or so is The Towne Dandies , a ( mainly ) one - man rock opera that puts on highly original shows about pirates , American Indian gambling centers , the fall of the British Raj , and other themes .
Towne Dandies frontman Geoff Ellsworth carried his unique way of thinking into the business end of his music by offering to compose and record a custom answering machine message .
All you need to send him is $ 50 and some details to include .
Considering this man's way with words , melody and humor , it could be money well spent .
After all , how many of your friends have managed to commission songs for their voicemail messages ?
( Ellsworth also offers to create customized slogans for $ 35 .
Example : " When robots fight , people win . " )
__ 10 .
Flash Memory__Ever since Trent Reznor had USB sticks containing his music placed in bathrooms at his shows , flash memory has shown promise as a method for distributing music .
After transferring the music onto their computers , fans can use the USB memory stick for whatever they want – or they can leave the files on there , to keep them in " mint " condition .
The concept has since spread to Sony , which released a 25th - year - anniversary edition of Michael Jackson 's Thriller album on a 2GB Micro Vault Click Drive , and SanDisk 's slotMusic program , which promises to make digital music as easy as dealing with a collection of really , really small compact discs .

Motor madman Bob Maddox is back with a twin - engine jet bike that makes the raucous rocket he rode last year look tame .
He recently bolted a dual - exhaust pulse jet engine to the side of an ordinary bicycle , donned a leather jacket and helmet and then held on tight as he peeled off a 73 - mph run down a deserted back road .
And we thought he was crazy when he hit 50 mph on one of his single - engine contraptions last year .
" When you get up to 60 or so , you 're thinking ' I really do n't want to know how fast it will go , ' " he told Wired.com .
Strong words from a guy who used to jump out of planes with a pulse jet strapped to his chest .
Pulse jet technology dates to the beginning of the 20th century when it was developed in Sweden .
Germany used pulse jets during World War II to propel its V - 1 " buzz bombs . "
The exceedingly simple internal combustion engines ignite a mixture of air and fuel in " pulses " that occur about 70 times a second .
They 'll run on just about anything .
Maddox , an artist and cabinetmaker in Medford , Oregon , started playing with pulse jets eight years ago .
He built a sweet purple pulse jet cruiser last year for a collector in the Netherlands .
His latest creation is beautifully retro-looking machine based on a 2005 Electra cruiser .
It weighs 85 pounds and gets its power from a pair of pulse jets .
Why two ?
Why not ?
" This bike has two [ engines ] , although it is really one engine with two tail pipes , " Maddox said .
" I stacked two 60 - pound thrust engines and opened a hole between the combustion chambers and that makes them cycle as one . "
The new engine also has a push - button starter and throttle .
Did we mention it 's loud ?
Forget your earplugs and you 're as good as deaf .
A pulse jet at full throttle can pop your eardrums .
" Those Harley guys with the short pipes do n't even come close the the noise this thing makes , good or bad . "
Despite the lopsided engine placement and the skinny bicycle wheels , Maddox says the ride is pretty smooth .
" People wonder if it pulls to one side .
It does not , " he said .
" The wheels have heavy spokes and the tires are aired to 65 pounds with heavy tubes , [ so ] there is no vibration and I feel real safe buzzing around at 50 or so . "
This bike is headed for the Netherlands .
Maddox is already working on his next project - a drag bike he estimates will have 1,400 pounds of thrust and " should be the fastest in the world . "
We 'll keep you posted .

1947 : Pan American World Airways begins the first regularly scheduled around - the - world passenger service .
Pan Am , already an innovator in passenger aviation , was the undisputed doyenne of American carriers when it began this unique worldwide service .
Flight 001 , originating in San Francisco , winged westward over the Pacific Ocean .
A passenger boarding 001 at San Francisco Municipal Airport ( it did n't become San Francisco International until 1955 ) and making the entire journey would touch down in Honolulu , Hong Kong , Bangkok , Delhi , Beirut , Istanbul , Frankfurt , London and finally New York .
Eastbound Flight 002 , originating in New York , hit the same cities in the opposite direction , ending up in San Francisco .
An economy - class ticket for the entire journey in either direction cost $ 2,300 , or $ 4,000 for a couple .
( That 's about $ 22,000 and $ 38,000 , respectively in today 's moolah . )
The beauty of the service was that it really could be a journey :
You could disembark anywhere along the route and remain there for as long as you desired ( provided that the entire trip was completed within a 180 - day window ) , then resume your passage when the flight came through again .
If you chose to remain on board without disembarking , the entire westbound flight took about 48 hours .
Pan
Am , already renowned for opulent passenger accommodations dating from its China Clipper days , configured its globe - trotting Lockheed Constellations for maximum passenger comfort .
Today 's utilitarian 747s and A300s are way bigger and way faster , but they 're flying cattle cars compared to the luxuries enjoyed by mid-century sojourners .
Of course , those people were journeying , and not merely traveling .
Although Pan
Am continued to blaze trails in the airline industry — it was the first airline to add the Boeing 747 to its fleet — by the 1970s it found its unassailable position being chipped at by various competitors , including TWA , Braniff and United .
The 1973 Arab oil embargo was another heavy blow to the industry , and Pan Am — already tottering a bit — was hit especially hard .
Pan
Am , the most storied airline in U.S. history , continued struggling and finally filed for bankruptcy protection in January 1991 .
It was only delaying the inevitable .
Flights 001 and 002 were already a memory , and by the following December , Pan Am as the world knew it was history , too .

Many depleted fisheries are making good progress to recovery .
Overexploitation has left many fisheries drastically depleted .
Rudy Kloser , CSIRO
Fisheries scientists and conservation ecologists have put aside their differences to collaborate in a study of overexploited commercial fisheries .
They say that such ecosystems can be revived and managed sustainably with existing techniques , but that these measures are being patchily applied around the world .
The study marks a rare consensus between the two fields .
Both recognize that overfishing is a serious problem , but have disagreed strongly on how bad the situation is and what the most effective remedies might be .1,2
Now , researchers from both sides of the debate have come together in a collaboration led by ecologist Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , and fisheries scientist Ray Hilborn of the University of Washington , Seattle .
They conclude that efforts to rein in overfishing are beginning to show success in several ecosystems , but they have n't yet reversed the global trend of depletion for individual fish stocks3 .
" It was quite surprising that the exploitation rate was decreasing in a number of ecosystems , " says Worm .
" This shows that we do n't need to wait for someone to come up with a magical cure for exploitation .
We already have the tools . "
“ Here are some fisheries that work .
Why are n't they all like that ? ”
Daniel Pauly
University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada
Daniel Pauly of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada , says that it was " very daring for [ Hilborn and Worm ] to come together .
There were many , including me , who thought nothing would come out of this because of the animosity between the two of them . "
" Of course there should never have been a conflict there in the first place , " he adds .
" When a stock is exploited , it 's as bad for ecology as for fisheries . "
Reaching consensus
The conflict had climaxed in 2006 , when Worm suggested that all fisheries could collapse by 20484 .
Hilborn and others argued against the apocalyptic prophecy by highlighting fishery success stories5 .
" The controversy highlighted that there were two very different views , " says Worm .
" We 're both motivated about improving the state of fisheries , so we wanted to find some consensus of where we are and where we 're heading . "
The 21 authors of the new paper , published in Science , came together in a working group supported by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis , based at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
They built comprehensive datasets , compiling three types of fish assessments : fisheries catches , research surveys and individual stock assessments .
“ The biggest surprise was how much progress had been made in the regions viewed as the ' bad boys ' of fisheries . ”
Ray Hilborn
University of Washington , Seattle
They then ran the data through ecosystem models to calculate the proportion of fish that could be caught while achieving the greatest yield for species across the ecosystem — known as the multi-species maximum sustainable yield ( MMSY ) .
The authors focused on ten well - characterized ecosystems .
In five overfished ecosystems , they found that fishing rates had declined since the 1990s to a level at or below the MMSY , which had allowed some depleted stocks to recover .
The five rebounding ecosystems ( Iceland , Newfoundland –Labrador , the northeast US shelf , southeast Australian shelf and California current ) all used different combinations of traditional management practices , including gear restrictions , closed areas and quota reductions .
No room for complacency
" The biggest surprise was how much progress had been made in the regions viewed as the ' bad boys ' of fisheries , " says Hilborn .
" This shows that we have the tools to manage fisheries , and they work quite well . "
But the picture was n't entirely rosy : about two - thirds of the world 's stocks are being fished beyond their maximum sustainable yield .
Hilborn believes that this ongoing decline is " not for lack of scientific understanding " , but a result of competing economic pressures and poor management enforcement .
" The findings demonstrate that the gap between what we could do and what we actually do is enormous in most of the world , " Pauly says .
" Here are some fisheries that work .
Why are n't they all like that ?
Particularly for Europe and Japan , where all the conditions are there for reasonable fisheries . "
Worm says he has more hope than he did in 2006 , but " there are still enormous problems in much of the world , where there 's less management and less reinforcement , " he adds .
" We ca n't be complacent . "
A post on ruby - core reports on the plans for Ruby 1.9.2 , from a meeting of some of the Japanese Ruby team .
The final 1.9.2 release is planned for the end of 2009 ( 25th December ) , the first preview will be out by July 17th , in time for the japanese Ruby conference Ruby Kaigi 2009 .
Next to changes in the standard library , 1.9.2 might contain changes and improvements to the VM :
* improvement of YARV opcode set .[..]
* debugger support [..]
* profiler support [..]
* dtrace support on FreeBSD , OpenSolaris and OSX .[..]
Adding support for debugging / profiling instructions might enable fast debugging ( see an overview of the state of Ruby debuggers ) .
The 1.9.2 codebase also contains new optimizations ( discussed by Koichi Sasada at RubyConf '08 ) , which might be turned on by default in the final release .
Another potential change :
I hope to include the following features into the 1.9.2 .
But they might take too many time for deciding their specs and implementing them .
* SQLite as a standard library [ ruby - dev:38463 ]
With Ruby 1.9.2 on the horizon - are you planning to switch to Ruby 1.9 .x ?
Small Wind Sucks , Test Finds
July 29th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
Interestingly , while big wind can generate far cheaper power than big solar , small wind turns out to do quite the opposite .
A comparative turbine test performed over the last 12 months in Zeeland , Holland revealed that small wind turbines generate very little power for the money .
The smaller the rotor , the less power .
So I did some comparisons between small wind and solar .
I found something surprising .
Small wind could cost 10 times the cost of residential solar to make the same power .
The energy yield was measured in an average wind speed of 8.5 mph over the year .
Here are the results , translated for the U.S. reader , with the comparative solar costs :
( If you are European , the original measurements in meters etc can be found here at LowTechMagazine )
The smallest one they tested is barely in the energy business : at $ 6,129 to make 6 kwh a month , doing nothing but give green energy a bad name .
Ampair 600 ( 3 foot rotor blades ) was the next size up : for $ 12,710 it makes only 20 kwh a month .
( Or you could pay almost 3 times that – $ 30,107 to get pretty much the same output from the Turby . )
Airdolphin at $ 24,747 ( or the WRE 030 for twice that at $ 41,620 ! ) to get 33 kWh a month .
WRE 060 $ 52,444 for 41 kWh a month , or the ( relatively ! ) cost - effective Passaat at $ 13 , 029 to make about 48 kWh a month .
Skystream at $ 15,149 makes 176 kWh a month
Montana ( 16 foot rotor ) costs $ 26,359 and makes 224 kwh a month .
If you wanted to zero out your usage you would need a lot of these turbines !
It almost makes more sense to think of these tiny turbines as the power equivalent of individual panels in a solar array .
Here in the US electricity use ranges from an incredibly low 200 kwh a month ( if you are a frugal treehugger in a tiny house ) up to to 2,000 kwh a month in your palatial mansion with those ten plasma TVs .
To see how much power you would need to generate , look at your electricity bill .
Somewhere in all that fine print that keeps you from understanding all those billing charges is the usage in kwh per month .
Now see how many kwh a month you get from one turbine .
Divide your usage need by the turbine output to see how many you ’d need , then multiply the turbine cost by the number of turbines needed :
Even our frugal treehugger would need 10 Ampairs at $ 12,710 each to make 200 kwh a month .
200 kwh a month from Ampaires : $ 127,100 ! — Solar ?
About $ 15,000
By contrast , solar panels to make 200 kwh a month would cost about $ 5,000 ; installed with inverter about $ 15,000 , before rebates which cut that in about half .
The rotor spans of the tested wind turbines ranged from 3 feet to 16 feet .
The largest was more cost effective than the smallest .
But wind turbines with a rotor diameter of 16 feet are not safe on most roofs !
But if it is small enough to fit on a roof ; it is not generating enough energy to be worth doing .
Keep your residential roof for a green roof , pv , or a solar hot - water system .
It is perfectly possible to 100 % power a house with a solar array that ’s about the size of your living room and kitchen put together on your roof .
But with wind power ?
Not possible .
Near the test site , ironically almost by way of illustration of how to do it right , is a humongous wind turbine , churning out real power for the neighborhood cost - effectively .
That huge turbine supplies local needs for a per household average of $ 6,441 !

SAO PAULO , BRAZIL – The mystery of what happened to Air France flight 447 continues .
The Brazilian Air Force said none of the debris they had recovered from the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday belonged to the missing Airbus .
Officials said a cargo pallet recovered by helicopters was not from the missing plane .
In addition , the " jet fuel " slicks spotted in the area were not jet fuel , but likely oil from a passing ship , Air Space Control Department Brig .
Gen. Ramon Borges Cardoso told reporters Thursday .
“ We have not recovered any parts of the aircraft so far , ” General Borges Cardoso was reported as saying .
" The oil that we found today was not airplane fuel ; it was from a ship .
It was oil , not kerosene . "
A Brazilian Air Force official confirmed Cardoso ’s statement and said a detailed communiqué would be released later .
The Brazilian military has spotted other debris from the air , including what appears to be a 23 - foot ( seven - meter ) chunk of metal , an airline seat , and several large brown and yellow pieces that Cardoso said probably came from inside the plane .
But there 's been no confirmation yet that any of that debris spotted 340 miles ( 550 kilometers ) northeast of Brazil ’s northern Fernando de Noronha islands has been recovered or identified as from the Air France flight 447 , which disappeared on Sunday night with 228 passengers aboard .
Until now , Brazilian officials say , the focus was on finding survivors .
But none have been spotted , and the military will now start picking up debris in an attempt to identify the plane , they say .
More than Just Law Enforcement
The first involves duties traditionally carried out by the armed forces in Mexico , such as technical intelligence collection and maritime and aerial monitoring and interdiction .
These tasks are well - suited to the armed forces , which have the equipment , training and experience to perform them .
These are also key requirements in the country 's counternarcotics strategy , considering that Mexico is the primary transshipment point for South American - produced cocaine bound for the United States , the world 's largest market for the drug .
The second category includes traditional civilian law enforcement and judicial duties .
Specifically , this includes actions such as making arrests , prosecuting and convicting defendants and imposing punishment .
With the exception of the military routinely detaining suspects and then turning them over to law enforcement authorities , the tasks in this second category have remained mainly in the hands of civilian authorities .
The final category is more of a gray area .
It involves tasks that overlap between Mexico 's armed forces and law enforcement agencies , and it is the area over the last few years in which the Mexican military has become increasingly involved .
It is also the area that has caused the most controversy , primarily due to the fact that it has brought the troops into closer contact with the civilian population .
Drug - crop eradication and meth - lab seizures .
In addition to being the main transit point for U.S. - bound cocaine , Mexico is also estimated to be the largest producer of marijuana and methamphetamines consumed in the United States .
The U.S. National Drug Intelligence Center estimates that more than 17,000 tons of marijuana were produced in Mexico during 2007 , most of which was smuggled into the United States .
Similarly , seizures of so - called meth superlabs in Mexico over the last few years — some capable of producing hundreds of tons annually — underscore the scale of meth production in Mexico .
The destruction of marijuana crops and meth production facilities is a task that has been shared by both the military and law enforcement under Calderon .

Immigration and customs inspections at points of entry and exit .
Thorough inspections of inbound and outbound cargo and people at Mexico 's borders have played a key role in some of the more noteworthy drug seizures during the last few years , including the country 's largest cocaine seizure at the Pacific port of Manzanillo in November 2007 .
Similar inspections elsewhere have led to significant seizures of weapons and precursor chemicals used in the production of meth .
In many cases , the Mexican armed forces have played a role in either stopping or inspecting suspect cargo .

Raids and arrests of high - value cartel targets .
Beyond simply stopping the flow of drugs and weapons into and out of Mexico , the federal government has also sought to disrupt the powerful organizations that control the drug trade by arresting drug cartel members .
Given the federal police 's reputation for corruption , highly sensitive and risky operations such as the arrest of high - ranking cartel leaders have more often than not been carried out by the military 's elite Special Forces Airmobile Group ( GAFE ) .
In most cases , the suspects detained by GAFE units have been quickly handed over to the attorney general 's office , though in some cases military personnel have been accused of holding suspects for longer than necessary in order to extract information themselves .

General public safety and law enforcement .
The rise in organized crime - related violence across Mexico over the last few years has been a cause for great concern both within the government and among the population .
A central part of the federal government 's effort to curb the violence has been the deployment of military forces to many areas , where the troops conduct such actions as security patrols , traffic stops and raids as well as man highway checkpoints .
In some cities , the military has been called upon to assume all public - safety and law - enforcement responsibilities , disarming the local police force while looking for police links to organized crime .
Another part of this militarization of law enforcement has involved the appointment of military officers — many of whom resign their commission a day before their appointment — to law enforcement posts such as police chief or public safety consultant .
A Victim of its Own Success
Outlook
U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske is in the middle of a four - day visit this week to Mexico , where he is meeting with Mexican government officials to discuss the two countries ' joint approach to Mexico 's ongoing cartel war .
In prepared remarks at a July 27 press conference with Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora , Kerlikowske said Washington is focused on reducing drug use in the United States , supporting domestic law enforcement efforts against drug traffickers and working with other countries that serve as production areas or transshipment points for U.S. - bound drugs .
Absent from his remarks was any mention of the U.S. position on the role of the Mexican military in the country 's battle against the drug cartels .
Kerlikowske 's visit comes amid a growing debate in Mexico over the role that the country 's armed forces should play in the cartel war .
The debate has intensified in recent weeks , as human rights organizations in Mexico and the United States have expressed concern over civil rights abuses by Mexican troops assigned to counternarcotics missions in various parts of the country .
The director of Mexico 's independent National Human Rights Commission , for example , has encouraged the new legislature to re-examine the role of the Mexican military in the country 's cartel war , saying that the current approach is clearly not working .
The number of citizen complaints against soldiers has increased over the last few years as the troops have become actively engaged in counternarcotics operations , and the commission director has expressed hope for greater accountability on the part of the armed forces .
Citing similar concerns , and the fact that such citizen complaints are handled by the military justice system — which has reportedly not successfully prosecuted a case in years — the independent U.S. - based Human Rights Watch has sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urging her not to certify Mexico 's human rights record to Congress , which would freeze the disbursement of a portion of the funds for the Merida Initiative , a U.S. counternarcotics aid package for Mexico .
More important than any possible funding freeze from Washington , though , is the potential response from the Mexican government .
President Felipe Calderon has emphasized that the use of the military is a temporary move and is necessary until the country 's federal police reforms can be completed in 2012 .
Legislative leaders from both main opposition parties complained last week that Calderon 's approach has unnecessarily weakened the armed forces , while the leader of the Mexican senate — a member of Calderon 's National Action Party — said the legislature will examine the role of the military and seek to balance the needs of the cartel war with the civil rights of the Mexican people .
In addition , the president of Mexico 's supreme court has said the court plans to review the appropriateness of military jurisdiction in cases involving citizen complaints against soldiers .
Domestic debate and international criticism of Calderon 's use of the military are not necessarily new .
Indeed , Calderon was defending his approach to representatives of the United Nations back in early 2008 .
However , the renewed debate , combined with recent changes in the Mexican legislature , have set the stage for a general re-examination of the Mexican military 's role in the cartel war .
And while it is still unclear exactly where the re-examination will end up , the eventual outcome could drastically change the way the Mexican government fights the cartels .
Since taking office in December 2006 , Calderon 's decision to deploy more than 35,000 federal troops in security operations around the country has grabbed headlines .
While previous presidents have used the armed forces for counternarcotics operations in isolated cases , the scope and scale of the military 's involvement under Calderon has reached new heights .
This approach is due in no small part to the staggering level of corruption among federal police .
But primarily , the use of the military is a reflection of the many tasks that must be performed under Calderon 's strategy , which is far more complex than simply putting boots on the ground and requires more than what traditional law enforcement agencies can provide .
This broad range of tasks can be grouped into three categories :
Some of the most noteworthy tasks in this final " gray " category include :
It is this final trend that has led to most of the concerns and complaints regarding the military 's role in the cartel war .
The federal government has been mindful of these concerns from the beginning and has tried to minimize the criticism by involving the federal police as much as possible .
But it has been the armed forces that have provided the bulk of the manpower and coordination that federal police agencies — hampered by rampant corruption and a tumultuous reform process — have not been able to muster .
The armed forces ' greater effectiveness , rapid deployment capability and early successes in some public security tasks made it inevitable that its role would evolve and expand .
The result has been a classic case of mission creep .
By the time additional duties were being assigned to the military , its resources had become stretched too thin to be as effective as before .
This reality became apparent by early 2008 in public - safety roles , especially when the military was tasked with security operations in cities as large and as violent as Ciudad Juarez .
Even though the Mexican military was not designed or trained for law - enforcement duties or securing urban areas , it had been generally successful in improving the security situation of the smaller cities to which it had been deployed throughout 2007 .
But by early 2008 , when soldiers were first deployed to Ciudad Juarez en masse , it became clear that they simply had too much on their plate .
As the city 's security environment deteriorated disastrously during the second half of 2008 , the military presence there proved incapable of controlling it , an outcome that has continued even today , despite the unprecedented concentration of forces that are currently in the city .
In addition to the military 's mission failures , it has also struggled with increasing civil rights complaints from citizens .
In particular , soldiers have been accused of unauthorized searches and seizures , rough treatment and torture of suspects ( which in some cases have included police officers ) , and improper rules of engagement , which have led several times to civilian deaths when soldiers mistook them for hostile shooters .
In many cities , particularly in northern and western Mexico , exasperated residents have staged rallies and marches to protest the military presence in their towns .
While the military has certainly not acted flawlessly in its operations and undoubtedly bears guilt for some offenses , these complaints are not completely reliable records of the military 's performance .
For one thing , many cartel enforcers routinely dress in military - style clothing and travel in vehicles painted to resemble military trucks , while many also have military backgrounds and operate using the tactics they were taught .
This makes it difficult for residents , during the chaos of a raid , to distinguish between legitimate soldiers and cartel members .
More important , however , is the fact that the Mexican drug cartels have been keenly aware of the threat posed to them by the military and of the controversy associated with the military 's involvement in the cartel war .
For this reason , the cartels have been eager to exploit this vulnerability by paying residents to protest the military presence and spread reports of military abuses .
As the Mexican congress and supreme court continue the debate over the appropriateness of the military in various roles in the cartel war , it is important to recall what the armed forces have done well .
For all its faults and failures , the military remains the most reliable security tool available to the Mexican government .
And continued problems with the federal police reforms mean that the military will remain the most reliable and versatile option for the foreseeable future .
Any legislative or judicial effort to withdraw the armed forces from certain tasks will leave the government with fewer options in battling the cartels and , ultimately , in an even more precarious position than it is in now .
The loss of such a valuable tool in some areas of the cartel war would force the government to fundamentally alter its strategy in the cartel war , most likely requiring it to scale back its objectives .

White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told The New York Times Obama intends to use the news conference as a " six - month report card , " to talk about " how we rescued the economy from the worst recession " and the legislative agenda moving forward , including health care and energy legislation .
Political observers said Obama is at a pivotal moment in his presidency because how he handles the healthcare issue during the next few weeks could help shape the rest of his presidency and his relationship with Congress , among other things .
" He 's got to be careful that while he ratchets up the pressure , he does n't bet his whole presidency on whether this gets done before the August recess , " said Kenneth Duberstein , who molded President Ronald Reagan 's first - term legislative strategy .
" He has a broad , broad agenda that he's in a rush to enact , and if he 's not careful he will be viewed as a steamroller who tries to get things fast and not necessarily right . "
Up and down Castlegate Avenue and other streets in East Compton , some of the garages show signs of the city ’s recent crackdown on blight .
Some gleam with fresh coats of paint .
Others have clearly undergone remodeling , with doors newly fitted into the frames .
This pleases Marlene Townes , a 45 - year resident of Compton .
She sees it as yet another sign of her city ’s transformation from nationwide symbol of urban violence and decay back into a proud , working - class city .
To Justa Ramirez and some of her neighbors , on the other hand , what has happened to their garages is an injustice with racial undertones that is taking money out of people ’s pockets at the worst possible time .
Compton is cracking down on garages that have illegally been converted into living spaces .
That includes , according to city manager Charles Evans , as many as a third of all the residents ’ garages , some of which house entire families who ca n’t afford to rent a house or apartment .
Others think the number could be even higher .

Compton , a city of about 93,000 south of Watts , is hardly unique .
Across Los Angeles County , officials estimate that hundreds of thousands of people sleep each night in quarters originally built for automobiles -- although they say it ’s impossible to know for sure how many because the units are , by their nature , hidden behind closed doors .
In a region with a deep shortage of affordable housing , officials have long struggled with what to do about illegal garage units .
Strictly enforcing all building codes could result in tens if not hundreds of thousands of people pushed onto the street , according to housing experts .
But it is not good public policy to have children and families living in unsafe units -- especially ones that do not have proper fire exits .
Los Angeles officials are considering a different approach .
City Council President Eric Garcetti said he planned to propose that one neighborhood participate in a voluntary pilot project to help residents bring illegal units up to code and get them properly permitted .
“ To me , it ’s not a question about cracking down and ripping out these units , ” he said .
“ It ’s more in a . . . difficult economic moment , how can we make these legal ? ”

But Compton city officials , pointing to a 2007 fire that killed children living in a Long Beach garage , have said the converted garages pose a health and safety risk -- and they have been putting liens on people ’s properties until they turn their garages back into spaces for cars or formally legalize them with building permits .
City officials say they do n’t know how many people have been cited , but said it has been hundreds .
In a city where tensions between blacks and Latinos have simmered for years , this has led to charges that the crackdown is not hitting the two populations equally .
“ They only apply to certain people , ” said Maria Villareal , president of Compton ’s Latino Chamber of Commerce .
“ What I see happening is . . . for those people who come in and complain about code enforcement inspecting garages , they always have a solution for the African American families .
But they do n’t have a solution for the Latinos . ”

Anita Bennett , a communications consultant working for the city , said that charge is baseless .
“ If you look at the demographics , it might look like that ” because there are more Latino residents and therefore more Latinos facing questions about their garages , she said .
“ But absolutely , there is no targeting . ”
Bennett also said officials do not want to make anyone homeless .
“ It is a question of liability , ” she said .
“ If the city knows there is an illegal conversion and they do nothing , then the city is liable . ”
Pedro Olguin , a community organizer with the Compton - based group L.A. Cause , said he wants the city to consider a moratorium on its enforcement .

“ We feel there are so many converted garages in the city that to simply do away with them and not offer an alternative that is affordable and safe creates a problem , ” he said .
Olguin , who grew up in Compton , added that many families bought their homes because the garages had been converted , knowing they would have space for extended families or be able to rent them out for extra income .
But other longtime Compton residents say that the huge numbers of converted garages create blight and parking problems , the last things the city needs as it tries to overcome a negative image arising from years of violent gang - related crime .
Last year , the city posted 38 homicides , its fewest in a quarter century -- a 50 % drop since 2005 .
Joggers and people walking their dogs have come back onto the streets ; children are back in parks ; everywhere in Compton , people are talking about the renaissance .
Advertisement
But it has also allowed residents and officials to turn their attention to issues -- including garages -- that might have seemed insignificant in years past .
“ We are focusing on every area that involves blight , ” including weed - strewn lots and vacant houses , said Evans , the city manager .
But he also said that the tragedy of the children who burned to death in the Long Beach garage “ put our city on notice that we do have a problem ” with garages .
Across town , Luis Sanchez strolled the neighborhood where he grew up , pointing out the fresh paint and scarred wood on his neighbors ’ garages -- signs that they have recently been forced by the city to be converted back .
He and his mother , Ramirez , are fighting the city ’s order .
He believes that his mother ’s garage was converted properly -- with permits that have gone missing at Compton City Hall .
Unlike many of the conversions , in which residents just hang some drywall and declare a garage a room , his mother ’s garage -- with its pastel carpet and spotless walls -- looks professionally done .

What ’s more , Sanchez said , his mother , who bought the house with the garage already converted in 1993 , has been paying property tax on the square footage that includes the garage .
And then he found an old permit application from the 1970s .
Add it all up , he said , and he believes that city officials simply lost the permit and are trying to blame his mother .
So far , the theory is not getting much traction at City Hall .

This is the first installment of what will be a weekly column entitled Ask a Shiite .
Our resident expert will be fielding questions of a philosophical , physical , and political nature in regards to Shiite Islamic belief and Middle East perception from his own eyes .
Interested in asking a question ?
Send an email to alec .
Question :
What is the overall effect of the Israeli / Palestinian conflict on Muslim perspectives of the United States role in the Middle East ?
And what is the general perception of America given the current political climate for Muslims ?
Answer :
The simple answer is that there is no difference on the US image in these circumstances except that the muslim sentiment and rage is building up and is giving us all the more reason to fight back .
This question is kind of an easy one not too detailed .
But I have still given a bit more of my opinion on this ‘ topic ’ .
This Palestinians conflict has been going on for decades and as far as I know for sure , it will not end unless the Palestinians are given back Israel .
Our opinion about the USA has been the same for quite some time .
It creates wars between countries and has been backing up Israel since the beginning because of some conspiracy .
Some of us who study this matter deeply , like me , believe that the USA and Europe are controlled by Freemasons and groups like that who want to bring about the New World Order .
Thats why they are successful and some sort of religious reason is behind the occupation of Israel .
We believe that the Palestinian occupation is absolutely illegal and to tell the truth most of us cant understand how and why you actually support Israel .
It seems to be like a no brainer to go against Israel , looking at how they were formed .
A general sentiment has been created amongst the Muslims that they are being targeted by the west because Islam teaches us the most about standing up against oppression and because we do not want the American culture to be ‘ imported ’ into our community .
Now you might ask why do Muslims commit terrorism even though we say that we are the most peaceful religion ?
Well there are some Muslims who have different opinions and thats why we are not yet totally united as should be .
Most of the terrorist attacks that take place areby a small sect called the Wahabbis .
These people I can assure you have very messed up thoughts .
Their scholars are not exactly educated and are self proclaimed .
They think they are doing the right thing but they are not because making a big decision like Jihad bis Saif ( Struggle with the sword ) requires a LOT of knowledge , experience and the matter needs to be thought out from many different perspectives with all the Islamic laws in consideration .
This is not an easy job .
There are only a few people in the world who have this ability .
Some of them are Sistani and Khamenei .
In fact I think these are the only ones who do have the ability .
So these terrorists are actually not even educated and their mental horizon is very narrow .
They do not represent Islam and their ‘ version ’ of Jihad is flawed .
For example , the 9/11 attacks were not jihad because killing travelers in jihad is not allowed , likewise todays civilian attacks are not allowed because women and children cannot be targeted and only those who openly come to challenge can be opposed back .
Racism is not allowed in Islam so killing Americans because they are Americans is not allowed .
I read one of Usama bin Laden letter on a blog and it said that he targets American civilians because their tax money goes to killing Muslims .
This is wrong because the Arab governments are the ones who actually invest in the USA , their oil money is stored in US banks etc .
So why not target Arab countries ?
Secondly during the time of the Prophet Muhammad ( A.S ) the enemy armies were surely built form tax money .
So why did the Prophet also not target civilians ?
This shows that targeting Americans is wrong .
Now up until now the only Islamic government ever formed is the current Irani Government .
It ’s decisions are monitored by Ayatollah Khamenei .
The only so called ‘ terrorist ’ group who opposes Israel rightfully is Hezbollah .
One little proof : the Qur’an says that in jihad you attack them in the right manner and we will make you victorious .
Its a promise .
Now what is Hezbollah ?
A small group of highly motivated and trained militants who fought against one fo the worlds most powerful army and guess what ?
They won !
The Qur ’an ’s promise has been fulfilled .
What are our Sunni brothers doing on the other hand ?
They have fought I think 5 wars and lost all of them .
I dont really think thats jihad .
Those wars were not thought out with Islamic guidance and so they lost .

Nouriel Roubini is peeved by reports that suggest he ’s “ improved ” his outlook for the U.S. economy .
Bloomberg has been leading with the following all afternoon / evening : U.S. stocks , oil advance after Roubini says recession will end this year
U.S. stocks rose for a fourth day , the longest streak in six weeks , as economist Nouriel Roubini said the worst of the financial crisis is over and reiterated that the recession may end this year … .
“ The optimism that people are starting to embrace is that the recession may be months away from ending , ” said David Goerz…chief investment officer at Highmark Capital Management … .
“ Even the most bearish forecasters are starting to capitulate . ”
“ Capitulate ? ” Whoa there champ .
Back the bus up .
( Roubini press release )
“ It has been widely reported today that I have stated that the recession will be over ‘ this year ’ and that I have ‘ improved ’ my economic outlook .
Despite those reports – however – my views expressed today are no different than the views I have expressed previously .
If anything my views were taken out of context .
“ I have said on numerous occasions that the recession would last roughly 24 months .
Therefore , we are 19 months into that recession .
If , as I predicted , the recession is over by year end , it will have lasted 24 months with a recovery only beginning in 2010 .
Simply put I am not forecasting economic growth before year ’s end … .
I have also consistently argued that there is a risk of a double - dip W - shaped recession toward the end of 2010 , as a tough policy dilemma will emerge next year .
On one side , early exit from monetary and fiscal easing would tip the economy into a new recession as the recovery is anemic and deflationary pressures are dominant .
On the other side , maintaining large budget deficits and continued monetization of such deficits would eventually increase long - term interest rates ( because of concerns about medium - term fiscal sustainability and because of an increase in expected inflation ) , thus leading to a crowding out of private demand .
While the recession will be over by the end of the year the recovery will be weak given the debt overhang in the household sector , the financial system and the corporate sector .
Now there is also a massive re-leveraging of the public sector with unsustainable fiscal deficits and public debt accumulation .
Roubini is rather smitten with his Vs , Us , and Ws .
It ’s kind of funny .
But he ’s dead on with his crisp description of Bernanke ’s conundrum .

For frogs , timing is everything
Amphibians around the world synchronise their mating activity by the full Moon , researchers have discovered .
This global phenomenon has never been noticed before , but frogs , toads and newts all like to mate by moonlight .
The animals use the lunar cycle to co-ordinate their gatherings , ensuring that enough males and females come together at the same time .
In doing so the creatures maximise their spawning success and reduce their odds of being eaten .
Details of the discovery are published in the journal Animal Behaviour .
Biologist Rachel Grant of the Open University was studying salamanders near a lake in central Italy for her PhD in 2005 when she noticed toads all over the road , under a full Moon .
" Although this might have been a coincidence , the following month I went along the same route every day at dusk and found that the numbers of toads on the road increased as the Moon waxed , to a peak at full Moon , and then declined again , " she says .
A review of the scientific literature found little mention of any similar records , so Grant returned to the same site in 2006 and 2007 to survey the amphibians in more detail .
She then collated her data with a 10 - year analysis of the mating habits of frogs and toads at a pond near Oxford , UK , collected by her supervisor Tim Halliday , and with data on toads and newts living in Wales collected by colleague Elizabeth Chadwick from Cardiff University , UK .
" We analysed the data , and found a lunar effect at all three sites , " Grant says .
A cue to reproduce For example , the common toad ( Bufo bufo ) arrives at all its breeding sites , mates and spawns around the full Moon .
The common frog ( Rana temporaria ) also spawns around the time of the full Moon .
" Newts also seem to be affected by the lunar cycle but the results are less clear , " says Grant .
Newt ( Lissotriton vulgaris , L. helveticus and Triturus cristatus ) arrivals peak during both the full and new moons .
But " newts appear to avoid arriving at the breeding site when the Moon is in its third quarter .
This could be because the Earth 's magnetic field is highest at that time .
More research is needed to clarify this , " Grant says .
The researchers have also looked at historical data collected in Java on the Javanese toad ( Bufo melanostictus ) and found that it too mates by the lunar cycle , with females ovulating on or near to the full Moon .
" We now have evidence of lunar cycles affecting amphibians in widespread locations .
We definitely think that Moon phase has been an overlooked factor in most studies of amphibian reproductive timing , " says Grant .
Toads also get in on the act " We think this may be a worldwide phenomenon .
However , differences between species in ecology and reproductive strategy may mean that not all amphibians are affected in the same way .
This is something we would like to investigate further . "
Grant and her colleagues now hope to produce a statistical model that takes into account weather factors and other environmental variables such as geomagnetism , as well as the lunar cycle .
Making accurate predictions of mass amphibian movements is important in their conservation , she says .
For example , roads could be closed at precise times to avoid cars killing thousands of mating frogs and toads .
" Given the current global crisis among amphibian populations , further understanding of [ their ] breeding behaviour is extremely important , " she says .

I 've developed an xmonad configuration file for using this window manager with the Palm Pre smart phone .
( I described how I run X on the Pre in VNC here . )
The tricky part is that the Pre has absolutely no keys or key combinations that can be stolen by xmonad and used as the mod key .
So at first I looked at using xmonad 's support for gestures .
That would be a perfect fit with the Pre .
But , if taps are bound to gestures with no mod key , xmonad eats them all .
Applications receive no taps !
Not good .
I also tried using a submap .
But , the key that triggers a submap never gets sent through to the application , even if none of the actions in the submap are triggered .
Xmonad could handle these things better ..
Instead , I had to use PalmVNC 's support for sending special keys via a menu .
So the mod " key " consists of tapping the Menu icon in the emulator ( on the left hand side ) and then pressing " a " .
Thus , to start a new terminal , use " Menu a x " ; to close a window use " Menu a c " ; to change layout , use " Menu a space " ; and you can read the rest of the bindings in the config file .
Of course this is just yet another rumor , as there is no official confirmation .
But we caught word that Sony is set to not only reveal the PSP
Go at E3 , but another hardware redesign will be debuted as well .
We did n’t get any specifics , but we speculate that it could be one of a couple different options .
First off , it very well could be as simple as a white or a silver PS3 , to go with the white and silver Dualshock 3 ’s that have been made available .
This makes sense , as most people would want their controllers to match their consoles .
The other option , and the one we are leaning toward is a slimmed down , model .
Maybe with some updated specs .
Nothing major of course as to not alienate current PS3 owners , but there is an off chance they could add something small like bluetooth 3.0 support .
When we caught wind of this , the exact word “ redesign ” was used , which leaves me to believe that it is indeed a PS3 slim .
Announcing a different color would n’t exactly warrant the term “ redesign ” .
Then again , since a console was n’t specified either , it could be a redesigned PS2 , or yet another PSP model ( other than the Go ) but that is highly unlikely .
There is also an off chance that this “ hardware redesign ” was referring to a PS3 Motion controller , but I really do n’t consider that to be “ hardware ” , as it ’s more of an accessory .
Sony has been known to slim down their consoles , as the original PlayStation , PS2 , and even the PSP all have seen slimmer models released after the initial model was released .
Is the market ready for a PS3 slim ?
I know I am .
Stay tuned to PlayStation LifeStyle for all your E3 coverage needs .
Something Colossal is coming soon …

One of the biggest mysteries of the Madoff affair is what happened to all the money .
Federal investigators involved in tracking Madoff 's missing billions are not even sure how much they are looking for .
The amount ranges from estimated losses suffered by investors of $ 13bn to the $ 70bn which Madoff has accepted was attributable to his unlawful activities .
So far Irving Picard , the court - appointed trustee of Madoff 's collapsed firm , has recovered just $ 1.2 bn on behalf of investors .
It is a small return for a six - month investigation that involved the US justice department , the financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission , Picard 's office and the US marshals .
If Picard is to narrow the gap between asset recovery and escalating investor losses , it now seems likely that he will have to focus more on those who did business with Madoff rather than rely on tracking down his personal assets .
Although those assets give a fascinating insight into the fraudster 's lifestyle they cover only a fraction of investors ' losses .
The preliminary order of forfeiture filed in the US courts on Friday lists an apartment in Manhattan , a retreat in Long Island and a home in Florida , worth $ 22 m in total , among the assets of Madoff and his wife , Ruth .
Add to that two luxury yachts called Bull and two small boats called Little Bull and Sitting Bull .
Throw in a couple of fur coats and crockery and cutlery valued at enough to fund an entire kitchen in most homes and the picture of their extravagant lifestyle is complete .
However , these account for a fraction of estimated investor losses in the fraud .
There are a number of theories as to where the funds have gone .
Madoff has said that he was facing redemption calls for $ 7bn of investments owing to the financial downturn this year .
Some of that was paid , but it is unclear how much .
But sources close to the investigation recognise that if the trustee is going to make serious inroads into the gap then he will need to switch his attention to those who profited from their association with Madoff .
Auctioning off two season tickets in prime seats to watch the New York Mets baseball team may catch the headlines , but has little impact on the losses incurred by investors .
The investors ' position is made more complex because many of them do not qualify for compensation from the government 's investor protection scheme .
Picard has secured $ 235 m from Banco Santander to settle claims brought by the trustee against one of its investment subsidiaries .
" We hope that other entities against which we have claims will likewise come forward to settle those claims for the benefit of all Madoff 's victims , " he said .
Rumours persist that Madoff has billions of dollars deposited with overseas banks , but if this is true they are likely to prove almost impossible to track down .
Picard has filed a complaint in the US bankruptcy court against Cohmad Securities Corporation and a number of its principals , seeking to recover well over $ 100 m allegedly paid to Cohmad in exchange for introducing clients to Madoff 's firm .
The complaint says 90 % or more of the income to Cohmad and others came from referring customers to Madoff .
" Our investigation has yielded significant evidence that , in fact , a variety of other people helped Madoff prey on innocent victims , " said David Sheehan , counsel for the trustee and a partner at Baker Hostetler , the court - appointed counsel for Picard .
Pictured : Bearded wonders gather for the hairiest contest in the world
There was a hairy moment or two at the weekend as the biennial World Beard and Moustache Competition got underway .
After a few bristly rounds , David Traver from Anchorage , Alaska , was crowned the victor for his stunning woven beard and down - turned moustache .
The prize beard measures over 20 inches long and was cultivated over a period of two - and - a - half years , before being plaited into the shape of a snowshoe .
Hair - raising : Beard - growers from across the globe gathered to show off their facial furniture at the biennial World Beard and Moustache Competition
It won Traver a commemorative gold pan and a salmon fishing trip .
It was a winning year all round for the American hosts with second place going to Benjamin Juergens from Los Angeles , for his Imperial Partial Beard , made up of a regal - looking moustache and goatie .
While third place went to Jack Passion from San Francisco in the Natural Full Beard Category for his epic ginger cloud .
Winning by a whisker : David Traver of Anchorage won first place in the contest
Furry faces : Competition winners take centre stage in Anchorage , Alaska
Facial hair in all forms , from the immense woolly mane of Albert Schmid from Team Switzerland , to the vast lip antlers of Memili Ristioglu from Istanbul , Turkey , was on show at the event in Anchorage , Alaska .
Phil Olsen , founder and captain of Beard Team USA said : ' It was a great year for beards .
The competition was stiff . '
Almost 300 of the beard and moustache elite gathered from over 11 countries for the ninth WBMC competition , which featured a variety of categories from the delicate Dali moustache to side - burned mutton chops to the outrageous full beard freestyle .
Pruned to perfection :
Many of the beards were groomed into amusing styles - and these looked like they might take an eye out
Stately : British contender Ted Sedman ( centre ) twirls his moustache
Follically blessed :
These bushy beards are some of the best
Keith Haubrich won first place in the ' freestyle moustache ' round for an asymmetrical creation of spikes and loops .
Loopier still was Willi Chevalier of Sigmaringen , Germany , who took the ' partial beard freestyle ' category for the eighth time with his ' facial hair pretzel . '
Other teams included the newly formed Australian Bushrangers , and London 's famous Handlebar Club .
The last competition was held in Brighton in 2007 and was won by the bewhiskered Elmar Weisser from Brigachtal , Germany , for his hairy portrayal of Tower Bridge .
Team Germany : Lutz Giasa , left , and Karl - Heinz Hiller , both of Berlin , flew themselves and their facial hair to Anchorage
Father Christmas style : Tim Slade , left , seems proud of his Santa - like beard while , right , Bob Gengler would give Harry Potter character Rebeus Hagrid a run for his money with his brown bushy look
Snack break : Dick Lacey , left , and Jake Craig , right , both of London grab a sandwich ahead of the beardy parade
Elmar , from the ever - dominant German Swabian Beard Club also stole the show in Berlin 2005 for his furry Brandenburg Gate .
The 18 whiskered winners will return home with trophies but all proceeds go to charity because , in the world of competitive facial hair , honour is the only reward .
Judging is not based entirely on technical merit , as dapper clothing and a gentlemanly attitude are also revered .
While one beard might be technically superior , it 's the ones that move the judges ' spirit that triumph .

Over the past two decades , string theory has been touted as the best chance physics have of combining quantum mechanics with general relativity .
This would essentially set the basis for the long - sought - after Unified Theory of Everything ( UTE ) , which would include all the four essential forces in the Universe – gravity , electromagnetism , and the strong and weak nuclear forces .
While its success has been limited until now , physicists have recently announced that they may have found a way to explain superconductivity using strings .
When materials become superconductors , usually at either very low or very high temperatures , their internal structures are modified to the extent that they exhibit zero electrical resistance values , and their interior magnetic field is excluded .
This means that an electrical current , once introduced in a superconductor , can flow in a loop indefinitely , with no external power supply .
This makes accumulating electricity very easy and enables a wide range of scientific applications in high - energy physics , where enormous amounts of current are needed to get things going .
At a workshop held this month at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics , in Santa Barbara , California , physicists from the Harvard University , led by Condensed - Matter Theorist Subir Sachdev , argued that they discovered a way to explain this behavior that materials had , using string theory .
The paper presented at the meeting , which is not even in pre-print at this point , “ suggests that we are on the verge of understanding a new state of matter using a string - theory description , ” Sachdev said , quoted by Nature News .
Kavli Institute String Theorist Joseph Polchinski , who has been a co-organizer of the workshop with Sachdev and Harvard University postdoctoral researcher Sean Hartnoll , believes that this theory could be used to explain the flow of electrons in high - temperature superconductors in very much the same way it was employed to explain phenomena occurring inside black holes .
The key technique from string theory that was used is the one that allows for the expression of content from a higher dimension in an inferior one .
The principle can be compared to a hologram , where 3D data is stored in a 2D layer .
There are , however , critics to string theory .
They do not say that it does not work , but merely that the wave of enthusiasm sweeping physicists may be unfounded .
“ Just because a model works in one context , does n't mean you can unify physics and get a fundamental theory of reality , ” Columbia University Mathematician Peter Woit , who is an outspoken string theory critic , said .

BBC News , Beijing
CCTV has built a landmark new building in Beijing China is launching an Arabic - language TV channel to show the Middle East and North Africa the " real " China .
China Central Television 's station will broadcast news , entertainment and cultural programmes 24 hours a day .
It is part of the Chinese government 's plan to promote its own viewpoints by encouraging state - controlled media organisations to go global .
Beijing , while saying that some foreign broadcasters misrepresent China , tightly restricts its own media .
' Distorted views '
" It is imperative for us to be a multi- language , multi- faceted and multi- perspective broadcaster , " said Zhang Changming , vice - president of CCTV .
Speaking at a launch event , he added : " [ We hope ] the world can know China and China can know the rest of the world even better . "
CCTV already has four international channels that broadcast in English , French and Spanish , as well as Chinese .
The new Arabic channel will be accessible for nearly 300 million people in 22 Arabic - speaking countries from 25 July .
CCTV will present the world with the real China
Zhang Changming
Vice - president , CCTV
The broadcaster declined to comment on how much the channel was costing and how many viewers it is hoping to attract .
It will have an initial staff of about 80 and is being fronted by Arabic - speaking Chinese presenters .
Mr Zhang made it clear that the aim was to counter some of the " distorted " views about China that are put out by a number of foreign broadcasters .
" Our principle is to be real , to be objective , to be accurate and transparent .
CCTV will present the world with the real China , " he said .
He did not mention that Chinese media outlets are routinely censored by the government and face tight restrictions about what stories they can cover .
Expansion plans CCTV also plans to launch a Russian - language channel in September and is not the only Chinese media organisation to have expanded .
In April the Chinese - language Global Times newspaper launched an English edition with the aim of promoting Chinese people 's views to foreigners .
China has long complained about what it says are biased and unfair reports about the country carried by foreign media outlets .
There was a government - backed campaign against the " prejudiced " foreign media last year following the unrest in Tibet , which led to death threats to some foreign correspondents based in China .
But China is not the only country broadcasting to the Middle East .
Last year the UK's BBC launched its own publicly funded Arabic TV channel .

» Ten WW2 Photos in Color
Ten WW2 Photos in Color
Contributor : C. Peter Chen
Color photography was introduced to the world prior to the 20th century , but even by the WW2 - era , black - and - white photography was still the norm .
Although color photos were not extremely rare , they came few and far in between .
The result was that , since we typically expect WW2 - era photos to be in shades of gray , the impact of those in color was far greater on the viewers .
With nearly 7,000 photographs in the WW2DB collection at the time of this writing , I compiled a list of ten interesting color photographs from the WW2 - era for your enjoyment .
What do you think ?
Be sure to leave a comment and let me know .
This photo of battleship USS Arizona erupted in an explosion is arguably one of the most memorable photographs from the Pearl Harbor attack .

Every new computer in China will have the software installed China has defended the use of new screening software that has to be installed on all computers .
Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the software would filter out pornographic or violent material .
Critics have complained that it could also be used to stop Chinese internet users searching for politically sensitive information .
But Mr Qin , speaking at a regular press briefing , said China promoted the healthy development of the internet .
All computers sold in China - even those that are imported - will have to be pre-installed with the " Green Dam Youth Escort " software .
' Poisoned minds '
The news came in a directive from China 's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology , and the new regulations will come into force on 1 July .
The directive says the newest version of the software has to be pre-installed on Chinese - made computers before they leave the factory .
Imported computers must contain the software before they are sold .

The aim is to build a healthy and harmonious online environment that does not poison young people 's minds , according to the directive .
Mr Qin defended the move on Tuesday : " The purpose of this is to effectively manage harmful material for the public and prevent it from being spread , " he said .
" The Chinese government pushes forward the healthy development of the internet .
But it lawfully manages the internet , " he added .
The Chinese government regularly restricts access to certain internet sites and information it deems sensitive .
The BBC's Chinese language website and video sharing website Youtube are currently inaccessible in Beijing .
Critics fear this new software could be used by the government to enhance its internet censorship system , known as the Great Firewall of China .
But a spokesman for one of the companies that developed the software , Jinhui Computer System Engineering , rejected this accusation .
" It 's a sheer commercial activity , having nothing to do with the government , " Zhang Chenmin , the company 's general manager , told the state - approved Global Times newspaper .

Questions about doping aside , there 's no taking away from what Steve Asmussen 's done in the last year .
He 's gone from the guy who takes the leading trainer crown every year at Lone Star Park to the guy who 's training the best horse in the world .
That horse would be Curlin , and earlier this year , after the 4 - year - old had won just about every race Asmussen put him in , he decided to run him on grass , just for the hell of it , against some of the best turf runners this side of the pond .
The big chestnut came up just short .
It wo n't be the last we hear from him or Asmussen .
Expect to see the Arlington resident in the winner 's circle for years to come .
We ’ve all become familiar with the word “ stimulus ” lately .
Its exact meaning is :
An agent , action , or condition that elicits or accelerates a physiological or psychological [ or , one hopes , financial — Ed. ] activity or response .
We ’re also familiar with “ stimulation . ”
But for the purposes of this post , we ’ll leapfrog over that concept to another related word , “ stimulant . ”
Actually a subcategory of stimulus , stimulant zeroes in on the variety of eliciting agent .
One of its official definitions :
An agent , especially a chemical agent such as caffeine , that temporarily arouses or accelerates physiological or organic activity .
Coffee , of course , is the stimulant of choice for most of us .
The National Coffee Association 2009 National Coffee Drinking Trends survey reveals that 54 % of adults currently indulge , about the same as in 2008 .
It further notes that :
After a quick drop at the start of the recession , the pendulum steadied for young adult coffee consumers age 18 - 24 in 2009 with 29 % now partaking in any one day .
…
Although slightly up from 2008 ’s level , the current percentage of 18 - 24 ’s who drink coffee is still significantly lower than 2007 ’s high of 37 % that was attained after several years of steady growth .
Why the drop - off ?
Aside from cost and barring an increase in amphetamine usage , perhaps they ’ve found an alternative .
The New Yorker ’s Margaret Talbot reports in Brain Gain :
The underground world of “ neuroenhancing ” drugs :
Adderall , a stimulant composed of mixed amphetamine salts , is commonly prescribed for children and adults who have been given a diagnosis of attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder .
But in recent years Adderall and Ritalin , another stimulant , have been adopted as cognitive enhancers : drugs that high - functioning , overcommitted people take to become higher - functioning and more overcommitted .
We ’ll leave the discussion of whether these drugs are overprescribed — as well as why amphetamines are used to treat hyperactivity — for another day .
In her piece , Ms. Talbot reports that it ’s not so much elite students that use these drugs , but those who ( usually guys ) seek to experience all that college has to offer .
In other words , there ’s no way that , as a top student might , they ’ll forsake partying for studying .
In retrospect , it ’s disingenuous to think kids raised on these drugs would not only continue to use them in college , whether they still need them or not , but would extol their virtues as a study and term paper - writing aid to their peers .
As you can imagine , the students then carry usage of the drugs over to their professional lives , where they come in handy for writing reports , especially if they ’re dry like accounting .
Though she does n’t deal with possible side - effects of the drugs , Ms. Talbot points out that they tend to encourage an almost obsessive focus .
Thus is creativity , which requires a mind free to roam , liable to be shunted aside .
She also explores the ethical question of the unfair advantage users enjoy .
Never mind drugs that help us focus , most of us who study and write are content with a substance that simply keeps us awake and functioning .
In that spirit , we ’d like to know our readers ’ stimulants of choice when they perform mind work ?
Coffee ?
Red Bull ?
Amphetamines ?
To give you an example of the type of answer I ’m looking for , I ’ll seed the responses .
I once used alcohol , which is not typically thought of as a stimulant , to write .
I found it loosened the pen like the tongue .
But it ’s as if the bottle were an hour glass :
After the initial surge , as inebriation increased , I ran out of steam sooner than if I were writing without it .
Once sober , like many when they give up alcohol , I drank coffee alcoholically .
In fact , I actually contracted caffeine poisoning , as one might from too much alcohol , and dropped it like I did alcohol .
My stimulant of choice remains caffeine , but in smaller amounts : black tea .
Also , running workouts are at least as critical in replenishing energy flow and fueling my ability to focus .
Now would readers ( and fellow S&R staff ) kindly use the comments section to confide their stimulants of choice ?
If comfortable admitting it , include the amount and frequency .
Finally , have any readers used neuroenchancers like Adderall expressly to work or study ?
Armstrong has indicated he will race for his new team next year , including in the Tour , but he wants to sign riders with a view to achieving a long - term future .
And the 37 - year - old believes he can produce better form for next year 's Tour , even though he is still in the fray for a place on the podium as the 3500 kilometre race nears its finish in Paris on Sunday .
Heading into yesterday 's 40.5 km 18th stage time trial around Lake Annecy , Armstrong was in fourth place at three minutes , 55 seconds behind race leader and Astana teammate , Alberto Contador .
Contador was leading Andy and Frank Schleck ( Saxo Bank ) by 2.26 and 3.25 respectively .
For Armstrong 's own team to develop beyond the short - term while pushing the message of his global cancer awareness program , he will need rising stars such as Bobridge , who excel on track and road .
Bobridge is the Australian under - 23 open road champion and a world championship silver medallist this year in the individual and team pursuits .
" Our goal will be to continue to win the Tour for years to come .
We have to find the right person to do that , " Armstrong told the Herald in an exclusive interview before Wednesday 's 169.5 km stage from Bourg - Saint - Maurice to Le Grand - Bornand .
" I would love to have a kid like Bobridge .
He is complete and he is aggressive , which is really cool to see for a young guy - no fear .
But he needs the right program to develop him , I think . "
A major stumbling block for Armstrong if he is to recruit Bobridge is that the young rider has already signed with American team , Garmin - Slipstream , on a two - year contract .
However , Armstrong said he would closely monitor Bobridge 's progress , and would be on the lookout to sign him up when the opportunity arose .
" Oh yeah , " He said .
" After we saw what we saw in [ the Tour ] Down Under we have already signed up for that fan club ! "
Armstrong said he had held informal chats with riders during the Tour about their availability but that no direct head - hunting had been carried out .
" Not in a formal way .
Nothing has been signed with anybody , " he said .
" But I think there will be a lot of interest from the current teams and peloton . "
Armstrong said Bobridge was not the only Australian he was keen to sign , indicating he was also interested in South Australian Stuart O'Grady ( Saxo Bank ) and Victorian Simon Gerrans ( Cervelo ) , a controversial late omission from this year 's Tour .
" I know Stuey has a contract , " Armstrong said .
" I know Gerrans has a contract .
But definitely guys like that I would be interested in .
Simon , I really enjoyed training with him for a couple of weeks in June .
I know he is contracted with [ Cervelo ] for another year . "
Gerrans was desperately unlucky to be omitted from the Tour , and was stunned to hear the news after returning to France from the US where he had been training with Armstrong in Aspen .
The Australian has not spoken of any wish to leave Cervelo but Armstrong said he " would be keen to have that discussion [ if his status changed ] " .
" He is a smart rider , a scrapper .
When he gets in the right move , he is a winner .
And based on what I saw in Aspen , he is a hard worker , " Armstrong said of Gerrans , who last year won a stage of the Tour on the mountain finish at Prato Nevoso in Italy and another in this year 's Giro d'Italia .

Zed Shaw just blogged about why he uses the GPL instead of a BSD - style license .
His arguments for the GPL are interesting but I feel that counterpoint is needed , since at Enthought ( where I work ) , we try to BSD as much of our code as possible .
“ It ’s the Author ’s Right ”
First off , I ’d like to encourage everyone in the Python community to be respectful .
It is never appropriate to get angry at another person for their choice of license , and I am disappointed that Zed feels slighted by the community reaction to his work .
( If you do n’t like the license on a package , it is sometimes appropriate to ask the author if they ’d consider changing it , but obviously beggars ca n’t be choosers . )
Hopefully it ’s just a few bad apples ( “ ungrateful turds ” , as he calls them ) .
That being said , “ it ’s the author ’s right ” is not really a reason for the GPL , just an admonishment .
“ I Do n’t Want To Be Ignored Again ” / ” You Have To Tell Your Boss You ’re Using My Gear ”
The fact that Zed wrote Mongrel and got no recognition is possibly an indictment of several things : the RoR buzzstorm , the Rails community , the “ OMG Ruby is the new Java for Web 2.0 ” technorati , maybe even venture capitalists .
But it is not an indictment of the BSD license .
Numpy and Scipy are two very successful projects , and they are BSD licensed .
They have healthy communities , and many people make a living off of consulting work or commercial projects built on those tools .
There are also countless companies whose staff make use of them internally , and occasionally give back to the projects .
I would consider both Numpy and Scipy to be healthy , open - source projects with plenty of mature collaboration between commercial , academic , and hobbyist users .
If either project were suddenly to become GPL , they would lose their commercial viability and the communities would undoubtedly suffer .
SAGE , an open - source Pythonic replacement for Maple / Mathematica / Magma / Matlab , is another very successful project , but they staunchly use the GPL .
Their reasoning is much like Zed ’s , because the symbolic math software community has been burned in the past by people profiting from proprietary extensions of BSD code without attribution or contribution .
However , the GPL means that people cannot realistically use SAGE in a commercial tool , either as a platform / runtime , or as an embedded component .
The SAGE authors have , presumably , weighed the trade - offs and decided it ’s ultimately more valuable to be protected than to have the contributions of that segment of developers .
The style of license both depends on and defines the type of community that develops around a project .
If you feel that the potential audience of your project consists of the sort of people that are liable to use your code without attribution and without becoming part of the user community , then by all means protect yourself with the GPL .
If your code is the outgrowth of a community that already has a healthy number of commercial users , then there ’s usually no downside risk of using BSD , while you get the upside of reaching a larger audience .
Based on what I ’ve seen , the Python community has a pretty healthy mix of commercial developers , and so as a whole I do n’t think people there get burned by choosing the BSD license .
“ If It ’s Good , Pay For It ”
Here is where we are in agreement , but there are numerous ways to approach this .
Phil Thompson uses a dual licensing scheme with PyQT , wherein commercial developers have to pay for it .
Travis Oliphant implemented an interesting “ world price ” / community fixed - fee scheme to fund the development of Numpy : he wrote a big pile of documentation ( the Numpy Book ) and sold it until a certain total dollar amount had been reached , at which point the book became freely available .
At Enthought , we earn consulting contracts based on our BSD - licensed Enthought Tool Suite and our involvement with the Numpy and Scipy projects .
BSD / LGPL does not imply that you will not make money , and GPL does not ensure that you do .
The only way to ensure that you * do * make money is to explicitly dual license .
( Edited : as some have pointed out , dual licensing basically requires the use of the GPL with a commercial license , as BSD does not prohibit commercial use . )
“ Finally , Value ”
I think there is a very good discussion to be had about how to commercialize the success of open source .
Talented coders need to be compensated so they can afford to continue to innovate .
Users should be free to use code however they wish , with no limitations on their freedoms , because code is ultimately a form of expression .
But we need an interaction model that allows the expression of values and economic preferences without grounding certain values to zero , which is that traditional OSS licenses tend to do .
As the practice of software development matures , we simply have to find a better economic model than the traditional Stallman - Gates bifurcation .
However , I think that choosing GPL or BSD is orthogonal to whether or not you feel your work is valuable ; it is merely a way to define the kind of community you want around your project .
If the community is filled with selfish , short - term opportunists , then protect your code and yourself with the GPL .
If the community has a large , healthy contingent of commercial developers , then you ’re only hurting yourself if you shut them out .
I recognize that in the scientific Python community , we ’ve been extremely lucky to have developed the user base that we have , but I think that has largely been possible * because * we use the BSD license .
Even though gun-rights advocates in the Senate narrowly failed on Wednesday in a vote to greatly broaden the freedom to carry concealed weapons , two states acted last week to make it easier for armed gun owners to hang out with drunk people .
Last Tuesday , a new guns - in - bars law took effect in Tennessee after a judge in Nashville refused to issue a temporary injunction blocking its implementation .
A few hours later , Arizona followed suit with a measure signed into law by the state ’s governor , Jan Brewer .
The Arizona Republic reported that the governor ’s action “ expanded the rights of gun owners by allowing those with a concealed - carry permit to take their firearms into establishments that serve alcohol . ”
As my colleague Katharine Q. Seelye reported last month when the guns - in - bars bill passed in Tennessee : “ Gun-rights advocates say expanded rights are needed so that law - abiding citizens can protect themselves in more situations . ”
In this video report from Nashville , the BBC heard from Nikki Goeser , a resident who supports the new law .
Ms. Goeser told the BBC that she might have been able to prevent the murder of her husband in a bar if she had had a gun on her at the time .
In both states , there is a catch .
The new laws stipulate that armed patrons have to refrain from drinking while in the bars — in effect , creating a new category of customer , the designated shooter .
Not surprisingly , some bar owners in each state have objected to laws that leave it up to them to tell armed customers that they ca n’t drink .
Metromix Phoenix reports : “ Scottsdale bar and restaurant owner Les Corieri said he thinks the new law permitting the state ’s 137,766 carriers of concealed - weapons permits to bring firearms into bars and restaurants is insane . ”
According to the video report from News Channel 5 in Nashville embedded below , “ Many bar and restaurant owners are already taking steps to prohibit the weapons by using a provision of the law that allows them to post signs saying guns are not allowed . ”
One important correction should be made to this local television report : the anchor ’s closing statement that “ nearly 40 other states have a similar law in place ” is incorrect .
On Wednesday , The Lede spoke with David Randolph Smith , whose Nashville law firm is leading the fight to have Tennessee ’s law declared unconstitutional .
Mr. Smith says that his legal research team looked closely at the gun laws in every state , and found that there are just 14 states that issue permits allowing patrons to carry firearms in restaurants that serve alcohol .
Mr. Smith has posted the results of his legal team ’s research on his Web site , beneath this statement : “ The claim that ’ 40 ’ states have ‘ similar laws ’ to Tennessee ’s new guns - in - bars law is false and misleading . ”
In fact , Mr. Smith writes , “ because bars , saloons , nightclubs and restaurants with bar areas are notorious for fights , assaults and breaches of the peace , carrying loaded guns is expressly prohibited by law in bars , nightclubs or bar areas serving alcohol in 24 states [ 23 now that AZ changed its law ] . ”
After reviewing state gun laws in detail , Mr. Smith concluded : “ No state , by statute or regulation , expressly allowed firearms to be brought into bars until the Tennessee legislature passed ” the new law .
Mr. Smith told The Lede .
“ No state has ever said , ‘ we want you to bring a gun into where real drinking is happening . ’ ”
As The Tennessean reported this week , while industry groups “ expect roughly four out of five restaurants in the state to opt out of a new law , ” some bars and restaurants in the state are planning to allow guns , at least for the moment :
Drew Dixon , co-owner of Legends Sports Grill in Lebanon , said the restaurant is allowing guns , though it ’s doing so “ with open eyes . ”
“ We did think about it for a week or so , ” Dixon said .
“ We just said we ’ll go along with Tennessee state law unless there ’s a scuffle or , heaven forbid , anything happens . ”
Meanwhile David Randolph
Smith is pressing ahead with his effort to have the new law declared “ void for vagueness . ”
The same judge who refused to grant a temporary injunction to prevent the law from taking effect plans to hear his case soon .
In both Tennessee and Arizona , bar owners have complained to the media that their objections have been ignored by politicians looking to score points with a powerful pro-gun lobby .
Last week The Colbert Report profiled one of the political leaders of Tennessee ’s fight to get guns and alcohol in the same room :
David Randolph
Smith drew our attention to a report from Jeff Woods , a Nashville blogger , which seems to undercut the argument made by Nikki Goeser , whose husband was fatally wounded in a bar .
Last week , Mr. Woods wrote :
Since her husband was shot to death in a Nashville sports bar this spring , Nikki Goeser has become the public face of the NRA ’s campaign to make it legal for Tennessee ’s licensed gunmen to go armed into drinking establishments .
She contends that if she ’d only had a gun with her at Jonny ’s Sports Bar , she could have saved her husband ’s life . [… ]
Well , it turns out that even the folks at Jonny ’s apparently do n’t buy the NRA ’s logic .
The Nolensville Road bar is one of many that have posted signs banning handguns on their premises .
Pith called Jonny ’s and asked to speak to the owner or manager .
The guy who came to the phone confirmed Jonny ’s has banned guns but would n’t talk about it . [… ]
“ We put the signs up , ” he said , “ but I do n’t want to be quoted at all . ”
A reader who supports the new laws suggests that “ permit holders are much less likely to commit violent crimes than the general public . ”
In March a Tennessee newspaper , The Memphis Commercial Appeal , published a report headlined “ Armed and dangerous : Dozens with violent histories received handgun carry permits , ” which suggests the permit process in Tennessee may not be keeping guns out of the hands of people with violent histories .
The newspaper reported that by searching a database it had compiled — and published on its Web site — of people with permits in one local county , it had “ identified as many as 70 county residents who were issued permits despite arrest histories , some with charges that include robbery , assault , domestic violence and other serious offenses . ”
After barely a week in full - tilt operation the " Cash for Clunkers " program has been suspended .
As recently taken apart in a Mises Daily , this program is a particularly absurd example of the broken - window fallacy .
But the suspension of the program has brought even more economic absurdity .
Rep. Candice Miller breathlessly tells us " The thing has exploded .
It has exceeded everyone 's expectations . "
Before we go on let 's just pause and reflect on these people who were surprised .
Here is the amazing turn of events :
The government starts handing out free money .
People start grabbing it as fast as they can .
The bureaucrats quickly realize that they are hitting the program 's budget in mere days ( of the program being finalized ) and suspend the program .
What is the reaction to this perfectly foreseeable sequence of events ? " ... dealers were amazed ... " , " the explosively popular ... program . "
As if the program itself and the surprise at its reception were n't enough , there is one more bit of economic foolishness dolloped on like a cherry on top .
Returning to the brilliant Rep. Miller ( representative from Michigan and co-architect of the glorious program ) she is enthused at the results : " ' Throughout our history , it has been auto sales that have pulled us out of recession .
People are more likely to buy cars than houses .
Not to be too Pollyannaish , but we 're gettin ' our mojo back .
This could be the pivot ' that begins an economic recovery . "
How do you get an economic recovery going ?
Start raining free money down on everyone 's heads .
I grew up thinking that the people from the Middle Ages were idiots ...
They believed the earth was flat !
Turns out they did n't actually .
But Rep. Miller ( and how many Americans ? ) really does believe this nonsense .
I have found the Dark Ages and it is us .
The police believe Mr Cernay had cocaine A man caught with suspected cocaine worth £ 6,000 has told the High Court he thought he had bought medication for boosting his sexual performance .
Marek Cernay , 26 , said he paid £ 25 for the drug after confiding his problems with erectile dysfunction to a stranger he met at a supermarket in Coleraine .
Mr Cernay , of Lodge Road in the town , faces a charge of possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply .
Refusing bail , Mr Justice McLaughlin said his explanation was a fairy tale .
A lawyer for the prosecution told the court in Belfast that had police stopped Mr Cernay 's car on Newbridge Road , Coleraine , on 11 May .
He said bags of white powder were discovered in the vehicle , along with a number of tablets in the suspect 's pocket .
Although forensic tests are expected to take up to five months to complete , the barrister told the court that scientific information indicated 120 grams of cocaine was found .
He said that during questioning Mr Cernay claimed to have met a man in a Tesco car park and told him about his physical difficulties .
" That male then produces these four bags of powder which are worth £ 6,000 and sells them to him for £ 25 , " the prosecuting lawyer added .
Mr Cernay 's lawyer said his client , an electrician and shop fitter who came to Northern Ireland from Slovakia more than four years ago , denied knowing he was buying cocaine .
He said : " He has given a colourful explanation for being in possession of the items , but he maintains that explanation .
" He simply says he purchased them in order to enhance his sexual performance . "
But Mr Justice McLaughlin questioned the alleged circumstances of Cernay meeting someone and " within minutes discussing his erectile dysfunction , to find this man mysteriously has the answer for £ 25 " .
Refusing bail , the judge added : " This is another one for the book of fairytales and it 's going to be a long book . "

インタビュー：ラリー・ペイジ氏
グーグル共同創業者が語る 、Chrome OS に取り組むワケ
ページランク （PageRank）の名称にもその名を刻む、グーグル共同創業者のラリー・ペイジ（Larry Page）氏。1973年生まれの現在36歳。120億ドル（約1兆1400億円）の資産を持つ世界有数の富豪であると同時に、グーグルを率いる主要な経営者の1人だ。
コンピュータサイエンティストで大学教授だった父親の薫陶を受け、幼少時からコンピュータに触れて育ったというペイジ氏は、根っからのエンジニアでもある。創業から10年余り、グーグルという会社はどこへ行こうとしているのか。＠IT編集部は2009年7月23日、来日中だったペイジ氏にグループインタビューする機会を得た。
ラリー・ペイジ氏。グーグル共同創設者兼製品部門担当社長
グーグル がChrome OS に取り組むワケ
――いまグーグルについて最大の話題 はChrome OSのアナウンスです。どうしてWebの世界からこの領域へ踏み込もうと考えたのですか？
ペイジ氏 サーゲイやエリック（共同創業者のサーゲイ・ブリン氏と、現CEOのエリック・シュミット氏のこと）とミーティング中に、部屋にいるほとんどの人がWebブラウザ――そのときはFirefoxでした、だけを立ち上げていることに気付いたのです。非常に面白いと思いました。ふつうコンピュータといえば、OSがあって諸々の複雑なものがあってと思い浮かべますが、実際にはWebブラウザしか使っていないのです。サーゲイと私は、OSについて考え直すというのはいいアイデアだと非常に強く思いました。
Chrome OS の基本的アイデアは、ほとんど常にブラウザを使っているという利用ケースを念頭にOSを再設計することです。ソフトウェアのインストールや、メンテナンスを不要にする。このアイデアに、とてもワクワクしています。
私はコンピュータの値段にはあまり頓着しません。コンピュータが大好きです。でも、ソフトウェアによって制限されているのです。自分がいくつコンピュータを持っているか分かりませんが、それらのコンピュータの面倒を見なければならないということで制限されているのです。ガジェット文化の文脈で考えれば、もっと多くのデバイスを持てればいいですよね。そうするためにわれわれコンピュータ産業は、OSやデバイスを含むコンピュータが、もっとちゃんと動くようにしないといけません。もし、家の中にある50のデバイスに50の異なるOSが載ってたりしたら、頭がおかしくなりそうですよね。Chrome OSのコンセプトの1つは、コンピュータをシンプルにするというものです。
現在のネットブックは、ある意味ではすばらしいものです。
ネットブックは安いですから、人々はキッチンやお風呂場に喜んでコンピュータを置いておくでしょうし、そうなれば、これまでと違うタイプの製品が欲しくなるでしょう。これはハードウェア的にもユースケースの面でも、ネットブックなど従来の製品とは違うものです。もしこれがうまく行けば、人々はもっと多くのハードウェアを買うようになるかもしれません。ゼロサムゲームではないのです。ソフトウェアのインストールというものがなくなることで、もっとたくさんのハードウェアを所有できるんです。こうした長期的な変化は、過小評価されがちだと思います。
Chrome OS を使うことで、オフラインでソフトウェア （Webアプリケーション）を走らせることも、やりやすくなります。そうなれば、残りの5％（ブラウザ以外のアプリケーションで行う作業）も、ブラウザ上でできるようになるかもしれません。OSと聞いて思い浮かべる部分は、今よりも縮めることができて、もっと小さくなるでしょう。
Gmailをリリースしたとき、Gmailを作った人たちに、そんなのはうまくいかないよ、と言ったものです。JavaScriptで、ちゃんと動かすなんてね。ところが、うまく行ったのです。JavaScriptは、今でも難しくて最も自明のやり方というわけでもありませんが。
われわれは、コードを書く対象としてのブラウザをより良くするために、多くのことに取り組んでいます。3Dゲームだって実は書けます。こうした（高度な）ことができる必要がありますが、できるようになるのです。これは、ブラウザで動かすということではなく、いろんなプラットフォームで動くということを意味しています。
Chrome OS は社内でもメインストリームに？
ペイジ氏 グーグル でOS に取り組むというアイデアに、CEOのエリックは長らく反対の立場でしたが、最終的にはわれわれが彼を説得しました。それでAndroidとChromeをリリースしました。
エリックとの議論の焦点は、OSに取り組むというのが一大事業であるということです。われわれは大企業と思われてるかもしれませんが、従業員2万人で、人的リソースという観点では中堅でしょう。何に取り組むかという判断に慎重なのです。とはいえ、会社が100人規模だととても無理ですが、今やわれわれにもOSをうまく作れるだけの十分なリソースがあるということです。
――グーグルでは検索と広告に70％、自由な研究・開発に20％、そのほかに10％というリソース配分の比率があると聞いています。今でもそうですか？
Chrome OS はこの分類ではどこに？
ペイジ氏 それは、実はチームメンバがわれわれ（経営陣）に聞く質問でもあるのですが、答えるのが難しいのです。この件についてはあまり議論していません。おそらく20％の部分、もしかしたら70％のほうでしょうか。Chrome OSのようなプロジェクトに人々を引き入れることは難しく、エンジニアを説得しないといけません。すでに存在するものに対して小さな改変を加えるほうが仕事としては一般的です。Chrome OSは、このカテゴリ（すでに存在するプロジェクト）に属します。大きな投資をしている領域ということです。
オープンな標準にこだわる
――Linux OS の歴史から何か学びましたか？ ほか のOSとの差別化は？
ペイジ氏 ある意味では、これは 新OS ではありません――、われわれ はLinuxカーネルを採用しています 。Linuxはデスクトップでは成功していませんが、Androidを見てください、Linuxベースですが、今のところ非常に成功しています。電話端末上で見てみれば分かりますが、Linuxという感じが全然しません。AndroidはスムーズでモダンなOSのように見えます。大事なのは、UIであって、カーネルの中身ではないのです。
これまで （Linuxでは）多くの努力がカーネルに注ぎ込まれてきていて、UIのほうは忘れられていたのだと思います。
――Webプラットフォームとしては標準化も重要です。O3DやNaCl、HTML
5のCanvasやvideoコーデックなどですが、マイクロソフトは標準化プロセスに加わっていません。この点についてどうお考えですか？
ペイジ氏 マイクロソフトはずっと標準には関心がないように思います。それこそが、われわれが、われわれのやり方を通す大きな理由でもあります。
われわれは若いコンピュータサイエンティストとして成長し、いつも物事がうまく動くように望んでいました。インターネットは、企業ではなく大学が開発したオープン標準があるから存在しています。われわれはこの哲学をベースにしています。コンピュータサイエンティストとして住みたいと思うような場所です。
例えばメッセンジャーを例に取りましょう。IMが出た当初は、誰にでもメッセージを送ることができました。しかし、企業が関与するようになって、その企業（のユーザー）の間でしかメッセージを送れないように変えてしまったのです。われわれは（各社のIMを）Gmailと統合するようオープンな提案をしています。マイクロソフトもヤフーも、これに応えていません。われわれは協業できればうれしく思うのですが、彼らが興味を示したことはありません。
オープンな標準にこだわりたいのです。Chromeはオープンソースですし、Androidもそうです。われわれはユーザーに自分のデータを所有してもらいたいですし、ユーザーとしては自分のデータを自由に使いたいだろうと考えるのです。われわれはユーザーの邪魔になるような場所にいたくありません。多くの企業が、こうした考え方をしていません。
――しかし一方、サービスのコアにある実装や、インフラのソフトウェアコンポーネント、例えばBigTableとかChubbyサーバといったものは、グーグルもオープンソースで出していません。
ペイジ氏 いずれオープンソースになると思いますが、より問題なのは検索結果を操作しようというプロプライエタリなサーチのほうです……、しかし、これは確かに考えてみるべき問いかけですね。毎日使うコアの部分はオープンであるべき。それはコンピュータサイエンティストの視点から正当化できます。
必ずしもマイクロソフトとの競争のためではない
――HTML 5は肥大化して混乱していると指摘する人もいます。あまりに多くの関連技術が登場して、何がHTML 5かという点について合意されたものはありません。フラグメンテーションも起こりえます。政治的問題でしょうか？
ペイジ氏 それはいつでも問題となりますし、これといった解決法はありません。ただ、そんなに政治的なものではないと思います。Webアプリケーションをローカルに保存してオフラインで使えるようにするには、さまざまなやり方がありえますが、大まかに合意できれば、それで十分ですし。
非IEのブラウザ市場シェアが非常に伸びています。どんなWeb開発者も、これらを対象に開発していますから問題はないでしょう。あまり心配はしていません。オープンソースのSafari（WebKit）、Firefox、Chromeは、非常によくやっていて、IEとの差は開く一方です。
――Chrome OSがPCの世界で標準となって、ライセンス料を払うという罠からユーザーを解放するということを望んでいる？
ペイジ氏 それはストーリーとしては面白いですが、われわれの考え方とは違います。われわれは、こんな風に思っています。会議室にいて、誰もがブラウザだけを使っている。なのに、不要なソフトウェアがたくさんある。われわれは、コンピュータサイエンティストとして使いたいと思うような、素晴らしいものを作りたいんです。もしそれでいい仕事ができれば、ビジネスチャンスもあるでしょう。（マイクロソフトやアップルとの）競争という風に表現するのは簡単なことですが、そうではないのです。われわれは何か面白くて役立つことがしたいんです。
日本のウォシュレットは全世界のグーグル拠点に
――グーグルの日本チームに期待することは何ですか？
日本やほかの地域には、非常に大きなチャンスがあると思います。日本で何をやっているかということについて、日本オフィスのエンジニアたちと先ほどレビューをしたのですが、非常にエキサイティングなものでした。まだ存在していないものの、今後、非常に多くの人に影響を与える可能性があるようなもあります。
ギーク、またエンジニアとして、日本に来るたびに本当に驚かされます。われわれは日本のウォシュレットを持ち帰ったんですよ。今や世界中のグーグルの、かなりのオフィスに設置されています。TOTOは素晴らしいと思います。
これは取るに足りない例のように思うかもしれませんが、決してそんなことはありません。日本にはエンジニアリングとイノベーションの文化があるのです。何かを違った風にやろうという文化があって、これは非常に価値があることです。われわれはエンジニアリングの拠点を日本に置いて、ワールドワイドで使える開発を行ったことで、それを知りました。強い経済力とエンジニアリングの力、世界に少ない力を両方持つ国として、日本の将来はとても期待しています。
Google Waveは 「 会話と作業」の組み合わせ
――Google Waveによって、人々のコミュニケーションはどう変わるでしょうか？
ペイジ氏 少し背景的な話からさせてください 。Google Mapsを作ったチームがオーストラリアにいるのですが、グーグルには、こんなルールがあります。もし何か本当にすごいことを成し遂げたら、多くの自由裁量を与える、というものです。彼らは、こんなアイデアがあって、たくさん人が欲しいと言ったんですね。それでわれわれは“やってみれば”とイノベーションを起こすために多くの自由を与えました。
Wave チームは、コミュニケーションと仕事の境界をぼやけさせるような取り組みをしています。例えば何か文書を作成しますよね。誰かほかの人にもその作業に加わってもらいたい。Google Docsを使えばできますが、続いて、いつ、誰に、送るかを決めないといけません。Waveでは会話もできますし文書作成もできます。それは会話と作業の組み合わせで、境界はあいまい。同じことなんです。それがすべてリアルタイムにできるんです。
コンテンツの収益化もユーザー視点で
――YouTubeの収益化についてご意見は？
ペイジ氏 利益が出せるようになるのはすぐでしょう。それほど心配していません。ビジネスはうまく行っています。日本での成長は急激で、検索が巨大ビジネスであるのと同様に、これも大きなビジネスになると期待しています。
YouTubeには幅広い視聴者と多量のトラフィックがあって、コンテンツのプロたちとの契約もあります。どうやってマネタイズするかという点でもオープンです。
――オンライン広告だけでは、コンテンツ制作費用がまかなえないという指摘もあります。マイクロペイメントは考えにありますか？
ペイジ氏 ええ、もちろん。支払いと視聴をより手軽にするのは、誰にとってもいいことです。Google Checkout（グーグルの決済代行サービス）に力を入れているのもそのためです。もし人々に何かを買ってほしければ、それが非常に簡単でなければなりません。私自身はプレミアコンテンツを買いません。それは面倒だからです。価格はあまり気にしませんが、フォームを埋めるのが嫌なのです。具体的にどういう形になるかは、あまりこだわっていませんが、ユーザーから見て、ちゃんと使いやすいものになってほしいと考えています。マイクロペイメントなのか、バンドル方式なのか、これは非常に大きな領域ですね。人々はいいコンテンツを支援したいと考えていますし、現在お金を払いようがないコンテンツに対しても、お金を出すことにやぶさかではないでしょう。私はそうです。でも、決してお金を請求されることがないわけです。
――エンタープライズ市場のニーズは、コンシューマ市場のそれとは大きく異なります。どうやって両者のニーズを満たすのですか？
ペイジ氏 われわれは誰にでも使えるプロダクトを持っていて、これはエンタープライズでも使えます。オンラインでサインアップするだけです。企業のIT部門はこれまで、あまりユーザーにフォーカスを置いていませんでした。彼らのフォーカスは何か別のものです。
Googleカレンダーは、私の生活を変えました。大量の秘書を抱えていなければできなかったようなことが、Googleカレンダーのおかげでできるのです。妻とのやり取りもできますし、非常に便利です。社内で使っているものの一部を、ほかの会社にも出していくということはエキサイティングなことです。これは新しいことです。（グーグルのサービスを）大企業が使い始めてくれていることに本当にワクワクしています。今後もこれは加速すると考えています。
エンジニアリングや技術は過小評価されている
― ―X Prizeに取り組む理由を教えてください。
ペイジ氏 主要投資者ではありませんが 、X Prizeには、ずっと関わっています。人類月面着陸40周年を記念して、「 Google Lunar X Prize」も発表しています。月にローバーを送り込むミッションに3000万ドル（約25億円）の賞金をかけています。昔のアポロ探索の現場を見つけて写真を撮れば、追加で500万ドル（約4億7000万円）というのもあります。
面白い技術を追求することには、とても大きなポテンシャルがあると思うのです。何か難しいテーマを選んでコンテストにしましょう、と。とてつもなく大きなポテンシャルがあります。
も う1つ指摘したいのは、エンジニアリングや技術の価値が過小評価されているということです。何が世界を変えるのかと言えば、それは何か物事をするのに新しいやり方で行うような人々なのです。歴史を振り返ってみてください。われわれはみな、かつて農作業を営む必要がありました。水運びをする必要がない今の生活の質の高さを考えてみてください。こうしたことを過小評価しがちです。
革新的な製品やサービスを作ることに挑戦するエンジニアというのは、非常に限られているものです。ほとんどコストをかけずに大きなインパクトを与えるようなものです。
X Prizeでほかの分野を見てみると、エネルギー生産は非常に重要な領域です。われわれは、この分野の1つに関心を持っていて、ここで10人ほどの人を見いだしました。われわれが彼らに100万ドル（約9500万円）を渡したところ、彼らの世界は変わりました。本物のイノベーション、本物の変革に対しては、人もお金もほとんど流れていないのが現実です。

The fate of Autonet Mobile , the world ’s first in - car internet service provider , has been in some question with two of its largest partners , Chrysler and General Motors , in dire straits .
However , the company does still have partnerships in place for their “ uconnect web ” service which can be installed at select Chrysler , Jeep , Dodge and Cadillac dealerships .
And the companty did sign - on VW as a partner in June .
Most recently they have also expanded their retail operations , which previously only included a few smaller outfits like Crutchfield and Car Toys , to include the 800 pound gorilla , Amazon.com , in a new direct - to - consumer sales approach .
As such , the Autonet Mobile router is available for $ 299 after rebate .
Now they just have to figure out a way to get people to cough up $ 29 a month for service …
Reviews of the Autonet Mobile service , also known as uconnect web , have been somewhat mixed .
The consensus is that the unit is good for e-mail and basic web surfing but do n’t try and watch lots of streaming video or Skype your significant other .
Bandwidth averages around 400 kbps , your basic 3G speeds , and connection drops are rare .
Range is about 100 feet and the mobile WiFi unit it is electronically shielded from the radio and your radioactive Blackberry .
The internet router is typically mounted in the trunk and is ruggetized to survive the crappy city streets that we all have to drive on .
With ATT CruiseCast jumping into the mobile tv market look for the in - car internet segment to heat up as well .

An age - old , thinly - veiled love story involving two restless hearts separated by distance as they struggle to hold on to their undying , yet unspoken , love for one another splashed against the backdrop of big-ass robots pounding the shit out of each other .
Yep , folks , it ’s just about as good of a love story featuring gargantuan explosions as you ’re likely to get from Michael Bay .
It ’s funny , I had an opportunity to see this movie Wednesday morning at midnight , but since it ’s running time is a far outstretched two - and - a - half hours , I passed .
And then the more I read up on it ( perhaps my first mistake ) I rapidly lost interest thanks in part to the reviews from people who really ought to be laying off the sedatives before attending a movie .
So , as it was , I gave in to even my wife ushering me into the theater as she did see it at midnight with her work buddies .
And ya know what ?
Despite it ’s myriad and reprehensible flaws , it was still a fun , popcorn - munching flick that at the very least lived up to what it ultimately set out to do : harass your senses with loud , pulsating hunks of metal blowing apart scenery and robot alike with reckless abandon .
Picking up two years after the first installment , the heroic Autobots are still on earth and their new lot in life is to work undercover with the boys from the military ( Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson ) scouring the planet for hidden Decepticons and render them lifeless piles of twisted metal .
Oh , and lest you think no new Autobots have been called upon for active duty , the team also consists of several female bots disguised as motorcycles ( Arcee and friends ) , Sideswipe , and a pair of brothers who transform into a scrapped - out Ice Cream Truck named Mudflap and Skids - the latter being voiced by Spongebob ’s Tom Kenny .
This is where one of the series of stupid little issues arises : the twins , Muflap and Skids , eventually taking the forms of Chevy Trax and a Beat , are pretty damn annoying .
No , they ’re not quite Jar Jar Binks annoying as I have read so many other times , but they do get borderline grating with their street - wise jaw flapping and constant swearing ( yeah , not really a kid friendly bunch ) .
They really are like inner-city kids and , fortunately later in the film , Bumblebee treats them as such .
Anyway , several new bad guys are forced out of hiding including that single - wheel thing from the ad ’s called Demolishor and his buddy , Sideways .
Once these two are rounded up and blasted apart , a warning regarding ‘ The Fallen ’ is heeded by Optimus and the real fun begins .
Sam is heading off to college .
But not before discovering a shard of the All - Spark in his shirt that brings his kitchen to life .
His parents have gone completely insane , which is kind of nice as his mom immediately becomes one of the funniest characters in the movie , especially after she eats a pot brownie on the campus .
Sam has to leave Mikaela home since she insists on watching after her father in the garage at which they both work .
Sam promises fidelity and offers his lady a web - cam so they can chat every night .
Mikaela , once again not much on the acting front as a whole , but definitely wearing significantly less , is saddened , but resolute .
So Sam is off .
He does , however , tell Bumblebee ( whom he consistently and teeth - clenchingly annoyingly calls “ B ” the whole damn time ) to scoot along and find his Autobot friends to hang out with since his tenure of protection is over .
And so the throw - away scenes of college begin .
Well , mostly .
The second most irritating thing happens here .
Once the shit starts to hit the fan on campus in the form of a Species / Terminator - burglary lady Decepticon who ultimately gets Mikaela to question Sam ’s loyalty , Sam ’s roommate ( Leo ) joins the duo as they race away from the scene and he becomes part of the story line .
The kid , Ramon Rodriguez , is like the Short Round to Sam ’s Indy though a million times more whiny and buffoonish .
He is so unnecessary that it ’s almost criminal .
If he has one redeeming moment , and I ’m not insinuating that he does , it ’s when he reintroduces Sam to Seymour ( John Turturro ) who has since been relieved of his Sector 7 duties yet still maintains a cache of the files in his underground storage bunker beneath the deli where he works .
Once he ’s brought up to speed on the flashes of weird Cybertronian images bolting through Sam ’s skull , he , too , comes along for the ride .
Now the whole gang is together .
Whee… who cares .
Finally , after ( problem number 3 ) far too much human interaction , we get to the core of this epic sensory overload : who is the Fallen , anyway ?
It seems Mikaela has been busy wrangling and rehabilitating a Decepticon spy in the form of a blue r.c. monster truck named Wheelie .
Yup , another bit borrowed from the original animated and far superior movie .
Wheelie here is far less aggravating and actually leads the team to the Air and Space Museum near D.C. to revive one of the original robotic inhabitants of Earth : Jetfire , an SR - 71 Blackbird .
With shard in hand , Sam brings him to life and he retells the whole convoluted mess of what ’s going on : Basically , Primes from Cybertron went to Earth millions of years ago to mine for Energon , each with the understanding that , if a planet has life , they must search on .
As it turns out the only way to get to the Energon is by destroying the sun with the Matrix ( oh , yes , another poorly used bit from the toon movie ) .
Well , the Primes decide to leave Earth in peace but one changes his mind and threatens the planet , thereby becoming the Fallen .
The remaining Primes hide the Matrix and bury themselves in the Earth .
This must be found before the Decepticons get to it .
And so begins a race against time ( and by time I mean far too much wasted time doing unnecessary things ) to save the Earth , the Autbots , and to find the Matrix .
Oh , and fear not , there is a hell of a lot more going on in the background that I have n’t even touched on .
It ’s a saturated film to say the least , and there is an awful lot about it to hate wholeheartedly .
But , ultimately , if your heart was set on seeing nearly twice as many Transformers clobbering the life out of one another with fists and explosives and a whole ton of slo -mo Megan Fox jiggling cleavage , you ’ve certainly come to the right movie .
If you go in hoping for anything else at all , turn around and go see My Sisters Keeper … that might be more your speed .

Asked whether he ’d like Cheney to campaign with him , Utah Sen.
Robert Bennett -- who faces a primary challenge in 2010 -- said : “ The most powerful national politician in Utah is Mitt Romney , and he ’s already come to Utah to campaign for me .
And I think I ’ll leave it at that . ”
As though the GOP does n't have enough problems to face going into the 2010 midterm election cycle -- primarily a perception among moderate voters that they caused the country 's problems and that now they are mindless , partisan obstructionists , coupled with high level retirements in blue - trending ( and not so blue - trending ) states and an inability to recruit competitive first tier candidates -- the most detested figure in American politics has now inserted himself , front and center , into the campaign .
Pollsters may debate whether Cheney has a higher public approval rating than Paris Hilton or not , but in the shriveled and shrunken Republican Party he 's still considered a respectable figure .
Always looking to promote ratings - friendly food fights , the media has shamelessly propped him up .
A few days ago , the beleaguered chair of the NRSC , Texas Know Nothing John Cornyn , said he'd be " proud to appear with the vice president , anywhere , anytime . ”
Not even anywhere inwould be a good idea and for many Republican candidates the idea of campaigning with Cheney is anathema .
McCain refused to allow him out of hisbunker during the 2008 campaign and many non-Southern Republicans wish he was still locked away somewhere .
Even a high profile right - wing Mormon , Utah Senator Robert Bennett , facing a serious primary from an even more extreme winger , has indicated that he does n't want Cheney coming around Utah during campaign season .!
( That 's almost as lame as Oklahoma . )
Bennett is n't the only Republican who does n't want to be identified with the unpopular ex-vice president who most Americans see as part of the problem rather than as part of the solution .
Even radical obstructionist Richard Burr , a complete Cheney clone , is n't eager to see Cheney coming to North Carolina to lend a hand .
And , petrified , neither Florida 's Charlie Crist , Ohio's Bush Regime leftover , Rob Portman , nor Lisa Murkowski ( AK ) would go on the record when asked if they 'd like having Cheney campaign with them or not .
In Florida , Marco Rubio , who almost makes Cheney look mainstream by comparison , is eager to have the ex-VP come help him out against his popular closeted gay opponent .
KKK supporter Johnny Isakson ( GA ) as well as John Thune ( SD ) and Tom Coburn ( OK ) also feel they would benefit from some joint appearances with Cheney in their states .
McCain , who just reminded a writer that Cheney 's position on torture is basically advocating a war crime and comapared it to the Spanish Inquisition , still does n't want Cheney campaigning for him .
Not that Cheney would .
Cheney hates McCain with a passion and is far more likely to support Chris Simcox , founder of one of the Minutemen terrorist groups , who is challenging McCain for the Republican Senate nomination in Arizona next year .
Interesting rumor : when someone asked right - wing ex-football player Mike Minter , who we reported was mulling over a run against popular freshman Larry Kissell , whether he was interested in having Cheney come down to North Carolina to campaign for him , he said he'd pretty much decidedto run after all but that he would have been proud to campaign with Cheney .
We also asked a Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) staffer if the congressman would invite the former vice president to Kenosha , Racine or even Janesville and the string of expletives was so intense that I wish I had had my recorder on !
Anyway I hope someone asks Cheney enablers like Thaddeus McCotter ( R - MI ) , David Dreier ( R- CA ) , Mary Bono Mack ( R- CA ) , Dave Reichert ( R - WA ) , Frank Wolf ( R - VA ) , Brian Bilbray ( R - CA ) and Peter King ( R - NY ) .
They all rubber stamped the Cheney agenda that landed us in trouble .
They should all appear onstage in their home districts with Cheney around their necks .h/t : Glenn Greenwald
Labels : 2010 congressional races , Cheney , Cornyn , NRSC , Senate 2010
Amid rising concern about privacy , BT Group , the British telecommunications company , said Monday that it would not adopt a technology that lets advertisers tailor their pitches to consumers based on interests revealed by their Internet use .
The news was the latest in a series of setbacks for Phorm , the company that developed the technology , causing its stock to plunge more than 40 percent .
Phorm ’s approach has been hailed by advocates as a way to improve the effectiveness of advertising .
But the technology has raised concerns because it mines actual data supplied by Internet service providers , rather than building consumer profiles from partial Web browsing patterns , something that many Web companies already do .
Though Phorm says its system renders the data anonymous and has safeguards against security breaches , privacy advocates claimed vindication in the decision by BT .
Hunting whales is part of the Japanese culture that comes under heavy criticism from environmentalists .
Due to “ disruptions by anti-whaling activists , ” Japanese whale hunters killed fewer whales during their 2008 - 2009 Antarctic hunting season .
679 minke whales were killed short of the target of 850 . Â
Nearly one - third of those whales were pregnant . Â
Image by duchamp
The Humane Society International is denouncing the Japanese government for killing pregnant and lactating female whales .
Of 679 whales reported to have been killed during the 2008 - 2009 whale hunt in Antarctica , 304 were female .
Four of the female whales were lactating , and 192 were pregnant at the time of death .
The Japanese government ’s “ Cruise Report ” gives gruesome details on the fetuses killed .
The four lactating females killed would each have had a dependent calf who would inevitably have starved to death .
In 1986 , Japan agreed to an international moratorium on whaling , but the country continues to hunt whales under the guise of scientific research .
Any whale meat not used for research can be sold for human consumption .
Â
The BBC explains :
Whale meat not used for study is sold for consumption in Japan – which critics say is the real reason for the hunt .
The meat can be found in supermarkets and restaurants across the country …
Generations of children have been given whale meat for their school lunches , our correspondent says .
Â
Consumption of whale meat is now low , but attempts have been made to increase its popularity by marketing whale curry and whale burgers , he adds .
At the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) meeting in Portugual , IWC members agreed last week “ to extend negotiations over the disputed hunting of the marine mammals for a year , avoiding a disastrous split in the group . ”
Â
At stake is whether or not to allow Japan to reinstate commercial whaling in exchange for less “ scientific whaling in the Antarctic . ”
Â
Delegates fear that if an agreement is not reached by 2010 , the IWC may dissolve .
According to the poll ,
The name of the fork will be Distribute !
The code should not be changed anymore at this point , and I am working on the bootstraping so installing Distribute will work with an existing Setuptools installation and will replace it for the applications that requires it .
This is done by detecting an installation of Setuptools , and replacing it with a fake installation .
This means that once you ’ve installed Distribute , applications and especially installers will think that setuptools 0.6c9 is installed .
That ’s pretty strong and intrusive , but required for a simple switch : even if the programs you are using have a setuptools dependency , they will work without requiring any change on the code or in their setup .py files .
Same goes for zc.buildout apps .
I still have a lot of work for this part :
I do n’t detect and patch properly single - version - externally - managed setuptools installation yet ( required for pip )
I need to fix a bug on a first run under jython
I need to fix a bug when virtualenv is not used with –no - site - packages
I need to do extensive tests on zc.buildout to see if it behaves correctly
If you want to help :
download http://nightly.ziade.org/install_test.py run it with the Python interpreter of your choice ( possibly a virtualenv - ed one )
To uninstall , follow the Uninstallation instructions here : http://bitbucket.org/tarek/distribute/src/tip/README.txt
* Disclaimer : it might break your installation *
If the test end up with this line : **** Test is OK .
It worked .
Otherwise , please let me know !
The next “ big ” step will happen with Distribute 0.7 because the plan is to split the code in several distributions with renamed modules :
Distribute : the core ( setuptools package but renamed )
: the core ( setuptools package but renamed ) DistributeInstall : easy_install on its own , and renamed .
: easy_install on its own , and renamed .
DistributeResource : will contain the pkg_resources.py module , renamed
I ’ll post more details on it in the upcoming days .

An Aggie does not lie , cheat or steal , or tolerate those who do . -
Aggie Code of Honor , Texas A&M University , recipient of a 2003 Institute of Museum and Library Services ( IMLS ) grant that funded my MSIS education in partnership with the University of North Texas .
With permission from the author , here is the email apology I received this morning from Clinical Reader .
I have replied that I accept it .
I would also like to note that there is mention of the above apology on Twitter yet still not a public apology to me as there was for one of the artists yesterday
As of this time , Clinical Reader is or already has removedimages I discussed below from their website .
I commend them for their quick attention and responsiveness .
However , there was this before that I do not remove my blog articles .
I am happy to edit when information within them is in need of updating , as am I doing now , or corrections with clear markings as to what is original and what is corrected .
It is with concern that I 've heard about some of my colleagues promoting and collaborating with the newly launched company , Clinical Reader Why ?
( red scrawl emphasis mine ) This above - the - page - fold graphic is intentional ( not accidental , this is clear marketing intent to lend quick visual credibility to the organization ) and currently displayed everywhere ( homepage the newsletter , etc. ) throughout the resource .
It is bogus as far as the National Library of Medicine ( NLM ) is concerned since the U.S. Government does n't endorse or grant 5 stars to anything .
The NLM Copyright Information page offers more elaboration , bold emphasis mine : But wait , there 's more .
Clinical Reader also currently uses two copyrighted images on their Partners specific original source , copyright notice at bottom ) and Advertising pages ( from somewhere on Signalnoise ) .
A ' credit ' link to a source does n't honor an image copyright .
Even free open source images , such as this set of Springer Images , are often limited to usage for noncommerical purposes .
Commercial organizations can well afford to purchase or design their own graphics .
As a medical librarian , I respectfully request that Clinical Reader remove all occurrences of these images from their website immediately .
If not , this is my statement of intent that I 'll request removal of my blog from their proposed medical librarian resources .
I have already notified NLM and the artists involved about these images .
All have replied and thanked me for doing so , one noting " They might have credited me , but not cool using my work to sell something .
" I uphold the Medical Library Association code of ethics , the Library Society of the World Cod of Ethics , and my professional photographer friends deal with people stealing their copyrighted work all the time .
Professional integrity means taking a stand to explain who , what , where , when & why when something is amiss .
I 'm a bit more direct than some carefully review new resources ( and re-evaluate the old ones from time to time ) for information .
company that falsifies endorsements and displays copyrighted materials for their own use should raise immediate red flags for librarians .
How does it reflect on our profession to recommend a resource that is not compliant for accountability to clinicians , faculty , students and your own colleagues regardless of how nice it looks and functions ?
Asustek kicked off an entirely new category in the mobile computing space when it presented a prototype of its Eee PC at Taiwan 's Computex trade show two years ago .
Since then , many users have embraced netbook PCs for their small size , light weight and low cost .
Their popularity pushed Microsoft to extend the life of Windows XP and they 've turned out to be one of the bright spots in the PC industry over the last few months .
But the sector has n't been a hotbed of innovation .
Except for a few exceptions , most netbooks share pretty similar specs and are based on the same Intel Atom processor and Microsoft Windows XP operating system .
But now , as the netbook sector enters its third year , new chips and operating systems hold the potential for massive change in the sector .
Leading the charge on the hardware side are Qualcomm and Nvidia .
Qualcomm has produced a new chip called the Snapdragon that uses less power than Intel 's Atom , so it runs cooler and does n't require a heatsink .
That means laptops built with it can be thinner and have a longer battery life -- Qualcomm expects between 8 and 10 hours .
The chip comes with a feature that will be appreciated by any traveller : compatibility with both major cell phone standards in use worldwide .
But there are potential drawbacks .
Qualcomm 's processors do n't understand the x86 instruction set used by chips from Intel and AMD , so they wo n't run mainstream Windows .
Instead , netbook makers are turning to Linux , which has been ported to many non-x86 processor architectures .
Prototypes of Snapdragon machines , and some based on similar ARM - based chips from companies like Freescale and Texas Instruments , were on show at last week 's Computex , but no one was talking launch dates .
NVidia 's proposition does n't attempt to cut Intel out of the equation .
It has developed a graphics chip called Ion to supplement the Atom processor and provide some nice performance gains .
" We believe that when a consumer shells out 300 dollars to buy a PC they do n't say to themselves ' I did n't pay very much for a PC and I deserve a lousy experience , ' " said Jen - Hsun Huang , CEO of Nvidia .
" Between these two processors we would be able to enable a really delightful experience whether you 're playing games , streaming video or wanting to create some home movies yourself . "
In several demonstrations at Computex Nvidia showed Atom - based computers with the Ion chip could transcode video for a portable media player about 5 times faster than a computer based on Atom alone .
The Ion can also add multimedia functions like Blu-ray Disc playback to the small , cheap Atom - based computers .
Intel is n't sitting still during this assault on the netbook market .
The company continues to refine the Atom platform and the latest version of the platform , known by the code - name Pine Trail , has just been released .
It consolidates the number of chips required from four to three and should lead to thinner netbooks with longer battery life and , possibly , lower prices .
On the operating system side the dominance of Windows XP remains strong although , due largely to the ARM - based chips , there 's renewed talk about Linux .
Back in 2007 the first prototype of the Asus Eee PC ran Linux and despite a lot of early talk among PC makers about the OS consumers have shown a strong preference for Windows XP .
Whether Linux can make it this time remains to be seen but a couple of flavors of the open - source operating system are attracting attention .
Most talked about is Google 's Android operating system that is in use on some smart phones .
Several prototype devices running Android are on show at Computex although the current iteration of the OS has n't been adapted for the technically richer environment that netbooks .
For that reason many are saying it 's quite ready for netbook use .
A second operating system , Moblin , is also attracting interest .
Moblin was originally developed by Intel but the company recently turned over stewardship of the OS to the Linux Foundation in the hopes of building wider industry support for it .
How much these technologies will affect the netbooks of tomorrow wo n't become clearer until closer to Computex 2010 but there 's no doubt that several of the biggest names in the netbook market feel there 's a lot more room for innovation .
" Acer strongly believes today 's netbook is not close to perfection at all , " said Jim Wong , president of global product operations at Acer .
" Today the netbook is not anytime , anywhere , all the time .
The battery life is not long enough , the connections are on - and - off and it 's influenced by a lot of things .
So we have a lot of room to improve . "
Bellator Fighting Championships has certainly produced its share of memorable moments in the debut season .
CEO Bjorn Rebney is n’t dwelling on his promotion ’s current success because he ’s busy laying out the next moves for season two .
Broadcasting on ESPN2 and featuring heavyweight and light heavyweight tournaments are among the items on Rebney ’s to - do list .
He is also open to the idea of cross-promoting with other organizations .
“ If we have a champion , and there ’s an opportunity to fight a guy at Strikeforce , or the WEC , or another organization from Japan you would take it , ” Rebney told Chicago ’s MMA .
“ If Eddie [ Alvarez ] came to us three months before the tournament and said ‘ I got this incredible opportunity to go out and test myself against [ Shinya ] Aoki ’ and he said ‘ I wanna do it . ’
I [ would say ] go do it . ”
“ My hope would be that we would have the opportunity to do those kind of bouts .
Cross promote with other organizations if the right fight was there . ”
Also expect to see a broader range of international talent in Bellator ’s second season .
While the first season has focused on the Latino / Hispanic market , Rebney promises to recruit fighters from other corners of the world .
“ In the coming season we ’ll pull guys out of Japan , we ’ll pull guys out of Europe .
We ’ll pull a lot of guys out of places that we otherwise might not have pulled from in the first season . ”
While the Chicago and Los Angeles based organization has succeeded in signing individuals on the cusp of breaking through as a big name in the sport , the door is also open to signing established stars .
“ If there ’s a structure to it , and the contracts allow and a Aoki , or a [ Joachim ] Hanson , or [ Norifumi “ Kid ” ]
Yamamoto or anybody could come over from Japan , as a , I always look at it first as a fan .
And I say ‘ how cool would it be if “ Kid ” Yamamoto was here ?
How cool would it be if these guys were fighting in the United States and I could watch them . ' ”
Watch the video to hear Bjorn Rebney ’s entire statements regarding cross-promotion and courting some of the sport ’s biggest names .
Jeff Sharlet , author of “ The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power ” is an expert on “ The Family ” and his expertise has become even more valuable in recent weeks as the various infidelities of Gov. Mark Sanford , Sen. John Ensign , and former Rep. Chip Pickering have exploded in the news , as all have deep ties to the organization and its house on C Street .
Today , he has a piece in Salon about these men and numerous other powerful political figures and their ties to this secretive organization :
Today ’s roll call is just as impressive : Men under the Family ’s religio- political counsel include , in addition to Ensign , Coburn and Pickering , Sens.
Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa , and Jim DeMint and Lindsey Graham , both R - S.C. ; James Inhofe , R - Okla . , John Thune , R - S.D. , and recent senators and high officials such as John Ashcroft , Ed Meese , Pete Domenici and Don Nickles .
Over in the House there ’s Joe Pitts , R - Penn. , Frank Wolf , R - Va. , Zach Wamp , R - Tenn. , Robert Aderholt , R - Ala. , Ander Crenshaw , R - Fla. , Todd Tiahrt , R - Kan. , Marsha Blackburn , R - Tenn. , Jo Ann Emerson , R - Mo. , and John R. Carter , R - Texas .
Historically , the Family has been strongly Republican , but it includes Democrats , too .
There ’s Mike McIntyre of North Carolina , for instance , a vocal defender of putting the Ten Commandments in public places , and Sen. Mark Pryor , the pro-war Arkansas Democrat responsible for scuttling Obama ’s labor agenda .
Sen .
Pryor explained to me the meaning of bipartisanship he ’d learned through the Family : “ Jesus did n’t come to take sides .
He came to take over . ”
And by Jesus , the Family means the Family . …
I met the younger Coe when I lived for several weeks as a member of the Family .
He ’s a surprising source of counsel , spiritual or otherwise .
Attempting to explain what it means to be chosen for leadership like King David was — or Mark Sanford , according to his own estimate — he asked a young man who ’d put himself , body and soul , under the Family ’s authority , “ Let ’s say I hear you raped three little girls .
What would I think of you ? ”
The man guessed that Coe would probably think that he was a monster .
“ No , ” answered Coe , “ I would n’t . ”
Why ?
Because , as a member of the Family , he ’s among what Family leaders refer to as the “ new chosen . ”
If you ’re chosen , the normal rules do n’t apply .
The entire thing is fascinating and worth reading , but I was particularly interested in Sharlet ’s explanation of how the organization regularly funds junkets overseas for its members that are , in essence , missionary trips :
M]ost of the trips sponsored by the Family are n’t pleasure junkets .
They ’re missionary work .
Only the Family missionaries are n’t representing the United States .
They ’re representing “ Jesus plus nothing , ” as Doug Coe puts it … when they arrive in other countries , on trips paid for by the Family , at the behest of the Family , they are still traveling under official government auspices , on official business , with the pomp and circumstance — and access — of their taxpayer - funded , elected positions .
Considering that Sen. Jim Inhofe is reportedly a member of the organization as well , this goes a long way toward explaining this video we posted earlier this year in which he bragged to Faith and Action ’s Rob Schenck about this missionary trips through which he uses his standing as a US Senator to bring people to Jesus :
Oil Spills
A drunk captain and pictures of oil - soaked birds shot the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill straight into the American consciousness .
But the 10 million gallons of oil that spilled into Prince William Sound made it only the 34th largest spill in history .
The largest oil spill in history was in Kuwait in 1991 , when Iraqi forces intentionally opened up the valves on a number of oil tankers .
Over 520 million gallons of oil spilled into the Persian gulf , resulting in this pretty crazy satellite image :
But even the small ones are a huge mess .
In 2007 , roughly 3 million gallons of oil spilled into the ocean near South Korea .
Messed Up Rivers
Growing up in the US I had heard about how Cleveland ’s Cuyahuga River had been polluted enough to catch fire in 1952 and 1969 .
But even then the Cuyahuga was as clean as a mountain spring compared to the most polluted river in the world : The Citarum River in Indonesia .
Over 500 factories dump their crap into the river ...
... and it is reportedly more profitable to scavenge the floating garbage than it is to fish .
It ’s easy to see why :
Air Pollution
The smog that can hang over Los Angeles on a still day is notorious in the U.S. , but in terms of air pollution China has stolen the crown for biggest mess .
During the Beijing Olympics we saw how bad the capital city can get .
In the aerial photo below , Beijing is completely obscured by a layer of grey polluted haze .
But Beijing has nothing on Linfen , China .
It is considered to be the most polluted city on earth .
The air is so thick with factory emissions that just spending a day walking around town is the equivalent of smoking three packs of cigarettes !
VBS.tv sent a reporter to Linfen last year as part of their “ Toxic Series ” :
Biggest Mess Period : Pacific Garbage Patch Discovered by sea captain and oceanographer Charles Moore in 1997 , the Great Pacific Ocean Garbage Patch is easily the largest mess on the planet .
The Patch is a massive swirling soup of plastic between Hawaii and Japan .
How large is it ?
Estimates range between the size of Texas and the size of the entire continental United States .
Most of the plastic has been broken down by light and wave action into tiny microscopic pieces that are then eaten by fish and other sea life .
The larger pieces of plastic ensnare sea mammals and often wind up in the stomachs of birds like the albatross below :
Oprah brought the issue to the masses and VBS.tv did a pretty good , though foulmouthed , documentary on the subject .
And here 's a " Good Morning America " segment on the Patch .
Anna Sophie Loewenberg is the star and producer of “ Sexy Beijing , ” an online series of sly , knowing videos about a hapless , curious foreigner which has proved popular among expats , language students , and mainland Chinese .
( The début episode , “ Looking for Double Happiness , ” has been viewed more than one and a half million times on YouTube . )
The videos , which run from five to ten minutes , are loose parodies of “ Sex and the City , ” with Loewenberg playing a hammy version of herself , careering around town to interview construction workers , dog - walkers , cranky old men , and , on occasion , Lubavitchers about their love lives .
The latest episode goes online this week .
What brought you to China , and what was the most effective way you found for learning Chinese ?
I came to China in 1996 with a program called V.I.A. — Volunteers in Asia .
I was also interested in China because my German grandparents and my father had lived in Shanghai from 1933 to 1937 .
[ They were German Jews who were part of a large Jewish diaspora in the city . ]
The best way to learn Chinese is to surround yourself with Chinese people .
If you want to give yourself the accelerated course , take a Chinese lover — and not someone who speaks English !
Let yourself feel uncomfortable and out of your comfort zone for a while and you will learn to speak more quickly .
Why “ Sexy Beijing ” ?
We created “ Sexy Beijing ” for YouTube and other Web sites in 2006 .
So , at that point , multimedia was part of the plan .
Chinese people often tell me I look like Sarah Jessica Parker , and when I created the show , with Luke Mines and Jeremy Goldkorn , I was single and in my thirties in Beijing .
What could be more fun than a Chinese - speaking Carrie with glasses ?
I ’m still single , but now I am enjoying single life more because hot men around town recognize me as the “ Sexy Beijing ” girl — so the show has done wonders for my love / social life .
My personal issues aside , I thought the show would be an interesting approach to documenting Chinese culture .
What ’s your best story about being a Jew in China ?
The very first time that Luke and I went out to film , we were in a hutong asking an elderly man from the neighborhood about love when I mentioned my Jewish mother .
The next thing I knew , his crotchety neighbor was laying out his ideas on Israeli foreign policy at the top of his lungs .
I thought he was attacking us , but , as I began to listen more closely , I realized that was just the way he talked .
Then he said , “ You Jews really have it bad — everyone in the world hates you ! ”
From what you know , who is watching your work ?
Young overseas Chinese , mainland Chinese , anyone interested in China and pop culture , Jewish hipsters .
What is the moment you most regret during the course of your time here ?
The moment I fell in love with a Chinese rock star .
Fall of 1996 .
There was no turning back .

Iran Monday accused the West of supporting " rioters " in widespread street unrest that has rocked the Islamic Republic since a disputed June 12 presidential election .
" The promotion of anarchy and vandalism by Western powers and media is by no means acceptable , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi told a news conference .
He did not rule out the possible expulsion of some European ambassadors in Tehran .
... Referring to the tight race between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush in 2000 and other U.S. Presidential elections , Qashqavi said :
" No one in that race encouraged the American people to stage a riot or anything like that and it was actually the ( U.S. Supreme Court ) that solved the issue . "
Now that Ayatollah Khamenei has become inexorably connected to Ahmadinejad ’s power grab , many clerics are coming around to the idea that the current system needs to be changed .
Among those who are now believed to be arrayed against Ayatollah Khamenei is Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , the top Shi ’a cleric in neighboring Iraq .
Rafsanjani is known to have met with Grand Ayatollah al - Sistani ’s representative in Iran , Javad Shahrestani .
A reformist website , Rooyeh , reported that Rafsanjani already had the support of nearly a majority of the Assembly of Experts , a body that constitutionally has the power to remove Ayatollah Khamenei .
The report also indicated that Rafsanjani ’s lobbying efforts were continuing to bring more clerics over to his side .
Rafsanjani ’s aim , the website added , is the establishment of a leadership council , comprising of three or more top religious leaders , to replace the institution of supreme leader .
Shortly after it posted the report on Rafsanjani ’s efforts to establish a new collective leadership , government officials pulled the plug on Rooyeh .
Meanwhile , the Al - Arabiya satellite television news channel reported that a " high - ranking " source in Qom confirmed that Rafsanjani has garnered enough support to remove Ayatollah Khamenei , but an announcement is being delayed amid differences on what or who should replace the supreme leader .
Some top clerics reportedly want to maintain the post of supreme leader , albeit with someone other than Ayatollah Khamenei occupying the post , while others support the collective leadership approach .
To a certain degree , hardliners now find themselves caught in a cycle of doom : they must crack down on protesters if they are to have any chance of retaining power , but doing so only causes more and more clerics to align against them ... [ A ] showdown could come later this week .
One of the country ’s highest - ranking clerics , Grand Ayatollah Hussein - Ali Montazeri has declared three days of mourning for those who have died in street protests .
Grand Ayatollah Montazeri ’s declaration could bring thousands of Tehran residents back out into the streets starting on June 24 .
Khamenei certainly has the power to crush the street demonstrations in Tehran -- as he appears to have done yesterday by letting the Revolutionary Guards off their leashes .
But he may be more worried about Qom , the Iranian Vatican City and home of the Assembly of Experts , which hires and fires Supreme Leaders and is headed by Khamenei's arch - rival -- pistachio baron ( and one of Iran 's richest men ) Ayatollah Hashemi Rasfanjani .
To recap yesterday , there is now no doubt that the election was stolen .
although this morning the Guardian Council -- headed by the Ann Coulter of Iran -- announced that they would not annul the results of the tainted balloting .
Mousavi , in the face of more violence , is calling on Iranian patriots to keep up the pressure and Ali Shahrokhi , head of parliament 's judiciary committee , said Mousavi should be prosecuted for " illegal protests and issuing provocative statements . "
There is talk of a general strike , probably the only way to bring down the regime .
( Thanks to the shameful partisan opportunism of McCain , Graham , Lieberman , Pence , and other mini-presidents in Congress , the Khamenei regime is accusing the protesters of being duped by the U.S. , the same way the U.S. staged a coup in Tehran 55 years ago . )
Back to the goings on behind the curtain , the paranoid coterie around Khamenei is fairly certain that " Rafsanjani has been in the holy city of Qom , working to assemble a religious and political coalition to topple the supreme leader and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . "
Khamenei is no longer seen a the father of the country and a spiritual leader above the fray , but as a grubby political operative and a bloody dictator .
He was a real image problem with the clergy and many are offended that he has repeatedly characterized the election as a " divine assessment " of Ahmadinejad ’s popularity .

It is widely assumed that women are more charitable than men .
A new poll puts a number on it :
Wealthy women give away nearly twice as much as of their wealth as their male counterparts .
In a survey due out this week , Ledbury Research for Barclay 's Wealth found that women in the U.S. give an average 3.5 % of their wealth to charity .
The survey of 500 people with investible assets of $ 1 million or more found that men give an average of 1.8 %
And it is n't just a U.S. phenomenon .
In the U.K. , women give an average of 0.8 % , compared with 0.5 % for men , the survey shows .
Yes , the finding confirms stereotypes .
But it also has big implications for the future of philanthropy .
He may not have had enough exercise today ...
Researchers have confirmed what parents have long believed - running around in the day means your child may well fall asleep faster at night .
But the study of 500 children provides a figure : for every hour they sit , they need three minutes longer to nod off .
Interestingly , it was not relevant what the child did while they sat .
TV was no more detrimental than quietly reading .
And the Archives of Disease in Childhood found those who took longer to get to sleep were no worse behaved .
Experts from Monash University in Melbourne and the University of Auckland looked at 519 seven - year - olds .
The majority fell asleep within 45 minutes , and the average " sleep latency " - the time it took - was 26 minutes .
Sleepyhead Children who were very physically active during the day tended to take less time to fall asleep , but the more prominent association was between being sedentary and taking longer to drift off .
Those who fell asleep faster also tended to sleep for longer .
There has been much discussion about the impact of reduced sleep duration on children .
" As short sleep duration is associated with obesity and lower cognitive performance , community emphasis on the importance of promoting healthy sleep in children is vitally important , " the researchers wrote .
Activity is not the be all and end all , and should n't be encouraged right before bedtime
Mandy Gurney
Sleep specialist " This study emphasises the importance of physical activity for children , not only for fitness , cardiovascular health and weight control , but also for sleep . "
They did not however find any evidence of bad behaviour , as measured by professional charts , among those who took longer to fall asleep .
Nor did they find any significantly different sleep latencies for children who went to bed after 9 pm .
Mandy Gurney , founder of children 's sleep clinic Millpond , said the research was useful confirmation of the benefits of exercise for sleep as well as fitness and weight .
" But activity is not the be all and end all , and should n't be encouraged right before bedtime .
What 's essential is a routine wind - down hour , a quiet time before bed .
A warm bath , but no longer than 10 minutes , and then straight into a darkened bedroom .
" That way you make the most of the natural sleep trigger of the warm water , and you can cap it all off with a bedtime story . "

On Sunday , July 5th in Urumqi , the capital of China 's western Xinjiang region , thousands of minority ethnic Uighur residents marched , demanding a government investigation into an earlier incident - a brawl between Han Chinese and Uighurs in a toy factory in Shaoguan that ended with at least two Uighur deaths .
Sometime during the July 5th protest the situation became very violent , Uighurs clashing with police and attacking local Han Chinese .
Urumqi citizens woke the next morning to learn that over 1,000 people had been injured and 156 killed in their city .
Government forces worked to quell the violence and to separate the newly - formed Han vigilante groups and the Uighurs still in the streets .
Communications were shut off , streets closed , curfews imposed , hundreds arrested , and thousands of troops poured into Urumqi , which remains tense - several clashes reported even today .
Today , 7/10/09 , Chinese officials released the ethnic breakdown of those killed in the riots for the first time - 137 of victims were ethnic Han , 46 were Uighurs and one was Hui .

Examining the Single Payer Health Care Option
Health , Employment , Labor , and Pensions Subcommittee Hearing
U.S. House of Representatives
June 10 , 2009
Marcia Angell , M.D. :
I want to mention one final and very important reason for enacting a nonprofit single - payer health program .
We live in a country that tolerates enormous and growing disparities in income , material possessions , and social privilege .
That may be an inevitable consequence of a free market economy .
But those disparities should not extend to denying some of our citizens certain essential services because of their income or social status .
One of those services is health care .
Others are education , clean water and air , equal justice , and protection from crime , all of which we already acknowledge are public responsibilities .
We need to acknowledge the same thing for health care .
Providing these essential services to all Americans , regardless of who they are , marks a decent and cohesive society .
It says that when it comes to vital needs , we are one nation , not 300 million individuals competing with one another .
***
Walter Tsou , M.D. , M.P.H. :
President Obama has stated that if he were to start over again he would favor a single - payer system , but argues that moving to single - payer is too radical .
Well , I come from Philadelphia where revolutionary ideas are celebrated not dismissed .
Our most famous radical document begins with the words , “ We the People ” .
Not “ We the Insurers ” .
“ We the People of the United States , in order to form a more perfect union . . . to promote the general Welfare , and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America . ”
This nation captured the world ’s imagination with bold ideas that put the people first .
It is time for our own generation ’s revolution .
***
David Gratzer , M.D. :
Critics of the American system note that it fails to provide universal coverage to its citizens .
But Canada ’s single - payer system also denies care ; instead of denying insurance coverage , Canada ’s public insurance plans simply limit the supply of costly medications and capital - intensive procedures .
These challenges appear in different forms across the single - payer world .
Wait times , rationed care and inefficient public management is inevitable in single - payer systems because they all face the same health - care demands as the American system .
***
During the questioning by committee members :
Rep. Dennis Kucinich : Dr. Gratzer , you ’ve tried to make the case for rationing in Canada – worse than it is in the U.S.
Do you know what Statistics Canada – the analogue to the U.S. Census – says the median wait time is across Canada for elective surgery ?
Dr. David Gratzer :
Why do n’t you inform us , sir ?
Kucinich :
It ’s four weeks .
And what does Statistics Canada say the median wait time for diagnostic imaging like MRIs is ?
Gratzer : I could tell you the Ontario government recently looked at that for …
Kucinich :
It ’s three weeks .
Gratzer : … for cancers , was six months .
Kucinich :
It ’s three weeks .
How many uninsured are there in Canada ?
Gratzer : Probably relatively few .
Kucinich :
That ’s right , none or very few .
How many medical bankruptcies are there in Canada ?
Gratzer : Depends on how you define medical bank ..
Kucinich : None or very few .
How many insured Americans go without needed care due to high cost of health care which is due to health insurance companies ?
Gratzer : ( Pause )
Am I allowed to answer , or are we just going to continue to …
Kucinich :
If you have an answer , you can answer .
But if you do n’t , I ’ll answer .
What ’s your answer ?
Gratzer :
Go for it , sir .
Kucinich :
What ’s your answer ?
Gratzer :
Why do n’t you answer your question , sir ?
Kucinich :
What ’s your answer ?
Gratzer : My answer …
Kucinich :
How many insured Americans go without needed care due to the high cost of health care which is due to health insurance companies ?
Gratzer : ( Silence )
Kucinich :
The witness is n’t responding .
Gratzer :
The witness is delighted to speak further on those statistics and other statistics , but you keep cutting me off , sir .
Kucinich :
You respond , if you have an answer .
You did n’t give an answer to the other one .
Gratzer : I do n’t want to be led down a garden path .
If you ’d like to ask me a question , I ’d be …
Kucinich :
You ’ve shown a garden here to members of this committee and to the audience .
There ’s another side to this picture you do n’t seem to be aware of even though you want to be an expert on Canada .
Can you provide us with an answer on this one about America ?
Gratzer :
My position is respectable , and I dislike your comment , sir .
Kucinich :
Do you have an answer ?
How many insured Americans , insured , go without needed care due to high costs of health care due to health insurance companies ?
Gratzer : ( Silence )
Kucinich : He has no answer .
Well what the answer is is that it ’s one out of every four .
So we ’re trying to make a case here that somehow Canada is in a mess , but we ’re not focusing on the fact that in the United States there are people who are n’t getting needed care , and this gentleman has expected us to believe that rationing is worse in Canada .
I do n’t know how we can buy that .
Now if single payer is so bad , maybe the gentleman – the doctor – can explain to us why sixty percent of U.S. doctors want it according to the peer - reviewed Annals of Internal Medicine , April , 2008 .
( off camera voice ) :
Are you going to let him answer this one ?
Kucinich :
He can answer it , if he can answer it .
Gratzer : I would suggest that many physicians in the United States are unsatisfied with their system , and rightly so .
I would suggest that many physicians are looking for reform , and rightly so .
But I would suggest that many physicians are unaware of what really goes on single payer systems , perhaps illustrated well by some of the comments that you ’ve already made …

It was meant to be a show case for healthy living , with the first lady , Michelle Obama , personally putting hand to pitch fork in a crowd of school children to dig up the first White House vegetable garden in more than 50 years .
Instead , an embarrassed White House admitted today that the plot - whose lettuce , herbs and other produce have been consumed by the first family , visiting dignitaries , local school children and a women 's homeless shelter - had tested positive for elevated levels of lead .
A spokeswoman for the White House said the soil in the garden had lead concentrations of 93 parts per million of lead .
Health experts say it is safe to raise leafy vegetables in soil with concentrations of 10 - 50 parts per million , and urban gardens typically have raised lead levels .
However , it is advised for young children to be tested for exposure to lead if they play in areas where lead concentrations exceed 100 parts per million .
The Environmental Protection Agency puts the threshold for dangerous lead levels at 300 parts per million .
But even though lead levels in the first garden are far below that danger zone , the disclosure is awkward for a White House which has made prominent use of the vegetable garden to define Michelle Obama 's role as First Lady , and to encourage sensible eating habits in children .
Children are especially vulnerable to exposure to lead , which can cause neurological and kidney damage , and stunt their growth .
The vegetable garden was an important symbolic break with the George Bush presidency , and it became a cause for environmentalists and the organic food movement in America who had urged the Obamas to use the White House to set an example of healthy eating .
Michelle Obama invited dozens of 10 - and 11 - year olds from a state elementary school in a transitional neighbourhood of Washington to the White House last March to help her dig up a 1,100 square foot plot of land near her daughters ' swing set .
Photographers were let in to take pictures of her kneeling in the dirt and wielding garden tools .
The first lady gave interviews joking about how all the members of the first famly would be required to weed on occasion .
As the weeks went on , and the White House garden grew , it became central to Michelle Obama 's efforts to rebrand herself , and banish any residual damage from the rightwing attacks of the election campaign when she was cast as the stereotypical angry black woman .
The White House featured blog posts on the garden 's progress .
The school children were invited back to tend the plot and just two weeks ago to bring in the first harvest : 73 lbs of lettuce , 12 lbs of snap peas and one cucumber .
Obama and the children then trooped into the White House kitchen to wash lettuce and shell and cook the peas for lunch , which they ate outside on red and white checked tablecloths .
Sam Kass , who followed the Obamas from Chicago as their personal chef , gave a short speech praising the gardeners for getting their yeild without resort to fertiliser or herbicides , and for using green compost .
The White House said the garden would go on .
" The garden recently underwent extensive soil testing that proved it is completely safe , " Katie McCormick Lelyveld , the first lady 's spokeswoman , said .
A lead level of 92 parts per million is significantly better than the government standard for a garden like this .
The White House kitchen garden team is committed to producing fresh , safe and healthy food as a learning opportunities ( sic ) about health eating , and they 'll continue to do so , " Lelyveld said .
The White House would not say whether the Obamas or the children who had helped tend the garden would be tested for lead exposure .

. NET Rocks Podcast : Michael Foord Talks IronPython
I 've recorded a podcast with the .NET Rocks guys on IronPython .
We discuss dynamic languages on the .NET framework ( I'm even nice about Ruby ! ) , Python , IronPython and of course Resolver One and IronPython in Action :
Michael Foord Talks IronPython Michael Foord works full time with IronPython for Resolver Systems ; creating a highly programmable spreadsheet called Resolver One .
He has been using IronPython since about version 0.7 .
The podcast is 53 minutes long and it was great fun chatting with Richard and Carl .
Towards the end of the podcast there is a discount code for ordering IronPython in Action , so well worth listening to all the way to the end .
Apparently the .NET Rocks podcast has around 300 000 (! ) regular listeners , so it was great to be able to promote Python and the book to the .NET community .
Introduction to ConfigObj Article
In May 2008 the Python Magazine published my Introduction to ConfigObj article .
ConfigObj is an easy to use but powerful configuration file reader library .
This article is a great introduction to ConfigObj , but is a particularly useful reference on the config file validation features .
The documentation is complete , which does n't necessarily make it a good place to start , so this is probably the best reference for getting started with validation .
The article also covers features like Unicode support and unrepr mode .
Many thanks to the Python Magazine for allowing me to reproduce the article in full .
In the process of putting this online I 've managed to fix a couple of the inevitable ( but irritating ) typos that were in the original .
If you spot any more typos or errors then please let me know .
Oh - and a new release of ConfigObj is coming soon .
It mainly includes improvements to validation ( including support for validating multiline values and removal of restrictions on ' __many__ ' validation ) .
Multi-monitors and the Hazro 30 " Monitor
My colleague Kamil Dworakowski has written a blog entry on using multiple monitors , showing off his desktop setup ( the deathstar control centre ) at Resolver Systems : Quad Head
Traders have long known about the value of using multiple monitors .
The reason it is so good for programming is that the activity requires to keep millions of things in the head at once -- names of variables , functions , classes , third party APIs .
You can keep limited amount of things in your head , depending on various factors affecting your concentration like amount of sleep the previous night .
You will have to page fault to the rest .
And when page faulting requires switching between windows it adds friction .
Energy that could have been used on solving problems is wasted .
Allocating windows across monitor is crucial .
You want to have the information you will need most often readily available .
What you do n't want is to have two windows to which you need simultaneous access being on the same monitor .
Even with four monitors , you will find that you have more than one window on the same monitor .
My average is about 2 - 3 windows per monitor and 2 - 3 virtual desktops ( do n't worry I do n't use splits ; ) .
For past month I had one virtual desktop for lunch time , one for spiking an interactive console for Resolver One , and one for main development .
Vista is not really well prepared for 4 monitors ; windows appear on different monitors at random .
It is not unusual that an application on monitor 4 will popup a dialog on monitor 1 .
Without some third party tools it would be a chore to manage it all .
I use winsplit for moving windows around , vdm for virtual desktops and ultramon for extending the taskbar .
I quite agree that having several monitors really improves development experience ; and whilst I hate to play the " mine is bigger than yours " game , I 'm currently running five monitors :
My main monitor is now a 30 " Hazro monitor .
The others are a 32 " LCD TV , 22 " widescreen and two 24 " monitors .
( I watch movies on the top monitor - fed from my computer - and the middle monitor runs a Vista VM . )
The 30 " monitor is a recent addition .
I 've long wanted one - with a resolution of 2500x1600 is large enough to have two applications side by side in the same monitor at the same size as they would be on a standard 20 " monitor .
24 " monitors are typically 1900x1200 pixels - too wide for a single application and not wide enough for two side by side at a decent width .
Note
These monitors are driven by an Apple Mac Pro with three graphics cards - each supporting two monitors .
The cards are 2x ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT and 1x NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT .
The LCD TV is a 1080P monitor , which means it has a 1920x1080 pixel resolution when plugged into the computer via HDMI .
I do n't have a blueray drive , but watch a lot of movies in 720P format .
The improvement over standard definition compressed movie files is astonishing .
A 720P movie encoded using a modern codec ( like H.264 ) is typically 3 - 4 gigs .
A 1080P movie is typically 24gigs .
I 've only downloaded one and could n't find a player for the Mac that could work with the video container format it used ( although PowerDVD on Windows handles it fine apparently ) .
The best resource on video codecs ( etc ) that I 've seen is a series of articles by Mark Pilgrim , A gentle introduction to video encoding : Part 1 : container formats
Part 2 : lossy video codecs
Part 3 : lossy audio codecs
Part 4 : captioning
Part 5 : constraints
For the curious I use a Kinesis Advantage Keyboard which is unjustifiably expensive but really helps with my RSI .
I also use the Kensington Expert Mouse which is n't a mouse at all but a trackball ( and the scroll ring is very cool ) .
It is much more sensitive than a standard mouse , but I have n't tried it for gaming yet .
Both the mouse and the keyboard are wired which is annoying .
I 'll do a separate blog entry on these sometime .
I have a separate number keypad as there is n't one on the Kinesis ( well you can switch it into a separate mode which I should probably try ) .
Once you get used to a numberpad you can't do without them - they speed up number entry enormously .
( I worked in a Builders Merchant for many years . )
I 've resisted the lure of thirty inches for a long time because they are still hugely more expensive than 24 " monitors .
The market leaders for 30 " monitors are Dell and Apple , and they cost around a thousand pounds or so .
A good twenty four inch monitor can be had for around two hundred pounds .
I recently found a cheaper alternative , the 30 " Hazro Monitor .
Allegedly they take the same panels used in the more expensive Dell monitors and use cheaper housing with less markup .
If you read the reviews ( google for them - there are quite a few ) , they are almost universally positive .
I found one from Overclockers .co.uk for six hundred and seventy pounds ( including VAT and shipping ) - about a third cheaper than any other I had found .
At first I was very nervous about ordering .
I hate dead pixels on monitors and have been very lucky on the monitors I have bought so far .
Hazro 's dead pixel policy even allows for 5x5 clumps of dead pixels .
Fortunately I got very good advice on Overclockers own forum :
If you still have a dead pixel problem , can't bring it back to life and can't RMA it under warranty then you can sometimes return it to the stockist if you purchased it online .
If you bought online you can take advantage of the " Distance Selling Act " which entitles you to return any item within 7 days as you were not present at the time of purchase .
If you are not happy with your TFT you can return it at your cost of postage and often claim a refund or exchange .
Legally , if the stocker accepts the TFT back as a return governed by the Distance Selling Act , then they are NOT allowed to charge you a restocking fee as covered in the Government Regulations ( page 11 in particular ) .
This selling act is not widely known by retailers , but does exist if you really need to use it .
You should only have to pay for postage to send it back to them .
( Obviously the distance selling act only applies in the UK . )
On that basis I was happy to order it and would have returned it if there were any dead pixels .
Fortunately there were none .
This is what it looks like :
It 's not a perfect monitor , but overall I 'm very pleased with it .
Here 's the good and the bad .
The good :
Lovely image quality
No dead pixels
Really a lovely monitor
Comes with the dual - link DVI adaptor lead it requires ( although a bit short )
Does have vertical tilt on the stand ( not all cheap monitors I 've bought have this )
The bad :
It runs quite hot ( not really an issue , but even so ...)
Vertical tilt only - no horizontal movement on the stand
Ca n't remove the stand so can't wall mount it
The touch power button is inconveniently recessed at the bottom of the monitor and not sensitive enough - I usually have to swipe it several times
The configuration options are basic - but the default setup was absolutely fine for me on a Mac Pro .
Python , Wing on Quartz , and ConfigObj in Textmate
A bunch of stuff , almost all of it interesting to someone ( usually me ) .
Someone likes ConfigObj , but wanted highlighting for the ConfigObj format ini files in Textmate - so he created a Textmate bundle .
I like what he says about ConfigObj :
We use ConfigObj configuration files pretty extensively at WebMynd ; it would be nice to use the ConfigParser module available in Pythonâ€™s standard library , but the extra features ConfigObj has , such as lists , multi- line strings and nested sections , make it hard to say no to the richer library ...
Knowing even approximately how many Python programmers there are is very difficult , in fact even defining a Python programmer is difficult .
Is someone who writes a simple Trac plugin or shell script a Python programmer ?
Even counting downloads will be a wild underestimate .
Python is included in most Linux distributions ( and is preinstalled on the Mac ) , and even Linux users who upgrade are likely to do it through their OS 's package management rather than from Python.org .
However , most Python programmers on Windows will use the standard installers .
In January the Python 2.6.1 installer for Windows was downloaded 348 761 times !
In that month Python installers for Windows were downloaded more than a million times !
My favourite Python IDE , which I use on both Windows and the Mac , is Wing .
The UI uses GTK , which in turn uses X11 on the Mac .
On the Mac X11 comes with the OS , but is also developed by Apple as an external project called XQuartz , and as the official updates are slow it is usually better to track XQuartz .
Michael Burton recently posted to the Wing mailing list about some improvements from upgrading to the latest version of XQuartz :
I just noticed that XQuartz has updated apple 's X11 server to 2.3.2.1 ( the one apple ships with Leopard is 2.3.1 I believe ) .
It seems to fix a number of weird behaviors I 've noticed with Wing , such as : tooltips appear when wing is in background
weird issues with dialogs popping up at inopportune times when using the external tools layout
problems with copy / paste when using a clipboard manager such as Jumpcut
fix occasional " stuck keys " when switching between apps
All in all , it seems like a vast improvement .
However , there 's one change that seems to have dramatically changed the way that Wing displays .
From the release notes : " Default dpi reported is now 96 instead of 75 " http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X112.3.2.1
When you first load wing in 2.3.2.1 the fonts will all appear HUGE .
To switch back , run the following in Terminal ( from the FAQ ) : defaults write org .x. X11 dpi - int 75 http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/X11-UsersFAQ
PyPy and Psyco
Psyco is the specialising compiler - basically a JIT - for Python 2.X .
It has been in maintenance only mode for a long time , not even optimising generators which were introduced to the language in Python 2.2 .
Maintaining and extending Psyco is so painful that it was part of the motivation for Armin Rigo joining the PyPy Project .
Some people are still confused about PyPy ; about what it is and what it hopes to achieve .
PyPy is really two projects :
An interpreter compiler toolchain allowing you to write interpreters in RPython ( a static subset of Python ) and have cross- platform interpreters compiled standalone , for the JVM , for .NET ( etc )
An implementation of Python in RPython
( There are also subprojects like Prolog and Smalltalk front - ends written in RPython ) .
These two projects allow for many things .
Maintaining Python in Python is much easier than maintaining it in C
From a single codebase you can generate Python interpreters that run on the JVM , .NET and standalone - rather than having multiple slightly incompatible implementations
Part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental tracing JIT generator ( now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well ) - the goal is for a JITed PyPy to run much faster than CPython
It is much easier to experiment with fundamental language features - like removing the GIL , better garbage collection , integrating stackless and so on
So there are really a lot of reasons for PyPy to be exciting , and it is finally starting to live up to all its promises .
Meanwhile , Psyco is n't completely out of the game .
In fact there was recently some news :
This is not an official announcement of Psyco V2 , yet .
But everybody who is interested should check out http://codespeak.net:/svn/psyco/v2
and do some testing .
The major improvement besides lots of builtins is the new generator support , which is disabled by default , due to an internal error in Psyco .
To use and test generators , create preferences.py , following the instructions in setup.py .
This software is considered asan alpha release .
The final version should be expected before end of February .
regards Christian Tismer
The downside is that there is still never likely to be a version of Psyco that supports 64 bit or Python 3 ( in fact Christian Tismer is more positive than I thought on this subject - see his comment on this reddit thread ) .
And as for the future of PyPy , well , good news everyone :
we 're now able to translate a highly - experimental Python interpreter that contains JIT .
It mostly crashes immediately , mostly due to some unsupported operations in the assembler backend , but for a carefully crafted program , we 're able to get massive speedups .
For something as complex as : i = 0
while i < 10000000 :
i = i + 1 our JIT is about 20 x faster than CPython .
That 's still about 3 x slower than Psyco , but looking at assembler code it 's obvious that we can speed it up a lot .
These are very good news , since we do n't encode python semantics at all in the JIT .
The JIT is automatically generated from the Python interpreter source code .
This means we should be able to expand it to handle more complex python programs relatively quickly ( interested assembler experts needed ! ) .

From " Mona Lisa : Inside the Painting , " by Jean - Pierre Mohen , Michel Menu and Bruno Mottin
An Infared photograph suggests that Leonardo originally painted the Mona Lisa with a gauzy overdress for nursing ( visible , at right ) , and a tiny bonnet ( vague outline visible about the sitter 's head ) .
