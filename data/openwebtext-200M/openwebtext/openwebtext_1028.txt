What happens to democracy when you set up a town ( Hoboken ) devoted to attracting freshly - barely - graduated frat boys and college cheerleaders turned pharmaceutical sales reps too " sketched out " to cope with the gritty urban realities of Williamsburg or Murray Hill ?
Yes folks , like everything else in Hoboken , democracy gets puked upon -- by a corrupt cabal of machine politicians conspiring with rabbis and real estate developers to make money in the sketchiest ways possible -- which in this case includes trafficking human body parts .
At least 30 public officials were arrested and hauled into federal court in Newark this morning in a story that is so far short on details and long on awesome names .
There is Jersey City Council President Mariano Vega , Jersey City Deputy Mayor Leona Beldini , the aforementioned Hoboken Mayor Peter Cammarano -- who is just 23 days into his term after winning a runoff election by 67 absentee ballots and may have a secret family -- in addition to the longtime Secaucus Mayor Dennis Elwell and a lot of as - yet - unidentified employees of two Monmouth County religious institutions , the Ohel Yaacob synagogue and the Deal Yeshiva , the latter of which first ran into trouble when the real estate mogul son of its founder deposited a bad $ 25.2 million check .
The editor of the site Hoboken411 says he will give us a briefing on the " juicy " background of all this once he fixes his server issues ...
Finally the dam has ­broken , and everyone is talking about changing Britain 's political system .
For decades reformers have been thwarted by Westminster inertia .
But the MPs ' expenses ­scandal has overturned old certainties and made change possible .
This moment must be seized by all who want a different kind of politics .
Warm words , rhetoric and consideration are not enough ; indeed , they are a ­guarantee that little will happen .
So let us bar the gates of Westminster and stop MPs leaving for their summer holidays until this crisis has been sorted out , and every nook and cranny of our political system has been reformed .
Today I 'm setting out a plan of action to get all the changes we need delivered in just 100 days – making it possible for MPs to be sacked by constituents , abolishing the House of Lords , getting corrupt money out of politics and changing the electoral system to give everyone a voice .
People will say it is n't possible – parliament can't act that quickly .
I say the innate conservatism that marks out our political establishment is part of the problem .
Let 's stop all this self - congratulatory hype about the mother of parliaments and get on with improving it .
Momentum will ebb away unless we act quickly .
Delay would be a victory for those who want to confine change to the bare minimum – the two establishment parties who will talk up reform long enough for the storm to pass , then kick it into the long grass for good .
David Cameron 's proposals set out in the Guardian on Tuesday were a masterful example of well - judged rhetoric free of substance and conviction .
Open - source software , new select committee chairs and legislative text messages will not rescue British democracy .
They are designed , I fear , to provide verbal cover for maintaining the status quo .
Real political change is about taking power from those who have hoarded it for themselves , and distributing it to others .
So change will only be ­possible if the vested interests that have ­benefited from the way things are accept that they can no longer ­preside over an institutional stitch - up .
For ­generations the Labour and Conservative parties have ­colluded to keep out ­competition .
They are like a corporate duopoly , ­setting the rules of the game to maintain ­dominance .
And just like in economics , it 's ordinary people who suffer : taken for granted , and deprived of the ­ability to make different choices to those imposed upon them .
That is why what Cameron did not say is more revealing than what he did .
No mention of the murky business of party funding .
No mention of the scandal of an unelected second chamber .
The rejection of any change to an electoral system that hands power to governments on a fraction of the vote .
Without these changes , British politics will continue to be a game of pass the parcel between two old parties , while the rest of the country switches off ,
So instead of long - term consideration of the possibility of tinkering , let us have 100 days of real action : swift , decisive and confident .
It really is possible .
The details of a reformed system of party funding have already been thrashed out between the parties , months ago .
Sir Hayden Phillips secured outline agreement to ban donations of more than £ 50,000 , limit spending to £ 100 m over a parliament and shake up union contributions .
The reason it was n't adopted was because the Conservatives walked out , keen to protect donations from tax exiles such as Lord Ashcroft .
But there is no reason not to return to what was all but agreed , and enforce it .
The political parties and elections bill , now before parliament , could be amended and adopted within weeks .
Similarly , on House of Lords reform , the principles of a fully elected chamber have already been exhaustively debated and adopted by MPs .
As in any bicameral system , peers should be elected on a different constituency basis and electoral cycle to MPs .
Details could be decided on and introduced in the constitutional renewal bill being promoted in the House of Lords by Paul Tyler .
And then there 's electoral reform .
The ideal solution would be an Irish - style single transferable vote system in which voters elect the person , not the party .
But even alternative vote plus – as first advocated by Roy Jenkins in 1998 and now backed by Alan Johnson – would ensure most MPs have a personal constituency link with their voters , as already occurs in Germany and Scotland .
Labour made a promise more than a decade ago to hold a referendum on the Jenkins proposals .
If the government wo n't call a general election , let us have this referendum in early September , as the culmination of 100 days of reform .
Together , over the next 100 days , we could achieve nothing less than the total reinvention of British politics .
These months could become a great moment in British political history , rather than a shabby footnote to a shameful month of scandal .
Let us seize , not squander , the opportunity for change .
Opinion
Republicans entering Century 21
" It 's the wave of the future ! ” Jared Woodfill tells a brave , mostly gray crowd squeezed into a Greenway - area office space amid paraphernalia ranging from life - size cutouts of Ronald Reagan and the Presidents Bush , a Goldwater campaign poster and an Ann Coulter action figure .
They drove from Kingwood and from Clear Lake and from just down the street .
Armed with legal pads , they came to learn how to effectively penetrate what 's become , at least in politics , the domain of mostly whippersnapper Obamaphiles .
Welcome to Facebook 101 , Harris County Republican Party - style .
Upon arrival , the more than 50 attendees receive a how - to packet featuring The Simpsons character centenarian Mr. Burns , his palms connivingly parallel , fingers in mid-drum .
Woodfill , the party 's chairman , sees the series of workshops as the first step in moving the local party , especially its older members , into the current century , where , he concedes , the D - side has been for a while .
“ We do n't agree with them on anything , ” Woodfill says of the Obama machine amid groans at the mere mention of the president 's name .
“ But one thing they did well is use social networking to their advantage . ”
Welcome to the ‘ wake '
The first workshop last week was a hit , prompting Woodfill to plan future sessions to accommodate those turned away .
It 's a welcome sign of life for an organization battling a shrinking base , financial woes , a leadership crisis and a philosophical schism among its members .
“ Welcome to the Harris County Republican Party wake , ” the party 's social networks chairman , Bill Kneer , announces to laughter .
“ I heard it was dead and I see now that it 's not . ”
Kneer tells the group there 's no better place than Facebook to voice opinions on conservative issues or even their frustration at some Republican elected officials : “ If we want to get our party back , we have to do it ourselves . ”
Woodfill asks the crowd how many have signed on to Facebook and about a third put their hands up .
An inquiry into how many still “ do n't have a clue how to work it , ” draws the same response .
Then , the youngest guy in the room , 20 - something Austin consultant Luke Dyer , a soft - spoken redhead with shades propped atop his messily hip hairstyle , jets through the lesson with jargony abandon .
“ Louder ! ” a woman yells from the back .
As Luke drops terms like “ upload ” and “ newsfeed , ” hands sprout from the crowd .
“ Do you have to use your real name ? ”
“ Do you just let everybody in ? ”
“ Do you have to put your correct birthday ? ”
“ Does the person you 're unfriending get a message you 're unfriending them ? ”
Some seem to catch on quickly : “ It 's kind of like a three - dimensional e-mail , ” one woman observed to the person next to her .
Others struggle .
A bewildered - looking woman with short gray hair flees for the exit before Luke can even explain how to fill out the profile page : “ This is so over my head , ” she mutters .
Security concerns
Luke attempts to assure the crowd about security : “ I would n't say your identity is going to get hacked if you have a Facebook account , ” he says .
But some persist with security concerns : IT consultant Mike Bercu ponders whether he could be deposed if a Facebook “ friend ” posts about illegal activities : “ I may be drug up to Alaska for a deposition , ” says Bercu , who said later he was partly kidding .
Others worry about protecting themselves from evil - doers , such as the ACLU .
Richard Dillon , precinct chair and chairman of the party 's “ Rapid Response Team , ” pipes up : “ The best way to minimize the effect of the ACLU finding you is to have a bunch of conservative friends . ”
But Kneer interjects : “ I want the ACLU to find me , ” he says , adding that maybe they could learn something from reading his page .
‘ Let 's wake up '
Eighty - year - old Ruth Hasty of Spring Branch got the message loud and clear .
She came for education and got it .
“ I 've heard of Facebook .
I get these messages and I would like to know what it 's all about , ” she said .
“ I probably will sign up .
I think it 's a pretty good venue . ”
Jack O'Connor , 61 , of Houston , agreed , saying if Obama can e-mail people from Europe during the campaign , Republicans can organize over Facebook , although he acknowledges the age obstacle .
“ As you can see , there 's not many people under 40 here , ” he says .
“ I think this is re-enfranchising people who are over 40 .
And I think that 's good .
Let 's wake up . ”

Dozens of residents of Canada ’s capital city , Ottawa Ontario and nearby Gatineau , Que. , witnessed an object streak across the night sky at about 10 pm local time Monday night and crash into the Ottawa River with a “ thunderous boom . ”
The object had lights on it and appeared to change course several times , like a small plane struggling to stay airborn , before it hit the water .
It was such a sight that emergency rescue and search crews in the area sprung into action and began searching the area using sophisticated sonars and underwater cameras to try and figure out what the object was .
Even helicopters from the Canadian Forces Base ( CFB ) in nearby Trenton took part .
On Tuesday at 1:30 pm , they discovered an object about 9 meters ( 30 feet ) below the surface , but because of currents and nearby rapids , sending divers down would be extremely dangerous since they would be instantly swept away by the currents .
The mystery ?
Authorities and residents have no idea what this object laying at the bottom of the river is .
There are no planes missing from the area , no other aircraft like helicopters , etc. are missing .
There is no derbis , no oil slick and even space agencies that were contacted said nothing disappeared from orbit .
On Tuesday afternoon , Ottawa police Const .
Alain Boucher said of the object they found on the riverbed :
“ The size and the shape does n’t lead us to believe it ’s any piece of an airplane or fuselage or anything like that .
It could be a rock , it could be a bunch of logs stuck together , it ’s hard to say .
No one has come forward with any kind of videos or anything like that at this time .
None of the people actually reported seeing a plane go down at the same time . ”
But the fact still remains – something fell into the Ottawa River Monday night that prompted a massive co-ordinated search by local authorities and the Canadian Military .
They found an object below the surface and do n’t know exactly what it is .
It truly is a UFO mystery at this point .

Ambassador called in over Iranian supreme leader 's warning that Britain is the most evil of foreign powers
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Iran 's ambassador to London was summoned to the Foreign Office this morning after the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , singled out Britain as Iran 's foremost enemy .
In his speech during Friday prayers , Khamenei played on the historic suspicions many Iranians have of Britain by hinting at its involvement in the demonstrations and describing it as " the most evil " of foreign powers .
He held up the Westminster MPs expenses scandal as a prime example of the corruption which he said was rife in many western countries .
Then he unleashed a thunderbolt – a warning not to be wooed by foreign enemies .
Western countries were " hungry wolves ambushing us and removing the diplomatic cover from their faces .
Do not neglect these people , " he warned .
" The outstanding diplomats of some western countries who have talked to us with diplomatic courtesy up to now , have , during the past few days , taken the masquerade away from their faces and are showing their true image .
" They are showing their true enmity towards the Iranian Islamic state and the most evil of them is the British government . "
The mention of Britain triggered chants of " Marg bar Ingles " ( Death to Britain ) from the ranks of worshippers .
Brown intensified his criticism of Iran 's handling of the election dispute today .
" We are with others , including the whole of the European Union unanimously today , in condemning the use of violence , in condemning media suppression , " he told a news conference after a European Union summit in Brussels .
" It is for Iran now to show the world that the elections have been fair … that the repression and the brutality that we have seen in these last few days is not something that is going to be repeated , " he said .
" We want Iran to be part of the international community and not to be isolated .
But it is for Iran to prove … that they can respect these basic rights . "
In playing the British card , Khamenei was appealing to traditional resentment of interference in Iran 's affairs by Britain at the peak of its imperial power , while also tarring the demonstrators by association with a foreign power .
He took aim at other foreign elements , namely the " Zionist - controlled " western media and the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton .
Without naming her , he contrasted her comments about human rights in Iran with the FBI raid on the Davidian cult headquarters in Waco , Texas , in 1993 that left 75 dead .
The incident occurred in the early months of Bill Clinton 's presidency .
Apple may be working to fix an iPhone vulnerability that could possibly allow an attacker to remotely install and run unsigned software code with root access to the phone .
The theoretical attack in question exploits a weakness in the way iPhones handle text messages received via SMS ( Short Message Service ) , said security researcher Charlie Miller , during a presentation at the SyScan conference in Singapore on Thursday .
He did n't provide a detailed technical description of the SMS vulnerability .
[ Related : Jailbroken iPhones leave users more vulnerable .
| Read Tom Yager 's eight easy steps to iPhone security .
|
Last month a group released an iPhone security benchmark . ]
An SMS flaw might allow an attacker to run software code on the phone that is sent by SMS over a mobile operator 's network .
In Miller ’s case , it appears he used the flaw he found to remotely crash an iPhone , a sign that a more serious attack might be possible .
If so , the malicious code could theoretically include commands to monitor the location of the phone using GPS , turn on the phone 's microphone to eavesdrop on conversations , or make the phone join a distributed denial of service attack or a botnet , Miller said
Miller reported the vulnerability to Apple , hoping it will get fixed .
He plans to discuss the flaw further during a presentation at the Black Hat USA conference in Las Vegas .
Despite the SMS vulnerability , the stripped - down version of MacOS X used in the iPhone makes it more secure than computers running the full - blown operating system , Miller said .
For starters , the stripped - down version of the OS presents fewer options for attackers , removing applications and features such as support for Adobe Flash and Java , which they might otherwise be able to exploit for vulnerabilities .
In addition , the iPhone includes hardware protection for data stored in memory and the phone is designed to only run software code that has been digitally signed by Apple .
The iPhone also requires applications to run in a sandbox , a security feature that isolates them from other applications and limits their access to the phone 's capabilities .
But SMS offers a way for attackers to get greater access to the phone 's capabilities , Miller said .
" SMS is a great vector to attack the iPhone , " he said .
Most often used to send brief text messages between cell phones , SMS can also send binary code to an iPhone , which then processes the code without any user interaction .
Each SMS message is limited to 140 bytes , but longer sequences can be sent to the phone as multiple messages that are automatically reassembled .
This feature allows larger programs to be delivered to a phone , Miller said .
In addition , vulnerabilities found in the iPhone 's SMS function give an attacker root access to the handset , Miller said .
That 's not the case for the iPhone 's other applications , such as its browser , where vulnerabilities only give an attacker access to the application 's sandbox .
" The iPhone is more secure than OS X , but SMS could be a critical vulnerability , " Miller said .

Hosting with XHTML , CSS abd Graphics
Limitations of XHTML
Sample of XHTML
About DTDs
What is the role of CSS
Web hosting service is a type of internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make website accessible via World Wide Web .
The hosting companies provide a particular space on the server provided by the web hosting company .
That space is provided according to what the user wants and is that space suitable for the user .
Websites can be hosted in many different platforms .
So if hosting of the website is done with XHTML , CSS and web graphics then how it will be working .
So let ’s go in brief about XHTML , CSS and web graphics .
XHTML is the stricter and cleaner form of HTML and is very much identical to HTML 4.01 .
XHTML is responsible for the structure of the web pages whereas presentation is handled by CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) .
The first version of it is known as XHTML 1.0 .
It used the existing three document types of HTML and reformulated them as applications of XML .
XHTML is the recommendation of W3C ( Worldwide Web Consortium ) , an organization to make and maintain standards for the Internet and its associated technologies .
Some limitations about XHTML :
Documents must have only one root element
XHTML elements must be properly nested
Elements must always be closed and be in lowercase
Tags attribute names must be in lower case and quoted
XHTML tags attribute minimization is forbidden
Websites are designed multi-column CSS layouts with optimized graphic files , the process of website development includes :
• Getting Web Hosting , Domain name and FTP Access :
Get the best business hosting plan which helps you in providing the user best hosting .
Business hosting plan provides following :
• Create a simple ( X) HTML page , how to add links and images :
An XHTML document has a very simple structure .
It has a header , which contains information about the document , and a body , which contains the main content of the document .
To markup this structure , you need three tags – < html > , < head > , and < body > .
The FTP ( File Transfer Protocol , File Transfer Protocol ) is one of the oldest within the Internet .
It is a service that users use frequently ( driver downloads , music , documents , etc . . ) ,
But this is only part of the service , since it is also possible to implement in our machine , FTP server for other users can connect to our computer and pick up / leave information in a particular area .
For eg :
<?xml version = ” 1.0 ″ encoding = ” UTF - 8 ″ ?>
<!DOCTYPE htmlPUBLIC
“-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN ” ” DTD / xhtml1-strict.dtd ” >
< html xmlns= ” http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml” xml:lang= ” en ” lang = ” en ” >
< head >
< title > Strict DTD XHTML Example </ title >
</head >
< body >
< p >
Please Choose a Day :
< br />< br />
< select name = ” day ” >
< option selected =” selected ” > Monday </ option >
< option > Tuesday </ option >
< option > Wednesday </ option >
</select >
</ p>
</ body >
</html >
• Web standards –
Facts about XHTML :
XHTML documents start with an < html > tag – there is no such thing as an < xhtml > tag .
It is required that you declare the XHTML namespace inside the opening < html > tag .
This XHTML example covered the use of XHTML transitional – for XHTML strict or frameset , use the appropriate DOCTYPE Declaration .
Remember that declaring a DOCTYPE with a valid identifier at the top of an XHTML page puts most browers in standards mode - so remember not to use old browser hacks , and non-standard tags .
( Otherwise , use just use regular HTML )
For some browsers , including Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 , if you start an XHTML page with the XML declaration , the browser goes into quirks mode , an unfortunate bug .
The workaround is to delete the optional declaration and declare the the encoding using a meta tag .
The DOCTYPE declaration has to be in all uppercase characters , just like in the XHTML example code .
What are DTD’s ?
XML defines the DTD [ document type definition ] to avail variable contents to display them .
XML conversion services are useful for newspapers , magazines , journals , technical and various documents , graphics and other republishing services .
The source file is converted and validated with best validating software ; every individual tag will be validated by automated method to make sure the highest quality standard is achieved .
The purpose of a DTD ( Document Type Definition ) is to define the legal building blocks of an XML document .
A DTD defines the document structure with a list of legal elements and attributes .
Three types of DTD ’s are there :
a. Strict :
You should use the strict DTD when your XHTML pages will be marked up cleanly , free of presentational clutter .
You use the strict DTD together with cascading style sheets , because it does n’t allow attributes like “ bgcolor ” to be set for the < body > tag , etc .
b. Transitional
The transitional DTD should be used when you need to take advantage of the presentational features that are available through HTML .
You should also use the transitional DTD when you want to support older browsers that do n’t have built - in support for cascading style sheets .
c. Frameset
You should use the frameset DTD when your XHTML page will contain frames .

• Cascading Style Sheets – CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets .
Styles define how to display HTML elements .
Styles were added to HTML 4.0 to solve a problem .
External Style Sheets can save a lot of work .
External Style Sheets are stored in CSS files .
CSS defines HOW HTML elements are to be displayed .
CSS allows us to create visual settings for our internet documents .
CSS is not a tool to enrich the business or logical layers of websites .
The main and only purpose of CSS is to enrich and give a better control to visual aspects such as page layout , page color , text and decorations and the like .
CSS also allows us to define different display of the same content in different situations .
For example , using CSS it can be configured to display content differently in a browser or printed document .
CSS also allows us to customize the way one reader or a group of readers will see our site according to various characteristics that we can define in advance .
For example if you want to change the background color of a page then CSS is as follows :
< html >
< head >
< style type=” text /css ” >
body
{
background - color : #b0c4de ;
}
</style >
</head >
< body >
< h1 > My CSS web page !</h1 >

• Web graphics : Graphics are visual elements often used to point readers and viewers to particular information .
They are also used to supplement text in an effort to aid readers in their understanding of a particular concept or make the concept more clear or interesting .
Graphics can be functional or artistic .
The latter can be a recorded version , such as a photograph , or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features , or an artist , in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred .
Web graphic design has been professed as the easiest and modern method for online connectedness , exploring other arenas of typography for designs .
It uses visual arts , creative and cognitive skills , etc. for creating that quest to grouping .
In primary events equal fluid publicity , competent illustration designs activity a better portrayal in determining the open soul for the kind .

WENDELL POTTER :
That we should n't fear government involvement in our health care system .
That there is an appropriate role for government , and it's been proven in the countries that were in that movie .
You know , we have more people who are uninsured in this country than the entire population of Canada .
And that if you include the people who are underinsured , more people than in the United Kingdom .
We have huge numbers of people who are also just a lay - off away from joining the ranks of the uninsured , or being purged by their insurance company , and winding up there .
And another thing is that the advocates of reform or the opponents of reform are those who are saying that we need to be careful about what we do here , because we do n't want the government to take away your choice of a health plan .
It 's more likely that your employer and your insurer is going to switch you from a plan that you 're in now to one that you do n't want .
You might be in the plan you like now .
But chances are , pretty soon , you 're going to be enrolled in one of these high deductible plans in which you 're going to find that much more of the cost is being shifted to you than you ever imagined …

Five More Co-Sponsors For Frank ’s Bill
Gambling News - July 1 , 2009 - Written by Renee
The support for H.R. 2267 , the Internet Gambling Regulation Consumer Protection & Enforcement
Act is rising .
This bill was introduced by Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank in order to legalize and regulate online gambling .
This week five more Congressmen have signed up as co-sponsors to the bill .
They are Rep. Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii , Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon , Rep. Bill Foster of Illinois , Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York .
The total number of co-sponsors now stands at 40 .
Despite the talk of bipartisan support , the field is overwhelmingly loaded with politicians from the Democrat party .
Of the 40 co-sponsors 36 are Democrats .
There are three Republicans .
Of these Peter King from New York is the original co-sponsor .
The other two are Ronald Paul from Texas and Donald Young from Alaska .
Gregorio Sablan from Northern Mariana Islands is an Independent .
The online poker industry has as much at stake in the bill as the online casino industry .
The Poker Players Alliance ( PPA ) is solidly backing the bill .
It is requesting those interested in online gambling , whether members of the PPA or not , to mail a standard letter to their Representatives from the PPA web site .
The letter exhorts Representatives to co-sponsor and support the bill .
It says , “ H.R. 2267 provides for sensible regulation of Internet gaming and puts the U.S. in charge of safeguarding its citizens .
H.R. 2267 mandates rigorous safeguards against underage participation and protections for those with excessive gaming habits .
This bill will also allow American gaming companies to participate in the world ’s Internet gaming market , bringing needed jobs to America . ”
I 'm halfway through a big bet and I just weighed in at a tad over 210 pounds this morning , right on schedule for winning my bet .
Getting down to 220 lbs from 230 at the start of the year was easy , but the rest of the pounds were much harder .
I 'm now on a pretty good weight loss streak of a couple pounds per week with no end in sight .
Different things work for different people but I thought I 'd share what worked for me in the hopes that maybe one or more of these tips will help your own weight loss as well .
Read the Hackers Diet
A good starting point is reading the bible for geek weight loss :
The Hacker 's Diet .
It 's a simple free book you can get a copy of online and read on almost any device .
It 's pretty basic stuff , talking about how food equals calories equals pounds and how to count and curb calories while exercising to further your calorie deficit .
The book does a great job of laying out a simple engineering approach that does n't concern itself with what foods you eat or how you prepare them or even what exercise you choose to do , it 's all just simple math on how to make small changes to lose a pound or two a week to meet your goal and maintain your ideal weight .
The only downside to the book is that it was written a long time ago and you should ignore all the mentions of spreadsheets and the screenshots of early Excel running in Windows 3.1 because thankfully there are iPhone apps and online apps that can keep track of your data much easier .
Weigh yourself every day , use a moving average to analyze it
I 've heard many times in many places that you should n't live and die simply by the scale and that you should instead plot your daily weight on an average curve that smoothes out the daily fluctuations in weight .
I never had the patience to do this until recently but now that I have I fully understand the benefits .
It 's also important to limit your variables by taking your weight at around the same time every day , with the same scale , under similar conditions .
I do this every morning right after I get up .
I usually pee , get undressed completely , and take my weight .
I 've been doing this for almost a year and I used to get depressed easily if I happened to shoot up a few 10ths of a pound one day .
It was n't until I switched to a moving average that I started to see the light .
It takes a couple weeks to get enough data points but trust me that it is worth it .
There are many explanations of why one would use a moving average , but I 'll just say that it covers your weight trends and lessens the daily fluctuations .
This means if you drop 0.1 pounds every day for a week then one morning you weigh in at one full pound heavier than the previous day , your entire week was n't shot that morning because you 'd still be trending downwards .
If you stick to your plans you 'll often see weight continue to go down even with the occasional hiccup .
After trying out several online tools and apps , I like physicsdiet.com the best .
It gives a nice history graph and you can use the basic green - means - good , pink - means - bad to continue exercising and watching what you eat .
Sometimes it can be frustrating if you suddenly lose a few pounds and your moving average still reads a pound or two higher than what the scale says , but having a slow moving average has done wonders for my happiness each day .
An average weight loss trend removes a lot of the emotion from daily weigh - ins , in a good way .
Practice mindful eating
When I first started trying to lose weight I hit a plateau early on .
I was doing more exercise but I was n't losing any weight for months on end and it was n't until I realized that I was eating larger meals to counteract the exercise that I solved the plateau problem .
Being mindful of your eating for me means a few things .
First , I try to have small dinners , early in the evening .
Secondly , at every meal and especially dinner I stop every few minutes while eating and take a quick assessment of how full I am feeling .
In the past , I 've pretty much just shoveled food into my mouth until a plate was cleared , but now I frequently have small light dinners with 14 hours or so before breakfast the next day , which really helps lower my daily calorie intake .
Another quick tip came from somewhere deep in Ask MetaFilter : if you 're presented with some large meal , rich food , or incredible looking dessert , ask yourself if you 'll remember it two weeks from now .
If the answer is yes , by all means go ahead and eat it and enjoy it and think back on how wonderful it was weeks from now .
If the answer is no , put the fork down and go do something else .
Pick an exercise that does n't feel like work
I know a lot of friends that have done the Body for Life thing have told me to not just try a diet and not just try a workout , but change your schedule permanently so you can do healthy things forever and it 's true .
My big win on losing weight was increasing my exercise but doing so with an activity I love to do ( cycling ) .
So it was n't a chore to increase my weekly miles on a bike , it was a chance to spend more time doing something I loved .
Even if you hate gyms , hate working out , hate running , hate cycling , and hate jumping rope , you have to find something physical you love to do in order to make it work .
Once you find that exercise embrace it and use enthusiasm to help burn some extra calories .
Overall I 'm really happy with my 20 lbs lost since early this year and I 'm looking forward to losing another 15 lbs more before I try to stabilize my weight below 200 lbs .
A lot of it comes down to self - control — there are so many opportunities every day to gorge yourself on free office bagels , high calorie coffee drinks , and rich desserts that it 's often hard to say no , but with good feedback and some clear goals it makes it much easier to say no .
A few weeks ago , the Daily Mail wrote about a low - ranking British diplomat named James Hudson who was caught on hidden camera by the FSB ( formerly the KGB , formerlier the MVD , formerlierer the NKVD , formerliest the Cheka ) getting it on with two Russian hookers in a Yekaterinburg brothel .
The paper published a couple of frame grabs from the video , but I wanted to check out the raw footage for myself .
It looked like one of those classic sex scandals set up to blackmail someone into cooperation , and there ’s nothing cooler than being able to watch real spy games in action .
So I headed straight for kompromat.ru , Russia ’s biggest muckraking / political scandal news site .
If the video does n’t load , click here .
The only promise we ’ll make is that it ’s not kiddie snuff porn .
In terms of porn quality , the FSB snake camera crew could ’ve done a bit of a better job with composition and timing , but the fact is they did n’t have much to work with .
Hudson is a bit of chub , his bitch of an ex-wife said as much : “ He let himself go …
He never wore glasses and he was thin .
I ’m glad I got out when I did . ”
But no one said a damn thing about the hookers being fat , too .
What was the FSB thinking sending in such subpar seductresses ?
One of them was particularly bad , with a huge blubbery fender swinging from her front end .
But for all their principals ’ telegenic failings , the spies at least did their homework .
Or maybe they just lucked out .
Whatever the case , it ’s pretty obvious from the video that Hudson is into the chunky chicks .
When confronted with two prostitutes , a man will inevitably , subconsciously choose a favorite .
Hudson hardly pays any attention to the other hooker in the room , perfectly content rubbing sweaty lard sacks with the one that reminds him of his womenfolk back home ; loose , pasty skinbags full of beer and fish ‘ n ’ chips .
Hudson clearly has a sick side as well , because the only thing he can think of doing with the better - looking whore is to have her sit on his face and jump up and down .
Sick , and dangerous .
If Hudson keeps up this kind debauchery , he ’s gonna end up looking like Baron Harkonnen .
Anyways , I ’m getting a bit sidetracked here .
I did n’t mean to do a point - by - point sex tape review .
I wanted to talk about Russia ’s system of kompromat , or “ compromising information . ”
Russians still like to settle political and business disputes the way men have been settling them since the cave days : with beatings , disappearances , mysterious suicides , strange poisonings , and good old - fashioned summary executions .
But these days in Russia you ca n’t go around offing people like you used to , especially when you ’re dealing with high - powered businessmen and politicians .
And anyway , Russia is a democratic country now .
One must keep up appearances .
This is where kompromat comes in handy .
Put simply , kompromat sites are just news aggregators like any other .
They collect relevant and interesting news stories , and also offer a service for politicians and businessmen .
For a fee , they ’ll post a link to whatever story you can provide them , no matter how ridiculously fake or outrageous .
If the client does n’t have his own fake news agency to publish the article , kompromat sites can post it for you on one of the many seemingly legitimate blogs they maintain for just such situations .
The more popular a kompromat site , the more money it can charge .
But not every kid off the street can open his own kompromat site .
Posting damaging info on high - powered people can quickly get you disappeared without proper protection .
No one will come out and admit it , but all of the dozens of scandal sites are backed by some sort of powerful government agency , which uses its kompromat portal to launch smear campaigns against their rivals .
Russia has a draconian array of armed government agencies :
There ’s the FSB ( sort of like a FBI - CIA hybrid ) , the GRU ( an elite CIA ) , the current MVD ( federal cops ) , and the FCS ( a mix between border patrol and the FBI ) ; and these are just the top of the pigpile .
These groups are always engaged in behind - the - scenes turf wars for businesses , smuggling routes , and government funds .
About a year ago , I did a story on Russia ’s answer to Matt Drudge .
Sergei Gorshkov founded Russia ’s first and most popular scandal site , kompromat.ru .
That ’s the one I got the sex video from .
Back then , his competitors estimated he made somewhere around $ 1 million USD a year , tax free .
He supposedly also had offers to sell his low - tech site for $ 10 million , but the bastard would n’t go below $ 15 million , firm .
Sergei Gorshkov , the most trusted man in Russia
The cool thing about Gorshkov was that he was n’t at all shy about divulging his fee schedule :
He charges between $ 600 and $ 800 per single post , depending on its libel risk .
Half of the dozen or so articles posted daily on the site are paid for , meaning he makes a minimum of $ 3,600 a day .
Not a bad racket !
This kind of success could only have been achieved with a very strong guardian angel .
Gorshkov denies any affiliation , but word on the street has it that he ’s the Federal Custom Service ’s boy .
If you mess with him , you better be prepared to do battle with Russia ’s second - strongest armed - security organization .
Most Americans would scoff at this kind of blatant sellout journalistic business model , but it is n’t much better here .
It ’s just way more hypocritical .
American journalists are the biggest frauds of them all , wrapped in so much self - serving bullshit about “ objectivity ” and “ balance ” that they ’ve actually started believing it .
It ’s impossible to fight against their proud notions , but every now and then we are blessed with media fuck - ups to help remind us of just how sleazy news people really are .
There were a few memorable ones just this month :
In early July , Politico got its hands on a flyer from the Washington Post which in real plain English invited corporations to an exclusive closed - door , off - the - record cocktail party at the residence of the Post ’s publisher .
The price of “ sponsorship ” was between $ 25,000 and $ 250,000 and would guarantee the sponsor the full , sympathetic attention of Post editors and journalists .
But that ’s not all .
Here ’s what else a small donation to a struggling newspaper can get you , according to the flyer :
Underwriting Opportunity : An evening with the right people can alter the debate .
Spirited ?
Yes .
Confrontational ?
No .
The relaxed setting in the home of Katharine Weymouth assures it .
What is guaranteed is a collegial evening , with Obama administration officials , Congress members , business leaders , advocacy leaders , and other select minds typically on the guest list of 20 or less .
…
“ _ Offered at $ 25,000 per sponsor , per Salon .
Maximum of two sponsors per Salon.
Underwriters ’ CEO or Executive Director participates in the discussion .
Underwriters appreciatively acknowledged in printed invitations and at the dinner .
Annual series sponsorship of 11 Salons offered at $ 250,000 … Hosts and Discussion Leaders … Health - care reporting and editorial staff members of The Washington Post …
An exclusive opportunity to participate in the health - care reform debate among the select few who will actually get it done_ . ”
The Washington Post sent this flyer to health industry lobbyists just as they were gearing up to fight Obama ’s health insurance reform push .
The flyer does n’t leave much room for doubt : to the Post , objectivity is defined strictly by money .
If you want them to condemn 40 million uninsured Americans to early , agonizing deaths for a one - time donation of $ 25,000 , they can do it .
It ’s a joke , and they are the ones laughing .
The Post is not even a news organization anymore , if it ever was .
It ’s just an elaborate public relations firm , cranking out press releases for their sponsors and planning hobnobbing events for government officials and their corporate bosses .
Ironically , it was a lobbyist who leaked the document to Politico .
He thought that the Post was over the line with their offer .
See , even lobbyists have more integrity than publishers of print media these days .
Just as the fallout from this story was starting to finally settle over Capitol Hill , Talking Points Memo reignited the whole debate with another leaked sleazy pay - to - play journo party , this time put on by The Atlantic .
Here ’s their pitch :
Salon Dinners : Private Conversations Among
Thought - leaders Private , custom , off - the - record conversations of 20 - 30 key influential individuals , moderated by an Atlantic editor , designed to bring a thoughtful group together for unbounded conversation on key issues of the day .
Sampling of salon dinner sponsors and topics :
– AstraZeneca on “ Healthcare Access and Education ”
– Microsoft on “ Global Trade , ”
– GE on “ Energy Sustainability and the Future of Nuclear Power ”
– Allstate on “ The Future of the American City ”
– Citi on “ The Challenge of Global Markets ”
The Atlantic turned out to be a bit more clever than the Post .
They knew better than to print the bribe amount right there on the invite .
No one will say how much they charged , but what is known is that this was not a one - off event for the Atlantic .
It was n’t even a ten - off event , either .
The magazine has staged something like 100 of these things since 2003 .
Like the Post , The Atlantic firmly defended their dinner tradition .
They claim it never occurred to anyone on the staff that these events might actually be unethical .
It just never crossed their minds .
They did n’t think of it like that .
And that ’s the part that ’s the most telling .
The truth is , these kinds of corporate fluff parties happen all the time in the news industry .
Always have .
Even the stodgy old New Yorker throws these things .
That ’s exactly why I ’m with the Gorshkov - kompromat model , it ’s a more honest form of shadiness .
“ I never take sides , ” Gorshkov told me .
“ Besides , the nature of the business is such that when one side of a conflict orders an article , their opponents inevitably respond , usually before the day is out .
This way , all sides of the conflict are aired , and objectivity is maintained . ”
Hey , the free market takes care of itself .
Case closed .

[ digg- reddit - me ] Last week , Matt Yglesias explained how the relationship between Congress , the media , and the public does n’t often lead to positive policy results .
His these is that a policy idea do not become popular and then receive bipartisan support and those presidents who support such ideas then succeed ; instead , the observing affects the observed : if an idea is promoted by the president at the head of one party and is supported by at least some of his opposition party then the media conveys this in such a way that the idea becomes popular ; if instead his opponents remain solidly opposed , the idea is seen as overreach .
It was this insight that allowed Bill Clinton to bounce back after his defeat on health care in 1993 / 1994 .
The plan was solid enough – but failed , among other reasons , because the Republicans solidly opposed it and were able to peel off a few Democrats .
The public thus assumed that the health care plan was a bad thing , that it was a result of Clinton ’s liberal overreach .
Clinton , to his credit learned from this defeat and subsequently exploited this dynamic by consistently peeling off a few Republicans for the rest of his initiatives – or sometimes siding with them more substantially – and thus accomplished things as he needed to in order to save his presidency .
The problem is that Clinton ’s approach often hurt the Democratic party – and resulted in many small initiatives at a time when there were festering problems that needed to be dealt with .
Obama has tried to be the un-Clinton on this and other issues .
Clinton was often seen to be insincere in reaching out to the Republicans – but he helped the class of 1994 pass a significant part of their agenda .
Obama has taken pains to appear sincere , but has been more interested in ideas of his own – including incorporating Republican ideas into his proposals .
While Bill Clinton had started out happy with partisan victories , but then gradually came to see how the above dynamic could be used to protect himself , and became a proponent of bipartisanship , Obama started out trying to reach out to Republicans , but has become disillusioned with bipartisanship as he saw how the necessity of it gave inordinate power to a few Republicans to derail his agenda .
All of this creates a situation which Jonathan Chait over at The New Republic ‘s Plank describes :
Democrats simply have to accept that health care reform is going to be polling badly when they vote on it .
There ’s no mechanism in the current media configuration that would allow them to convey the details of the plan in a positive way without getting overrun by negative process stories .
It ’s just not possible .
What they have to focus on is which alternative is likely to make them better off : reform passing or reform failing .
It ’s an easy call , which is why I think reform will pass .
But it ’s a bit depressing that the actual merit of a policy has little to nothing to do with whether or not it will pass .
I agree with Chait that health care reform will pass – and it will be substantial – because the Democrats know they must just take that leap of faith and trust the president ( or whoever the architect of this health care bill ends up being ) .
It ’s an easy choice between whether each representative wants to survive together , or hang separately .

Honest people do n’t have to work at not cheating .
They ’re not even tempted .
That ’s the conclusion of the first - ever neurobiological study of honesty and cheating , which could someday help develop brain - based tests of truthfulness .
When studying honesty , neuroscientists usually ask people to either tell the truth or lie while undergoing a brain scan .
This is unsatisfactory , because even the “ liars ” are doing as they were told , so Joshua Greene and Joseph Paxton at Harvard University came up with an alternative .
Advertisement
They asked volunteers to bet money on the flip of a coin .
Sometimes the players had to record their predictions before the flip , and sometimes they said whether they had guessed correctly after the flip , giving them the opportunity to cheat .
Some – but not all – did so , as evidenced by an abnormally high “ success ” rate .
Honesty test ?
In each round , fMRI was used to record brain activity in the prefrontal cortex and other regions associated with decision making and behavioural control .
Honest players showed no increase in brain activity when they had a chance to cheat , suggesting that they did n’t have to make a conscious effort to be honest .
In contrast , dishonest players showed increased brain activity whenever they had a chance to cheat – even when they reported ( presumably truthfully ) that they had lost .
In fact , Greene and Paxton found that they could predict each player ’s degree of cheating from their brain activity with remarkable accuracy .
If the results of this lab experiment can be generalised to real - world situations – a big if , Greene points out – then brain scans could someday be used to measure , for example , a prospective employee ’s overall honesty .
But before that becomes practical , researchers would need to verify that scans can be compared reliably over time and among different test conditions or groups of subjects , says Martha Farah , a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia .

FEATURES Valve 's Gabe Newell on Becoming a Game Developer [ 11.07.08 ]
- GameCareerGuide.com staff
[ Shiny Entertainment founder Dave Perry recently wrote up an interview he did with Gabe Newell , co-founder and managing director of Valve Software , about getting into the video game industry .

Gabe Newell on Careers in Video Game Development
Interview by Dave Perry
I 've been quoted as saying that Gabe Newell will be the richest person in the video game industry .
It 's a bold statement , but he and his very talented crew have been able to stay ahead of the curve on engine technology , game design , sales , business , publishing , you name it .
I have a lot of respect for his " Steam " initiative ( cutting edge digital distribution service that a major media company will buy ) , and the fact that he has completely opened up the industry to new indie teams .
It 's hard to find someone that 's more busy than him [ sic ] , and that makes the fact that he 's willing to give advice to students even more valuable .
I laughed out loud when I read how he compared Hollywood and the video game industry when it comes to niche talent .
I 've been expecting the opposite of what he says ( I 'm not going to spoil it ) , but I 've now changed my opinion and agree that blended talent is indeed much more valuable these days .
So here you go .
Iif you 're a student , here 's some great advice from Gabe Newell , the founder of Valve .
Dave Perry :
What did your mother want you to do as a career ?
Surely , it could n't have been to make professional video games !
Gabe Newell : Well , my mom was actually the first programmer in the family ( Bell Labs ) .
She told me that I should be a " system analyst " which is , in retrospect , an odd thing to say to a 9 - year - old .
DP : What would you say to my mother , to get her off my back and let me make professional video games as a career ?
GN : Video games are growing faster than the rest of the economy , combine the best aspects of the high tech and entertainment industries , and they are personally satisfying to work on .
DP : Tell us about your start in the industry .
What was your life like when you were younger and hungrier ?
GN : There were two aspects of my early experiences in the industry that are probably relevant : networking and personal interests .
On the networking side , I already knew people in the industry who were instrumental in helping launch me in the field ( specifically , Michael Abrash who was at id Software , and with whom I 'd worked at Microsoft ) .
On the personal interest side , in addition to loving video games , I had already done a lot of thinking about consumer computing platforms that had given me a set of tools that were helpful in starting Valve .
DP : It 's pretty tough ( almost damn impossible ) to get hired without industry experience on a resume .
Should I lie ?
It 's the standard Catch - 22 , need a job to get experience , need experience to get a job .
Imagine you are me , caught in the 22 -- what the heck would you do ?
GN : Do n't lie .
That 's just a disaster on multiple levels .
The best thing to do is to start making content using the mod tools that are out there .
Whether you use Civilization or Warcraft III or Hammer does n't matter as much as that you are building and shipping stuff to customers , getting their feedback , and then iterating your work .
Mod development is better in a lot of ways of both honing your skills and demonstrating your talent to a potential employer than work experience as there are going to be fewer institutional barriers and creative constraints to limit the work you do .
DP : People that never went to college in the video games business swear blind that colleges are n't needed to get a job .
Are they for real ?
Should I burn my books now ?
GN : That is changing very quickly .
In the past , colleges did n't really have anything to teach people that directly applied to game development , so people who went to school or did n't go to school were more or less on the same footing .
However programs like Digipen are a huge advantage , and are very valuable for the students who make it through .
DP : How did you get your big break ?
Did you claw your way out of the testers ' pit ?
Did you sleep your way to the top ?
Did you sleep at all ?

BIG RAPIDS --
Four construction workers were seriously injured Wednesday after lighting struck a tree they were standing under at a Ferris State University project site , said Tim Ward , project manager for Clark Construction Co .
The four men , found clustered under the tree by emergency crews , were transported to Mecosta County Medical Center .
Two later were taken to a Grand Rapids hospital to be treated for their injuries .
All the injuries could be considered potentially life - threatening , fire officials said .
The men have not yet been identified and the extent of their injuries is not known , Ward said .
The four are employees of J. Ranck Electric of Mount Pleasant , subcontractors of Clark Construction Co. , the group managing upgrades to the FSU infrastructure , he said .
Heavy rains in Big Rapids around 9:45 a.m. had stopped work at the site , he said .
The men , who were walking to their vehicles , hid under a group of pine trees and one of the trees was struck by lightning , fire officials said .
" There were some people in the building next door that called 911 , " Ward said .
" But nobody actually saw what happened . "
" Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and we are hoping that they 're OK , " he said .
State safety inspectors are on the scene completing their investigation of the incident .
The project , which began about three weeks ago , employs around 30 electricians , day laborers and operating engineers , Ward said .

A simple formula , familiar to high school students , can be used to refute the official account of American Airlines Flight 77 -- alleged to have struck the Pentagon on September 11 , 2001 .
Force = Mass X Velocity Squared / Radius
This formula approximates the force that would be exerted on an aircraft when it transitions from its downward path to level flight .
First we determine the mass of the aircraft .
Flight 77 , a Boeing 757 , had taken off from Washington Dulles International airport , and was bound for Los Angeles .
Assuming its fuel tanks were full , and ignoring the weight of the 64 passengers , and cargo ( which should be available if one wants to include them ) , the weight of the plane would be about 255,000 pounds ( Boeing Technical Specifications ) .
For our calculation we 'll assume that weight and mass are equal , i.e. 255,000 pounds .
For velocity we turn to the official account that Flight 77 struck the Pentagon at " 530 miles per hour " ( The 9/11 Commission Report , p10 ) .
For our calculation we 'll assume that speed and velocity are equal , i.e. 530 mph ( speed is a scalar and velocity is a vector ) .
To calculate the radius , we could begin with a statement in The 9/11 Commission Report ( p9 ) : Flight 77 was " 5 miles west - southwest of the Pentagon " when it " began a 330 - degree turn .
At the end of turn , it was descending through 2,200 feet " .
Next we need to calculate the maximum radius ( the most conservative case ) of the arc that would allow the aircraft to transition from its downward path to level flight ( while clearing obstacles in its path ) , and strike the Pentagon at the point described in official reports .
We chose instead to use the radius calculated by Pilots for 9/11 Truth .
Pilots for 9/11 Truth base their calculation on the Flight Data Recorder ( FDR ) data obtained pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request filed with the National Transportation Safety Board , and carefully constructed topography of the area below the flight path .
Leaving aside the discrepancies between the official account of Flight 77 , and the Flight Data Recorder ( which NTSB refuses to answer ) , Pilots for 9/11 Truth calculated a radius equal to about 579 feet .
From this they calculated the force on the Boeing 757 at 34 Gs , i.e. 34 times the force due to gravity .
There has been some criticism of the calculations performed by Pilots for 9/11 Truth , and they have answered their critics .
With mass , velocity , and radius equal to 255,000 lbs , 530 mph , and 579 feet respectively , the preceding formula yields force equal to 8,276,850 lbs , i.e. the Boeing 757 would act as if it had increased its weight by 8,276,850 lbs , or more than 32 times its normal weight .
With a virtual weight of about 8.5 million pounds , Flight 77 could not have levelled off before striking the Pentagon .
It would have crashed before it reached the Pentagon .
This fact alone is sufficient to refute the official account of " Flight 77 . "
Neither Hani Hanjour -- the alleged pilot trainee " noted for incompetence " , nor the Boeing 757 , would have been in any condition to fly with " the top of the fuselage of the aircraft no more than 20 ft above the ground " ( Pentagon Building Performance Report , p14 ) .
Pilots for 9/11 Truth did another calculation by lowering the height of " Flight 77 " below that shown by the FDR .
They lowered it to to the top of the Virginia Department of Transportation communications antenna that sits below the alleged flight path .
With this very conservative case , they calculated the force on the Boeing 757 at 11.2 Gs. " 11.2 Gs was never recorded in the FDR .
11.2 Gs would rip the aircraft apart " they state .
Calculations by Frank Legge and David Chandler , Scientists for 9/11
Truth , do not take into account the 4 - storey Navy Annex on the north side of Columbia Pike ( its southeast corner is at an elevation of 124 feet ) and the gas station and electric power line west of the Pentagon .
These appear to be higher than the flight path calculated by Legge and Chandler , which even if theoretically possible , is at least an order of magnitude more difficult than striking the Pentagon from the east .
Stiking from the east is likely to inflict more damage to top military commanders whose offices overlook the Potomac River on the eastern side of the Pentagon .
Frank Legge and David Chandler ignore the overwhelming evidence against their conclusion .
Their analysis requires one more step : calculating the probability that Hani Hanjour could fly a Boeing 757 in a spiral turn from 7000 feet along their calculated flight path to strike the western wall of the Pentagon between the first and second floor as described in the Pentagon Building Performance Report .

Yesterday the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations decided to investigate the practice of recission .
This is when you pay your premiums for years to a healthcare insurer , then get sick , and then have your insurance cancelled .
The insurance industry executives at the hearing did not exactly cover themselves with glory :
A Texas nurse said she lost her coverage , after she was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer , for failing to disclose a visit to a dermatologist for acne .
The sister of an Illinois man who died of lymphoma said his policy was rescinded for the failure to report a possible aneurysm and gallstones that his physician noted in his chart but did not discuss with him .
…. Late in the hearing , [ Bart ] Stupak , the committee chairman , put the executives on the spot .
Stupak asked each of them whether he would at least commit his company to immediately stop rescissions except where they could show “ intentional fraud . ”
The answer from all three executives : “ No . ”
Rep. John Dingell ( D - Mich . ) said that a public insurance plan should be a part of any overhaul because it would force private companies to treat consumers fairly or risk losing them .
“ This is precisely why we need a public option , ” Dingell said .

The opinions expressed are his own )
Tough marijuana laws are driving millions of Americans to a more dangerous mood - altering substance , alcohol .
The unintended consequence : violence and thousands of unnecessary deaths .
It ’s time , therefore , for a serious public debate of the case for marijuana versus alcohol .
That ’s the message groups advocating the legalization of marijuana are beginning to press , against a background of shifting attitudes which have already prompted 13 states to relax draconian laws dating back to the 1930s , when the government ended alcohol prohibition and began a determined but futile effort to stamp out marijuana .
How dismally that effort has failed is not in doubt .
Marijuana is so easily available that around 100 million Americans have tried it at least once and some 15 million use it regularly , according to government estimates .
The U.S. marijuana industry , in terms of annual retail sales , has been estimated to be almost as big as the alcohol industry — $ 113 billion and $ 130 billion respectively .
On a global scale , marijuana is the world ’s most widely used illicit drug .
Since the United States , and much of the rest of the world , plunged into a recession last year , the most frequently used argument in favour of legalizing marijuana has been economic : if it were taxed , the revenue would help stimulate economic recovery just as a gusher of dollars in fresh tax revenue from alcohol helped the United States pull out of the Great Depression after the 1933 repeal of prohibition .
That idea enrages some leading drug warriors , including the head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , Antonio Maria Costa .
In the preface to the U.N. ’s 2009 World Drug Report , he asks whether proponents of legalization and taxation also favour legalizing and taxing human trafficking and modern - day slavery “ to rescue failed banks . ”
Never mind that drug abusers hurt themselves and human traffickers hurt others .
It ’s the kind of topsy - turvy logic which has made sober discussion of national and international drug policies ( largely driven by the United States ) so difficult for so long .
The case for adding a compare - and - contrast dimension to the debate is laid out in a statistics - laden book to be published next month entitled “ Marijuana is Safer , So why are we driving people to drink ? ”
The authors are prominent legalization advocates – Steve Fox of the Marijuana Policy Project , Paul Armentano of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) and Mason Tvert , co-founder of SAFER ( Safer Alternative for Enjoyable Recreation ) .
“ The plain and simple truth is that alcohol fuels violent behaviour and marijuana does not , ” Norm Stamper , a former Seattle police chief , writes in the foreword of the book .
“ Alcohol … contributes to literally millions of acts of violence in the United States each year .
It is a major contributing factor to crimes like domestic violence , sexual assault and homicide .
Marijuana use … is absent in that regard from both crime reports and the scientific literature .
There is simply no causal link to be found . ”
LACK OF COMMON SENSE
Violence committed by belligerent drunks apart , there is the question of which drug — marijuana or alcohol — is more harmful to your health .
The authors cite government statistics and a long string of academic studies that show marijuana is less harmful .
According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , around 35,000 Americans die of alcohol - related diseases every year .
That ’s almost 100 a day .
Add to this another 16,000 people killed in road accidents involving drunk drivers .
There are no equivalent statistics for deaths linked to marijuana use .
Yet alcohol is legal , marijuana is not .
The monumental lack of common sense in the attitudes of successive U.S. administrations towards marijuana is one of the explanations for a steady shift in public attitudes as reflected by opinion polls .
In May , a Zogby poll found 52 percent support for treating marijuana as a legal , taxed and regulated substance .
Opposition to legalization , polls show , has been weakening over the past few years .
Before 2005 , no national poll showed support for legalization above 36 percent .
But surveys also show that there is a persistent perception that alcohol and marijuana are equally harmful and that legalization would merely add another vice .
“ This perception is wrong , ” says Tvert , “ and it ca n’t be corrected overnight .
What we aim for is legislation that would give adults the choice between alcohol and a less harmful alternative .
Current laws steer people towards alcohol because they fear the consequences of being caught using marijuana .
But I think we are nearing a tipping point . ”
Perhaps .
One of the biggest obstacles on the road to policy changes is a sprawling bureaucracy of drug warriors who have an obvious interest in keeping things as they are and have long practice in shrugging aside data and evidence .
During the eight years of the Bush administration , they were led by a staunch , ideologically - driven proponent of prohibition at any cost , drug czar John Walters .
The man President Barack Obama chose as his top drug policy official , Gil Kerlikowske , is likely to be more open to rational argument .
Kerlikowske succeeded Norm Stamper as Seattle police chief and during his tenure , possession of marijuana by an adult ranked as the city ’s lowest law enforcement priority .
Lower than running a red light .

LOS ANGELES 
An ever - widening budget gap joined with intractable political paralysis to deliver California its biggest fiscal blow in decades on Thursday , when the state ’s controller began printing i.o.u.’s in lieu of cash to pay taxpayers , vendors and local governments .
It was only the second time the state had adopted the emergency payment method since the Great Depression .
The National Conference of State Legislatures had no record of any other state ’s ever using them .
It was unclear whether the i.o.u.’s , known as warrants , would be accepted by all of the banks in California , which were caught off guard by the move and seemed hesitant to entrust the state to repay the them  at an interest rate of 3.75 percent  in October , as promised .
The controller , John Chiang , issued 28,742 warrants totaling $ 53.3 million .
If state lawmakers fail to reach a budget agreement by the end of August , the amount would grow to $ 4.8 billion .
Adobe has released an Open Source Media Framework ( OSMF ) that can be used to build Flash - based streaming video players .
The framework emerged from Adobe 's Strobe initiative and is part of a broader collaborative effort called the Open Video Player project that has brought together Microsoft , Adobe , Akamai , and other key players with the aim of simplifying real - world video delivery on the Internet .
The OSMF provides a preintegrated stack of components for building a streaming video player that runs on top of Adobe 's Flash browser plugin .
It includes stream loading functionality , user interface classes , and other parts that are needed to build a video player .
The roadmap , which has been published at the project 's website , lists a wide range of more specialized features that are planned or under active development , such as rich playlist support and a connection plugin for streaming content from Akamai 's content delivery network .
OSMF will make it easier for Web developers to create custom streaming video players for Flash .
Developers can simply take the components of the OSMF and add or modify it as needed to include additional functionality or give it a custom look and feel .
It eliminates the need to manually assemble the streaming functionality when implementing custom players .
There are already a lot of existing commercial and open source video player frameworks for Flash .
One example is JW Player , which is widely used on the Internet and has a very broad feature set .
The advantage of OSMF relative to these other player frameworks is that it has the potential to become the standard foundation for Flash video players , enabling interoperability by providing a single integration target for third - party components .
Its plugin model is designed largely to make that possible .
The source code is available under the terms of the open source Mozilla Public License ( MPL ) .
Adobe says that it intends to accept patches from third - party developers , meaning that the project is open to independent contributors .
The roadmap will largely be determined by Adobe and its partners , but the company says that the schedule and roadmap will remain transparent and that feedback from the community will be given consideration .
Open framework , proprietary plugin
Although OSMF is open source , the Flash player itself — the browser plugin that is used to run and display the content — still remains proprietary .
Flash is increasingly facing pressure from emerging Web standards that have the potential to provide truly open vendor - neutral solutions for delivering streaming video content .
The HTML 5 video element , which is supported in Firefox 3.5 and a number of other browsers , facilitates video playback without requiring any browser plugins .
It also makes it possible to build custom player interfaces that integrate better with conventional Web content using HTML , CSS , and JavaScript .
HTML 5 video is being held back from widespread adoption by Microsoft 's lack of interest and an ongoing codec debate , but it has the technical potential to displace Flash in the future .
Popular streaming video websites such as YouTube and DailyMotion are already actively exploring HTML 5 video as an alternative to Flash .
The Wikimedia Foundation , the organization behind the Web - based Wikipedia encyclopedia is planning to adopt the open Ogg Theora codec and HTML 5 video for its new multimedia content .
In a recent video interview with Beet.tv , Wikimedia Foundation deputy director Erik Moller highlighted some of his concerns about Flash .
" The typical video that we see on the Web is basically a black box format in a Flash container .
I can't easily manipulate it — I need to buy proprietary tools to really do things with it or even to rebroadcast it .
So video on the Web is n't as open — it 's not as free and as reusable as , for example , an image on a webpage or text on a webpage , " he said .
" We want to build a completely open , standards - based environment that people can use to remix video .
To set , basically , a standard for what an open ecosystem should look like , and to set an example for other organizations as well -- both in the educational space , non-profit organizations , and so on . "
Adobe 's new OSMF will help lower the barriers to entry for companies that want to deliver streaming video today on top of Flash , but it does n't address the fundamental issue inherent in using a proprietary browser plugin that is controlled by a single vendor as a vehicle for delivering media content .

President Obama may be struggling with his health care initiative , but so far he can claim success in improving the U.S. image worldwide , according to a new poll .
According to a new global poll by the Pew Research Center , " in many countries opinions of the United States are now about as positive as they were at the beginning of the decade before George W. Bush took office . "
Among the reasons : Obama 's June speech in Cairo to the Muslim world , as well as pledges to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq and to close the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
This picture of the Obamas is from one of The Oval 's favorite cities , Prague .
" Improvements in the U.S. image have been most pronounced in Western Europe , where favorable ratings for both the nation and the American people have soared , " the poll says .
" But opinions of America have also become more positive in key countries in Latin America , Africa and Asia , as well . "

WASHINGTON  Supreme Court nominees almost never comment on recent decisions from the court they hope to join .
But both Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. broke with protocol and perhaps prudence at their confirmation hearings when it came to a decision that had been issued just months before , Kelo v. City of New London .
Without quite saying Kelo had been incorrectly decided , both men , at the time federal appeals court judges , spoke at length about their doubts concerning its wisdom and consequences .
The decision , a 5 - to - 4 ruling in 2005 , allowed local governments to take private property for business development and provoked outrage across the political spectrum .
Judge Sonia Sotomayor will doubtless be questioned about Kelo at her confirmation hearings next month .
But her answers will be complicated by her participation in a 2006 decision applying and extending Kelo .
Bart Didden , the property owner on the losing side of that decision , Didden v. Village of Port Chester , said in an interview that he had been contacted by aides to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee who seemed eager to explore Judge Sotomayor ’s views on property rights .

Once you strip away the mujamalat – the courtesies exchanged between guest and host – the substance of President Obama 's speech in Cairo indicates there is likely to be little real change in US policy .
It is not necessary to divine Obama 's intentions – he may be utterly sincere and I believe he is .
It is his analysis and prescriptions that in most regards maintain flawed American policies intact .
Though he pledged to " speak the truth as best I can " , there was much the president left out .
He spoke of tension between " America and Islam " – the former a concrete specific place , the latter a vague construct subsuming peoples , practices , histories and countries more varied than similar .
Labelling America's " other " as a nebulous and all - encompassing " Islam " ( even while professing rapprochement and respect ) is a way to avoid acknowledging what does in fact unite and mobilise people across many Muslim - majority countries : overwhelming popular opposition to increasingly intrusive and violent American military , political and economic interventions in many of those countries .
This opposition – and the resistance it generates – has now become for supporters of those interventions , synonymous with " Islam " .
It was disappointing that Obama recycled his predecessor 's notion that " violent extremism " exists in a vacuum , unrelated to America 's ( and its proxies ' ) exponentially greater use of violence before and after September 11 , 2001 .
He dwelled on the " enormous trauma " done to the US when almost 3,000 people were killed that day , but spoke not one word about the hundreds of thousands of orphans and widows left in Iraq – those whom Muntazer al - Zaidi 's flying shoe forced Americans to remember only for a few seconds last year .
He ignored the dozens of civilians who die each week in the " necessary " war in Afghanistan , or the millions of refugees fleeing the US - invoked escalation in Pakistan .
As President George Bush often did , Obama affirmed that it is only a violent minority that besmirches the name of a vast and " peaceful " Muslim majority .
But he seemed once again to implicate all Muslims as suspect when he warned , " The sooner the extremists are isolated and unwelcome in Muslim communities , the sooner we will all be safer . "
Nowhere were these blindspots more apparent than his statements about Palestine / Israel .
He gave his audience a detailed lesson on the Holocaust and explicitly used it as a justification for the creation of Israel .
" It is also undeniable , " the president said , " that the Palestinian people – Muslims and Christians – have suffered in pursuit of a homeland .
For more than sixty years they have endured the pain of dislocation . "
Suffered in pursuit of a homeland ?
The pain of dislocation ?
They already had a homeland .
They suffered from being ethnically cleansed and dispossessed of it and prevented from returning on the grounds that they are from the wrong ethno- national group .
Why is that still so hard to say ?
He lectured Palestinians that " resistance through violence and killing is wrong and does not succeed " .
He warned them that " It is a sign of neither courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children , or to blow up old women on a bus .
That is not how moral authority is claimed ; that is how it is surrendered . "
Fair enough , but did Obama really imagine that such words would impress an Arab public that watched in horror as Israel slaughtered 1,400 people in Gaza last winter , including hundreds of sleeping , fleeing or terrified children , with American - supplied weapons ?
Did he think his listeners would not remember that the number of Palestinian and Lebanese civilians targeted and killed by Israel has always far exceeded by orders of magnitude the number of Israelis killed by Arabs precisely because of the American arms he has pledged to continue giving Israel with no accountability ?
Amnesty International recently confirmed what Palestinians long knew : Israel broke the negotiated ceasefire when it attacked Gaza last November 4 , prompting retaliatory rockets that killed no Israelis until after Israel launched its much bigger attack on Gaza .
That he continues to remain silent about what happened in Gaza , and refuses to hold Israel accountable demonstrates anything but a commitment to full truth - telling .
Some people are prepared to give Obama a pass for all this because he is at last talking tough on Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank .
In Cairo , he said : " The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements .
This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace .
It is time for these settlements to stop . "
These carefully chosen words focus only on continued construction , not on the existence of the settlements themselves ; they are entirely compatible with the peace process industry consensus that existing settlements will remain where they are for ever .
This raises the question of where Obama thinks he is going .
He summarised Palestinians ' " legitimate aspirations " as being the establishment of a " state " .
This has become a convenient slogan to that is supposed to replace for Palestinians their pursuit of rights and justice that the proposed state actually denies .
Obama is already on record opposing Palestinian refugees ' right to return home , and has never supported the right of Palestinian citizens of Israel to live free from racist and religious incitement , persecution and practices fanned by Israel 's highest office holders and written into its laws .
He may have more determination than his predecessor but he remains committed to an unworkable two - state " vision " aimed not at restoring Palestinian rights , but preserving Israel as an enclave of Israeli Jewish privilege .
It is a dead end .
There was one sentence in his speech I cheered for and which he should heed : " Given our interdependence , any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail . "

A landmark victory against the government over pesticide spraying was overturned today , prompting accusations of a " whitewash " from the environmental campaigner who brought the original case .
Georgina Downs , said the decision by the court of appeal to overturn the judgement was " bizarre " and a " public health scandal " .
She vowed to take the fight to the House of Lords .
( Read her full statement here . )
The environment department Defra , which brought the appeal , welcomed the ruling , which it said showed the government had complied with its obligations under European law .
The case turned on how exposure to pesticides sprayed onto fields to boost crop growth may affect peoples ' health .
The appeal follows a high court ruling in November that Downs , who runs the UK Pesticides Campaign , had produced " solid evidence " that people exposed to chemicals used to spray crops had suffered harm .
Reacting to the appeal victory , Hilary Benn , environment secretary , said : " In controlling pesticides , the protection of people 's health is our priority .
That is why we are already working to better assess bystander exposure to pesticides so that we can continue to improve our models . "
He added : " In view of the issues raised by Georgina Downs and the new European directive , we will consult this autumn on how to give people access to farmers ' spray records , how to give residents prior notification of spraying activity , and what else should be included , for example , monitoring and training . "
The original judgment said the government had failed to comply with a European directive designed to protect rural communities from exposure to the toxins .
Theruling , from Mr Justice Collins , said the environment department , Defra , needed to reassess its policy and investigate the risks to people who are exposed .
Defra had argued that its approach to the regulation and control of pesticides was " reasonable , logical and lawful " .
Downs , who lives on the edge of farmland near Chichester , West Sussex , launched her campaign in 2001 .
She blames repeated exposure to pesticides for persistent ill health .
Responding to today 's appeal judgment , she said : " I am upset , but not as upset as if the ruling had gone against me on my own evidence . "
Downs claimed the appeal judges ignored the evidence she gathered during her campaign , and instead relied on official reports to reach their findings .
In the new ruling , Lord Justice Sullivan said that Downs " genuinely believes that her own , and her family 's health problems have been caused by the exposure to pesticide spraying . "
But he said that although Downs is " a most effective campaigner " she had no formal scientific or medical qualifications .
Mr Justice Collins 's reference to " solid evidence " substituted his own evaluation for that of Defra , said Lord Justice Sullivan .
The appeal judge said the regulatory framework for pesticides required balance between the interests of the individual and the community as a whole .
The Crop Protection Association , which represents the pesticides industry , said the judgment was a victory for common sense .
Dominic Dyer , chief executive , said : " Without pesticides to keep weed , pest and disease pressures in check , crop yields would fall by around a third , something we can ill afford at a time of heightened concern about food security and population growth . "
Peter Melchett , policy director at the Soil Association , which promotes organic food grown without artificial pesticides , said : " Whatever the court of appeal says , the fact is UK regulation of pesticide spraying does not take into account the safety of schools or families living next to sprayed fields . "

هيلارى كلينتون، وزير امور خارجه آمريكا، روز پنجشنبه اعلام كرد كه واشينگتن خواستار ارتباط با ايران است ولى بحران سياسى جارى به معنى اين است كه پاسخ ى
از سوی تهران در كار نخواهد بود .
خانم كلينتون كه به شرق آسيا سفر كرده است در گفت و گو با تلويزيون بى بى سى انگليسى اظهار داشت : آمريكا منتظر پاسخ ايران بوده است اما تهران « در شرايط حاضر توان آن را ندارد كه تصميمى در اين زمينه بگيرد . »
باراك اوباما، رييس جمهور آمريكا ، از زمان روى كار آمدن خود اعلام كرده است در صدد است تا باب مذاكره و تعامل با ايران را بگشايد و مى گويد : در صورتى كه ايران مشت گره كرده خود را باز كند دست دوستى آمريكا به سوى اين كشور دراز مى شود .
تهران و واشينگتن از سه دهه پيش رابطه رسمى با يكديگر ن دارند و مناسبات دو كشور در برهه هاى مختلف و بر سر مسائل بين المللى دچار تنش و اختلاف هاى زيادى بوده است .
آمريكا بارها ايران را متهم كرده است كه در پوشش برنامه هسته اى خود به دنبال توليد سلاح هسته اى است و از تهران خواسته تا به قطعنامه هاى سازمان ملل مبنى بر تعليق فعاليت هاى غنى سازى اورانيوم احترام بگذارد .
خانم كلينتون در باره واكنش ايران به ابتكارهاى باراك اوباما براى گفت و گو با آمريكا گفته است : ما هنوز پاسخى در اين زمينه دريافت نكرده ايم .
وزير امور خارجه آمريكا افزود : « ما به وضوح روشن ساخته ايم كه خواسته ما چيست، حتى اكنون و به رغم محكوميت قاطع آنچه كه در جريان انتخابات ( دهم رياست جمهورى ايران ) رخ داده است.
اما فكر نمى كنم آنها قادر به تصميم گيرى در چنين شرايطى باشند . »
مخالفان محمود احمدى نژاد و
نامزدهاى معترض دولت جمهورى اسلامى را متهم كرده اند که به طور بى سابقه و گسترده اى در انتخابات رياست جمهورى تقلب كرده است و دولت بر آمده از اين نتيجه را به رسميت نمى شناسند .
از زمان معرفى آقاى احمدى نژاد به عنوان رييس جمهور چهار سال ديگر ايران، تظاهرات خيابانى و اعتراض هاى زيادى ايران را فرا گرفت ولى اين اعتراض ها از سوى نيروى انتظامى ، لباس شخصى ها و بسيج سركوب شد .
در جريان سركوب تظاهرات در شهرهاى ايران حداقل ۲۰ نفر كشته شدند ولى مخالفان اعلام كرده اند اين تعداد بيشتر بوده است. صدها نفر نيز از سوى نيروهاى امنيتى بازداشت شده اند .
آمريكا با محكوم كردن كشتار معترضان خواستار احترام به آزادى بيان و اجتماعات در ايران شده و گفته است زندانيان سياسى بايد آزاد شوند .
A mammogram is used to detect breast lesions
One in three breast cancers detected by mammogram screening may actually be harmless , a study has suggested .
Data from five countries , including the UK , suggest some women may have had unnecessary treatment for cancers that were unlikely to kill them or spread .
As it is not possible to distinguish between lethal and harmless cancers , all are treated .
But advocates of screening insist it is a vital tool for early detection of cancerous cells .
It means that screening for cancer , in this case breast cancer , is a much closer call than has been previously advertised
Professor Gilbert Welch
Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy Researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Denmark said their results showed cancer screening programmes could lead to " overdiagnosis " .
Writing in the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , they said : " Screening for cancer may lead to earlier detection of lethal cancers but also detects harmless ones that will not cause death or symptoms .
" The detection of such cancers , which would not have been identified clinically in someone 's remaining lifetime , is called over - diagnosis and can only be harmful to those who experience it . "
Closer call Professor Gilbert Welch , of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy , wrote an editorial on the finding in the BMJ .
He said : " It means that screening for cancer , in this case breast cancer , is a much closer call than has been previously advertised .
BREAST CANCER STATISTICS
Our guide to breast cancer and comprehensive statistics " It has the opportunity to help some women but it also has the consequence of leading others to be treated needlessly for cancer and that 's not a trivial thing . "
But Professor Julietta Patnick , director of NHS Cancer Screening Programmes , said one in eight women diagnosed with breast cancer through the NHS programme would have been missed without screening .
She said screening was estimated to save 1,400 lives a year in England alone .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme Professor Patnick said : " Thanks to screening , one extra woman 's life will be saved for every eight women diagnosed with breast cancer .
" By bringing forward the date of diagnosis ( through early detection ) , we find those cancers that would otherwise not be caught until later in life by which time they could be fatal . "
She also criticised the research , suggesting it made highly selective use of statistics , and ignored lifestyle changes which had increased breast cancer incidence , such as women waiting longer before having their first child .
The researchers looked at a range of statistics from five countries which had implemented screening programmes , including data for England and Wales from between 1971 and 1999 .
Based on all the current evidence , we believe the benefits of detecting breast cancer early still outweigh the risks
Dr Sarah Cant
Common cancer deaths ' falling '
The findings seem to confirm research published by the same team earlier this year .
Other recently compiled figures also show that UK death rates from breast , bowel , and male lung cancer are at their lowest since 1971 .
The figures showing the fall in deaths from three of the most common cancers were compiled by Cancer Research UK , and are being put down to improved screening and better care .
' Do n't be put off '
Dr Sarah Cant , from Breakthrough Breast Cancer , said she hoped the research on the incidence of harmless breast cancers would not discourage women from attending screening .
" Unfortunately , it is currently not possible to predict which cancers found through screening will develop aggressively and which will grow very slowly , " she said .
" Based on all the current evidence , we believe the benefits of detecting breast cancer early still outweigh the risks . "
She added that women needed to be given clear information about breast screening and it was important to remember that " while survival rates have increased greatly in recent years , just under 12,000 women still die from this disease each year in the UK . "
Her view was echoed by Emma Pennery , of the charity Breast Cancer Care , who said : " Until it is possible to accurately determine the progression of cancers found through mammograms , screening remains an effective option for detecting breast cancers as soon as possible .
" As this review acknowledges this could lead to overtreatment in a percentage of cases .
" However , without screening women would face the prospect of having to wait for a visible symptom of cancer , such as a lump , to become apparent before treatment could start . "

In thinking about the possible extent of the current economic crisis , I have been focused on understanding the role of debt .
I first started looking at household debt .
The Federal Reserve publishes statistics called the “ Flow of Funds ” which track sources and uses of capital in the economy over time .
The following chart shows household debt , broken down into consumer debt ( credit cards ) and home mortgages , starting in 1966 .
The chart shows an eye - popping explosion in debt from a few hundred billion dollars to over 13 trillion dollars .
Of course there are a number of things one needs to correct for .
First up , inflation .
Dollars in 1996 were worth a lot more than dollars now .
Using 1990 as a base year and applying the CPI as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics results in the following chart .
So that takes some of the slope out of the chart .
Next one might argue that there are more households in the US now than there were in 1966 and that one really needs to look at this on a per household basis .
Thankfully the Census Bureau provides a time series of the number of households .
Using this series results in the following per household chart .
While this results in a further reduction in the slope of the debt curve , the overall numbers are still impressive .
In constant 1990 dollars ( meaning the effect of inflation has been taken out ) , the per household debt in 1966 was less than $ 25,000 and by 2007 had grown to over $ 70,000 .
Finally , one might argue that households can afford more debt because they have more income so that one should really look at is the household debt level relative to household income .
Using the Census Bureau ’s household income data gives the following picture .
Household debt went from 74 % of income in 1966 to an amazing 165 % in 2007 .
Since these numbers are averages and since there are clearly some housholds that have very little or no debt , it means that there are many households that have more debt than 2 years worth of income .
Even if one of those households were able to save 10 % of income , it would take them 20 years to pay off their debt .
And a 10 % savings rate is high in the US .
In fact , the aggregate savings rate was as low as 5 % by 2004 and by 2007 had gone negative .
As the charts show quite clearly , the first significant acceleration of household debt started around 1984 .
It is likely that this was in response to a drop in interest rates after Volcker had used high interest rates to fight inflation .
But the really steep increase starts in 2002 and directly reflects the real estate bubble .
One might ask , so what ?
Well it turns out that consumers were responsible for a large part of economic growth in the US .
During the period from 2002 to 2007 , consumers accounted for almost 75 % of all economic growth and for the longer period of 1985 to 2007 , consumers accounted for over 77 % of growth ( this is based on the National Accounts data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis ) .
So arguably , we have had at least 5 years and possibly over 20 years of economic growth that was significatly in excess of a long term sustainable rate , with the excess fueled by increasing household debt .
Now , with the implosion of the housing bubble and the threat of a global recession with massive layoffs , consumer spending is drying up rapidly .
There is actually an interesting bit of detail in the BEA data which breaks out whether consumer spending was on non-durable goods , durable goods or services .
In 1966 consumer spending on durable goods accounted for only 26 % of GDP , but by 2007 that had risen to 42 % – think new cars , personal computers , etc .
Of course those durables are exactly the area where it is easiest for consumers to delay new purchases , which means that the drop off in consumption is likely to be rather abrupt .
Away from the spotlight of the Tour de France and back in Spain , his home country , Alberto Contador took the chance Monday to say what he really felt about his Astana teammate Lance Armstrong .
“ My relationship with Lance is zero , ” Contador said at a news conference , one day after winning his second Tour .
“ He is a great rider and has completed a great race , but it is another thing on a personal level , where I have never had great admiration for him and I never will . ”
Contador ’s comments came after three weeks of near silence about his rivalry with Armstrong , a tense relationship that Contador played down throughout the race , which ended Sunday in Paris .
At the Tour , Contador and Armstrong , a seven - time Tour winner , fought to be the leader of Astana , a team based in Kazakhstan .
Both riders will be departing the team at the end of this season .
Armstrong , 37 , will ride for the new Team RadioShack , based in the United States .
Contador , 26 , wants to sign with another team .
In the meantime , what can you expect in the way of provision if your charter flight is badly delayed ?
EU regulations apply to charter flights in the same way as they do to scheduled airlines .
These rules depend on how far you 're flying .
If you are delayed more than two hours and are flying less than 932 miles ( 1,500 km ) , which includes destinations in the south of France or to northern parts of Spain and Italy , you 're entitled to meals and refreshments " in reasonable relation to waiting time " .
If you 're flying between 932 miles and 2,175 miles ( 3,500 km ) – Greece , Turkey and southern Portugal , for example – you have to be delayed more than three hours to qualify for food and drink .

The ousted president of Honduras has briefly crossed the country 's border with Nicaragua , in a symbolic move the US has described as " reckless " .
Manuel Zelaya has been in exile for nearly a month after he was forced from his position by a coup , and had previously tried to return by plane .
The interim government has said it will arrest him if he sets foot in Honduras .
Earlier , soldiers fired tear gas at hundreds of Mr Zelaya 's supporters who were waiting for him near the border .
Talks in Costa Rica aimed at resolving the political crisis collapsed two weeks ago with no agreement reached .
' Not crazy '
The best thing is to reach an understanding that respects the will of the people
Manuel Zelaya Mr Zelaya , surrounded by supporters and journalists and talking into a mobile phone , lifted the chain marking the border between Nicaragua and Honduras in the frontier town of Los Manos and walked underneath it .
The BBC's Stephen Gibbs said the military personnel retreated by about 20 m ( yards ) as he did so , apparently unclear how to react .
Mr Zelaya , wearing his customary cowboy - style hat , walked up to a sign reading " Welcome to Honduras " but did not go any further into the country .
Less than 30 minutes later , the ousted leader crossed back into Nicaragua , saying the risk of bloodshed was too great .
" I am not afraid but I 'm not crazy either , " he told Venezuelan - based TV network Telesur .
" There could be violence and I do n't want to be the cause . "
He told reporters he was prepared to return to the negotiation table with the interim government .
" The best thing is to reach an understanding that respects the will of the people , " he said .
The US Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , has described Mr Zelaya 's return as " reckless " and not conducive to " the broader effort to restore democratic and constitutional order in the Honduras crisis " .
" We have consistently urged all parties to avoid any provocative action that could lead to violence , " said Mrs Clinton .
The interim Honduran President , Roberto Micheletti , said Mr Zelaya 's action was " ill - conceived and silly " .
Curfew
At least one man was wounded in skirmishes at the border Prior to Mr Zelaya 's crossing , the army had sealed all roads to the border several kilometres ( miles ) from the actual crossing point , says our correspondent .
But hundreds of people had still gathered in the area and when the military announced an 18 - hour curfew , they began throwing rocks at the soldiers , who responded with tear gas , he adds .
At least one man was wounded in the clashes , during which Mr Zelaya was waiting in a white jeep a few metres on the Nicaraguan side of the border .
Earlier televised footage had shown Mr Zelaya driving in a convoy including Nicaraguan police cars towards the Nicaraguan border with Honduras .
The interim government , led by Mr Zelaya 's former ally , Mr Micheletti , has imposed an 18 - hour curfew along the Nicaraguan border .
People living close to the border were ordered to stay at home between midday local time ( 1800GMT ) and 0600 ( 1200 GMT ) to " keep the peace " .
" We can't be responsible for the security of people who , by inciting generalised violence in the country , may be subject to attacks even from their own supporters who may have the sole aim of turning them into martyrs , " the military said in a statement .
A night time curfew already extends to the whole of the country .
Talks bid Mr Zelaya was exiled on 28 June after a crisis erupted over his attempts to hold a vote on changing the constitution .
He insists he remains the democratically - elected leader of Honduras and had previously attempted to return home on 5 July .
On that occasion , his plane was prevented from landing when the Honduran military blocked the runway .
The ousted leader 's attempt to return follows the collapse of talks in Costa Rica , mediated by the country 's President , Oscar Arias .
Mr Arias had drawn up a detailed plan to facilitate Mr Zelaya 's return to lead a national reconciliation government prior to early elections in October .
The proposal also included a general amnesty for crimes committed during this crisis and the setting up of a truth commission to investigate events in the run-up to Mr Zelaya 's removal .
Delegates of the interim government reiterated they would not reinstate Mr Zelaya as president but said they would present the Arias plan to Congress .
But since it was Congress that approved the ousting of Mr Zelaya , the move may prove to be of limited importance , says our correspondent .

( CNN ) --
The United States has created a " zone of impunity " by rarely investigating private contractors involved in the unlawful killing of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq , a U.N. human rights envoy said .
Civil rights activists protest the use of unmanned U.S. drones in Pakistan .
The U.S. government should track the number of civilians killed in its military operations abroad and limit collateral damage from unmanned drone attacks , Special Investigator Philip Alston said in a stinging report submitted Wednesday to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva , Switzerland .
" The government has failed to effectively investigate and punish lower - ranking soldiers for such deaths , and has not held senior officers responsible , " Alston said .
" Worse , it has effectively created a zone of impunity for private contractors and civilian intelligence agents by only rarely investigating and prosecuting them . "
Alston recommended that the United States establish a national commission to independently look into the policies and practices that are leading to the deaths .
He also urged that an independent special prosecutor be charged with pursuing criminal allegations against government officials accused of wrongdoing .
" First , the government has failed to track and make public the number of civilian casualties , or the conditions under which deaths occurred , " he said .
" Second , the military justice system fails to provide ordinary people , including U.S. citizens and families of Iraqi and Afghan victims , basic information on the status of investigations into civilian casualties or prosecutions resulting therefrom . "
Alston called the United States ' reliance on pilotless missile - carrying aircraft " increasingly common " and " deeply troubling . "
U.S. forces operating in Afghanistan have used drones to attack militant targets in Pakistan .
Pakistan has said the attacks have claimed hundreds of civilian lives .
Do n't Miss Pakistan claims dozens of militants killed
Mark Cassayre , the American representative to the U.N. Human Rights Council , said U.S. military and intelligence operations during armed conflict did not fall within the special investigator 's mandate .
Alston is the special investigator on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .
" We wish to be clear that the prosecution of private contractors who commit crimes is an important priority of the Department of Justice , and despite the difficulty of these cases , the United States continues to attempt to bring private contractor cases to justice , " Cassayre said .

Several months after my son was born in 2001 or 2002 , I got a very exciting telephone call .
Would I be interested in being in the new Pixar movie ?
Since I was not yet fully immersed in the world of children 's entertainment , I was not really aware of Pixar products .
All I knew was that every time a new Pixar movie came out , it was a big deal and made hundreds of millions of dollars , which to an actor translates to large royalty checks .
I did not know how much money one could stand to make in residuals from something like that but a friend of a friend was in some successful animated movie or another , and I can remember that he routinely received checks for tens of thousands of dollars .
So that sounded pretty good .
Also , animated movies take a long time to put together .
I figured that by the time this was done , my son would just be old enough so that I could take him to the movies , point to whatever animated creature I was portraying and say " That 's Daddy ! " in a voice just loud enough so that several other surrounding fathers could hear .
As a new father , I was constantly trying to figure out ways to make my son love me since just being his father was obviously not enough .
Even at six months , he was already contemptuous of me .
So I quickly accept the job and reported to work at a small recording studio in midtown Manhattan .
When I got there , I was greeted by some lovely people from the Pixar corporation who walked me through the storyboards of this particular movie , entitled " Finding Nemo . "
My character was a sea turtle called Crush , and the director Andrew told me they were looking for a " Keanu Reeves from ' Point Break ' type voice , " and that they immediately thought of me for the part .
My first thought at the time was , " Why ? " Meaning : if you are looking for a Keanu Reeves type voice , am I really the guy that comes to mind ?
I was confused and seriously considered the possibility that they had mistaken me for somebody else .
Perhaps another State member ?
Maybe one of the Kids in the Hall ?
Because when I think of myself , I certainly do n't think Keanu Reeves in " Point Break . "
I do n't even think Keanu Reeves in " Feeling Minnesota . "
Honestly , I never put me and Keanu Reeves in the same mental image at all except when telling this story .
So I was confused but game .
After all , I was doing this for my son .
And for money .
They put me in a little booth and we went line by line through my part of the script .
The director was in Los Angeles , and I could see him on a little video screen they had set up .
He had me do each line several different ways , and often acted the lines out himself so that I could get a clearer sense of what he wanted .
For example , there was a part where Crush goes , " You were like , ' Whoa , ' then I was like , ' Whoa , ' and then it was like , ' Whoa . ' "
He had a very specific way he wanted each " Whoa , " and I was having kind of a hard time doing it , so he demonstrated exactly what he wanted .
When he did it , I remember thinking , " That 's pretty good .
You should do this part , " but I did n't say that because I did n't want him to have the same thought .
He was a very nice man , and I would say it took about two hours for me to record Crush .
Afterwards my throat hurt and I was sweating .
As I left , they handed me a " Finding Nemo " giftbag , which included a stuffed Nemo and a limited edition lithograph of a character study of Nemo .
Very nice of them , and I thought to myself , " Hey , if this movie is a hit , this will be a great collector 's item .
I can get it framed and give it to my son and he will have a treasured memento from the movie in which his heroic father starred . "
As I walked back to my car , I remember that I felt good about the session , good about the fact that I was going to be in a Pixar movie , fantasizing that maybe this would open a whole new avenue in my career , that maybe I could get more voice work , maybe end up like Hank Azaria on " The Simpsons . "
Then I got to my car and saw there was a parking ticket on my windshield , which maybe I should have taken as an omen .
But I did n't .
Because I am stupid .
A couple months later , I heard from the Pixar people again .
Bad news .
Unfortunately , the character of Crush is no longer going to be in the movie .
Crush is n't working and they are going to cut Crush .
No more Crush .
I was , to use the obvious turn of phrase , " crushed . "
But what can you do ?
Characters get cut from movies all the time .
It 's not anybody 's fault .
It just is what it is .
I did n't know what happened .
All I knew was that I was no longer going to be in a Pixar movie , no longer going to receive tens of thousands of dollars in the mail , and worst of all , no longer going to be anything more to my son than a continuing source of irritation and resentment .
Now , perhaps you 've seen " Finding Nemo . "
If you have , and BILLIONS of people have , considering it is the number one grossing animated movie of all time , you probably remember a rather lengthy sequence featuring a Keanu Reeves - sounding surfer sea turtle called Crush .
Apparently , the problem was n't Crush .
Apparently the problem , as is so often the case , was me .
Fast forward a year and a half or so .
Now trailers are coming out for " Finding Nemo . "
Featured prominently in these trailers is a sea turtle that sounds a lot like somebody doing a fairly bad Keanu Reeves imitation .
It 's Crush !
CRUSH IS BACK !!!
I 'm listening to Crush in the trailer .
I 'm listening and listening , and what I 'm wondering is , " Is that MY bad Keanu Reeves imitation or somebody else 's ? "
And I honestly can't tell .
To my ears , it sounds just like me .
It sounds Just .
Like .
Me . Is it me ?
No .
It is not .
This is what I think happened : in an effort to save my feelings , they told me Crush was cut from the film .
Crush was never cut from the film .
What happened was that the director apparently had the same thought I was desperately trying to will him not to have when I was recording the part , namely that he sounded pretty good as Crush .
Yes , the nice director from that tiny video screen decided that he was better at Crush than me and so cast himself in the part .
The part that I was told no longer existed .
The part which became one of the most popular characters in the film , and which DWARFS the two main characters on the video box .
As the opening date approached , " Finding Nemo " commercials were everywhere .
Crush was everywhere .
T
Was it painful ?
Very .
When the movie finally came out , my kids , of course , wanted to see it , and could not understand why daddy started yelling every time they asked .
I think it took me three years to finally sit down with my children and watch the stupid movie , and endure my son saying things like , " Surf 's up , dude ! " in the voice of Crush .
To make matters worse , it 's a great movie .
I still have that lithograph tightly rolled in the original tube in which it was presented to me .
It 's buried in the back of my son's closet behind boxes of outgrown shoes and forgotten toys .
He does n't even know it 's there .
Once in a while , when I feel the need for a little extra self - flagellation , I take it out and look at it and think about how I was almost part of something that people know and love , something that does n't even involve dildos or necrophilia .
Of course , you may think to yourself , " Serves you right for trying to buy your children 's love through shallow career accomplishments . "
You would be right to think that , but when you consider how little else I have to offer them , shallow career accomplishments are about the best I 'm going to do .
I keep waiting for the Pixar people to call again .
I keep waiting for a lot of things .

Garage Sale Tips For Success [ Tipnut ]
Vorwärts Marsch zum Deutschnetz Twister ( Bettina Winsemann )
Sperrungen - der Nächste bitte
Mit dem " Zugangserschwerungsgesetz " wurde in Deutschland Pandoras Büchse geöffnet , die , allen Beschwichtigungen der Politik zum Trotz , nicht wieder geschlossen werden kann .
Die logische Konsequenz ist ein komplett reguliertes Deutschlandnetz , in dem alles ausgeblendet wird , was nicht deutschem Recht entspricht .
Nachdem schon Sperrungen für Nazi- , Glücksspiel - und Jugendpornographieseiten gefordert wurden , hat sich nun der Zentralrat der Sinti und Roma in die Debatte um Netzsperren eingeschaltet und forderte eine Sperrung von sogenannten " Hassseiten " .
Die Forderung an sich ist nicht neu , auch die Bundesregierung hat sich bereits gegen " Hasspropaganda " im Internet stark gemacht und Bundesinnenminister Schäuble führte auch die Bombenbauanleitungen ins Feld .
Was in der Debatte meist ( auch durch die mediale Aufbereitung ) zu kurz kommt , ist die Tatsache , dass hier aber nicht die Meinungsfreiheit , sondern die Rezipientenfreiheit tangiert wird .
Zwar sind beide eng miteinander verknüpft und die Frage , inwiefern sie unabhängig voneinander überhaupt existieren bzw .
Auswirkungen haben können , ist legitim .
Aber die Rezipientenfreiheit ist gerade dann , wenn es um internationale Problematiken geht , von größerer Wichtigkeit , da sie im Bereich Forschung und Wissenschaft / Lehre eine große Rolle spielt .
Ein Forscher muss , so er beispielsweise zum Thema " Nationalsozialismus heute " Informationen sucht , auch auf Webseiten , Kommentare usw .
Zugriff nehmen können , die nicht dem deutschen Recht entsprechen , sonst kann er letztendlich nur etwas zur Lage in Deutschland feststellen .
Neues vom Feindsender
Die Sperrung von Seiten , die nicht dem deutschen Recht entsprechen , käme insofern einem Feindsenderverbot gleich , welches es in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus gab .
Die Verordnung über außerordentliche Rundfunkmaßnahmen " stellte das Hören / Wahrnehmen von Sendungen der ausländischen Sender unter Strafe , wer satirische Beiträge , Jazz oder Swing hörte , musste mit einem Besuch der Gestapo , dem Entzug des Rundfunkgerätes oder aber auch mit Gefängnis rechnen ( die Todesstrafe war möglich ) .
Auch hier zeigte sich , wie sehr Meinungs - und Rezipientenfreiheit Hand in Hand gehen , denn auch das eigene Senden war verboten .
Es mutet realsatirisch an , dass nunmehr mit dem Zentralrat der Sinti und Roma eine Institution einem neuen Feindsenderverbot das Wort redet , die sich mit dem Thema Diskriminierung , und Bespitzelung sowie Minderheitenverfolgung ja gerade durch die Erfahrung aus dem Nationalsozialistischen Reich auskennen sollte .
Denn der Wunsch , dass hasserfüllte Beiträge gegen diejenigen , die durch den Zentralrat vertreten werden , nicht mehr zu lesen sind , ist zwar legitim , aber kurzsichtig .
Eine solche Sperrung von Inhalten , die in anderen Ländern legal sind , lässt sich nur durch umfassende Kontrolle und Überwachung umsetzen .
Nur wenn sichergestellt ist , dass die Inhalte mehrheitlich nicht mehr abgerufen werden können oder die Umgehung der Sperren unter Strafe gestellt wird , ist eine Sperrung überhaupt sinnvoll .
Nur wenn die " Minderheit " derjenigen , die die Sperrungen umgehen können , auch konsequent verfolgt und sanktioniert wird , können die Inhalte tatsächlich dauerhaft " versteckt " bleiben .
Ohne Überwachung , Minderheitenverfolgung und härteste Strafen können technische Lösungen für gesellschaftliche Probleme nicht funktionieren ( wenn sie denn überhaupt funktionieren können ) .
Löschen ?
Unmöglich
In der Diskussion um das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz haben aber die Kritiker auch einen Fehler gemacht , indem sie für " Löschen statt Sperren " plädierten .
Hierbei wurde , vielleicht auch aus Vorsicht vor einer vorschnellen medialen Verurteilung als Kinderpornosympathisanten , nicht ergänzt , dass das deutsche Recht nun einmal nicht überall gilt und insofern die Frage im Raum steht , wie weit man mit der Freiheit im Netz gehen darf .
Es wurde oft argumentiert , dass Kinderpornographie nun einmal ( fast ) überall verboten ist , aber es stellt sich die Frage : was , wenn dies nicht so ist ?
Was , wenn ein Staat Kinderpornographie und dessen Verbreitung explizit zulässt ?
Dass dieser Staat international geächtet werden würde , steht außer Frage , aber ist dies tatsächlich ein Grund dafür , die Rezipientenfreiheit einzugrenzen ?
Was beim Thema Kinderpornographie so absurd erscheint , da hier ein Konsens darüber herrscht , was erlaubt sein sollte und was nicht , wird bei anderen Themen umso verständlicher .
Die USA beispielsweise haben " Freedom of speech " stets höher bewertet als die Meinungsfreiheit in Deutschland bewertet wurde .
Die in Deutschland unter Strafe gestellte Holocaustleugnung ist in den USA nicht strafbar , das Zeigen von Hakenkreuzen ebenso wenig .
Wird die Argumentation " Löschen statt Sperren " , zusammen mit der Idee , dass die Sperrungen ja nur als Zusatz wirksam sein sollen , als Ergänzung zum Löschen , weitergeführt , so muss den Befürwortern der Sperrungen Recht gegeben werden , die sagen , dass oftmals ein Löschen nicht bewerkstelligt werden kann .
Wer lediglich " Löschen statt Sperren " befürwortet , der hat insofern außer Acht gelassen , dass hier die Wahrnehmung von Inhalten , die nicht gelöscht werden sollen / wollen , das zentrale Thema ist , nicht die Ausnahme Kinderpornographie .
Neue Herausforderungen
Das Internet mit all seinen Bestandteilen führt alte Regelungen ad absurdum .
Dies wird durch andere Medien fortgeführt .
Soll beispielsweise die Möglichkeit , den bekannten Neonazi Gary Lauck anzurufen , durch die Provider unterbunden werden , weil er möglicherweise ein " Sieg Heil " ins Telefon ruft und den Holocaust leugnet , Zyklon B- Memorabilia anbietet und Hitler anpreist ?
Soll dies beim " Skypen " durchgesetzt werden oder , wenn zunehmend das Telefonieren über Internet genutzt wird , auch hier gefiltert werden ?
Sollen Ausreiseverbote verhängt werden , wenn zu vermuten ist , dass sich jemand dem " Feindsenderverbot " entzieht , indem er in die USA reist um dort mit Herrn Lauck zu sprechen und dessen in Deutschland verbotene Parolen anhört ?
Der Vergleich mit China und anderen " Zensurstaaten " , der von der Politik stets empört von sich gewiesen wird , ist legitim , denn jeder Staat , der Meinungen oder deren Wahrnehmung verbietet , hat seine eigenen Gründe dafür - was dem einen Staat legitim erscheint , ist für den anderen Staat Demokratiezersetzung oder Gefährdung der inneren Sicherheit .
Die nackte Brustwarze ist für den einen Pornographie , für den anderen nicht ; Artikel über Falun Gong sind für China demokratiegefährdend , hierzulande wichtige Information .
Die Umgehung von Websperren ist , wenn sie für die verfolgten Dissidenten in China angeboten wird , Demokratieförderung , hierzulande aber ein Zeichen dafür , dass jemand an Kinderpornographie interessiert ist oder sonstiges zu verbergen hat .
Das Herumlavieren der Regierungen ist hierbei schlichtweg Selbstschutz .
Regierungen sind durch das Internet mit einem Problem konfrontiert werden , das vorher in dieser Form nicht bestanden hat : nationale Regelungen in Bezug auf Meinungs - und Rezipientenfreiheit sind nur noch stark begrenzt durchführbar , wenn der im eigenen Land verhängte Maulkorb im Internetcafe um die Ecke im Nachbarland abgelegt werden kann .
Aber auch diejenigen , die lediglich die Durchsetzung der deutschen Regelungen ggf. durch Löschungen von Seiten fordern , sind anscheinend überfordert .
Wenn keine ausländische Regelung existiert , die die inkriminierte Seite als illegal deklariert , dann ist es unumgänglich hinzunehmen , dass diese Seite existiert und abgerufen werden kann .
Egal ob von privater oder behördlicher Seite interveniert wird um , wie auch immer , den Provider zur Löschung der Seite zu bewegen - wenn dies passiert , dann wird hier die rechtliche Souveränität eines Staates missachtet und das Netz bzw .
der Netzzugang wird zum Spielball diverser Interessen .
Auch wenn es wehtut : wenn tatsächlich in irgendeinem Staat die Verbreitung von Kinderpornographie legal sein sollte , dann gibt es , bis ggf .
die Strafbarkeit gesetzlich verankert wurde , nur zwei Möglichkeiten zu argumentieren : Pro oder kontra Netzsperren .
Wer in diesem Fall für die Netzsperren argumentiert , der wird sich beim Thema Holocaustleugnung , Bombenbauanleitung , Hasspropaganda , Dschihadaufrufe und Co. wiederfinden und Schwierigkeiten damit haben , nunmehr gegen Netzsperren zu argumentieren .
Der Mut , sich momentan gegen Netzsperren zu äußern , ist größer als vielfach angenommen .
Denn auf die Frage : Was , wenn der Staat die Seiten nicht löscht ?
Kann es die Wahl zwischen zwei Antworten geben : Hinnehmen , dass die Seiten weiter aufgerufen werden können / Die Seiten sperren .
Alles andere sind Manöver , die nur damit zu erklären sind , dass tatsächlich davon ausgegangen wird , man könne beim Thema Kinderpornographie bleiben und sich nicht allgemein zum Thema Netzsperren platzieren .
Diese Ansicht ist aber naiv , wie die schon jetzt laut werdenden Forderungen nach Sperrungen gegen weitere Seiten eindrucksvoll beweisen .

Anyone who has fiddled a bit with USB devices recognizes the infamous Windows pop up message " This device can perform faster " .
This message is a result of two USB communication speeds , known as USB1.1 and USB2.0 .
Great !
But heck , it pops up on two UBS2.0 DELL latitude D610 laptops and one USB2.0 workstation .
On top of that on a LINUX UBUNTU installation in a different format .
Time for a bit of digging where " This device can perform faster " Windows message comes from .
But my laptop has USB 2.0 ports !
One USB 2.0 Hi-Speed card reader produced the " This device can perform faster " pop up message from day 1 .
A quick test with various other USB 2.0 mass storage devices ( USB stick , USB hard drive ) and USB printers DO NOT produce " This device can perform faster " pop up message .
So the USB drivers and USB hardware seem to be very much OK .
This device can perform faster - USB 2.0 Hell
The USB2.0 Hi-Speed detection mechanism is not rocket science , it 's a matter of writing decent driver software .
So why do these misleading messages pop-up ?
In a hurry ?
Go directly to USB 2.0 Hi-Speed findings
Another slow USB 1.1 device
Next a Tiptel 150 USB connected VOIP phone caused the same Windows XP behavior , right from start .
Although the consequence here is less , the phone works ok , the slower USB1.1 speed is enough for calling over the internet .
The USB 2.0 card reader however operates very slow , copying 2 Gb memory cards took ages .
Now what is wrong here ?
The Dell Latitude D610 has USB 2.0 ports as the other mass storage devices already indicate .
The generic USB 2.0 capable drivers from windows XP pro operate as they should .
It seems like there 's an incompatibility problem between USB devices on a lower level than USB driver software .
So at this stage installing different USB drivers does n't seem to make any sense .
Two USB devices communicating at slow USB1.1 speeds Cheap All - in - One Cardreader advertised as USB2.0 Tiptel 150 USB VOIP phone
How to detect USB 2.0 hardware ?
The D610 Latitude is equipped with a Intel 82801 FB / FBM USB2 Enhanced Host Controller .
Very common USB controller hardware found in many laptops and desktops .
Through " Properties " of " My Computer " the " Manage " menu item shows if a Windows system has USB2.0 Hi-Speed capabilities :
The " Enhanced " part in the name indicated USB 2.0 specifications .
Inside the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed card reader
Opening the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed card reader reveals a single chip - the AU6371 USB 2.0 Single LUN Multiple Flash Card Reader Controller from Alcor Micro Corporation located in Taiwan .
Surprisingly the controller chip range is mentioned at the website , however the AU6371 is not available anymore .
The newer AU6372 - the 9 - in - 1 USB flash card reader chip - now has the spotlight and is released in October 2003 .
The AU6371 most likely is released before 2003 .
Also the Intel 82801 USB2 Enhanced Host Controller stems from this era .
The USB 2.0 Hi-Speed card reader is bought in Dubai in 2008 , so the AU6371 is still in stock and sold as recent USB hardware .
The Alcor Micro website does n't host any drivers for the USB controller chip so generic Windows XP drivers should do the job .
But it does n't , the card reader operates at slow USB 1.1 speeds .
Inside the Tiptel 150 VOIP phone
Opening the Tiptel 150 VOIP phone reveals another brainy controller chip .
The CY7C64713 is a EZ - USB FX1 ™ USB Microcontroller Full - speed USB Peripheral Controller made by Cypress Semiconductor Corporation .
A quick glance through the chip specification results in an interesting statement : " FX1 operates at one of the three rates defined in the USB Specification Revision 2.0 , dated April 27 , 2000 : Full speed , with a signaling bit rate of 12 Mbps " .
Well that 's basically USB 1.1 speed !
That 's one problem solved - the VOIP phone is not designed for USB 2.0 Hi-Speed use .
The Windows pop-up message " This device can perform faster " is therefor wrong and misleading ; The Tiptel 150 USB VOIP phone can not operate at high USB speeds .
It get 's even crazier in Windows XP USB High Speed HELL !
Now with the Tiptel 150 VOIP phone , clearly identified as USB 1.1 because it 's USB controller ( CY7C64713 ) can't go any faster , let 's plug it into a USB 1.1 port on an ole DELL Optiplex with Windows XP Pro ( SP1 ) .
Heck !
The USB1.1 VOIP phone is AGAIN classified as High Speed USB2.0 .
At least Windows XP gets the controller right , it 's a non-Hi-Speed USB Hub - know as the Intel 82371 AB / EB PCI to USB universal host controller .
What a mess - no wonder the USB driver ( re -) installation orgy found on the Internet !
Note : SP1 has no USB2.0 support by default .
USB 2.0 Hi-Speed drivers have to be installed manually , starting with the USB host controller .
AU6371 USB 2.0 Controller chip malfunction ?
Now for the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed card reader - somehow USB 2.0 High Speed - capability identification goes sour between the Intel 82801 USB2 Enhanced Host Controller and the AU6371 USB 2.0 Controller chip .
The Intel 82801 already proved it can operate at USB 2.0 speeds , so what about the AU6371 Controller chip ?
A quick test in a Pentium 4 - USB2.0 workstation with Windows XP
Home produces the same message , the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed card reader is detected as a USB1.1 device .
The Pentium 4 work station has the same chipset , the Intel 82801 USB2 Enhanced Host Controller .
At the same time a different 6 in 1 USB 2.0 card reader connects without a problem .
This card reader has a Integrated Circuit Solution , Inc. ( ICSI ) IC1110 USB 2.0 Flash Card Reader controller inside .
( ICSI is also known as Integrated Silicon Solutions , Inc - ISSI )
With these strange findings , let 's see how a LINUX install copes with the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed card reader on a DELL Latitude D610 laptop .
UBUNTU Linux testing USB 2.0 High Speed Connection
The UBUNTU website serves a neat LINUX install resulting in a bootable UBUNTU 9.04 CD within 2,5 hours using NERO Burning ROM .
This free LINUX version is installed as a multi- boot partition next to a Windows XP SP3 install - all straight out of the UBUNTU box .
With UBUNTU up and running , the USB 2.0 test with the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed card reader can commence .
And it connects smoothly , silently popping up as a USB disk device .
UNBUNTU doesnt show if it 's USB2.0 directly .
So a 256 Mb Memory Card from a Sony T1 is installed for a quick copy test .
71 Mb of pictures are copied at a speed of approximatly 1012 KByte / sec .
Hmmmm , sounds like that 's USB 1.1 again .
To know for sure , / var / log / messages was opened and it contained the following log entries :
- usb 4 - 1 new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
- usb 4 - 1 not running at top speed ; connect to a high speed usb
Looks similar to the Windows XP Pro USB mess .
The log entries with " uhci_hcd " and " full speed " is similar to USB 1.1 .
It should mention " ehci-hcd " and " high speed " .
So with a totally different OS on the same hardware , the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed card reader still connects as a slow USB1.1 device .
Connecting a LaCie 160 Gb USB2.0 disk with UBUNTU 9.04 running on a DELL D610 Latitude laptop immediately results in a Hi-Speed USB2.0 link .
No need for manual " sudo modprobe ehci_hcd " commands because UBUNTU 9.04 automatically loads the right USB module .
Now / var / log / messages looks like this ;
- USB 1 - 5 new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 3
- USB 1 - 5 configuration # 1 chosen from 1 choice
- scsi 3 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
- scsi 3:0:0:0 : Direct - Access FUJITSU MHW2160BH PQ : 0 ANSI : 2 CCS
NOTE : : Trying to manually load the ehci_hcd module using modprobe results in " FATAL : module ehci_hcd not found " .
With the above results , this seems to be normal .
Chances are bleak that the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Memory Card Reader will ever perform at High USB Speeds .
So far it seems to be a hardware issue with the Memory Card Reader where Windows XP Pro adds even more confusion .
Uninstall Windows XP USB devices ?
Now back to Windows XP Pro again .
A much repeated remedy to get USB 2.0 devices operate at USB High speed is to uninstall all USB devices in the Windows Device Manager and restart .
The reasoning behind it is ; Service Pack 1 has no USB 2.0 support .
So for all those who migrated their XP installation from SP1 to SP2 , already registered USB 2.0 devices continue to operate on USB 1.1 speeds .
Sound legit .
So lets give that one a try with SP3 installed .
So open the Computer Management console ( My Computer - right click - Manage ) , select the device manager and start uninstalling all USB host controllers .
Pretty simple - they 're gone in a few minutes .
Restart and Windows XP
Pro detects the USB hardware right away .
Now it got really really really weird with re-installed USB device drivers .
Windows XP Pro SP3 reports the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed card reader as a High Speed USB 2.0 device and the Host controller as USB 1.1 .
With SP2 it was the other way around .
So what 's the verdict with the USB 1.1 VOIP phone ?
Wow !!
it 's also reported as a USB2.0 device .
What a total mess - SP3 should be an improvement ?
But what USB 2.0 devices do work at USB Hi-Speed ?
The list is long of devices that do work at High Speed WITHOUT re-installing USB drivers .
Too give a few examples of much used USB Hi-Speed devices :
LaCie 160 Gb USB disk ( Design By Porsche ) with JM20339 USB2.0 to SATA Bridge
NoName 120 Gb USB disk with M110B USB 2.0 To IDE Bridge ( PATA )
HP Deskjet F300 series with USB2.0 interface with unknown USB controller
And those USB 2.0 devices work flawlessly from day 1 on USB 2.0 speeds with :
DELL Latitude D610 with XP Pro SP2
DELL Latitude D610 with XP Pro SP3
DELL Optiplex Gx110 with Xp Pro SP1
NoName P4 with XP Home
DELL Latitude D610 with UBUNTU 9.04 ( Linux variant )
All have been tested with the above mentioned USB2.0 memory card reader and all OS configurations switch to USB1.1 .
Only Windows XP add 's more confusion to the already hard to diagnose USB 2.0 Hi-Speed mess .
The correct USB message here would be : " USB non -Hi-Speed device connected to USB Hi-Speed Hub " .
USB 2.0 High speed detection mechanism
Looking closer at the USB 2.0 High Speed - capability identification shows a rather simple mechanism and is known in the USB industry as " chirping " .
At connect the USB device receives " USB RESET " command from the host controller .
If the USB device has high speed capabilities it answers the USB RESET by raising one of the communication lines ( D -) to +5 Volts .
In turn the host controller " chirps " ( raising D- and D+ lines alternating ) indicating it 's own USB 2.0 High speed capabilities .
From here communication continues at USB 2.0 speeds .
Now for the USB 2.0 Hi-speed card reader , where does the USB Hi-speed identification go sour ?
A few possibilities , assuming the host controller initiates the USB reset ;
The USB device does n't respond according to USB specification , because ;
The USB reset is not received correctly ( voltage & timing )
The USB reset response is incorrect ( voltage & timing )
The USB device does respond within USB specifications , but
the host controller does n't interpret the response as correct ( timing ) and stays at USB1.1 .
the USB device does n't see the " chirping " correctly and stays at USB1.1 speed .
Most likely - in this case , it 's scenario 1 b where the timing of the D- signal is off mark and the USB host controller continues at USB 1.1 ( Full speed iso Hi-Speed ) .
USB 2.0 Detection mechanism implementation
In this case changing Windows driver software does n't help for one bit .
The problem lies at chip level , not at the Windows driver level .
For those with USB devices with on - board firmware in ( flash ) memory , there is a chance changing USB device driver software might help .
Controller chip dependent USB2.0 detection software , following signal and timing specification in the graph above , requires good programming usually implemented on small real - time OS kernels .
This is specialist embedded software programming where timing is crucial .
For PC based host controllers the right driver does the trick .
And as shown in this case , compatible USB 2.0 controller chipsets can make a big difference .
USB2.0 high - speed certification
Not surprisingly , there 's USB2.0 High Speed certification .
Those USB integrators / manufacturers who pass the USB - IF Compliance Testing Program may carry the USB Hi-speed certificate on their products .
The cheap USB2.0 card reader mentioned above did not have the USB Hi-speed certificate - at least not on the product package .
But as usual , logo's can be copied easily and can appear on products not certified at all .
For those USB devices where high speed communication is crucial , such as a memory card reader , it might safe a bit of time and frustration to have a device with a USB 2.0 compliant USB controller inside .
Now , just for the heck of it , did the AU6371 chip from Alcor Micro Corporation pass the USB - IF Compliance Testing Program ?
Yes it did , the AU6371 chip is listed in the the USB Hi-Speed compliance database , however with revision number A41 .
The USB Hi-Speed compliance entry is created at 6 august 2006 .
According to the Alcor website , the AU6371 is released in October 2003 .
It could be that early releases of the AU6371 controller did n't function properly and are still available in the " wild " .
The UBUNTU linux installation lists the Memory Card Reader with serial number Multi_Flash_Reader_058F001111B1-0;0 with firmware version 1.0 .
The latter version sounds very virgin ...
Tired of getting the Windows USB messages ?
With SP3 , it 's possible to get rid of the infamous USB messages .
Apparently some - one at Microsoft agreed the slow USB speed reminders are not always so much fun to look at .
Do n't try to find this " feature " in Windows XP versions prior to SP3 .
USB 2.0 Hi-speed findings
Based on the findings above , the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed stuff that really sticks out ;
No wonder the USB driver ( re ) - installation orgy found on the internet .
When USB messages can not be trusted in combination with the absence of decent USB error reporting it takes a lot of cross -PC / OS testing to make any sense of this USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Hell .
Finding your way out of USB2.0

Wenn eine Politikerin in den Urlaub nach Spanien fährt , bekommt sie vom Steuerzahler für den Dienstwagen über 9.000 EUR gesponsort .
Wenn hingegen ein Politiker politische Häftlinge in Aserbaidschan besuchen und sich für deren Freilassung einsetzen will , muss er die schätzungsweise 2000 - 2500 EUR für Flug und Unterkunft selbst zahlen :
In Absprache mit dem Menschenrechtsbeauftragten der Bundesregierung , Günter Nooke , und auf Wunsch von Aktivisten vor Ort will Tauss an diesem Dienstag nach Baku / Aserbaidschan reisen .
Hintergrund : Zwei Bürgerrechtler und Internetblogger , darunter ein ehemaliger Praktikant von Tauss , wurden vom Regime unter fadenscheinigen Begründungen aus offensichtlich politischen Gründen inhaftiert .
( derstandard .at , „ EU rügt Baku scharf “ )
Hiergegen gab es in den letzten Wochen internationale Proteste .
Der „ Pirat “ will mit den Inhaftierten in Kontakt kommen .
Doch kurz vor Abflug kam der Hammer : Jörg Tauss , mit der Region vertraut und Mitglied der Deutsch - Südkaukasischen Parlamentariergruppe , soll nach Auffassung der Bundestagsverwaltung die Reise aus eigener Tasche bezahlen , weil sie nicht in „ Zusammenhang mit seiner Tätigkeit im Forschungsausschuss “ steht .
Er müsse jetzt , so heißt es von oben , ein Reiseprogramm zum Thema Bildung vorlegen .
Menschenrechte genügen offensichtlich der Bundestagsverwaltung nicht als Grund für die Reise .
Tauss hat deshalb jetzt seine kurzfristige „ Versetzung “ in den Ausschuss für Menschenrechte erbeten und zu der Sache noch weiteren Gesprächsbedarf angekündigt : „ Es kann nicht sein , “ so Tauss , „ dass der Bundestag seine Flugmeilenkontingente für Bildungsreisen für Abgeordnete investiert , aber der Einsatz für Menschenrechte durch einen Bundestagsabgeordneten selbst bezahlt werden muss . “
Die Auseinandersetzung um die „ Meilen für Menschenrechte “ hat jetzt erst richtig begonnen .

' The best picture on Earth ' : Mount Everest captured from a mile above in British balloonist 's breathtaking panoramic shot
Advertisement
This awe - inspiring photograph captures the majesty of Mount Everest as you 've never seen it before - from more than a mile above .
The spectacular panorama shows the breathtaking landscape of the Himalayas from six miles above sea level .
It was shot by an intrepid British photographer wearing breathing apparatus in - 56C temperatures 36,000 feet up .
It is believed to be the highest panoramic picture taken by hand from a balloon , and was described by mountaineer Reinhold Messner as the ' best snap on earth ' .
' Best snap on Earth ' : Everest dominates the picture , shot from 36,000ft and in - 56C temperatures by Leo Dickinson on the world 's first - ever balloon flight over the highest mountain .
The curvature of the planet is exaggerated by the wide - angle lens
The summit of Everest , the world 's highest peak at 29,035 ft , takes centre stage above the 11,000ft vertical drop of the Kangshung Face , on the eastern side of the mountain .
British filmmaker and adventure cameraman Leo Dickinson took the photo from the stratosphere during his record - breaking balloon flight over Everest .
With Nepal on the left of the frame , and Tibet on the right , the stunning skyline westward shows nine of the planet 's highest summits .
These include Lhotse ( 27,940ft ) , Cho Oyu ( 26,906ft ) , Gyachung Kang ( 26,089 feet ) , Nuptse ( 25,850 ft ) , Peak 38 ( 24 , 904ft ) , Changtse ( 24,770ft ) , Shartse ( 24,471 ft ) and Ama Dablam ( 22,349ft ) .
The original photograph was shot in 1991 on the classic Kodachrome film - axed last month due to the rise of digital cameras .
It was digitally remastered for the first time this week .
Up , up and away : Adventure filmmaker Leo Dickinson in his hot air balloon over the Himalayas shortly before he took the photo
Married Mr Dickinson , 62 , soared to 36,000ft - where temperatures dropped to minus 56 degrees Celsius - to become the first person to fly over Everest in a balloon .
He took this picture using a hand - held 35 mm camera with a wide - angle lens while standing in the balloon 's wicker cabin .
Mr Dickinson , of Budleigh Salterton , Devon , said : ' This photograph is one of the finest I 've taken , and I 'm immensely proud of it .
' It took several minutes to set up - I was in the stratosphere and carrying bulky breathing apparatus - and I was n't sure it would even come out .
' So when it was developed , and it came out like this , you can imagine my delight .
It 's a scene that I 'll remember for the rest of my life . '
Mr Dickinson 's Everest expedition took 10 years to plan , involved 150 porters and 50 yaks , and almost cost him his life .
His epic journey from the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu to Tibet was chronicled in an award - winning documentary Ballooning Over Everest .
A letter I just sent :
Dear members of the LP National and / or Platform Committees :
Im writing to express my concern over reported comments by LP Platform Committee member Rick Randall to the effect that free - market anarchists are not genuine Libertarians and should be ousted from the Party :  Every time they surface , the mainstream ( true ) Libertarians quickly recognize them for what they are ( people more interested in promoting in - fighting and , well … anarchy , than liberty ) and oust them . 
Im frankly worried about the ability of Mr. Randall to carry out his duties fairly and objectively , given how poorly informed , and evidently prejudiced , he appears to be relative to the Partys longtime anarchist contingent .
I urge the Committees to demand an apology from Mr. Randall ; and I urge Mr. Randall himself to acquaint himself more thoroughly both with the basics of anarchist theory and with the history of the party he claims to represent .
Flourish in liberty ,

Optus Wants $ 9.99 A Month For iPhone Tethering
Optus has finally announced its plans for iPhone tethering , and they ’re not pretty : if you want to use your iPhone running the 3.0 OS as a modem , you ’ll have to pay an extra $ 9.99 a month for the privilege .
The $ 9.99 fee — which will become available from June 22 , according to an Optus press release — does n’t get you any extra data , but does let you draw on your existing allowance .
A 2GB bundle costs $ 24.99 , and a 6GB bundle is $ 44.99 .
Excess data is $ 0.35 per megabyte .
It would seem likely the bundles only last 30 days , but there ’s no way of knowing yet —
Optus has announced the pricing but is n’t going to reveal the terms and conditions until the service goes live .
Online reports suggest that iPhone users on Virgin have been able to tether , despite Virgin using the Optus network , so it would seem to be a decision based on carrier profit rather than technical requirements .
One thing ’s clear though : if tethering is an important feature for you , literally any other carrier is going to be better value .
An iTnews investigation has found Telstra opts not to roll out internet services in new housing estates where competing infrastructure has been installed .
Residents of housing estates with fibre networks other than Telstra Velocity can't access Telstra 's internet services .
Telstra 's competitors allege the incumbent has an internal policy of not offering services on third - party fibre .
i Tnews asked Telstra to indicate whether there are any new housing estates in which the carrier has offered services over third - party fibre .
A Telstra spokesman confirmed the telco had n't sought access to " any other provider in greenfield estates " .
While Telstra does not appear to have a formal policy against buying wholesale capacity on open access networks , iTnews has uncovered evidence of the telco 's reticence to do so .
One of the main alternatives to Telstra Velocity , Opticomm , told iTnews that Telstra did n't offer services in any of the estates it had wired .
Opticomm , which is backed by Hills Industries , had some 50,000 greenfield lots under contract for fibre rollout .
" We 're led to believe they still have an internal policy that they wo n't run across any third party network , " Opticomm 's general manager Phil Smith said .
" [ Telstra ] certainly have n't approached us to take up our wholesale access products and we have n't pursued them with any gusto at this stage .
" We 've expressed to Telstra we 're ready for them to come on board .
We do n't restrict them , but at the end of the day it 's their decision . "
Developers wanting to roll out fibre in their estates were being faced with a difficult choice - roll out Velocity and lock residents into Telstra or roll out an open access network that removes Telstra as a residential service option altogether .
" As a developer , whichever way you go with fibre you 're stuck , " said Robin Russell , managing director of Robin Russell & Associates , an engineering consultancy .
" Almost no developers have taken up [ Velocity alternatives ] because if they do Telstra are n't interested in providing services in the estates .
" Developers are interested in how land buyers perceive the deal .
Every developer at least wants an option to go to Telstra [ in their estates ] if everyone else fails . "
The result , in many cases , was simply confusion .
Although developers were becoming savvier with the implications of telecommunications infrastructure arrangements in their housing estates , many did n't know they had alternatives to Velocity .
These include open access networks like Opticomm and Pivit or the less favoured option of becoming a carrier and rolling out the fibre themselves .
" We did n't even know it was an option to roll out the fibre ourselves , " said one developer with several Velocity estates , who spoke to iTnews on condition of anonymity .
" We would n't know the technical side of doing it or where to start with putting it together . "
The story was not uncommon , according to the chief executive of greenfields fibre operator Pivit .
Pivit operates open access networks in estates in Queensland and NSW , including Prince Henry estate at Little Bay in Sydney 's eastern suburbs .
It also provides retail internet and phone services in its estates but it expects " two or three " other residential service providers to be offering services to home owners by the end of the year .
" Developers often have a bare to minimal [ understanding of open access ] , " Pivit chief Peter Thompson said .
" Some have their heads around it but others do n't understand the issues or where their responsibilities start or stop .
It 's normally a steep learning curve for developers on where the law stands on access . "
i Tnews has cited several examples that are said to highlight developers ' confusion over telecommunications infrastructure .
Landcom NSW , which developed the Prince Henry estate , deployed two sets of pits and pipes - one for Telstra and one for a third - party .
One set of conduits was intended for copper and the other for fibre .
But Thompson claimed Telstra had " elected not to deploy [ copper ] infrastructure in the estate " once it was clear Pivit had won the right to roll out fibre in the estate .
The claim was verified by other industry players .
" As soon as Telstra smell there 's fibre going in , they stop rolling out copper , " said Opticomm 's Smith .
Pivot 's Thompson said there was " a misconception among developers that they need two sets of pipes " to ensure choice in their estates .
" It 's a business case that 's fraught with danger because where there 's two access providers trying to service a minimum density residential estate , one will always lose , " he said .
A Landcom spokeswoman confirmed the arrangement but said it was the developer 's policy across a number of estates " to allow for flexibility " , rather than being due to any confusion .
In estates where Telstra decided to stop rolling out copper , it is understood Telstra maintained its universal service obligation for voice by providing residents with a " fixed phone " that ran off the Next G network instead .
This was billed at fixed line rates .
Russell believed the complexity of fibre builds had turned many developers off them .
He said some developers had shunned Telstra Velocity " because it was perceived as too costly and something developers did n't get much benefit from .
" They did n't think they could get Velocity costs per lot back in sales .
The fact it 's subsidised for the first year [ also ] does n't seem to have helped . "
Telstra offers residents of new housing estates a subsidy of up to $ 2000 for the first year of the Velocity service .
But Opticomm's Smith said developers are still keen to invest in fibre connectivity .
He said the company would bring Mirvac 's Parkbridge in Sydney 's
West online next week .
Alamanda Point Cook and University Hill on the outskirts of Melbourne and Lightsview in South Australia were among Opticomm 's other recent wins .

ANCHORAGE 
In late March , a senior official from the Republican Governors Association headed for Alaska on a secret mission .
Sarah Palin was beset by such political and personal turmoil that some powerful supporters determined an intervention was needed to pull her governorship , and her national future , back from the brink .
The official , the association ’s executive director , Nick Ayers , arrived with a memorandum containing firm counsel , according to several people who know its details :
Make a long - term schedule and stick to it , have staff members set aside ample and inviolable family time to replenish your spirits , and build a coherent home - state agenda that creates jobs and ensures re-election .
Like so much of the advice sent Ms. Palin ’s way by influential supporters , it appeared to be happily received and then largely discarded , barely slowing what was , in retrospect , an inexorable march toward the resignation she announced 10 days ago .

Few regions in the world are as richly endowed as the Peruvian Amazon .
Beyond housing around 10 percent of the world ’s biodiversity , it is rich in mineral , hydrocarbon and forestry resources , and its rivers are a coveted source of freshwater , food and energy .
But the Amazon ’s riches have also set the stage for a bitter conflict between the region ’s indigenous peoples and Peru ’s national government over land and resource rights and future development .
The conflict has escalated alarmingly over the past two months .
On June 5 , a confrontation in the town of Bagua between protestors and authorities left at least 30 activists and 22 police officers dead .
At the center of the conflict is a set of legislative decrees issued in early 2008 by the executive , bypassing the normal congressional discussion and scrutiny process .
President Alan García ’s extraordinary legislative powers were justified under the guise of ensuring quick implementation of the Peru - U.S. free - trade agreement .
However , the 101 decrees issued go well beyond facilitating U.S. - Peru trade relations .
Using a popular free - trade arrangement — 60 percent of Lima residents see it as positive for Peruvian development according to a 2008 report by the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs — as a springboard , the decrees implement a much wider agenda aimed at opening a vast area of the Peruvian Amazon ( around 60 percent of the country ’s territory ) to development , making it easier for private investors to settle and acquire lands .
The decrees ( 994and 020-2008 - AG ) in effect create a special fast - track regime for awarding title to “ idle and unproductive lands ” with agricultural potential to private developers .
But , in fact , most of the land under dispute is traditionally held by indigenous groups .
In Peru , obtaining and registering indigenous titles is far from easy , but title , at a minimum , is required for legal protection from state - sponsored encroachment .
There are a number of hurdles in the title process , not least the high cost of legal procedures and the stiff opposition of non-indigenous settlers who live in the region .
Work is in progress , but it is slow and often ineffective .
A study by the Ombudsman ’s Office in 2002 identified 17 steps to obtaining indigenous title , while Andrew Gray reported 26 steps stretching over 15 years in Derechos Indígenas y Desarrollo : autodeterminación en una comunidad amazónica ( Indigenous Rights and Development : Self - Determination in an Amazon Community , 2002 ) .
The dispute between the administration of President Alan García and the indigenous peoples was set in motion by the government ’s failure to consult the affected peoples prior to issuing the decrees , as required by law .
Beyond the government ’s procedural blunders , the substance of the dispute revolves around indigenous rights to land and resources , and the conditions under which Amazonian development may take place in the future .
In addition to Decrees 994 and 020 - 2008 - AG , the existing definition of “ idle and unproductive lands ” — legally state - owned — is expanded in Decree 1064 , further eroding the ability of indigenous peoples to maintain control of traditional lands and resources .
It also eliminates the requirement that extractive industry companies must gain informed consent from local communities before entering their territories .
Moreover , Decree 1090 , the new Forestry Law , removes deforested areas from the inalienable patrimony of the state , enabling their sale to private parties .
Already , illegal deforestation to make way for the sale of lands in indigenous territories has been reported .
To cap things off , the titling of lands with agricultural potential is declared to be in the national interest ( Decree 1089 , art 1 ) , taking priority over indigenous titling .
Legislative involvement is increasing as the situation has escalated .
Following the initial negative indigenous reaction to the decrees , in December 2008 , a multi-partisan commission convened to look into the dispute issued a report that found all the decrees to be illegal .
The government has obstinately resisted their derogation and the conflict has escalated to unprecedented levels , including the declaration of a state of emergency in mid-May that suspends individual rights and guarantees in certain parts of the country .
Five days after the June 5 confrontation in Bagua , and under intense public pressure , the legislature , which had called for dialogue instead of intervening directly in the conflict , narrowly approved ( 57 to 47 votes ) Law 29376 — a law that suspends the application of Decrees 1064 and 1090 ( the Forestry Law ) .
What started off as an attempt to attract investment has backfired .
Oil and gas companies , already active in the area and an important source of revenue for Peru , are being forced to work in an increasingly hostile environment .
For oil and gas , the conflict represents a huge setback .
Under the leadership of the Ministry of Energy and Mines ( MINEM ) , the sector had been slowly but surely working toward better relations with indigenous communities .
Just two years earlier ( June 2007 ) the government created a Social Impact Management Office ( OGGS ) to promote harmonious relations between extractive companies and civil society , including indigenous communities .
The OGGS has prioritized conflict prevention over conflict management by pushing for increased participation and early community involvement in impact and benefit management .
It launched a series of formal tri-party ( government , civil society and industry ) roundtables to seek consensus on development - related issues and is working on developing best practices in corporate social responsibility and on fine tuning community consultation regulations .
Changing the sector ’s institutional culture from one where any development is better than no development to one that emphasizes social and environmental sustainability is not easy and often leads to confrontation between OGGS and other oil and gas agencies , such as the private but state - owned and run Perupetro .
But its work over the last couple of years has been undercut by García ’s aggressive and unilateral approach to development promotion in the Amazon .
The current tension lays bare the dysfunctional workings of the Peruvian government .
One of the objectives behind opening the land to private agri-businesses was to promote large - scale farming of bioenergy crops as part of a National Bioenergy Plan that emphasizes development of available land for biofuel production .
But normal day - to - day operations of existing oil and gas producers have suffered , and the future development of the oil and gas industry is now in the balance .
Together with mining , oil and gas is again being blamed for everything that goes wrong in the Amazon .
It is true that the industry does not have a squeaky clean environmental and social record .
But an important effort was being made by all sides , particularly in the area of increased dialogue , to correct mistakes and lay the groundwork for better impact management and benefit distribution .
Now , with most of the gains of the earlier dialogue lost , future Amazon investment is in doubt .
A robust economic sector was sacrificed for the benefit of agri-business development including , most notably , biofuel development — an industry whose viability and advantages are questionable at best .
As a result , the odds against any attempts by new industries to settle in the region have increased significantly .
In what may be a precursor of future developments , a Brazilian consortium looking at hydroelectricity development on the Inambari River as part of a recently signed Peru - Brazil cooperation and integration agreement is already facing local resistance .
After a short honeymoon where Peru championed the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples the country is back on the international human rights community ’s blacklist .
Indigenous organizations are well organized and support for their cause is increasing inside and outside Peru .
If any development is to take place in the Amazon , the government will have to play by the rules , or face increasing opposition and missed opportunities .
Ratified by Peru in 1994 , the International Labor Organization ’s Convention 169 on indigenous peoples ’ rights clearly states that respect for indigenous land and resource rights is not optional .
The executive is sending out mixed signals , opening the door for further tensions .
Instead , the best way forward is through good - faith dialogue and timely consultation — an area where MINEM and the Ombudsman Office should reassert their role for the benefit of the indigenous people and Peruvian development .

Thirty people arrived in the Wellmark lobby in Des Moines and asked to see Forsyth or any of the members of the board of directors or the operating officers .
They were told that none were available , and instead the police arrived .
Nine of the 30 refused to leave and were arrested .

The nine latest supporters of single - payer to go to jail for justice are :
Mona Shaw , Renee Espeland , Frankie Hughes ( age 11 ) , and Frank Cordaro , all from Des Moines Catholic Workers ; Leonard Simmons from Massachusetts ; Robert Cook ; Eddie Blomer from Des Moines ; Kirk Brown from Des Moines ; and Chris Gaunt from Grinnell , Iowa .
These nine and others like them around the country represent , I think , the incredible potential to energize the American public on behalf of a struggle for the basic human right of healthcare , a potential being blocked by the work of activist organizations that reach out from Washington to tell the public that single - payer is not possible , rather than reaching into Washington from outside to tell our public servants what we demand .
Here 's a blog from Digby acknowledging the reduction of the public option from where it started to next - to - nothing .
It 's not clear whether Digby thinks it would have been smarter to start with single - payer , in order to end up with a better compromise than what you get by initially proposing the weakest plan you 'll settle for .
But Digby argues that proposing single - payer from the start would not have given single - payer itself any chance of succeeding , and this is proven -- Digby says -- from the fact that the public option is having such a hard time succeeding .
I can't prove this is wrong .
Everything Digby writes is smart and to the point .
But this does omit an important factor or two .
Namely : single - payer turns an obscure wonkish policy mush into a clear and comprehensible civil rights issue .
Even with it blacked out and shunned by the White House and astroturfing activist groups , single - payer still has people sacrificing and going to jail for it .
Nobody goes to jail for a public option . *
Nobody even knows what it is .
Nobody will even know whether they got it if a bill is passed until experts debate the point for them -- at which point it 's too late .
Making healthcare a right rather than a legislative policy energizes people , and that potential has hardly been tapped and should not be written out of consideration .
John Nichols understands this , as does Glen Ford from Black Agenda Report .
Even defenders of a public option depict it as a step toward single - payer , while missing the potential of single - payer activism in the short term to improve the public option .
So , all agree that in the long run a movement for single - payer is needed .
It can begin with phone calls this week in support of these measures and with a massive presence on July 30 in Washington , D.C .
Image shows a previous protest at Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield by Des Moines Catholic Workers .
* Note : Joe Szakos of Virginia Organizing Project went to jail this week for a public option , but nobody he 'd organized went with him .
His action , like that in Iowa , was protesting an insurance company , an entity that would be eliminated only by single - payer .

At around 9:34 , Glenn Beck talked about how important it was that everyone read as often as possible , and that Common Sense in particular was a must read .
But he was n't talking about Thomas Paine 's Common Sense ( which , I 'd like to point out , is available for free right here ) .
No .
There 's a new book , Glenn Beck 's Common Sense , that Glenn had in his pocket while on stage , because he really thinks you should buy it .
Actually , he does n't think you should buy it .
He thinks it is yourHe makes a big point to show that he made his publishers put it out as a soft cover book , so he could sell it for the low , low price of $ 9.99 and standing on stage with the threat of tears in his eyes , he again reiterates how important reading ( and buying ) books ( that he wrote ) is .
This is a two hour comedy show with a freaking intermission , and Glenn Beck spends 10 minutes desperately pimping his book , the proceeds of which I imagine go towards the pro-rape legislation he 's been pushing for .

I spent 19 fucking dollars of Cracked .
com 's money to watch Glenn Beck stand center stage , teary - eyed and red-faced , shouting about how They needed to be taken down , and the audience screamed and cried and cheered along with him .
But again , Glenn Beck never explicitly says who " They " are , so when the show was over , I conducted a brief interview with one of the other attendees , a gentleman in his late 40s with a giant grin .
So , you enjoy the show ?
Absolutely I did , he knows what he 's talking about , we should elect him for president .
Yes .
We should elect Glenn Beck for president .
That is true .
Yes .
Quick question :
When Glenn was talking about how we needed to rise up against " Them " and tell " Them " that we 're not going to take it anymore , who do you think the " them " in that sentence is ?
Who is the " They " that we 're rising up against ?
[ Very long pause . ]
Well , the people - I mean , the politicians , the ones - Anyone who has taken us farther away from Freedom , from where we were before .
The people who inched us away from ...
[ It 's clear that he 's thinking of titties right now . ] ... Liberty .
Got it .
In any legislation that ’s nearly 1000 pages long , it ’s inevitable that there will be some interesting details .
The American Clean Energy and Security Act ( ACES ) is no exception .
Last week , Solve Climate reported on one of those interesting details , namely that ACES has a $ 50 million per year “ self - assessment ” that directly benefits the coal and other fossil fuel industries .
According to the article , the direct benefit comes down to the creation of a federal Carbon Storage Research Corporation that is funded by per-kilowatt charges on electric bills instead of a tax on fossil fuel - burning utilities .
So not only do the utilities not have to organize themselves , with the overhead costs associated therewith – the federal government does the organizational heavy lifting – they also get to charge their customers a federally - mandated assessment that pays for carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) research instead of having to spend profit dollars to do that research .
Put another way , electricity users pay directly for CCS research and development instead of having utilities peform that research themselves based on market pricing pressure ( the usual way to get companies to do R&D in a market economy ) .
The Solve Climate article also points out that the utilities themselves will be the beneficiaries of the Carbon Storage Research Corporation ’s federally mandated largess as the Corporation doles out money for research projects .
To recap , fossil fuel - burning utilities a ) collect the assessment from their customers directly , b ) do n’t have to spend the time and money to organize themselves , and c ) will be the beneficiaries of the money they collect .
The article points out that the assessment is not technically a tax because a supermajority of utilities who collect the self - assessment have to approve it , but given the advantages the utilities get from this , what motivation would they have to reject the assessment ?
None that I can see , and none that Dan Greenwood , a professor of corporate finance and law at Hofstra University ’s School of Law , can see either .
Greenwood is quoted in the article as saying :
This is every industry ’s dream – to have the proceeds of a monopoly tax dedicated entirely to your interests .
The money does n’t need to be re-appropriated every year , all of it is dedicated to your industry , and your industry gets to decide on how the money is allocated .
Maybe this lovely piece of fossil fuel pork will be purged by other committees in the House or by the Senate , but I would n’t bet on it .

Science academies call for Copenhagen to address ocean acidification
International negotiators have started the long process of working out a follow - on treat to the Kyoto Protocol that will be finalized in Copenhagen this December .
Unfortunately , one of the more serious effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) , ocean acidification , is not presently a driving force behind emissions limits .
The Interacademy Panel on International Issues , a body composed of national science academies from around the world , released a statement that aims to raise the profile of ocean acidification among the treaty negotiators .
The IAP Statement on Ocean Acidification says , among other things , that :
If current trends in CO 2 emissions continue , model projections suggest that by mid-century CO 2 concentrations will be more than double pre-industrial levels and the oceans will be more acidic than they have been for tens of millions of years .
The current rate of change is much more rapid than during any event over the last 65 million years .
As a result of the rising acidity and the rate of the increase , the Statement says
[ Arctic ] waters will be corrosive to Arctic calcifiers such as pteropods , and bivalves such as clams , which play a key role in Arctic food webs .
and
The ocean chemistry changes projected … [ are ] likely to be too rapid for many species to adapt to .
Many coastal animals and groups of phytoplankton and zooplankton may be directly affected with implications for fish , marine mammals and the other groups that depend on them for food .
…
The impacts of these changes on oceanic ecosystems and the services they provide , for example in fisheries , coastal protection , tourism , carbon sequestration and climate regulation , cannot yet be estimated accurately but they are potentially large .
Do you like the taste of salmon or tuna ?
What happens if increasing CO 2 in the atmosphere acidifies the oceans so much that the food chain that feeds salmon and tuna collapses ?
No more salmon or tuna .
The Statement makes the following recommendations to the pre-Copenhagen negotiators :
Acknowledge that ocean acidification is a direct and real consequence of increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations , is already having an effect at current concentrations , and is likely to cause grave harm to important marine ecosystems as CO 2 concentrations reach 450 ppm and above ;
concentrations , is already having an effect at current concentrations , and is likely to cause grave harm to important marine ecosystems as CO concentrations reach 450 ppm and above ;
Recognise that reducing the build up of CO 2 in the atmosphere is the only practicable solution to mitigating ocean acidification ;
in the atmosphere is the only practicable solution to mitigating ocean acidification ;
Within the context of the UNFCCC negotiations in the run up to Copenhagen 2009 , recognise the direct threats posed by increasing atmospheric CO2 emissions to the oceans and therefore society , and take action to mitigate this threat ;
Implement action to reduce global CO 2 emissions by at least 50 % of 1990 levels by 2050 and continue to reduce them thereafter ;
emissions by at least 50 % of 1990 levels by 2050 and continue to reduce them thereafter ; Reinvigorate action to reduce stressors , such as overfishing and pollution , on marine ecosystems to increase resilience to ocean acidification .
In order to hit the “ 50 % below 1990 by 2050 ” target , however , some scientists say that global emissions of all greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) must peak and then start to fall no later than 2015 .
A similar conclusion was reached by a couple of Tyndall researchers and reported by the Carboholic in September , 2008 , where they concluded that “ it is difficult to envisage anything other than a planned economic recession being compatible with stabilization at or below 650 ppmv CO 2 e . ”

Permafrost ’s complex response to rising temperature
Last week , a new paper was published in the science journal Nature ( and reported by the National Science Foundation ) that showed for the first time how carbon responds to different amounts of permafrost thaw .
Previously , models had predicted that thawing permafrost would result in a release of carbon ( in the form of CO 2 and / or methane ) and methane releases from warming permafrost has been detected previously .
But the measurements to date have not shown whether the carbon emitted was greater than carbon absorbed , or how old the carbon emitted was .
The new paper not only reported details about both of these things , but also showed that whether permafrost was a net carbon sink or source depended on how long the permafrost had been thawed .
The authors monitored three sites in Alaska where various types of permafrost data has been collected since 1985 .
Since at least 2004 , the authors have been monitoring total carbon moving in and out of the three sites and determining the carbon ’s age via by radiocarbon dating .
What the authors found is that all three sites – selected for minimal , moderate , and extensive thawing of the permafrost – absorbed carbon during the Arctic summer and emitted carbon during the Arctic winter .
As expected , the site with minimal thawing was balanced and the site with extensive melting was a net source of carbon .
But the site with moderate thawing was actually a net carbon sink .
Unfortunately , the extensively thawed permafrost emitted much more carbon than it absorbed .
So much more , in fact , that all the carbon absorbed while the permafrost was in a “ moderately thawed ” state was released back into the environment once the permafrost thawed more extensively .
According to the paper , the results of the radiocarbon data confirm that microbial respiration of “ old ” carbon ( carbon prior to nuclear tests in the 40s and 50s ) has the potential to emit a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere .
The authors also attempted to estimate what this could mean for future carbon emissions even as they pointed out that it must “ be done with caution . ”
They estimated that , based on some models , permafrost thaw could release 0.8 - 1.1
Pg of carbon per year , roughly equal to the estimates of carbon emissions from land use changes such as agriculture , forestry , et al .
While the paper says that this emission rate depends on a host of factors that are not presently known , it is consistent with laboratory results .

Swiss RE expects a wave of climate litigation
According to an article in National Underwriter , reinsurance giant Swiss RE expects that a wave of lawsuits relating to climate change is going to hit in the next few years and that it will be similar to the mountain of lawsuits companies faced due to asbestos .
The Zurich - based firm , in an examination of the consequences of globalization of class actions on insurers , said , “ We expect , however , that climate change - related liability will develop more quickly than asbestos - related claims and believe the frequency and sustainability of climate change - related litigation could become a significant issue within the next couple of years … ”
The company advised , “ Given the potential implications of this shift for the insurance industry , developments need to be monitored closely . ”
If SwissRE is correct , then we can expect lawsuits against utilities and oil companies .
Imagine , for a moment , if the entire population of New Orleans brought suit against Peabody , Arch Coal , and ExxonMobil as a class action for their part emitting CO 2 that “ created ” Hurricane Katrina , or all the families who lost family members in Katrina charged the companies with wrongful death lawsuits .
Add into the equation the legal precedent set in the UK by the Greenpeace ruling that released six activists because they stopped climate damage and we have the potential for a horrendous amount of litigation .
Even I ’m not thrilled by the sound of that , and I ’m someone who would n’t cry a single tear if Peabody et al went out of business tomorrow .
According to the National Underwriter article , the SwissRE report warned that “ coercive settlements ” could be come a significant problem and suggested that “ consideration should be given to alternative dispute resolution schemes . ”

I have been using a Mac mini to port my C++/ Qt based code to Mac OS X for the last 3.5 years .
This is one of the early PowerPC based Mac minis , upgraded to 1GB of RAM .
Being Apple hardware , it is expensive for what you get .
But it has served me well .
The small form factor ( approx 17 x 17 x 5 cm ) has also been useful in my cramped office , where I have it attached to the same monitor , mouse and keyboard as my Windows box through a KVM switch .
But it is struggling to keep up with PerfectTable Plan ’s ever increasing code base .
A clean build of the PerfectTablePlan source into a Universal ( fat ) binary now takes an eye - watering 36 minutes to compile and link on the Mac mini .
Building a PowerPC - only debug version still takes nearly half that time .
That is painful , even just for occasional porting work .
As my main development environment is Windows , I ca n’t really justify the cost ( or office space requirements ) of a Mac Pro .
So I decided to buy a new Mac mini , with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor .
I did look around to see if I could find one at a discount .
However , this being Apple hardware , no - one dares sell at anything significantly less than Apple ’s RRP .
I bought the smaller ( 120 GB ) disk variant and had the dealer upgrade it to 2GB RAM , which tests on my old Mac mini indicated should be plenty for compiling and linking .
I did n’t want to do the memory upgrade myself as I know , from experience with my first Mac mini , that removing the case involves putty knives and some very worrying cracking noises .
I had all sorts of problems trying to get the right cables .
Firstly I wanted a Firewire cable so I could copy the set - up across from the old machine to the new machine using Apple ’s Migration Assistant software .
But it turns out that the old Mac Mini has a Firewire 400 6 - pin socket , whereas the new Mac Mini has a Firewire 800 9 - pin socket .
I ordered a 6 - pin to 9 - pin Firewire cable cable .
Then I discovered that there is more than one type of DVI cable .
The old Mac mini was attached to my KVM switch with a DVI - I cable .
The new Mac mini only accepts mini-DVI or ( via a supplied adaptor ) DVI - D . So I ordered a dual link DVI - D to DVI - D cable as well .
Once I had the right cables things went relatively smoothly .
The Migration Assistant software copied almost all the apps and data across from the old machine to the new one .
It even preserved settings for the apps , e.g. the email accounts in my Thunderbird email client .
I just had to re-install XCode ( which was n’t copied across ) and rebuild my Qt libraries ( to avoid copious warnings due to the fact they had been built with an earlier version of XCode / gcc ) .
To use the migration assistant you simply :
connect the 2 machines with a Firewire cable start - up the old machine with the ‘ T ’ key depresses to put it in ‘ Target ’ mode start - up the new machine follow the on - screen instructions
Nice .
If only it was was that easy to set - up a new Windows machine .
A quick test shows that the new Mac mini is nearly 6 times faster at compiling and linking a Universal binary of PerfectTablePlan from scratch [ 1 ] :
The time the new Mac mini takes to compile and link an Intel - only debug release of PerfectTablePlan also compares favourably with a similar build on my Windows 2.13 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo box with 4GB of RAM [ 2 ] .
This is n’t a fair hardware comparison , as the two machines are using completely different compilers and linkers and the Windows box was running various background services .
But it certainly shows that Intel - based Mac minis are worth considering for use as development machines .
[ 1 ]
The newer machine is using a newer version of XCode / gcc .
[ 2 ] The Windows box is using Visual Studio 2005 .
NORML Pro-Pot TV ad blankets US
The advertising media used by the campaign combined low cost national cable and Ohio News Network .
For added exposure element a PR bonus blitz was distributed via PRweb.com .
Initially , it was difficult t get approval to run NORMLs PSA / Commercial .
Ohio News
Network was quick to be first but other media outlets passed .
Finally , a national media vendor with homes in every market in the country , gave the go ahead .
The National Cable Homes buy ( April 20 - April 22 , 2009 ) reached homes with smart cableboxes , which tracks the precise networks and advertising spots watched .
NORML only paid for the audience reached and who stayed tuned to the ads .
- 97.5 % of people who watched the stay tuned in .
- Average length of time they viewed was 59.2 seconds NORMLs ad buyers viewed the PSA as being very effective , and for the very high percentage of the public who watched the ad , they apparently could not turn away .
The Numbers 7,700 spots ran across 210 markets over three days , in each market , 38 spots ran on CNN , Fox News , MSNBC , CNBC , CNN , CNN - Headline News , FX , Spike and Fuse .
- A total of 2,428,858 total viewing households were reached - A total of 2,394,690 actual viewers watched the commercials live - 34 , 168 additional viewers recorded the networks and watched the commercials within 7 days - 75 spots ran in 1.5 million homes on the Ohio News Network from April 23 - April 28 .
NORMLs PR package reached 30,000 journalists , 30,000 websites and 225,000 RSS subscribers , resulting in over 136,313 viewed packages , and 2,118 media outlets tracked the story .

In some U.S. states , nearly half of the job seekers who have stopped looking for work have done so because they simply do n't believe they 'll find anything .
Indeed , the number of discouraged workers nationwide has more than doubled in the past year .
This trend wo n't be reflected in the widely publicized unemployment rate , as discouraged workers are n't included among the unemployed .
Still , in states as diverse as Mississippi , South Dakota , and New York , the span of this often invisible slice of workers signals a population losing its hope .
[ Search for your best place to find a job . ]
Most jobless people who have stopped looking for work are otherwise engaged — they 're back in school , taking on family responsibilities , or too sick to search .
They , along with workers who have stopped because they 're discouraged , make up a group that the Labor Department calls the " marginally attached . "
They 're included in some of the broader measures of unemployment , but they 're officially not part of the workforce .
While discouraged workers make up about a third of the marginally attached nationwide , their numbers have been increasing .
Between the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year , Mississippi averaged the highest percentage of discouraged job seekers among its marginally attached — nearly 50 percent , compared with 32.6 percent nationwide .
South Dakota ranked second after Mississippi , with 48.5 percent of marginally attached workers classified as discouraged .
Florida , Michigan , Connecticut , West Virginia , and New York followed in ranking for the highest rates of discouragement .
Discouraged workers are characterized by their perceptions .
They do n't think work is available for them , or they believe they lack the necessary training to be hired .
They may be convinced that employers think they 're too young or too old , or they believe that they face some other kind of discrimination that prevents them from finding work .
And while there are discouraged workers in healthy economies , in a prolonged recession such as this one , worker pessimism tends to skyrocket .
The heights of discouragement in Mississippi are significant .
" It says something about the situation in that state when half of the people with a relatively recent commitment to searching for a job have stopped because they believe nothing is available for them , " says Thomas Krolik , an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Between the third quarter of last year and the second quarter of this year , Mississippi 's average unemployment rate was 7.9 percent .
Add in all the discouraged workers , and the rate shoots up to 8.8 percent , a 0.9 percentage - point jump .
Nationwide , the average difference between the unemployment rate and the rate of unemployed plus discouraged workers was about 0.4 percentage point .
Michigan and New York also ranked high by that measure .
Charles Campbell , a professor of economics at Mississippi State University , says the state struggles with regions of particularly high unemployment , " where there really are no jobs . "
Many of the residents of those regions lack the skills and means to find work in outside areas , Campbell says , so they remain unemployed .
In other states , the situation may be more obvious .
In Michigan , the demise of the domestic auto industry has brought job destruction far outpacing the national average .
Michigan 's unemployment rate for June topped 15.2 percent , compared with 9.5 percent nationally .
Across the country , Florida has been hit hard by the housing bust , and unemployment in the state reached 10.6 percent in June .
But higher unemployment rates and lousier job markets alone do n't explain the high rates of discouragement .
Connecticut , New York , and West Virginia have seen their numbers of jobless workers rise during the downturn , but their unemployment rates are all below the national average .
Several things could nudge job seekers toward hopelessness : negative media coverage of the job market ; unsuccessful job searches among friends and family ; their own long - term unemployment .
Also , men are more likely to give up their job search because they 've become discouraged — they make up 63 percent of the total group .
Younger workers , blacks , and Hispanics are also overrepresented in the discouraged - worker category , according to the Labor Department .
The housing bust could be partly to blame .
Workers may simply give up because there are no openings matching their skill set within their geographical area , Krolik says .
If workers own homes they can't sell , their ability to move for a new job is severely limited .
The effect could be exacerbated by areas where homes are a particularly difficult sell or homeowners are disproportionately underwater , as those markets have also tended to see higher unemployment rates .
The world 's central bankers have warned that the British economy faces relapsing into another recession – the much - feared " double dip " downturn .
A continuing drought in bank lending , evidenced in the latest figures from the Bank of England , and the threat that spiralling public borrowing will feed through to higher interest rates and inflation , are judged by international economists to be mortal dangers to a sustained recovery .
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , which comprises the 30 most advanced economies in the world , added to the gloom , saying that Britain remained " deep " in recession and faced a " bleak short - term outlook " .

" The recovery is likely to be slow and unemployment is expected to climb significantly , " it said , adding that the Treasury could do " considerably more " to fix the public finances .
Both warnings are at odds with recent market optimism and so - called green shoots suggesting that output in the economy may be recovering .
But the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) , which includes the Bank of England , the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank , said it feared that the problems of the world 's banks are far from fixed and could easily trigger a so - called " double dip " or " W - shaped " downturn .
" A major cause for concern is the limited progress in addressing the underlying problems in the financial sector , " it said .
" A significant risk is therefore that the current stimulus will lead only to a temporary pick - up in growth , followed by protracted stagnation . "
The BIS cautioned that " governments may not have acted quickly enough to remove problem assets from the balance sheets of key banks " .
It added that financial products should be treated like medicines and sold to consumers only when they are certified safe , to help prevent a repeat of last year 's financial meltdown .
Figures from the Bank of England yesterday confirmed that the banks and building societies remain reluctant to lend to any but the most secure of businesses and home buyers .
Mortgage approvals barely improved during May , remaining stuck at a little over 43,000 – some way above the nadir of 27,000 last winter , but under half of their normal level .
Analysts at Capital Economics said the figures were " consistent with house prices falling at double - digit annual rates " .
Detailed data on changes to the money supply indicated that relatively little of the £ 100bn pumped into the economy by the Bank of England through its policy of " quantitative easing " , akin to " printing money " , is finding its way as yet into meaningful lending by the banks to small businesses and first - time buyers .
A small improvement in consumer confidence was registered last month , and there is plenty of evidence of more buyer interest at estate agents and of shoppers continuing to shop .
However , for as long as the banking system remains reliant on public funding and unwilling to offer credit , little of this still - fragile optimism will be seen in hard purchases of " big ticket " items such as houses , cars and other goods linked to house purchase , such as electrical appliances and furniture .
Figures to be released by the Office for National Statistics are likely to reveal that the downturn in the UK in the first quarter of the year was even more severe than first thought , though most economists think the worst of the slump is over .
A CBI survey published yesterday said more than 95 per cent of banks and building societies expected their bad debts to rise over the next few months .
Such write - offs will join the existing " toxic assets " on the banks ' balance sheets and make them even less willing to take on riskier lending – the much feared " negative feedback loop " .
Most embarrassing for ministers is the OECD 's " health check " on important public services .
The OECD agreed that , since Labour came to power in 1997 , health spending has " surged " but " the returns so far appear modest " .
Ironically , given official enthusiasm for " league tables " , the OECD says the UK 's economic future is endangered by the inequality of educational achievement – a factor which has left the UK towards the bottom of the league table of advanced economies for social mobility : " International standardised tests show that the UK lags better performing countries significantly . "
However , the OECD supports the shift away from targeting : " The focus on raising the school leaving age and meeting performance targets in education may still be distracting attention from the more important goal of raising core literacy and numeracy achievement . "
It adds : " Adequate provision of public infrastructure should be a priority , particularly in transport where road and airport congestion , and problems in the rail system impede business and constrain productivity . "
Ministers have cancelled this year 's Comprehensive Spending Review on the grounds that the economic picture is too uncertain and that , after a general election , " tough choices " may become easier to implement .
Still , the OECD said it wanted " explicit " detail on spending cuts and tax rises , adding : " Experience in other countries suggests that a focus on expenditure cuts , rather than revenue raising , is associated with more successful consolidations . "
At the moment , the OECD claims , the Government is not being " ambitious " enough .
As a candidate , " Barack Obama promised to end the ' politics of fear and cynicism , ' " said Karl Rove in The Wall Street Journal .
But as president he is " trying to sell his health - care proposals on fear . "
Obama is trying to " scare voters " by saying that unless his proposals are approved their health - insurance premiums will keep rising and doctors will perform unnecessary procedures to fatten their wallets .
" This is not a healthy way to wage a policy debate . "
Fear - mongering is definitely clouding the health - care reform debate , said Froma Harrop in RealClearPolitics , but that 's the Republicans ' fault .
Their attacks on President Obama 's plan are growing increasingly crazy .
" A recent example invokes an evil plot to save money by knocking off the elderly . "
Betsy McCaughey , " the Sarah Palin of health care , " actually said on TV that a Senate bill would " pressure the elderly to end their lives prematurely , " and her lie has become a Republican talking point .
The " deathers " have convinced many Americans that " the House bill and health - care reform in general are the legislative equivalent of euthanasia , " said Christopher Beam in Slate .
But it 's only fair to point out that President Obama has suggested that without reform , health - care inflation could lead to cuts in Medicare .
Both sides , you see , are resorting to " scaring Grandma . "
If you ’re looking to join an Irish Facebook group , you ’ll have no shortage of options : when you type “ Irish ” in the Facebook group search , over 500 results pop up .
There ’s everything from the “ Irish Jews ” to the “ Irish Mafia ” ( sure you are ) , from the “ Feelin Irish ” group to the “ Irish Bowling ” community .
If you ’re Irish and interested in pretty much anything , there ’s sure to be a bunch of Facebookers who have gone ahead and created a group for you .
But the Irish Facebook group scene being so populous and all , of course there ’s going to be a few dark horses .
We here at IrishCentral took it upon ourselves to scope out the most bizarre , least ordinary Irish - themed Facebook groups out there .
And trust me – there were no lack of contestants .
Facebook goes to show : we Irish are an eccentric bunch .
if your Irish and you know it , eat some TAYTOS !!!
I ’ll ignore the blatant misuse of “ your ” ( though it irks me incredibly … ) – that is not what makes this group outlandish .
The outlandishness comes from the love of Taytos !
As an Irish American , I had no idea .
Taytos is a reoccurring theme in Irish Facebook gruops – from the Taytos - loving groups to the “ im gonna kneecap the next English person who mocks my Northern Irish accent ” group that uses a Taytos bag as their default pic .
( This group was outlandish enough to receive its own write up - see below . )
Irish people are immune to psychoanalysis
What does this even mean ?
I looked it up and discovered a ) it ’s based on something Freud said ( something like “ This is one race of people for whom psychoanalysis is of no use whatsoever " ) , and b) Matt Damon said something to that effect in “ The Departed . ”
The twenty or so members of this group do little to further explain .
There are only three wall posts , two of which , funny enough , are from a woman trying to convince the members to visit her psychotherapy Web site for support .
♣F*CK YOU I'M IRISH ♣
Hey , now , do we have to get nasty ?
This group is crazy because the Irish are known as such fun-loving people !
I mean , c’mon , “ Lonely Planet ” travel guide named Ireland the “ Most Friendly Country ” in 2008 .
Clearly no one from Lonely Planet ran into the members of this group … though there ’s a whopping 9,635 of them !
For more mean - spirited Irish pride , visit the groups “ I'm Irish , You 're Not , So You Suck ” and “ Kiss My Irish A ** . ”
im gonna kneecap the next English person who mocks my Northern Irish accent
Finally , a Northern Irish - specific outlandish site !
They overreact ( mildly ) to accent mocking , and use a bag of Taytos as their default pic .
Naturally .
PLUS , this 4,000 - strong group ever so thoughtfully provides a forum in which people can discuss and debate the true meaning of “ knee capping . ”
( Is it shooting one in the knees ?
Crippling them in the knees via any means ?
The debate roars on … )
i have a scary irish mother
Over 3,000 people claim to have a scary Irish mother , and I have a feeling there are a lot more out there .
According to this wise cracking group , a “ scary ” Irish mother is one who : is not afraid to shout and rip you to shreds in front of your friends and especially in a confined space .. like the car ; talks too loudly on the phone , usually slagging you off or revealing personal details about you to " Colette " or anyone that ’s called ; ca n’t remember the name of the missus down the road who ’s uncle 's cousin died and yet there ’s a whole story you have to hear about ; when she sees someone ugly on TV or an eejit , she says " ack ...he 's somebodys son ... "
In the end , though , the members of the group are wise enough to say they love their mothers .
Otherwise , their mothers would kill them .
If 10,000 People Join This Group I 'll Get A Leprechaun Tattoo On My Ass
So the guy making this horrible threat does not seem to be Irish , but nevertheless , he speaks of leprechauns , and he ’s outlandish – so his group makes it on the list .
Irish accents make my knees go just a little bit wibbly …
There were tons of groups to choose from in this category , from “ If you ask with an Irish Accent , I will do whatever you want , ” “ The Irish Accent Turns Me On ” and Irish accents make the world go round ... ”
Bottom line is , women from all over the world apparently swoon upon hearing an Irish accent emerging from a guy ’s mouth .
Good news for many visitors of this site , eh ?
After seeing The Departed I want to join the Irish Mafia
There ’s also the aptly named : “ I 'm Irish , have a Boston accent , and the Departed is the best movie ever . ”
Agreed , it ’s a good film , but no .
No you do n’t .
Top Reasons it 's Beneficial to Date an Irish Dancer
The group name is n’t so outlandish , but the racy list of reasons is .
Apparently , it ’s a pretty good deal to date an Irish dancer because : “ You can restrain us if you 'd like ...
We 're used to not using our arms ” ; “ We 've worn all sorts of strange articles of clothing ...
Nothing you can suggest will throw us off ” ; “ We are encouraged to flash ... A lot ! ”
Side note : we also enjoyed the groups : “ Screw the real world , I live in the delusional world of Irish dance ” and “ There 's nothing like stamping your anger out irish dancing after a hard day . ”
I LOVE IRISH EXITS and Irish exit
Facebook members are rather in love with the Irish .
They even love how they exit a room …
( Did anyone even know what this was before reading this ? )
Apparently , if you leave a place without explanation or a goodbye , you ’ve achieved the legendary Irish exit .
Members of the “ Irish exit ” group have shared their strategic tips on how to accomplish such a task , including :
1. Drink final drink to near end
2 . Ask someone to hold near empty drink
3 . Exit stage left
Another explains how a friend always said he was going to get pizza .
By the third time this happened , they figured out if he was “ getting pizza , ” that meant they would n’t see him until the next day .
Brilliant .
I love Irish Car Bombs
This kind of group itself is not so outlandish ( Okay , maybe one is – just check out the default pic of “ Irish Car Bombs fo’ life ” ) , but it is outlandish that there are just so damn many of this type on Facebook !
There are Irish Car Bomb party groups , championship groups , even a group inquiring where you took your first Irish Car Bomb .
( What is this , a sacred ritual ? )
What I get from this is put a half - filled pint of Guinness and a shot glass full of whiskey and / or Bailey ’s in front of one of these guys for them to combine , and they ’re happy campers .

This group name is just so outlandishly , multiculturally - awesome .
That is all .
Workers inside the factory say they will stay for " as long as it takes "
Turbine workers talk of sit - in life Eleven workers taking part in a sit - in protest over job cuts at a wind turbine blade factory on the Isle of Wight have been dismissed .
Vestas Windsystems said it had sacked 11 employees who it had identified as being inside the office .
The protest began on 20 July in response to the firm 's plans to make 625 staff redundant at the end of July .
Vestas is shutting the Newport site because it says the UK wind turbine market is not big enough .
Mike , one of the workers , told the BBC that dismissal letters - telling them they had lost their jobs and their redundancy packages - were delivered with their evening meal , a slice of pizza .
He said : " We 're obviously disappointed but we kind of expected this .
" It 's not going to deter us and we 're not going to leave .
The workers have spent more than a week inside the factory " We 're not doing this for us now , we 're doing this for everybody else . "
Vestas said : " Since the occupation began on Monday 20 July , Vestas has made several attempts to encourage the employees participating in the occupation to discontinue their participation .
" Vestas has also explained to the employees concerned the potential consequences of their actions if they were to refuse to discontinue their participation .
" Today , Vestas therefore , unfortunately , saw no other choice than to dismiss the 11 employees , who the company has positively identified as the employees currently participating in the occupation of the factory . "
On Wednesday , the company will make an application at Newport County Court for a possession order to remove the protestors from the factory .
Protesters said about 25 workers were occupying the office of the Danish company 's factory .
Climate rally Meanwhile , campaigners were holding a rally outside the Department of Energy and Climate Change in central London on Tuesday evening .
The Save Vestas Rally has been organised by the Campaign against Climate Change ( CACC ) and the National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers ( RMT ) .
They were calling on the government to spend more on green energy .
On Monday , Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband spent more than an hour talking to Vestas protesters when he visited Oxford .
The visit coincided with the government announcing a £ 6 m grant for Vestas ' research centre , which will be based at Newport .
Mr Miliband told the BBC he was " very sorry for the people who may be losing their jobs in the Isle of Wight " .
He went on to say the " £6 m to help Vestas build a research and development facility into offshore wind should employ around 150 people " .

The Mets were in town last night for a makeup game with the Buccos .
Also in town , and at the same hotel , were Furries .
Anthrocon 2009 made it to Pittsburgh , as it usually does , and the incredibly weird Furries annoyed the crap out of the Mets .
This is making the news nowadays ?
Ca n’t I find some Michael Jackson updates or something ?
All the Mets had to do was ask .
I know like 4 other hotels that they could ’ve stayed at .
Hell , I used to work at a hotel closer to Steelers training camp in Latrobe .
Sure , it is n’t right in the city and requires about a 45 minute trip on the turnpike and Parkway , but I never encountered any Furries there .
I did encounter an ancient woman who called me quite a few derogatory names for a black person , but no creepy Furries .
So there ’s that .
The California Supreme Court announced today that it will rule Tuesday on the constitutionality of Proposition 8 , the November ballot measure that resurrected a ban on same - sex marriage .
The ruling , which will be posted at 10 a.m. , will also determine whether an estimated 18,000 same - sex marriages will continue to be recognized by the state .
Gay rights lawyers have argued that the ballot measure was an illegal constitutional revision rather than a more limited amendment .
Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown urged the court to reject the measure on different grounds .
He contended the proposition was unconstitutional because it took away an inalienable right without compelling justification .
Chief Justice Ronald M. George and Justice Joyce L. Kennard will cast key votes in the case .
They were part of the four - judge majority that gave gays the right to marry last May , but both indicated at oral argument that they were not persuaded the measure was unconstitutional .
The court ’s majority decision should be revealed in the first or second page of the ruling and reiterated in its last paragraph .
Separate concurring and dissenting opinions follow .
Counting votes may be tricky because the court is dealing with three different legal issues : the revision challenge , the attorney general ’s challenge and the fate of existing same - sex marriages .
The court ’s vote on whether Proposition 8 is an impermissible revision , for example , will probably differ from its vote on whether existing marriages should continue to be recognized by the state .
Justices who disagree with the majority file dissents .
If they agree with only part of the majority decision , they file an opinion called a partial concurrence and dissent .
During oral argument in March , every justice expressed support for upholding existing marriages .
Justice Carlos M. Moreno indicated he believed Proposition 8 was an illegal revision , indicating he would dissent on that question
Moreno might be joined by Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar , a former civil rights lawyer who stressed the court was dealing with a novel legal question .
Werdegar , however , did not join Moreno in voting to put the measure on hold pending the court ’s ruling .

Press release
March 20 , 2009 Press releaseMarch 20 , 2009
At Monday night ’s meeting of the Albany County Legislature , Legislators PhillipSteck ( D ) , Douglas Bullock ( D ) and Wanda Willingham ( D ) introduced Local Law “ A ” , a proposal that would regulate the purchase of ammunition in Albany County .
Local Law “ A ” would require that a valid firearms license be shown when purchasing ammunition .
The law would also mandate that retailers keep a record of ammunition sales , including the type , caliber , and quantity of the ammunition , make , model and serial number of the firearm it is for , as well as the purchaser ’s name and address .
As if that is not enough , Local Law “ A ” would also create a secondary method of gun registration for both long guns and handguns .
Local Law “ A ” has been sent to the Law Committee .
[ efoods ]
Congress has tried ammunition registration in the past , only to discover that it was not only ineffective for law enforcement , but also completely unmanageable due to the sheer volume of transactions .
Ammunition registration creates huge record keeping requirements and provides no useful benefits for law enforcement ; which is why it was repealed under the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 .
Please contact the members of the Law Committee and the County Legislators TODAY and respectfully voice your opposition to Local Law “ A. ” Contact information for the members of the Law Committee can be found below .
County Legislators can be reached by phone at ( 518 ) 447-7168 or fax ( 518 ) 447-5695 .

A schoolboy cricketer was recovering in hospital today after being floored by a drive from England batsman Kevin Pietersen .
Reece Topley , 15 , was bowling at the star as part of a practice session at Loughborough University , Leicestershire , held yesterday .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But Pietersen hit one delivery straight back at the 6ft 6in teenager , hitting him in the ear and knocking him to the ground .
Reece , an emerging talent who attends the Royal Hospital School , in Holbrook , Suffolk , had been invited to bowl at the England batsmen as part of the team 's preparations for the ICC World Twenty 20 competition .
Reece 's father , Don , 45 , a former Essex cricketer , said : " Certainly there was a bit of pain and a bit of shock but it could 've been a lot worse . "
Don said his son , who had a " few " stitches inserted into his wound last night , remained at the Leicester Royal Infirmary Hospital and was undergoing tests today .
" In a light - hearted moment last night in the hospital , I did suggest to Reece that he might have dropped a catch - to which he replied : ' I think I stopped it going for six , " ' said Don .
He added that Pietersen had been concerned about the injury and had left a signed bat for Reece to collect at the university .
" Kevin Pietersen has always been Reece 's favourite cricketer , " said Don .
" I 'm sure that will remain the case if Reece gets this bat . "

PETER GUZLI'S TOURIST SNAPSHOTS
THE " DOOMED " TOURIST GUY
THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE
Peter Guzli's private prank goes awry -- and global
In late 1997 , Peter Guzli , a man from Budapest , Hungary , was living in the United States .
He worked at a hotel in Colorado Springs , Colorado , and in November of that year went to New York City to vacation and to visit relatives .
On a chilly 28 November , he went the World Trade Center , still one of the largest buildings on earth .
He took the elevator in WTC 2 ( south tower ) to the 107th floor observation deck , and eventually to the rooftop .
He wore a ski coat and stocking cap against the late autumn cold .
Like millions of tourists who had made the popular stop since 1974 , Guzli took photographs of the miniature Big Apple , and the sight of the north tower .
He shot a picture of himself with a Manhattan panorama as a backdrop .
Eventually Guzli returned to his homeland , his photographs in tow .
They were put away -- until nearly four years later when the structure he visited was destroyed .
Guzli remembered his time in the US and his trip to New York .
He was flipping through his photos , and one of him standing by the railing caught his eye .
Exercising " gallows humor , " Guzli pulled the picture into a graphic editing program .
He found a picture of a Boeing 757 with American Airlines livery , shot by Jonathan Derden at Dallas - Fort Worth International Airport .
Derden 's photo was part of a massive database of aircraft photography mainatined by Airliners .
net .
Through digital manipulation , Guzli placed the jet in the air behind himself , looking for all the world as if it were coming at WTC 2 .
He added a 09 - 11-01 date stamp and e-mailed the image to a few friends .
It was supposed to be a private joke , a riff of dark humor in an anxious time .
One of Guzli 's friends apparently took it too far .
The photo was forwarded to other people , and in the common chain reaction that is e-mail , the apparently doomed tourist was soon worldwide .
The following message was included in e-mails :
We 've seen thousands of pictures concerning the attack .
However , this one will make you cringe .
A simple tourist getting himself photographed on the top of the WTC just seconds before the tragedy ... the camera was found in the rubble !!
In the heady , fearsome days just following 11 September , the Guzli image became one more urban myth -- but unfortunately some people believed the e-mail and picture .
This is one major reason that the bogus tourist photo received such distribution .
Another was the skeptics , who simply could not believe that a digital camera could survive the collapse of a 110 - story building and tons of steel and concrete .
While some believed , the doubters were quick to discredit the photos .
Among some of their arguments :
The high in New York City on 11 September was about 72 degrees Fahrenheit , yet the tourist is wearing a heavy coat and hat .
The WTC observation deck was in the south tower .
It was struck by United Airlines Flight 175 .
The American Airlines jet , Flight 11 , hit the north tower , which had a restaurant at the top ( Windows on the World ) , but no decks .
The jet is remarkably clear -- a miracle camera with a high - speed shutter ?
A real photo would have shown a silvery blur .
The jet is a Boeing 757 .
Flights 11 and 175 were both Boeing 767s .
The jet is coming from the north , but Flight 175 had come in from the south .
The post - Labor Day hours for the WTC observation deck were 9:30 a.m. - 9:30 p.m.
Flight 175 hit the south tour at 9:03 a.m. before the deck even opened .
The digital date stamp looks phony .
The Derden jet photo
After the photo was quickly ruled a fraud , it still found minor fame on the Internet and was taken to bizarre new avenues of humor .
The unknown man was dubbed " Tourist Guy " and " Tourist of Death . "
Other graphic artists of varying skills began to insert him , Forrest Gump or Zelig - style , into other events at history .
Therefore , a man born in 1976 saw the RMS Titanic depart for her maiden voyage in April 1912 , witnessed the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurt , New Jersey , in May 1937 .
He also showed up when the USS Cole was rammed with a suicide boat in Yemen in October 2000 .
Tourist Guy was then blended with yet another obscure pop culture reference : " All your base are belong to us . "
This crude phrase came from the introductory screen of a Japanese videogame , Zero Wing , that had been poorly translated into English for US distribution .
A villain named Cats appears on the bridge of a rebel starship and declares to the hero that his forces have been defeated .
He adds : " All your base are belong to us . "
This oddball phrase began appearing in digitally altered photos , on billboards , highway signs , storefronts , etc. Tourist Guy was added to the mix when a techno song called , appropriately " All Your Base Are Belong to Us " was added to a Flash movie of Tourist Guy novelty images .
There was a commonality of both the Tourist Guy and the phrase " All your base ... " popping up incongruously in images .
By November 2001 , people were asking , " Who is the Tourist Guy ? "
Penteado
Initially Jose Roberto Penteado , a 41 - year - old businessman from Campinas , Sao Paulo state , Brazil , said he was the man .
He claimed some of his friends took his head and added to a picture of another person visiting the WTC .
Penteado certainly resembled the fellow in the picture .
People began to believe him , and Volkswagen 's Brazilian subsidiary seriously considered making a TV commercial with him .
At the same time , as Penteado was making the rounds , Guzli 's friends went to Index , a Hungarian Web news site , wanting the truth about Tourist Guy brought to light .
Eventually , the 25 - year - old man was tracked down , last name and all , in Budapest .
In December , Peter Guzli finally came clean .
He went to his parents ' house and found the unaltered deck shot , as well as the other two ( north tower and holding camera ) .
Guzli e-mailed the photographs shown on this page to Wired News , using only his first name .
" I 'd like to keep my identity incognito , " he said to Wired .
" This was a joke meant for my friends , not such a wide audience . "
Guzli said he did not rush to claim Tourist Guy 's identity because he was aware of the mockery that other Web celebs had endured -- for example , accordionist Mahir Cagri , who became known as the " Lovesick Turk " in 1999 after he posted a home page that included an invitation for women to visit him .
Guzli's photos were proof enough for Penteado to withdraw his claim and slip quietly back into obscurity .
Volkswagen decided against the commercial before Guzli even surfaced , feeling an ad with a guy associated with 11 September was not in the best taste .
" Now I believe that the real person showed up , " Penteado said in an e-mail to Wired .
" I think I have a brother in Hungary , and I did n't know . "
Tourist Guy Web sites and urban myth repositories carry Guzli's photo to this day .
They show how the ludicrous can become maybe too macabre and be taken too seriously .

The Dark River to Antares
Credit & Copyright : Jason Jennings
Explanation : Connecting the Pipe Nebula to the colorful region near bright star Antares is a dark cloud dubbed the Dark River , flowing from the picture 's left edge .
Murky looking , the Dark River 's appearance is caused by dust obscuring background starlight , although the dark nebula contains mostly hydrogen and molecular gas .
Surrounded by dust , Antares , a red supergiant star , creates an unusual bright yellowish reflection nebula .
Above it , bright blue double star Rho Ophiuchi is embedded in one of the more typical bluish reflection nebulae , while red emission nebulae are also scattered around the region .
Globular star cluster M4 is just seen above and right of Antares , though it lies far behind the colorful clouds , at a distance of some 7,000 light - years .
The Dark River itself is about 500 light years away .
The colorful skyscape is a mosaic of telescopic images spanning nearly 10 degrees ( 20 Full Moons ) across the sky in the constellation Scorpius .
The Tories have opened a commanding 18 - point lead over Labour , enough to put David Cameron into Downing Street with a general election majority of more than 150 , according to the latest ComRes poll for The Independent .
The survey puts the Conservatives on 42 per cent ( up six points on last month ) , Labour on 24 per cent ( down one ) , the Liberal Democrats on 18 per cent ( down one ) and other parties on 16 per cent ( down four , if still high ) .
The Tory surge will deal a further blow to Labour morale after a torrid spell for Gordon Brown which culminated in the party 's heavy defeat in last week 's Norwich North by - election .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Repeated at a general election , the results would give Mr Cameron a Commons majority of 152 and mean that many prominent Labour figures lose their parliamentary seats .
The increase in the Conservative lead from 11 to 18 points since last month suggests its strategy of stressing the need for spending cuts in the face of the economic crisis is chiming with the public .
It is also a setback for Mr Brown 's hopes of rebuilding Labour 's popularity after seeing off a leadership coup and bringing in reforms to the Commons after the expenses scandal .
The party 's support has been mired in the low to mid 20s for months , with only the slightest sign of recovery .
By contrast the Tories have achieved their highest level of support since April , indicating that they have recovered from the impact of the disclosure of some of their backbenchers ' expenses claims .
It is crucial for them to break through the 40 - point mark to be on course for a convincing victory at a general election .
Backing for the Liberal Democrats remains broadly static , although the party will argue that it is a high base from which to mount a general election campaign , during the course of which its support tends to rise .
Reflecting widespread disillusionment for mainstream politicians , support for other parties remains high among the electorate .
Their 16 per cent backing includes 8 per cent for the Green Party , 5 per cent for Ukip and 1 per cent for the British National Party .
Mr Brown 's woes are underlined by the finding that just 59 per cent of voters who backed Labour at the last election still say they support the party .
That compares with 94 per cent of previous
Tory voters who say they intend to support Mr Cameron at the next election .

The Tory leader goes on holiday to France this week , leaving the shadow Chancellor George Osborne and the shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague to deputise for him .
The party plans a series of themed weeks – concentrating on such issues as crime , health and education – over the summer .
Senior shadow ministers are also working on a series of Green Papers designed to flesh out policies in the party 's general election manifesto .
They have been asked to identify spending areas where cash can be saved .
Despite the Tories ' victory in Norwich North , the result carried some warning signs for the party .
Its share of the vote there , at less than 40 per cent , was read as evidence of a continuing lack of enthusiasm for the Tories despite the deep hostility to the Government .
Mr Cameron has admitted his party has yet to " seal the deal " with the electorate , and he wants to urgently deepen , as well as widen , Tory support .
Mr Brown , meanwhile , has also called for a flurry of government activity over the summer to counter accusations that his administration is drifting .
Although he is nominally on holiday in Scotland , he is in daily contact with Downing Street and has issued two press statements in the past two days .
His advisers hope that the Labour conference in September will enable him to get back on the front foot , although continuing dismal poll ratings could reignite mutterings against his leadership .
For the moment , however , there is no sign of any appetite among demoralised Labour MPs for reopening the leadership issue .
The launch of Labour 's much - trumpeted national plan , " Building Britain 's Future " , appears to have had little impact on the public .
Ministers are now pinning their hopes that glimmers of an end to the recession will enable them to argue that Mr Brown put in place the building - blocks of recovery and that the election of a Conservative government would threaten that .
One cabinet minister told The Independent : " We have to keep banging away at that message .
It is very hard going , but what 's the alternative – give up and go home ? "
Ministers also hope that the increasingly likelihood of a Tory victory in the election expected next May will increase scrutiny of opposition policies , allowing Labour to go on the attack against Mr Cameron .
ComRes interviewed 1,008 adults on 24 - 26 July .
Data was weighted to be representative of all adults .
Full details at www.comres.co.uk
How poll translates to election result
General election forecasts are made by applying the shifts in party support in opinion polls and applying them to the national political map .
Today 's ComRes survey suggests a swing of some 10.5 per cent from Labour to the Conservatives .
Replicated nationally , that would produce a Parliament containing 401 Tories , 178 Labour MPs and 41 Liberal Democrats .
David Cameron would preside over a majority of 152 .
Cabinet ministers Jack Straw , Alistair Darling and Ben Bradshaw would be among the Labour MPs given marching orders by the electorate .

At my job we have need of a high - performance hash lookup database in our antispam product .
It 's used to store Bayes tokens for quick lookups on individual scanning systems , and is read - only in the fast path ( mail scanning ) with updates taking place in another process .
For the last few years , we 've been using a plain old Berkeley DB hash database via Perl 's DB_File , but with all the hype about Tokyo Cabinet and its benchmark results I figured it was time to take a look .
The first thing I did was to run the TC benchmark suite on my system , and wow , it was fast .
Just like it says on the box , 100 % as - advertised .
Next , I hacked up a quick script to import our Roaring Penguin Training Network data -- approximately 11 M keys , as variable - length character strings , pointing to small bits of data for each .
Unfortunately , TC did n't do well .
After about a half hour , I was still only halfway through the data import , and each successive addition of 100 k keys was taking noticeably longer as time went on .
A few minutes of poking around on various forums and reading docs led me to some tuning parameters that got me down to a database creation time of about 30 minutes .
Much better than before , but it still paled in comparison to the Berkeley DB hash database creation time of about five minutes .
Some of those forum posts about tuning mentioned CDB as another alternative .
CDB is a constant database ( ie : non-updateable ) so it 's not really comparable to TC or BDB in the general case , but for our workload it would fit .
So ... with three databases to choose from , it 's time for some comparison benchmarks .
The Setup
The benchmarking tool was written in Perl , using DB_File , CDB_File , and the TokyoCabinet module .
The data for benchmarking was the uncompressed RPTN data from April 24 , comprised of 11004950 keys pointing to an encoded string containing spam , ham , and generation counts .
Writes were performed to a separate ext2 partition to avoid any journalling overhead .
The following tuning parameters were used on creation :
BerkeleyDB Hash cachesize of 96MB ( what we currently use in production )
BerkeleyDB BTree cachesize of 96MB ( I was lazy and did n't want to tune it , so it 's copied from the Hash testcase )
CDB
No tuning
Tokyo Cabinet Hash xmsiz value of 750MB ( necessary to make it complete in under an hour ) cache value of 12000000 ( same )
No tuning was performed for reads .

As can be seen from those results , CDB kills all comers in this simulation of our normal workload .
Perhaps there are ways to tune Tokyo Cabinet to perform better on large data sets ?
Based on this , I 'll be running more realistic tests on CDB to see if we can get those sorts of numbers in production .
As a GeekDad who also works in the space program , I often think about all of the myths and conspiracies associated with space exploration and how I will ensure that my Geekling will be brought up with the ability to separate the sand from the moon dust .
With the current celebration of the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11 , I thought it would be a great time to arm other Geek parents with the ammunition they need to address the moon - landing hoax theories .
One of the best resources out there is the Bad Astronomy blog , written by Phil Plait .
Mr. Plait works very hard at separating the truth from the various myths people take as the truth .
In 2001 , he wrote an extensive rebuttal to the Fox program " Conspiracy Theory : Did We Land on the Moon ? "
It addresses , point - for - point , the inaccurate conspiracy theories , which Fox presented with an eye toward sensationalism rather than journalistic integrity .
He continues to write to keep the public informed of the truth at Bad Astronomy .
I am sure many of our readers watch MythBusters on the Discovery Channel .
Last summer , a MythBusters episode addressed some of the big theories of why the moon landing was faked , as well as some things that are true but people commonly believe are a myth .
Actually , one of the things they proved to be true is n’t very controversial .
They showed that a feather and a hammer fall at the same rate in a vacuum .
Generally no controversy there , but who does n’t love to see Newton in action ?
The team had the support of NASA in making this show and was able to utilize resources at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center .
They also had the support of the Zero G Corporation and the Apache Point Observatory .
A Wikipedia entry sums up the myths and the show results .
Of course the real fun is watching the show and seeing the wonderful team Myth Busters team do their thing .
Very recently , the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) captured the best images yet of the Apollo landing sites since the astronauts walked on the surface .
I enjoyed these images as I had the pleasure of watching the process of LRO being assembled in a cleanroom at the Goddard Space Flight Center .
NASA has released those images for the world to see .
My favorite image released is of the Apollo 14 landing site , where you can actually see the trail of footprints from the landing site out to the location where some of the scientific experiments were performed .
Astronaut at the LEM
There are many other good websites that fight against the conspiracies with solid information and can be found through some simple web searches .
The greatest injustice of all in these myths remaining out there is the way in which they diminish the great work done by the brave astronauts who went to the moon and the men and women who supported the development of the program and the missions .
Thank you to all of you who made the moon landings possible .
Thank you to all of those who worked the predecessor missions of Mercury and Gemini that blazed a trail to the moon .
Finally , thank you to the astronauts who made the trek to the moon and helped mankind make that one giant leap .
Mankind has the honor of quite possibly being the most destructive force to ever hit mother nature .
This list looks at some of the more recent , probably lesser known extinctions that humans have lent a helping hand to .
Whether by over hunting or over population , driving a species to extinction is nothing to be proud of and it ’s certainly not slowing down .
10 Thylacine
Commonly known as the Tasmanian Tiger , the Thylacine was the largest known carnivorous marsupial of modern times .
Virtually wiped out in the wild due to constant hunting ( they were thought to be a threat to sheep and other small farm animals ) and the encroachment of humans on their already limited habitat the Thylacine was finally recognized as being in danger of becoming extinct in 1936 , too little , too late as that same year the last Thylacine , named Benjamin , died on 7 September as the result of neglect — locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters and exposed to freezing temperatures at night in Hobart Zoo , Tasmania .
60 years on there are still claims of sightings but all are yet to be confirmed .
9 Quagga
The Quagga was a southern subspecies of the Plains Zebra .
It differed from other zebras mainly in having stripes on the head , neck , and front portion of its body only , and having brownish , rather than white , on its upper parts .
The last free Quaggas may have been caught in 1870 .
The last captive Quagga , a mare , died on 12 August 1883 in Amsterdam Zoo , where she had lived since 9 May 1867 .
It was not realized that this Quagga mare was the very last of her kind .
Because of the confusion caused by the indiscriminate use of the term “ Quagga ” for any zebra , the true Quagga was hunted to extinction without this being realized until many years later .
The Quagga became extinct because it was ruthlessly hunted down for meat and leather by South African farmers , also they were seen by the settlers as competitors , like other wild grass eating animals , for their livestock , mainly sheep and goats .
8 Passenger Pigeon
The story of the Passenger Pigeon is one of the most tragic extinction stories in modern times .
As recently as around 200 years ago they were n’t anywhere near extinction .
In fact , they were actually the most common bird in North America , and some reports counted single flocks numbering in the billions .
Pigeon meat was commercialized and recognized as cheap food , especially for slaves and the poor , which led to a hunting campaign on a massive scale .
Furthermore , due to the large size of their flocks , the birds were seen as a threat to farmers .
The last Passenger Pigeon , named Martha , died alone at the Cincinnati Zoo at about 1:00 pm on September 1 , 1914 .
7 Golden Toad
The first record of the Golden Toad was by herpetologist Jay Savage in 1966 .
The toad , recognized by its brilliant golden orange color , was native to the tropical cloud forests which surround Monteverde , Costa Rica .
None have been seen since 1989 .
It last bred in normal numbers in 1987 , and its breeding sites were well known .
In 1987 , due to erratic weather , the pools dried up before the larva had matured .
Out of potential 30,000 toads , only 29 had survived .
In 1988 , only eight males and two females could be located .
In 1989 , a single male was found , this was the last record of the species .
Extensive searches since this time have failed to produce any more records of the golden toad .
6 Caribbean Monk Seal
The Caribbean Monk Seal was the only known seal which was native to the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico .
It is also the only species of seal to go extinct directly due to human causes .
The Caribbean monk seal was the first New World mammal to be discovered by Columbus and his company on the coast of Santo Domingo in 1494 .
It appears in the account of Columbus ’ second voyage to America .
Columbus promptly ordered his crew to kill eight of the animals , which he called “ sea - wolves ” , for food , paving the way for exploitation of the species by European immigrants who came in his wake .
Since then , the once abundant seals have been hunted for their oil and slaughtered by fishermen , who regarded the animals as competitors .
It was officially declared extinct just last year , on June 6th , 2008 , although the last recorded account of the species was made at Serranilla Bank between Honduras and Jamaica in 1952 .
Like other true seals , the Caribbean Monk Seal was sluggish on land .
This , along with its lack of fear for man , unaggressive and curious behavior , as well as human hunting , and early habitat exclusion by humans throughout their range may have dramatically speed up their decline and likely contributed to its demise .
5 Pyrenean Ibex
The Pyrenean Ibex has one of the more interesting stories among extinct animals , since it was the first species to ever be brought back into existence via cloning , only to go extinct again just seven minutes after being born due to lung failure .
The Pyrenean Ibex was native to the Pyrenees , a mountain range in Andorra , France and Spain .
The Pyrenean ibex was still abundant in the fourteenth century ( Day 1981 ) .
The Pyrenean ibex ’s population declined due to a “ slow but continuous persecution ” and disappeared from the French Pyrenees and the eastern Cantabrian mountain range by the mid-nineteenth century .
Its situation has been critical since the beginning of the 20th century , when it was estimated that the Pyrenean population in Spain numbered only about 100 individuals .
Since the beginning of the 20th century , the population never rose above 40 individuals .
In 1981 , the population was reported to be 30 .
At the end of the 1980 ’s the population size was estimated at 6 - 14 individuals .
The last naturally born Pyrenean Ibex , named Celia , died on January 6th , 2000 , after being found dead under a fallen tree at the age of 13 .
That animal ’s only companion had died just a year earlier due to old age .
4 Bubal Hartebeest
Although it once roamed throughout Northern Africa and the Middle East , the deep - rooted mythology ( once domesticated by the ancient Egyptians as a food source and for sacrificial purposes ) which surrounded the animal was not enough to save it from European hunters who began hunting them for recreation and meat .
People who resided in Morocco shot these animals for fun , and for hunting , which wiped large herds of them out .
Many Hartebeests were captured and were kept alive ( e.g. in the London Zoo from 1883 to 1907 ) , but they eventually died out .
The last Bubal Hartebeest was probably a female which died in the Paris Zoo in 1923 .
3 Javan Tiger
Javan Tigers were a subspecies of tigers which were limited to the Indonesian island of Java .
In the early 19th century Javan tigers were so common , that in some areas they were considered nothing more than pests .
As the human population increased , large parts of the island were cultivated , leading to a severe reduction of their natural habitat .
Wherever man moved in , the Javan tigers were ruthlessly hunted down or poisoned .
Natives carried much of the hunting out , a surprising thing since they considered the tiger a reincarnation of their dead relatives .
The last specimen to have been seen was sighted in 1972 , although there is evidence from track counts that the animal had lingered into the 1980’s .
The last track counts to yield evidence of the tigers was held in 1979 , when just three tigers were identified .
The leading cause of their extinction was agricultural encroachment and habitat loss , which continues to be a serious concern in Java .
2 Tecopa Pupfish
The Tecopa Pupfish was native in the Mojave Desert , in Inyo County , California , United States of America .
This fish subspecies was originally found only in the outflows of North and South Tecopa Hot Springs .
It was first described by Robert Rush Miller in 1948 .
Its decline began in the early 1940s when the northern and the southern spring which were about 10 yards apart were made into canals and bathhouses were build .
The popularity of Tecopa Hot Springs in the 1950s and 1960s led to the building of hotels and trailer parks in that area .
By 1981 the Tecopa Pupfish was officially delisted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and it became the first animal which was officially declared extinct according to the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 .
1 Baiji River Dolphin
The Baiji population declined drastically in recent decades as China industrialized and made heavy use of the river for fishing , transportation , and hydroelectricity .
As China developed economically , pressure on the river dolphin grew significantly .
Industrial and residential waste flowed into the Yangtze .
The riverbed was dredged and reinforced with concrete in many locations .
Ship traffic multiplied , boats grew in size , and fishermen employed wider and more lethal nets .
Noise pollution caused the nearly blind animal to collide with propellers .
In the 1970s and 1980s , an estimated half of Baiji deaths were attributed to entanglement in fishing gear .
Only a few hundred were left by 1970 .
Then the number dropped down to 400 by the 1980s and then to 13 in 1997 when a full - fledged search was conducted .
The dolphin was declared functionally extinct after an expedition late in 2006 failed to record a single individual after an extensive search of the animal ’s entire range .
Investigators are trying to determine what caused the hole
Enlarge Image
The US carrier Southwest Airlines has inspected about 200 planes after a hole opened up in the passenger cabin during a flight , forcing an emergency landing .
The one - foot - square ( 30cmx30 cm ) hole appeared as the Boeing 737 was flying from Nashville to Baltimore on Monday .
Passenger Brian Cunningham told NBC television he had been woken up by " the loudest roar I 'd ever heard " , and saw the hole above his seat .
People then calmly put on oxygen masks , he said .
No -one was injured .
The plane , with 131 passengers and crew on board , made the emergency landing in Charleston , West Virginia .
" After we landed ... the pilot came out and looked up through the hole , and everybody applauded , shook his hand , a couple of people gave him hugs , " Mr Cunningham said .
The cause of the damage is not known .
On Tuesday Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis told the Associated Press news agency that the airline had inspected 200 Boeing 737-300 jets across the country overnight .
No similar problem was identified and Southwest is operating a normal schedule of flights , she said .
It ’s time we came to grips with the fact that not every “ document ” can be a “ web page . ”
Some forms of writing just cannot be expressed in HTML — or they need to be bent and distorted to do so .
But for once , XML might actually help .
Article Continues Below
The creation myth of the web tells us that Tim Berners - Lee invented HTML as a means of publishing physics research papers .
True ?
It does n’t matter ; it ’s a founding legend of the web whose legacy continues to this day .
You can gin up as many web applications as you want , but the web is mostly still a place to publish documents .
The web is replete with projects to “ digitize legacy content ” — patent applications , books , photographs , everything .
While photographs might survive well as JPEGs or TIFFs ( disregarding accessibility issues for a moment ) , the bulk of this legacy content requires semantic markup for computers to understand it .
A sheet of paper provides complete authorial freedom , but that freedom can translate poorly to the coarse semantics of HTML .
The digitization craze — that ’s what it is — crashes headlong into HTML semantics .
Some documents cannot be published using HTML .
In many cases , we should n’t even bother trying .
In other cases , we have to radically change the appearance and structure of the document .
Ideally , we ’ll start using custom XML document types — which , finally and at long last , might actually work .
The screenplay problem#section2
An example of the conundrum of transferring print documents to the web , one that has become legendary in some circles , is the film screenplay .
A lot of people want to write a screenplay .
The outcomes for most of these writers are the same : Nobody films and releases their movie .
And they all go through the same phase — learning the generations - old “ style ” of screenplay formatting .
Typewritten screenplay from Die Hard 2 .
Originating in the typewriter age , screenplay layouts are custom - engineered so that one printed page ( in what we now call U.S. letter size ) equals almost exactly one minute of onscreen time .
Since most commercial movies run about two hours in length , typical Hollywood movie scripts are 118 to 122 pages long .
Typography is lousy ; old typewriter fonts of yesteryear were errantly mapped onto today ’s spindly Courier type .
But as an example of document engineering , scripts are brilliant .
There ’s an entire science involved in text indention .
Text is rarely , if ever , “ centered ” ; everything lines up at a tab stop , a concept that CSS expunges from the collective memory .
( You could set left margins using the ch unit in CSS3 , but nobody does . )
, a concept that CSS expunges from the collective memory .
( You could set left margins using the unit in CSS3 , but nobody does . )
With careful alignments like these , it ’s easy to scan down a screenplay page .
Semantic use of ALL CAPITALS aids scanning , and clearly does not live up to the purely mechanical name CSS gives it , “ text - transform . ”
And now people want to transfer the format — intact — to the web .
It ’s not going to work .
Web “ pages ” may be called that , but the term is metaphorical .
It has nothing to do with sheets of paper that equate to screen time .
( Right away that means a shooting script ’s many headers and footers would disappear , since we ’re dealing with only one “ page . ” )
Nobody seriously intends screenplays on the web to have the same function they do in real life — getting read , getting optioned or bought , and getting shot .
All of that happens on paper , not on Firefox .
HTML ( per se ) is not extensible .
Extensible HTML ( XHTML ) has really not been extended .
Hence the following truism is not going to change : HTML does not have enough tags for the semantics of screenplays , where nearly everything needs its own tag .
Dialogue seems to be no problem , but dialogue is intermingled with screen and actor instructions , and in HTML both of those would just be placed in paragraph elements — even though the function , and expected appearance , differ drastically .
What about the myriad headings , including the names of people speaking and notations for the time of day and the manner of speech ( often called slugs or sluglines ) ?
We have “ a lot ” of heading tags in HTML — six of them — but they are arranged hierarchically , not according to function .
Would class names really suffice here — that is , H2 class= “ slugline ” versus H2 class=“ charactername ” ?
Really , the answer is no .
Script headings and HTML headings are two different things .
The real movie industry does n’t need HTML in the first place ; it already has viable electronic exchange formats for scripts .
One is the proprietary format of Final Draft , the software that dominates the screenplay market the way MS Word dominates in offices .
Open - source fanatics may look at this as one more delicious chance to inveigh against a proprietary format , but screenwriters have better things to worry about than open source .
Anyway , Final Draft 8 ’s default document format is now XML .
The other is PDF .
The movie business does n’t have to care about accessibility , so even PDFs to which no accessibility features have been added suffice for script exchange .
You do n’t need tagged PDF , which also does n’t have enough semantics for screenplays .
( You could , in theory , write your own PDF tags , since they ’re just XML . )
The quest to adapt scripts to the web recalls other “ category errors , ” to use Martin Amis ’s phrase .
Electronic commerce , we eventually figured out , does not take the form of “ shopping malls ” you “ walk ” through .
“ Magazines ” and “ catalogues ” do not have discrete pages you flip ( complete with sound effects ) and dog-ear .
“ Web sites ” do not look like magazine layouts , complete with multicolumn text and callouts .
Tellingly , this quest recalls early television , which , conventional wisdom holds , behaved more like filmed stageplays .
Bringing scripts to the web is noticeably worse than filming a stageplay .
Now , people have tried to make web pages look exactly like typewritten screenplays .
The star of this show is screenwriter and inveterate blogger John August .
Scrippets , August ’s plug - in for WordPress , Blogger , and other systems , does everything it can to spin straw into gold .
Among other things , one of August ’s use cases is perfect “ screenplay ” formatting when viewed in an RSS reader , and the only way to make that happen is through presentational HTML and inline styles .
These are , of course , outmoded development methods .
August pitches his project thus ( emphasis added ) : “ With Scrippets , you can add boxes of nicely - formatted script to your blog . ”
That ’s actually a restatement of the problem — failed reliance on a page metaphor , failed efforts to duplicate typewriter typography , and failed attempts to replicate one - page - per- minute layout .
Script formatting is “ nice ” for print , but it ’s wrong for the web — even for “ little boxes ” of script content .
Worse , Scrippets ignores whatever small contribution HTML semantics can offer in marking up a screenplay .
Pretty much everything gets marked up as paragraphs , but not everything is a paragraph .
This is a worse sin than loading up H2 s with class names in an uphill battle to notate screenplay semantics .
The screenplay solution #section3
The way to adapt scripts for the web is through cosmetic surgery .
And we have a precedent for it .
There ’s a healthy market for screenplays published in book form .
In fact , “ the shooting script ” is an actual U.S. trademark ( from Newmarket Press ) for one series of book versions of movie screenplays .
Some books just reprint typewritten screenplays at reduced size .
This may make you feel like a pro , but what you should feel is cheated :
You ’re paying good money to read an author ’s typewritten manuscript .
Spindly Courier looks even worse in reduced size .
Other books completely redesign typewritten screenplays into a design native to book publishing .
In a typical layout , speaker names are run inline with dialogue , normal book margins are used , and there ’s a huge compaction of vertical whitespace .
Typewritten screenplays read quite well in their intended context — but so do screenplay books in their context .
( Retypeset scripts have also been used as language - learning aids . )
Hence to adapt this existing printed form to the web , you have to abandon all hope of duplicating original typescript formatting .
You have to design something native to the web , with its relatively weak semantics and pageless or single - page architecture .
You could use HTML definition lists to mark up dialogue — explicitly permitted in ( W3C - brand ) HTML , explicitly banned by Ian Hickson under HTML5 .
( There , use DIALOG instead , even though the descendants of that tag , DT and DD , are the same descendants DL has . )
instead , even though the descendants of that tag , and , are the same descendants has . )
You can use PRE to fake indention and line breaks ( but you ca n’t fake the division of a script into pages ) .
to fake indention and line breaks ( but you ca n’t fake the division of a script into pages ) .
You can disregard text indention and just use CENTER ed text .
ed text .
You could , without too much of a stretch , mark up a script as a table .
You could just not bother too much with semantics , run character names ( in bold or STRONG ) inline with dialogue , and use HTML headings where feasible .
Other print formats that need transformation #section4
Mastheads :
The list of who does what at a magazine or newspaper is actually semantically complex , because each person ’s title or the department they work in seems to be a heading .
But a masthead marked up with H1 through H6 essentially pollutes the tag stream of the surrounding web page .

But a masthead marked up with through essentially pollutes the tag stream of the surrounding web page .
Callouts and sidebars :
These structures , familiar from magazines , newspapers , and nonfiction books , cause serious confusion in creating a functioning document tree .
( At what exact point in the tag stream are you expected to read the callout or sidebar ? )

Footnotes :
There is n’t a structure for footnotes in HTML ( though there is in tagged PDF ) .
Developers have tried all sorts of hacks , including JavaScript show / hide widgets and various rats ’ nests of links and reverse links .
For literature fans , HTML ’s lack of footnotes makes the work of the late David Foster Wallace functionally impossible to render on the web ( especially his footnotes within footnotes ) .

With origins commonly attributed to Spy , a charticle is an illustrated featurette with a lot more accompanying text than what a bare illustration has .
By way of comparison , a Flickr photo festooned with notes is functionally identical to a charticle , but HTML has no semantics for it .

Math and science :
Yes , that old chestnut .
Before you exclaim “ MathML ! ” the way a pensioner might yell out “ Bingo ! , ” understand that barely anybody uses MathML on real web pages due to serious authoring difficulty — physicist Jacques Distler remains among the very few who do .
How do we solve the problem ?
#section5
Armed with this knowledge , what are we going to do ?
Prediction : nothing .
People will continue to fake the appearance of scripts and use John August ” “ caliber presentational code .
But we do have an alternative .
The case typified by screenplays is merely a new variation of the difficulty of encoding literature in XML .
People have tried it time and time again over the years , but barely any DTD has gotten traction .
People just want to mark up everything in HTML ( which has staying power ) .
Ill - trained authors mark up everything as a paragraph or a DIV .
People seem to have taken the catchphrase “ HTML is the lingua franca of the web ” a bit too literally .
HTML derives from SGML ; XHTML is XML in a new pair of shoes .
That ’s four kinds of markup right there , but everybody acts as though there is only one kind , HTML .
( Most of the time , browsers act like XTHML is HTML with trailing slashes . )
Even electronic books are marked up as HTML , as the ePub file format is essentially XHTML 1.1 inside a container file — but that makes ePub files simultaneously HTML and XML .
If we can spit those out , why ca n’t we spit out other kinds of XML ?
We are well past the stage where browsers could not be expected to display valid , well - formed XML .
Browsers can now do exactly that .
Variant literary document types could actually work now .
But because they languished on the vine for so long , now it seems nobody wants to make them work .
After all , is n’t our new future wrapped up in HTML5 ?
Just as our old future was wrapped up in XHTML2 ?
The web is , of course , a wondrous thing , but its underlying language lacks the vocabulary to express even the things that humans have already expressed elsewhere .
We ought to accept that some documents have to be reformatted for the web , at least if the goal is using plain HTML .
To give web documents the rich semantics of print documents , XML is finally a viable option .
North Korea test fires four short - range missiles
North Korea , in a move that seemingly plays against the United Nations ‘ sanctions for the recent nuclear tests in Pyongyang , have fired four short - range missiles towards its east coast Thursday .
All four missiles were fired within a timeframe of four hours .
The missiles were classed as surface - to - ship missiles , with a range of about 60 miles , and were fired from the city of Wonsan .
“ It ’s not a good sign because they are demonstrating their military power , ” said South Korea Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan .
North Korea has also been threatening to fire an intercontinental ballistic missile towards the direction of Hawaii .
The US has started bolstering their defenses in the area .
Suspicions arose when a North Korean ballistics ship which was being monitored suddenly changed course and directed itself back home , after being in US surveillance .
The ship was suspected of carrying illicit weapons .
North Korea has declared that any interception of their ships was equivalent to a declaration of war .
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
In Meat Wagon , we round up the latest outrages of the meat and livestock industries .
Sometimes I think I write a little too much about the meat industry .
But the news it generates is so consistently grave , and so generally underreported , that I ca n’t resist .
Moreover , outbreaks of E. coli and MRSA are really ecological markers –feedback that our way of producing meat is deeply unsustainable and really quite dangerous .
We ignore these news flashes from our ecoystem at our peril .
So I scribble on .
Here ’s the latest :
In Colorado , 14 people have fallen ill from hamburger meat tainted with antibiotic - resistent salmonella , the Boulder newspaper Daily Camera reports .
( Note that antibiotic - resistent salmonella is distinct from MRSA , an antibiotic - resistant staph infection , increasingly associated with industrial meat production , that kills 20,000 Americans each year–more than AIDS . )
The bad burger came from a Denver - based supermarket chain called King Soopers , which has now recalled 466,236 pounds of it .
It ’s Meat Wagon tradition to convert such abstract - seeming figures into what we like to call Quarter Pounder Equivalents .
According to our proprietary computer models , King Soopers has officially released enough suspect beef for McDonald ’s to crank out approximately 1.86 million Quarter Pounders .
In addition to Colorado , the tainted meat has been distributed to retail outlets in Kansas , Missouri , Nebraska , New Mexico , Utah and Wyoming .
That ’s our food system–concentrating pathogens and sending them far and wide .
Again , a gaping whole has been exposed in our food - safety system .
The USDA ’s FSIS , which oversees meat safety , announced the recall on July 22 ; according to the Daily Camera , people in Colorado “ became ill between June 13 and 28 after buying their meat between June 1 and 14 . ”
So it took more than a month to recall 1.86 million Quarter Pounder Equivalents after people came down with antibiotic - resistant salmonella .
What ’s the rush , guys ?
Of course , the meat actually entered the food system as far back as May 23 .
Nice work , inspectors !
But the underlying issue is the meat industry ’s reliance on antibiotics to keep animals alive while in cramped , flithy conditions and on questionable diets .
As Michael Pollan reported in his classic 2002 article “ Power Steer , ” antibiotics are a routine fact of cow life on feedlots .
In fact , if you ’re going to feed corn and corn byproducts to ruminants that evolved to eat grass , antibiotics are necessary .
Describing a visit to a large feedlot in Kansas , Pollan wrote :
First stop was a hopper filled with Rumensin , a powerful antibiotic that No. 534 [ the calf Pollan had bought ] will consume with his feed every day for the rest of his life .
Calves have no need of regular medication while on grass , but as soon as they ’re placed in the backgrounding pen , they ’re apt to get sick .
Why ?
The stress of weaning is a factor , but the main culprit is the feed .
The shift to a ” hot ration ” of grain can so disturb the cow ’s digestive process–its rumen , in particular – that it can kill the animal if not managed carefully and accompanied by antibiotics .
Pollan goes on to report that :
In a shed attached to the mill sit vats of liquid vitamins and synthetic estrogen ; next to these are pallets stacked with 50 - pound sacks of Rumensin and tylosin , another antibiotic .
Yum !
Nor is intentionally spiking feed rations with Rumensin and tylosin the only way beef cows are exposed to antibiotics .
Sometimes they ’re inadvertently present in the feed itself .
Amid the biofuel boom of recent years , feedlot operators have been putting drastically more distillers grains–a byproduct of corn - based ethanol –into cattle rations .
As I ’ve reported before , most ethanol makers routinely use antibiotics in production process–and the FDA recently found significant antibiotic residues in distillers grains .
FDA researchers detected penicillin , virginiamycin , erythromycin , and tylosin .
Tylosin is one of the two identified by Pollan as common feedlot fodder .
But wait , it gets worse .
Antibiotic resistance has already reared its head at ethanol plants .
In a recent article , the Associated Press quotes a University of Minnesota researcher who says he found resistant bacteria in distillers grains “ when he sampled bacteria at four Midwest ethanol plants several years ago . ”
So the FDA itself has found antibiotic residues in distillers grains , and independent researchers have found resistant bacterial strains in the stuff .
What have regulators done to keep distillers grains out of feedlots ?
Bugger - all , as the British say .
( The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy recently put out an excellent short primer ( PDF ) on the issue of antibiotics and distillers grains ; and the blog Food Poison Journal has a nice backgrounder on the recent history of antibiotic - resistant salmonella . )
Anyone for a House bill that would ban routine use of antibiotics in animal farms ?
“ The farm [ read : agribusiness ] lobby ’s opposition makes its [ the bill ’s ] passage unlikely , ” The New York Times reported recently .
Too bad it ’s that simple .
Side of PBDE with that salmonella burger ?
One thing you feel safe about when considering a typical U.S. burger patty , chicken breast , or pork chop :
It ’s not likely to burst into flames on the skillet and burn your house down .
Okay , that ’s probably not the most appropriate lead - in to the next stop on the Meat Wagon , but it ’s Friday .
Get this , from Environmental Health News :
People who eat meat and poultry have significantly higher levels of common flame retardants compared to vegetarians .
Ouch .
The topic here is a study ( abstract ) by Boston University researchers measuring levels of PBDEs , once a commonly used flame retardant , in the bodies of meat eaters and vegetarians .
Guess which side won ?
“ Vegetarians had 23 - 27 percent less PBDEs circulating in their serum as compared to meat - eaters , ” reports EHN .
Chicken seemed to be the main culprit .
Serum levels of 5 different PBDEs were associated with eating poultry .
People who more poultry had higher levels of the PBDEs .
Poultry fat was the greatest contributor to the body burden of PBDEs .
But red meat fared poorly , too .
“ Red meat intake was associated with two of the measured PBDE levels , ” EHN reports .
Consumption of fish and dairy , however , showed no effect .
In terms of demographics , levels of PBDEs skewed in the following order : “ males , the youngest age group examined ( 12 - 19 yrs old ) , the poor , and the underweight ( subjects with lowest BMI ) . ”
This is pretty devastating news for a nation that consumes more than a half pound of meat per day per capita .
What are the health implications ?
EHN :
PBDEs accumulate in the liver , kidney and thyroid gland and are known endocrine disruptors .
Chronic exposure and elevated levels lead to disruption of estrogen and thyroid systems .
Animal and epidemiological studies link PBDE exposure to several types of reproductive and nervous system impairments .
And here ’s how Environmental Working Group describes the situation :
A growing body of research in laboratory animals has linked PBDE exposure to an array of adverse health effects including thyroid hormone disruption , permanent learning and memory impairment , behavioral changes , hearing deficits , delayed puberty onset , decreased sperm count , fetal malformations and , possibly , cancer .
Research in animals shows that exposure to brominated fire retardants in - utero or during infancy leads to more significant harm than exposure during adulthood , and at much lower levels .
So how are flame retardants , of all things , making their way into the meat supply ?
That remains a mystery .
From a Science Daily report on the study :
Although it is not known how flame retardants get into commercial animal products , possibilities include the contamination of animal feed , contamination during processing or packaging and general contamination of the environment .
PBDEs accumulate in fat tissue and resist degradation in the environment .
The beginners ' guide to Redcode
Version 1.23
There are n't too many beginners interested in the game of Core War these days .
Of course , this is quite natural — not that many people would consider optimizing assembly code to be fun anyway — but one reason for the high starting threshold may be the difficulty of finding information on the very basics of the game .
True , there are many good documents around , but most of them are either too technical , outdated , too hard to find or simply incomplete .
That is why I decided to write this guide .
My aim is to guide newcomers from their very first contact with Core War and Redcode to the point where they can write a working ( if not successful ) warrior , and are able to proceed to the more technical stuff .
To be honest , I am still a beginner in this game myself .
I know the language fairly well , but have yet to produce a really successful warrior .
But I decided not to wait until I 've gotten more experienced and instead write this guide as soon as possible while I still have a fresh memory of what it 's like to be a new player struggling to comprehend the peculiarities of the game .
This guide is intended for the very beginners .
No previous knowledge of any assembly language ( or programming in general ) should be needed , though knowing the general idea should help in understanding the basic terms .
Redcode , especially the modern versions , may look like any assembly code , but it is more abstract than most and quite different in details from any other assembly language .
The flavor of Redcode used in this guide is ( mostly ) the current de facto standard , the ICWS '94 Standard Draft with pMARS 0.8 extensions .
( Sort of like the Netscape extensions to HTML ... Hmm ...
Luckily we still do n't have a Microsoft Corewar Simulator .
Maybe they think the market 's too small . )
The earlier ' 88 standard will be mentioned briefly , but this guide is mostly about the ' 94 standard .
For those who want to learn it , there are plenty of ' 88 tutorials available on the Web .
Important :
There is no simple way to teach Redcode — or any programming language — in a strictly linear way .
While I 've tried to organise this guide into a somewhat sensible order , if you want to skip around , by all means do so .
That 's what the contents section is for .
To maintain any coherency at all , I 've often been forced to show you things and then explain them a few chapters later .
If you do n't seem to understand something , read on for a while .
If you still can't figure it out , try browsing around to see if it 's explained in some other chapter .
Everybody learns in a different way , and so any order you decide to read the chapters in is probably better than the one I 've chosen .
But if you think something is boring and leave it completely unread , the chances are you 'll miss some important piece if information .
I 've tried to mark important parts with emphasis , so you know where to stop and think , but try to read everything carefully .
I simply can't spell everything out , or this guide would grow too long to read .
Core War ( or Core Wars ) is a programming game where assembly programs try to destroy each other in the memory of a simulated computer .
The programs ( or warriors ) are written in a special language called Redcode , and run by a program called MARS ( Memory Array Redcode Simulator ) .
Both Redcode and the MARS environment are much simplified and abstracted compared to ordinary computer systems .
This is a good thing , since CW programs are written for performance , not for clarity .
If the game used an ordinary assembly language , there might be two or three people in the world capable of writing an effective and durable warrior , and even they would n't probably be able to understand it fully .
It would certainly be challenging and full of potential , but it'd probably take years to reach even a moderate level of skill .
The system in which the programs run is quite simple .
The core ( the memory of the simulated computer ) is a continuous array of instructions , empty except for the competing programs .
The core wraps around , so that after the last instruction comes the first one again .
In fact , the programs have no way of knowing where the core ends , since there are no absolute addresses .
That is , the address 0 does n't mean the first instruction in the memory , but the instruction that contains the address .
The next instruction is 1 , and the previous one obviously - 1 .
As you can see , the basic unit of memory in Core War is one instruction , instead of one byte as is usual .
Each Redcode instruction contains three parts : the OpCode itself , the source address ( a.k.a. the A - field ) and the destination address ( the B - field ) .
While it is possible for example to move data between the A - field and the B - field , in general you need to treat the instructions as indivisible blocks .
The execution of the programs is equally simple .
The MARS executes one instruction at a time , and then proceeds to the next one in the memory , unless the instruction explicitly tells it to jump to another address .
If there is more than one program running , ( as is usual ) the programs execute alternately , one instruction at a time .
The execution of each instruction takes the same time , one cycle , whether it is MOV , DIV or even DAT ( which kills the process ) .
The number of instructions in Redcode has grown with each new standard , from the original number of about 5 to the current 18 or 19 .
And this does n't even include the new modifiers and addressing modes that allow literally hundreds of combinations .
Luckily , we do n't need to learn all the combinations .
It is enough to remember the instructions , and how the modifiers change them .
Here is a list of all the instructions used in Redcode :
DAT — data ( kills the process )
— data ( kills the process ) MOV — move ( copies data from one address to another )
— move ( copies data from one address to another ) ADD — add ( adds one number to another )
— add ( adds one number to another ) SUB — subtract ( subtracts one number from another )
— subtract ( subtracts one number from another ) MUL — multiply ( multiplies one number with another )
— multiply ( multiplies one number with another ) DIV — divide ( divides one number with another )
— divide ( divides one number with another ) MOD — modulus ( divides one number with another and gives the remainder )
— modulus ( divides one number with another and gives the remainder ) JMP — jump ( continues execution from another address )
— jump ( continues execution from another address ) JMZ — jump if zero ( tests a number and jumps to an address if it 's 0 )
— jump if zero ( tests a number and jumps to an address if it 's 0 ) JMN — jump if not zero ( tests a number and jumps if it is n't 0 )
— jump if not zero ( tests a number and jumps if it is n't 0 ) DJN — decrement and jump if not zero ( decrements a number by one , and jumps unless the result is 0 )
— decrement and jump if not zero ( decrements a number by one , and jumps unless the result is 0 ) SPL — split ( starts a second process at another address )
— split ( starts a second process at another address ) CMP — compare ( same as SEQ )
— compare ( same as ) SEQ — skip if equal ( compares two instructions , and skips the next instruction if they are equal )
— skip if equal ( compares two instructions , and skips the next instruction if they are equal ) SNE — skip if not equal ( compares two instructions , and skips the next instruction if they are n't equal )
— skip if not equal ( compares two instructions , and skips the next instruction if they are n't equal ) SLT — skip if lower than ( compares two values , and skips the next instruction if the first is lower than the second )
— skip if lower than ( compares two values , and skips the next instruction if the first is lower than the second ) LDP — load from p-space ( loads a number from private storage space )
— load from p-space ( loads a number from private storage space ) STP — save to p-space ( saves a number to private storage space )
— save to p-space ( saves a number to private storage space ) NOP — no operation ( does nothing )
Do n't worry if some of them seem , to put it mildly , weird .
As I said , Redcode is quite a bit different from more ordinary assembly languages , which results from its abstract nature .
The truth is , the most important parts of Redcode are the easiest ones .
Most of the basic warrior types were invented before the new instructions and modes existed .
The simplest , and probably the first , Core War program is the Imp , published by A. K. Dewdney in the original 1984 Scientific American article that first introduced Core War to the public .
MOV 0 , 1
Yes , that 's it .
Just one lousy MOV .
But what does it do ?
MOV of course copies an instruction .
You should recall that all addresses in Core War are relative to the current instruction , so the Imp in fact copies itself to the instruction just after itself .
MOV 0 , 1 MOV 0 , 1
Now , the Imp will execute the instruction it just wrote !
Since it 's exactly the same as the first one , it will once again copy itself one instruction forward , execute the copy , and continue to move forward while filling the core with MOV s.
Since the core has no actual end , the Imp , after filling the whole core , reaches its starting position again and keeps on running happily in circles ad infinitum .
So the Imp actually creates it 's own code as it executes it !
In Core War , self - modification is a rule rather than an exception .
You need to be effective to be successful , and that nearly always means changing your code on the fly .
Luckily , the abstract environment makes this a lot easier to follow than in ordinary assembly .
BTW , it should be obvious that there are no caches in Core War .
Well , actually the current instruction is cached so you can't modify it in the middle of executing it , but maybe we should leave all that for the later ...
The Imp has one little drawback as a warrior .
It wo n't win too many games , since when it overwrites another warrior , it too starts to execute the MOV 0 , 1 and becomes an imp itself , resulting in a tie .
To kill a program , you 'd have to copy a DAT over its code .
This is just what another classic warrior by Dewdney , the Dwarf , does .
It " bombs " the core at regularly spaced locations with DAT s , while making sure it wo n't hit itself .
ADD # 4 , 3 MOV 2 , @ 2 JMP - 2 DAT # 0 , # 0
Actually , this is n't precisely what Dewdney wrote , but it works exactly the same way .
The execution begins again at the first instruction .
This time it's an ADD .
The ADD instruction adds the source and the destination together , and puts the result in the destination .
If you 're familiar with other assembly languages , you may recognise the # sign as a way of marking immediate addressing .
That is , the ADD adds the number 4 to the instruction at address 3 , instead of adding the instruction 4 to the instruction 3 .
Since the 3rd instruction after the ADD is the DAT , the result will be :
ADD # 4 , 3 MOV 2 , @ 2 JMP - 2 DAT # 0 , # 4
If you add two instructions together , both the A - and the B - fields will be added together independently of each other .
If you add a single number to an instruction , it will by default be added to the B - field .
It 's quite possible to use a # in the B - field of the ADD too .
Then the A - field would be added to the B - field of the ADD itself .
The immediate addressing mode may seem simple and familiar , but the new modifiers in the ICWS ' 94 standard will give it an entirely new twist .
But let 's look at the Dwarf first .
The MOV once again presents us with yet another addressing mode : the @ or the indirect addressing mode .
It means that the DAT will not be copied on itself as it seems ( what good would that be ? ) , but on the instruction its B - field points to , like this :
ADD # 4 , 3 MOV 2 , @ 2 JMP - 2 DAT # 0 , # 4 ... ... ... DAT # 0 , # 4
As you can see , the DAT will be copied 4 instructions ahead of it .
The next instruction , JMP , simply makes the process jump two instructions backwards , back to the ADD .
Since the JMP ignores its B - field I 've left it empty .
The MARS will initialise it for me as a 0 .
By the way , as you see the MARS will not start tracing further chains of indirect addresses .
If the indirect operand points to an instruction with a B - field of , say , 4 , the actual destination will be 4 instructions after it , regardless of the addressing mode .
Now the ADD and the MOV will be executed again .
When the execution reaches the JMP again , the core looks like this :
ADD # 4 , 3 MOV 2 , @ 2 JMP - 2 DAT # 0 , # 8 ... ... ... DAT # 0 , # 4 ... ... ... DAT # 0 , # 8
The Dwarf will keep on dropping DAT s every 4 instructions , until it has looped around the whole core and reached itself again :
... DAT # 0 , # - 8 ... ... ... DAT # 0 , # -4 ADD # 4 , 3 MOV 2 , @ 2 JMP - 2 DAT # 0 , # - 4 ... ... ... DAT # 0 , # 4 ...
Now , the ADD will turn the DAT back into # 0 , # 0 , the MOV will perform an exercise in futility by copying the DAT right where it already is , and the whole process will start again from the beginning .
This naturally wo n't work unless the size of the core is divisible by 4 , since otherwise the Dwarf would hit an instruction from 1 to 3 instructions behind the DAT , thus killing itself .
Luckily , the most popular core size is currently 8000 , followed by 8192 , 55400 , 800 , all of them divisible by 4 , so our Dwarf should be safe
As a side note , including the DAT # 0 , # 0 in the warrior would n't really have been necessary ;
The instruction the core is initially filled with , which I 've written as three dots ( ... ) is actually DAT 0 , 0 .
I 'll continue to use the dots to describe empty core , since is it shorter and easier to read .
In the first versions of Core War the only addressing modes were the immediate ( # ) , the direct ( $ or nothing at all ) and the B - field indirect ( @ ) addressing modes .
Later , the predecrement addressing mode , or < , was added .
It 's the same as the indirect mode , except that the pointer will be decremented by one before the target address is calculated .
DAT # 0 , # 5 MOV 0 , < - 1
When this MOV is executed , the result will be :
DAT # 0 , # 4 MOV 0 , < - 1 ... ... MOV 0 , < - 1
The ICWS ' 94 standard draft added four more addressing modes , mostly to deal with A - field indirection , to give a total of 8 modes :
# — immediate
— immediate $ — direct ( the $ may be omitted )
— direct ( the may be omitted ) * — A - field indirect
— A - field indirect @ — B - field indirect
— B- field indirect { —
A - field indirect with predecrement
— A - field indirect with predecrement < — B - field indirect with predecrement
— B- field indirect with predecrement } — A - field indirect with postincrement
— A - field indirect with postincrement > —
B - field indirect with postincrement
The postincrement modes are similar to the predecrement , but the pointer will be incremented by one after the instruction has been executed , as you might have guessed .
DAT # 5 , # -10 MOV - 1 , } -1
will after execution look like this :
DAT # 6 , # -10 MOV - 1 , } - 1 ... ... ... DAT # 5 , # - 10
One important thing to remember about the predecrement and postincrement modes is that the pointers will be in -/ decremented even if they 're not used for anything .
So JMP - 1 , < 100 would decrement the instruction 100 even if the value it points to is n't used for anything .
Even DAT < 50 , < 60 will decrement the addresses in addition to killing the process .
If you looked at the instruction table a few chapters above closely , you may have wondered about an instruction named SPL .
There 's certainly nothing like that in any ordinary assembly language ...
Quite early in the history of Core War , it was suggested that adding multitasking to the game would make it much more interesting .
Since the rough time - slicing techniques used in ordinary systems would n't fit in the abstract Core War environment ( most importantly , you 'd need an OS to control them ) , a system was invented whereby each process is executed for one cycle in turn .
The instruction used to create new processes is the SPL .
It takes an address as a parameter in its A - field , just like JMP .
The difference between JMP and SPL is that , in addition to starting execution at the new address , SPL also continues execution at the next instruction .
The two — or more — processes thus created will share the processing time equally .
Instead of a single process counter that would show the current instruction , the MARS has a process queue , a list of processes that are executed repeatedly in the order in which they were started .
New processes created by SPL are added just after the current process , while those that execute a DAT will be removed from the queue .
If all the processes die , the warrior will lose .
It 's important to remember that each program has its own process queue .
With more than one program in the core , they will be executed alternately , one cycle at a time regardless of the length of their process queue , so that the processing time will always be divided equally .
If program A has 3 processes , and program B only 1 , the order of execution will look like :
program A , process 1 , program B , process 1 , program A , process 2 , program B , process 1 , program A , process 3 , program B , process 1 , program A , process 1 , program B , process 1 ,
...
And finally , a small example of the use of SPL .
More information will be available in the later chapters .
SPL 0 MOV 0 , 1
Since the SPL points to itself , after one cycle the processes will be like this :
SPL 0 MOV 0 , 1
After both of the processes have executed , the core will now look like :
SPL 0 MOV 0 , 1 MOV 0 , 1
So this code evidently launches a series of imps , one after another .
It will keep on doing this until the imps have circled the whole core and overwrite the SPL .
The size of the process queue for each program is limited .
If the maximum number of processes has been reached , SPL continues execution only at the next instruction , effectively duplicating the behaviour of NOP .
In most cases the process limit is quite high , often the same as the length of the core , but it can be lower ( even 1 , in which case splitting is effectively disabled ) .
Oh , and as for thruth often being stranger than fiction , I recently came across a web page titled " Opcodes that should 've been " .
Amongst some really absurd ones I found " BBW — Branch Both Ways " .
As all the opcodes were supposed to be fictitious , I can only conclude that the author was n't familiar with Redcode ..
The most important new thing brought by the ICWS ' 94 standard was n't the new instructions or the new addressing modes , but the modifiers .
In the old ' 88 standard the addressing modes alone decide which parts of the instructions are affected by an operation .
For example , MOV 1 , 2 always moves a whole instruction , while MOV # 1 , 2 moves a single number .
( and always to the B - field ! )
Naturally , this could cause some difficulties .
What if you wanted to move only the A - and B - fields of an instruction , but not the OpCode ?
( you 'd need to use ADD ) Or what if you wanted to move something from the B - field to the A - field ?
( possible , but very tricky )
To clarify the situation , the instruction modifiers were invented .
The modifiers are suffixes that are added to the instruction to specify which parts of the source and the destination it will affect .
For example , MOV .AB 4 , 5 would move the A - field of the instruction 4 into the B - field of the instruction 5 .
There are 7 different modifiers available :
MOV .A — moves the A - field of the source into the A - field of the destination
— moves the A - field of the source into the A - field of the destination MOV .B — moves the B - field of the source into the B - field of the destination
— moves the B - field of the source into the B - field of the destination MOV .
AB — moves the A - field of the source into the B - field of the destination
— moves the A - field of the source into the B - field of the destination MOV .
BA — moves the B - field of the source into the A - field of the destination
— moves the B - field of the source into the A - field of the destination MOV .F — moves both fields of the source into the same fields in the destination
— moves both fields of the source into the same fields in the destination MOV .X — moves both fields of the source into the opposite fields in the destination
— moves both fields of the source into the opposite fields in the destination MOV .
I — moves the whole source instruction into the destination
Naturally the same modifiers can be used for all instructions , not just for MOV .
Some instructions like JMP and SPL , however , do n't care about the modifiers .
( Why should they ?
They do n't handle any actual data , they just jump around . )
Since not all the modifiers make sense for all the instructions , they will default to the closest one that does make sense .
The most common case involves the .
I modifier :
To keep the language simple and abstract no numerical equivalents have been defined for the OpCodes , so using mathematical operations on them would n't make any sense at all .
This means that for all instructions except MOV , SEQ and SNE ( and CMP which is just an alias for SEQ ) the .
I modifier will mean the same as the .F .
Another thing to remember about the .
I and the .F is that the addressing modes too are part of the OpCode , and are not copied by MOV .F
We can now rewrite the old programs to use modifiers as an example .
The Imp would naturally be MOV .
I 0 , 1 .
The Dwarf would become :
ADD .AB # 4 , 3 MOV . I 2 , @ 2 JMP - 2 DAT # 0 , # 0
Note that I 've left out the modifiers for JMP and DAT since they do n't use them for anything .
The MARS turns them into ( for example ) JMP .B and DAT .F , but who cares ?
Oh , one more thing .
How did I know which modifier to add to which instruction ?
( and , more importantly , how does the MARS add them if we leave them off ? )
Well , you can usually do it with a bit of common sense , but the ' 94 standard does defines a set of rules for that purpose .
DAT , NOP Always .F , but it 's ignored .
MOV , SEQ , SNE , CMP
If A - mode is immediate , .AB ,
if B -mode is immediate and A - mode is n't , .B ,
if neither mode is immediate , . I .
ADD , SUB , MUL , DIV , MOD
If A - mode is immediate , .AB ,
if B -mode is immediate and A - mode is n't , .B ,
if neither mode is immediate , .F .
SLT , LDP , STP
If A - mode is immediate , .AB ,
if it is n't , ( always ! ) .B . JMP , JMZ , JMN , DJN , SPL Always .
B ( but it 's ignored for JMP and SPL ) .
The defined behavior of the immediate addressing mode ( # ) in the ' 94 standard is quite unusual .
While the standard is 100 % compatible with the old syntax , the immediate addressing has been defined in a very clever and unique way that lets it be used logically with all the instructions and modifiers , and makes it a very powerful tool .
Looking at the modifiers , you might wonder what MOV .F # 7 , 10 would do . . F should move both fields , but there 's only one number in the source ??
Would it move 7 into both fields of the destination ?
No , it definitely would n't .
In fact , it would move 7 into the A - field of the destination , and 10 into the B - field !
Why ?
The reason is that , in the ' 94 syntax , the source ( and the destination ) is always a whole instruction .
In the case of immediate addressing , it 's simply always the current instruction , ( ie. 0 ) whatever the actual value .
So MOV .F # 7 , 10 moves both fields of the source ( 0 ) to the destination ( 10 ) .
Surprising , is n't it ?
The same even works for MOV .
I .
This way of defining immediate addressing also lets us use instructions which , even without modifiers , would n't make sense in the ' 88 standard such as JMP # 1234 .
Obviously you can't jump into a number , but you can jump into the address of that number , or 0 .
This offers many obvious advantages , since not only can we store data in the A - field for " free " , but the code will survive even if someone decrements it .
We could now rewrite the earlier imp-making code to be a bit more robust :
SPL # 0 , } 1 MOV . I # 1234 , 1
It still works the same , but now the A - fields are free .
Just for fun I 've let the SPL increment the A - field of the imp , so that all the imps will look different .
Since SPL does n't use its B - field , that increment is also " free " .
It works , trust me — or try it yourself !
You should already know that addresses in the core wrap around , so that the instruction one coresize ahead or behind the current instruction refers to the current instruction itself .
But in fact , this effect goes much deeper : all numbers in Core War are converted into the range 0 - coresize - 1 .
For those of you who already know about programming and limited - range integer math , let 's just say that all numbers in Core War are considered unsigned , with the maximum integer being coresize - 1 .
If that did n't clarify everything , read on ...
In effect , all numbers in Core War are divided by the length of the core , or coresize , and only the remainder is kept .
You might try thinking of a calculator with a display of only 8 numbers that throws off any digits past that , so that 100* 12345678 ( 1234567800 , of course ) is only shown ( and stored ) as 34567800 .
Similarly , in a core of 8000 instructions , 7900+222 ( 8122 ) becomes only 122 .
What happens to negative numbers , then ?
They are normalised too , by adding coresize until they become positive .
This means that what I wrote as - 1 is actually stored by the MARS as coresize - 1 , or in an 8000 instruction core , as is common , 7999 .
Of course , this makes no difference for the addresses , which wrap around anyway .
In fact , it does n't make any difference to the simple math instructions like ADD or SUB either , since with coresize =8000 , 6+7998 gives the same result of 4 ( or 8004 ) as does 6 - 2 .
What 's the problem , then ?
Well , there are a few instructions where it makes a difference .
Such instructions as DIV , MOD and SLT always treat numbers as unsigned .
This means that - 2/2 is n't - 1 , but ( coresize - 2 )/2 = ( coresize /2 ) - 1 ( or for coresize =8000 , 7998/2=3999 , not 7999 ) .
Similarly , SLT considers - 2 ( or 7998 ) to be greater than 0 !
In fact , 0 is the lowest possible number in Core War , so all other numbers are considered greater than it .
Ok , your patience has been rewarded .
Until now I 've given you only some separate pieces of information .
Now it 's time to tie it all together by describing each instruction to you .
Of course I could 've listed them at the very beginning , when I shoved you the instruction set , and it probably would 've saved you from a lot of guessing .
But I had — at least in my opinion — a very good reason to wait .
Not only did I want to show you some practical code before getting into the boring theoretical stuff , but most of all I wanted you to grasp at least the basic idea of addressing modes and modifiers before describing the instructions in detail .
If I had described the instructions before the modifiers , I would 've had to first teach you the older ' 88 rules , and later teach it all again with modifiers included .
It 's not a bad way to learn Redcode , but it'd make this guide unnecessarily complicated .
DAT Originally , as its name shows , DAT was intended for storing data , just like in most languages .
Since in Core
War you want to minimise the number of instructions , storing pointers etc. in unused parts of other instructions is common .
This means that the most important thing about DAT is that executing it kills a process .
In fact , since the ' 94 standard has no illegal instructions , DAT is defined as a completely legal instruction , which removes the currently executing process from the process queue .
Sounds like splitting hairs , maybe , but precisely defining the obvious can often save a lot of confusion .
The modifiers have no effect on DAT , and in fact some MARSes remove them .
However , remember that predecrementing and postincrementing are always done even if the value is n't used for anything .
One unusual thing about DAT , a relic of the previous standards , is that if it has only one argument it 's placed in the B - field .
MOV MOV copies data from one instruction to another .
If you do n't know everything about that already , you should probably re-read the earlier chapters .
MOV is one of the few instructions that support .
I , and that 's its default behavior if no modifier is given ( and if neither of the fields uses immediate addressing ) .
ADD ADD adds the source value (s ) to the destination .
The modifiers work like with MOV , except that .
I is n't supported but behaves like .F . ( What would MOV . AB + DJN . F be ? )
Also remember that all math in Core War is done modulo coresize .
SUB
This instruction works exactly like ADD , except for one fairly obvious difference .
In fact , all the " arithmetic - logical " instructions work pretty much the same ...
MUL ... as is the case for MUL too .
If you can't guess what it does , you 've probably missed something very important .
DIV DIV too works pretty much the same as MUL and the others , but there are a few things to keep in mind .
First of all , this is unsigned division , which can give surprising results sometimes .
Division by zero kills the process , just like executing a DAT , and leaves the destination unchanged .
If you use DIV . F or . X to divide two numbers at a time and one of the divisors is 0 , the other division will still be done as normal .
MOD
Everything I said about DIV applies here too , including the division by zero part .
Remember that the result of a calculation like MOD .
AB # 10 , # - 1 depends on the size of the core .
For the common 8000 - instruction core the result would be 9 ( 7999 mod 10 ) .
JMP JMP moves execution to the address its A - field points to .
The obvious but important difference to the " math " instructions is that JMP only cares about the address , not the data that address points to .
Another significant difference is that JMP does n't use its B - field for anything ( and so also ignores its modifier ) .
Being able to jump ( or split ) into two addresses would simply be too powerful , and it'd make implementing the next three instructions quite difficult .
Remember that you can still place an increment or a decrement in the unused B - field , with luck damaging your opponent 's code .
JMZ
This instruction works like JMP , but instead of ignoring its B - field , it tests the value (s ) it points to and only jumps if it 's zero .
Otherwise the execution will continue at the next address .
Since there 's only one instruction to test , the choice of modifiers is fairly limited .
.
AB means the same as .B , .
BA the same as .A , and .X and .
I the same as .F .
If you test both fields of an instruction with JMZ .F , it will jump only if both fields are zero .
JMN JMN works like JMZ , but jumps if the value tested is not zero ( surprise , surprise ... ) .
JMN .F jumps if either of the fields is non-zero .
DJN DJN is like JMN , but the value(s ) are decremented by one before testing .
This instruction is useful for making a loop counter , but it can also be used to damage your opponent .
SPL
This is the big one .
The addition of SPL into the language was probably the most significant change ever made to Redcode , only rivalled perhaps by the introduction of the ICWS ' 94 standard .
SPL works like JMP but the execution also continues at the next instruction , so that the process is " split " into two new ones .
The process at the next instruction executes before the one which jumped to a new address , which is a small but very important detail .
( Many , if not most , modern warriors would n't work without it ! )
If the max .
number of processes has been reached , SPL works like NOP .
Like JMP , SPL ignores its B - field and its modifier .
SEQ SEQ compares two instructions , and skips the next instruction if they are equal .
( It always jumps only those two instructions forward , since there 's no room for a jump address . )
Since the instructions are compared only for equality , using the .
I modifier is supported .
Quite naturally , with the modifiers .F , .X and .
I the next instruction will be skipped only if all the fields are equal .
SNE
Ok , you guessed it .
This instruction skips the next instruction if the instructions it compares are not equal .
If you compare more than one field , the next instruction will be skipped if any pair of them are n't equal .
( Sounds familiar , does n't it ?
just like with JMZ and JMN ... )
CMP CMP is an alias for SEQ .
This was the only name of the instruction before SEQ and SNE were introduced .
Nowadays it does n't really matter which name you use , since the most popular MARS programs recognise SEQ even in ' 88 mode .
SLT
Like the previous instructions , SLT skips the next instruction , this time if the first value is lower than the second .
Since this is an arithmetical comparison instead of a logical one , it makes no sense to use .
I .
It might seem that there should be an instruction called SGT , ( skip if greater than ) but in most cases the same effect can be achieved simply by swapping the operands of SLT .
Remember that all values are considered unsigned , so 0 is the smallest possible number and - 1 is the largest .
NOP
Well , this instruction does nothing .
( And it does it really well , too . )
It 's almost never used in an actual warrior , but it 's very useful in debugging .
Remember that any in - or decrements are still evaluated .
You might notice that two instructions , namely LDP and STP are missing .
They are a fairly recent addition to the language , and will be discussed ... um , well right now . :-)
P - space is the latest addition to Redcode , introduced by pMARS 0.8 .
The " P " stands for private , permanent , personal , pathetic and so on , whichever you like .
Basically , the P - space is an area of memory which only your program can access , and which survives between rounds in a multi-round match .
The P - space is in many ways different from the normal core .
First of all , each P - space location can only store one number , not a whole instruction .
Also , the addressing in P - space is absolute , ie .
the P - space address 1 is always 1 regardless of where in the core the instruction containing it is .
And last but not least , the P - space can only be accessed by two special instructions , LDP and STP .
The syntax of these two instructions is a bit unusual .
The STP , for example has an ordinary value in the core as its source , which is put into the P - space field pointed to by the destination .
So the P - space location is n't determined by the destination address , but by its value , ie .
the value that would be overwritten if this were a MOV .
So STP . AB # 4 , # 5 for example would put the value 4 into the P - space field 5 .
Similarly ,
STP .B 2 , 3 ... DAT # 0 , # 10 DAT # 0 , # 7
would put the value 10 into the P - space field 7 , not 3 !
This can get pretty confusing if the STP itself uses indirect addressing , which leads into a sort of " double - indirect " addressing system .
LDP works the same way , except that now the source is a P - space field and the destination a core instruction .
The size of the P - space is usually smaller than that of the core , typically 1/16 of the core size .
The addresses in the P - space wrap around just like in the core .
The size of the P - space must naturally be a factor of the core size , or something weird will happen .
The P - space location 0 is special , in that it is initialised to a special value before each round .
This value is - 1 for the first round , 0 if the program died in the previous round , and otherwise the number of surviving programs .
Thus , for one - on - one matches , 0 means a loss , 1 a win and 2 a tie .
This special initialization also means that location 0 cannot be used to pass any other information from one round to the next , since it will be overwritten by the MARS before the next round begins .
There is one little peculiarity in the pMARS implementation of P - space .
Since the intention was to keep access to P - space slow , loading or saving two P - space fields with one instruction is n't allowed .
This is a Good Thing , but the result is at the very least a kludge .
What this actually means is that LDP .F , .X and .
I all work like LDP .B ! ( and the same for STP too , of course )
Absolutely the most common use of P - space is to use it to select a strategy .
In its simplest form , this means saving the previous strategy in P - space , and switching strategies if the P - space field 0 shows the program lost last time .
This kind of programs are called P - warriors , P - switchers or P - brains ( pronounced pea-brains ) .
Unfortunately , the P - space is n't as private as it seems .
While your opponent can't read or write your P - space directly , your processes may be captured and made execute your opponents code , including STP s .
This kind of technique is known as brainwashing , and all P - switchers must be prepared for it , and not freak out if the strategy field contains something weird .
So far , I 've written all the addresses in our example programs as instruction numbers , relative to the current instruction .
But in larger programs , this can get annoying , not to mention difficult to read .
Luckily , we do n't really have to do this , since Redcode lets us use labels , symbolic constants , macros and all the other things you 'd expect of a good assembler .
All we need to do is to label the instructions an refer to them with the labels , and the parser calculates the real addresses for us , like this :
imp : mov .i imp , imp+
1
Whoa , what happened ?
This is exactly the same program as the one I showed you in the very beginning .
I 've just replaced the numerical addressed with references to a label , " imp " .
Of course , in this case doing that is pretty futile .
The only instruction in which the label is used is " imp " itself , in which the label is replaced by 0 .
Before executing it , the parser in the MARS converts all such labels and other symbols into the familiar numbers .
Such a " pre-compiled " Redcode file is called a load file , for whatever reason .
All MARSes must be able to read load files , but some may not have a real parser .
In load file format , the previous code becomes MOV .
I 0 , 1 .
We could 've also written the same code as
imp : mov .i imp , next next : dat 0 , 0
In this case , the instruction labelled " next " is one instruction after " imp " , so it 's replaced by 1 .
Remember that the real addresses are still relative numbers , so the Imp will continue to be MOV .
I 0 , 1 even after it has copied itself forward over " next " .
Actually , the : in the end of the labels is n't really necessary .
I 've used it here to help you see where the labels are , but I usually do n't use it in my own programs .
It 's a matter of taste .
Oh , and just in case you 're wondering about it , Redcode instructions are case - insensitive .
I like using lower case for the sources since it looks nicer , and upper case only for the compiled , " load file " format ( mostly because it 's a tradition ) .
While the examples in previous chapters might compile just fine , they 're not really complete programs , but parts of one .
A typical redcode file contains some extra information for the MARS .
; redcode -94 ; name Imp ; author A.K.
Dewdney org imp imp : mov .i imp , imp+1 end
As you probably have already figured out , everything after a is a comment in Redcode .
The lines on the top of this program , however , are n't just ordinary comments .
The MARS uses them to get some information about the program .
The first line , ; redcode - 94 , tells the MARS that this really is a Redcode file .
Anything above this line is ignored by the MARS .
Actually , the MARS only expects a line starting with ; redcode , but we can use the rest of the line to identify the flavor of Redcode used .
Specially , the KotH servers read this line themselves , and use it to identify the hill the program is going to .
The ; name and ; author lines just give some information on the program .
Of course you could give it in any format , but using the specific codes lets the MARS read the names and display them when the program is run .
The line with the word END — surprise , surprise — ends the program .
Anything after it will be ignored .
Together with ; redcode , it can be use for example to include Redcode programs in e-mail .
The line with ORG tells where the execution of the program should start .
This lets us put other instructions before the beginning of the program .
The ORG command is one of the new things included in the ' 94 standard .
The older syntax , which still works in modern programs too , is to give the starting address as an argument to the END .
; redcode -94 ; name Imp ; author A.K. Dewdney imp : mov .i imp , imp+1 end imp
Simple , compact , and unfortunately quite illogical .
And with long programs , you have to scroll to the end just to see where it begins .
In Redcode terminology , both ORG and END are called pseudo - OpCodes .
They look like actual instructions , but they 're not actually compiled into the program .
But enough of the Imp .
Let 's see what the Dwarf would look like in modern Redcode :
; redcode -94 ; name Dwarf ; author A.K. Dewdney ; strategy Bombs the core at regular intervals .
; assert CORESIZE % 4 == 0 org loop loop : add .ab # 4 , bomb mov .i bomb , @ bomb jmp loop bomb : dat # 0 , # 0 end
The labels make understanding the program a lot easier , do n't they ?
Notice that I 've added two new comment lines .
The ; strategy line describes the program briefly .
There may be several such lines in the program .
Most current MARSes ignore them , so you might as well use ordinary comments like the one my name is in , but the Hills display the ; strategy lines to others .
Sending the previous program to one , something like this might be shown :
A new challenger has appeared on the ' 94 hill !
Dwarf by A.K. Dewdney : ( length 4 ) ; strategy Bombs the core at regular intervals .
[ other info here ...]
Another new detail in our example code is the ; assert line .
It can be used to make sure the program really works with the current settings .
The Dwarf , for example , kills itself if the size of the core is n't evenly divisible by 4 .
So , I 've used the line ; assert CORESIZE % 4 == 0 to make sure it always is .
The CORESIZE is a predefined constant which tells us the size of the core .
That is , n + CORESIZE is always the same address as n .
The % is the modulus operator , which gives the remainder in a division .
The syntax of the expressions used in the ; assert lines and elsewhere in Redcode is the same as in the C language , although the set of operators is much more limited .
For those who do n't know C , here 's some sort of a list of the operators which are used in Redcode expressions :
Arithmetic : + addition
- subtraction ( or negation )
* multiplication
/ division
% modulus ( remainder ) Comparison : == equals
!= does n't equal
< is less than
> is greater than
<= is equal or less than
>= is equal or greater than Logical : && and
|| or
! not Assignment : = assignment to a variable
The ; assert is followed by a logical expression .
If it 's false , the program will not be compiled .
In C , a value of 0 means false and anything else means true .
The logical and comparison operators return 1 for true , a fact which can be useful later .
Typically , ; assert is used to check that the size of the core is the one the constants have been designed for , like ; assert CORESIZE == 8000 .
If the program uses P - space , its existence may be tested with ; assert PSPACESIZE > 0 .
Since our example , the Dwarf , is fairly adaptable , I only tested the CORESIZE for divisibility , not for a specific size .
The Imp , which runs with any settings , could use ; assert 1 , ; assert 0 == 0 and so on , all of which always evaluate as true .
This is useful since otherwise the MARS may complain about a " missing ; assert line -- warrior may not work with current settings . "
Some of the predefined constants , such as CORESIZE , are defined by the ' 94 standard , and others may and have been added .
pMARS 0.8 should support at least the following :
CORESIZE — the size of the core ( default 8000 )
— the size of the core ( default 8000 ) PSPACESIZE — the size of the P - space ( default 500 )
— the size of the P - space ( default 500 ) MAXCYCLES — the number of cycles until a tie is declared ( default 80000 )
— the number of cycles until a tie is declared ( default 80000 ) MAXPROCESSES — the maximum size of the process queue ( default 8000 )
— the maximum size of the process queue ( default 8000 ) WARRIORS — the number of programs in the core ( usually 2 )
— the number of programs in the core ( usually 2 ) MAXLENGTH — the maximum length of a program ( default 100 )
— the maximum length of a program ( default 100 ) CURLINE — the number of instructions compiled so far ( 0 to MAXLENGTH )
— the number of instructions compiled so far ( 0 to ) MINDISTANCE — the minimum distance between two warriors ( default 100 )
— the minimum distance between two warriors ( default 100 ) VERSION — the version of pMARS , multiplied by 100 ( 80 or more )
The predefined constants are useful , and so are labels , but is that really all ?
Ca n't I use some variables or something ?
Well , Redcode is an assembly language , and they do n't really use a lot of variables .
But there 's something almost as good , or maybe sometimes even better .
There 's a pseudo - OpCode EQU that lets us define our own constants , expressions and even macros .
It looks like this :
step equ 2667
After this , step is always replaced by 2667 .
There 's a catch , however .
The replacement is textual , not numerical .
In this case it should n't do any harm , but while it makes EQU a very powerful tool , it can create some problems which C programmers should be quite familiar with .
Let 's take an example .
step equ 2667 target equ step - 100 start mov .i target , step - target
The A - field of the MOV would be 2567 , just as it should be .
But the B - field would become 2667- 2667 - 100 == - 100 , not 2667 -( 2667-100 ) == 2667-2567 == 100 , as it was probably intended .
The solution is simple .
Just put parentheses around every expression in EQU s , such as " target equ ( step - 100 ) " .
With the modern versions of pMARS it 's possible to use multi- line equ s , and thus create some sort of macros .
The way it 's done is this :
dec7 equ dat # 1 , # 1 equ dat $ 1 , $ 1 equ dat @ 1 , @ 1 equ dat * 1 , * 1 equ dat { 1 , { 1 equ dat } 1 , } 1 equ dat < 1 , < 1 decoy dec7 dec7 dec7
There are a few more features of the pMARS parser left , and this one is perhaps more powerful ( and harder to learn ) than any of the above .
The FOR / ROF pseudo - OpCodes not only can make your sources shorter and create complex code sequences easily , but they can be used to create conditional code for different settings .
A FOR block begins with — yes , you guessed it — the pseudo - OpCode FOR , followed by the number of times the block should be repeated .
If there 's a label before the block , it will be used as a loop counter , like this :
index for 7 dat index , 10 - index rof
The block ends , as you can see , with ROF .
( Much better that the old clich � NEXT or REPEAT , I 'd say . )
The block above would be parsed by pMARS into :
DAT .F $ 1 , $ 9 DAT .F $ 2 , $ 8 DAT .F $ 3 , $ 7 DAT .F $ 4 , $ 6 DAT .F $ 5 , $ 5 DAT .F $ 6 , $ 4 DAT .F $ 7 , $ 3
It 's quite possible to have several FOR blocks inside each other .
The blocks can even contain EQU s inside them , which lets us create some very interesting code .
An even more useful feature is that the loop counter can be joined to a label with the & - operator .
This is most commonly used to avoid declaring labels twice , but it can be useful for various other purposes as well .
dest01 equ 1000 dest02 equ 1234 dest03 equ 1666 dest04 equ ( CORESIZE - 1111 ) jtable ix for 4 jump&ix spl dest&ix djn .b jump&ix , # ix rof
This would , after the FOR / ROF is parsed , become :
jtable jump01 spl dest01 djn .b jump01 , # 1 jump02 spl dest02 djn .b jump02 , # 2 jump03 spl dest03 djn .b jump03 , # 3 jump04 spl dest04 djn .b jump04 , # 4
As for what this would be useful for , well , that 's up to your own imagination .
The only warriors I 've seen using such complex expressions are some quickscanners .
The predefined constants can also be used with FOR / ROF , like this :
decoy foo for ( MAXLENGTH - CURLINE ) dat 1 , 1 rof end
This fills the remaining space in your warrior with DAT 1 , 1 .
Such a decoy can misdirect other warriors ' attacks , provided that you 've copied ( booted ) your own program away from the decoy .
Note that I 've used foo as a loop counter even though it is n't used for anything .
That 's because otherwise the MARS would consider decoy to be a loop counter instead of the label it should be .
Finally , here 's an example of some more creative ways of using FOR / ROF :
; redcode - 94 ; name Tricky ; author Ilmari Karonen ; strategy Some really complex warrior thingy ; strategy ( A self - explanatory example of conditional code ) ; assert CORESIZE == 8000 || CORESIZE == 800 ; assert MAXPROCESSES >= 256 && MAXPROCESSES
< 10000 ; assert MAXLENGTH >= 100 org start for 0 rof for ( CORESIZE == 8000 ) step equ normalstep rof for ( CORESIZE == 800 ) step equ tinystep rof for 0 ; strategy Since strategy and assert lines are really comments , they ; strategy will be parsed even inside FOR 0 / ROF blocks !
rof
The problem with the constants defined with EQU is that they 're , well , constants .
Once you 've defined them , you can't change their values .
This is fine for most purposes , but it makes a few tricks damn near impossible .
Luckily pMARS provides a few real variables for us to use .
Their use is a bit tricky and it's been a long time since I 've seen anyone really using them , but they do exist .
The variable names have only one letter , effectively limiting their number to 26 ( a through z ) .
Instead of using EQU , the variables are assigned their values with the = operator .
The tricky bit is that , to use the operator , one has to have an expression .
And since pMARS does not recognize the comma operator , it may be necessary to write dummy expressions .
Still , the variables can be useful .
For example , the following auto - generated Fibonacci sequence would probably be impossible without them .
dat # 1 , ( g=0 ) +( f=1 ) idx for 15 dat # idx+1 , ( f=f+g ) + ( ( g=f - g ) && 0 ) rof
Note how the expression ( g=f- g ) is " hidden " by ANDing it with 0 .
The system works because pMARS wo n't reorder the expression but always evaluates the left side of addition first , so that when the right side is being computed , f has already been increased .
Okay , I almost forgot .
There 's one more pseudo - Op left to describe .
It 's almost never used , but yes , it 's there .
The PIN stands for " P - space Identification Number " .
If two programs have the same number as their PIN , they will share their P - space .
This can be used to provide a sort of inter-process communication and even cooperation .
Unfortunately the strategy does n't seem to be worth the trouble it takes to create an affective and fast method of communication .
Of course , if you want to try it , go ahead .
You never know if it 'll be a success ...
If the program has no PIN , their P - space will always be private .
Even if two programs do share their P - space , the special read - only location 0 is always private .
If you did n't already know about them , the King of the Hill servers ( often called just hills ) are continuous Core War tournaments on the Internet .
Warriors are sent by e-mail — or entered on a web form — to the server , which pits them agains all the ( usually 10 - 30 ) programs already on the hill .
The program with the lowest total score falls off the hill , and the new warrior will replace it ( assuming it got a better score than at least one of the original programs ) .
There are also quite a few variations of this basic setup around , like " infinite " hills , diversity hills , etc .
Note that the hills typically pre-compile the warriors into load files before actually running them to save time .
This can lead to some of the predefined constants , such as WARRIORS , being incorrect , and thus to mysterious ; assert problems .
There are currently ( April 2012 ) two main KotH servers available :
KotH.org
The oldest and most famous currently active KotH server .
Currently hosts 7 hills with different settings , including two multiwarrior melee hills and two hills using the older Redcode ' 88 standard .
KOTH@SAL
Also hosts 7 hills with different parameters , including a Beginners ' hill where warriors are automatically pushed off after surviving 50 challenges to make it easier for new players to make it onto the hill .
Also , the Koenigstuhl server hosts 10 " infinite " hills for published warriors .
Warriors sent to these hills never get pushed off , so the hills keep getting bigger and bigger .
The Koenigstuhl also uses a recursive scoring argorithm that adjusts a warrior 's contribution to the scores based on its ranking .
The list above is not meant to be comprehensive , and is likely to become outdated .
A more detailed and up - to - date list of active KotH servers can ( currently ) be found at the corewar .

After Professor Gates , Why Pretend ?
NEW YORK -- The current national conversation about race and the police reminded me about an incident that occurred when I was in Uzbekistan .
As I walked into an apartment complex for an appointment I noticed the decomposing body of a man lying on the side of the road .
" How long as he been there ? " I asked my host .
" Three , maybe four days , " he said .
" What happened to him ? "
" Shot , maybe , " he shrugged .
" Or maybe hit by a car .
Something . "
I did n't bother to ask why no one had called the police .
I knew .
Calling the Uzbek militsia amounts to a request to be beaten , robbed or worse .
So desperate to avoid interaction with the police was another man I met that , when his mother died of old age at their home in Tashkent , he drove her body to the outskirts of town and deposited her in a field .
With the exception of New Orleans after Katrina , it 's not that bad here in the United States .
Consider Professor Henry Louis Gates : he should n't have been arrested by that Cambridge , Massachusetts police officer , but he came out of the experience physically unscathed .
Nevertheless , the Gates incident has illuminated some basic , strange assumptions about our society .
Cops think they have a constitutional right to be treated deferentially .
And black people think cops are nice to white people .
Yeah , well , take it from a white guy : we do n't like cops either .
Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts Jr. references " the African immigrant killed while reaching for his wallet , the Maryland man beaten senseless as he lay in bed , the Miami man beaten to death for speeding , the dozens of men jailed on manufactured evidence in Los Angeles and manufactured police testimony in Tulia , Texas , the man sodomized with a broomstick in New York .
Are we supposed to believe it coincidence that the men this happens to always happen to be black ? "
Of course not .
Blacks are 30 to 50 percent more likely to be arrested than whites for the same crime .
Their prison sentences are longer .
In the notorious " driving while black " New Jersey trooper case , African - Americans made up 70 percent of those randomly pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike -- but fewer than 17 percent of motorists .
Blacks are more likely to be stopped , frisked , arrested , beaten and murdered by the police than members of all other ethnic groups .
American racism against blacks remains systematic , pervasive , and murderous .
When there 's a policeman in the picture , it 's best to be white .
Still , whites and blacks have more in common than they think when it comes to their feelings about the fuzz .
When those flashing lights appear in the rearview mirror , even the biggest right - winger 's day is ruined .
No one should be less scared of cops than me .
I 'm white , clean - cut , middle - aged , invariably polite : " Hello , sir .
Is there a problem , officer ? "
Yet I can't point to a single positive experience I 've ever had with a cop .
Neutral ones , sure -- basic , cold , bureaucratic interactions .
But no great ones .
And lots and lots of negative ones .
Where to begin ?
I 'll never forget the New York traffic cop who stepped off the curb in front of my car on Madison Avenue and ordered me to turn right .
He wrote me up for illegal right turn .
" But you told me to , " I protested .
" Wrong place , wrong time , " he smirked .
$ 165 plus three points on my license .
I appealed .
The cop lied under oath .
The court believed him .
Or the Nevada highway patrolman who pulled me over .
I was doing 80 in a 70 .
He wrote me up at 100 mph .
My brother - in - law , never the suck - up , confirmed I was going 80 .
I was so furious -- the fine would have been $ 400 - - that I spent double that to fly back and challenge the ticket in court .
I won .
When my 20 - year - old self forgot to turn on my headlights as we pulled out of a parking lot while on a road trip with my druggie roommate , a Massachusetts cop pulled us over .
I could n't begrudge him probable cause ; pot smoke billowed out the window , " Cheech and Chong " - style , when I opened it .
Still , what came next was unforgivable : he handcuffed my arms so tight that the metal cut to the wrist bone .
( The scar lasted ten years . )
When we got out of the town lock - up the next morning , $ 400 was missing from my wallet .
( A judge , examining my wrist a few months later , dropped the charges .
My $ 400 , of course , was gone forever . )
An LAPD cop -- it bears mentioning that he was black -- arrested me for jaywalking on Melrose Avenue .
I was n't .
I did n't resist , but he roughed me up .
Upon releasing me , he chucked my wallet into the sewer , laughed and zoomed off on his motorcycle .
I filed a complaint , which the LAPD ignored .
And so on .
I admit it : I do n't like cops .
I like the idea of cops .
The specific people who actually are cops are the problem .
My theory is that cops should be drafted , not recruited .
After all , the kind of person who would want to become a police officer is precisely the kind of person who should not be allowed to work as one .
But I did n't start out harboring this prejudice .
It resulted from dozens of unpleasant interactions with law enforcement .
Race has long been a classic predictor of attitudes toward the police .
But high - profile cases of police brutality , coupled with over - the - top security measures taken since 9/11 that targeted whites as well as blacks , have helped bring the races together in their contempt for the police .
In 1969 , the Harris poll found that only 19 percent of whites thought cops discriminated against African - Americans .
Now 54 percent of whites think so .
Do n't worry , Professor Gates .
We do n't care what you said about the cop 's mama .
A lot of white guys see this thing your way .

Cascading Style Sheets were introduced 13 years ago , and the widely adopted CSS 2.1 standard has existed for 11 years now .
When we look at websites that were created 11 years ago , it ’s clear that we are a thousand miles away from that era .
It is quite remarkable how much Web development has evolved over the years , in a way we would never have imagined then .
So why is it that , when it comes to CSS , we ’re stuck in the past and so afraid of experimenting ?
Why is it that we still use inconvenient CSS hacks and JavaScript - dependent techniques for styling ?
Why ca n’t we make use of the rich CSS3 features and tools available in modern Web browsers and take the quality of our designs to the next level ?
It ’s time to introduce CSS3 features into our projects and not be afraid to gradually incorporate CSS3 properties and selectors in our style sheets .
Making our clients aware of the advantages of CSS3 ( and letting older deprecated browsers fade away ) is in our power , and we should act on it , especially if it means making websites more flexible and reducing development and maintenance costs .
In this article , we ’ll look at the advantages of CSS3 and some examples of how Web designers are already using it .
By the end , we ’ll know a bit of what to expect from CSS3 and how we can use its new features in our projects .
Please also consider reading our previous , related article :
Using Browser - Specific Properties
To use most CSS3 properties today , we have to use vendor - specific extensions together with the original properties .
The reason is that until now , browsers have only partially implemented new CSS3 properties .
Unfortunately , some properties may not even become W3C recommendations in the end , so it ’s important to target browser - specific properties by differentiating them from standard properties to ( and then replacing them with the standardized ones when they become superfluous ) .
The disadvantages to this approach are , of course , a messy style sheet and inconsistent design across Web browsers .
After all , we do not want to revive the need for proprietary browser hacks in our style sheets .
Internet Explorer ’s infamous < marquee > , < blink > and other tags were employed in many style sheets and became legendary in the 1990s ; they still make many existing websites inconsistent or even unreadable .
And we do n’t want to put ourselves in the same situation now , right ?
However , websites do not have to look exactly the same in all browsers .
And using browser - specific properties to achieve particular effects in certain browsers sometimes makes sense .
The most common extensions are the ones used for Webkit - based browsers ( for example , Safari ) , which start with - webkit- , and Gecko - based browsers ( for example , Firefox ) , which start with - moz- .
Konqueror ( - khtml- ) , Opera ( - o- ) and Internet Explorer ( - ms- ) have their own proprietary extensions .
As professional designers , we have to bear in mind that using these vendor - specific properties will make our style sheets invalid .
So putting them in the final version of a style sheet is rarely a sound idea for design purists .
But in some cases , like when experimenting or learning , we can at least consider including them in a style sheet together with standardized CSS properties .
1. Selectors
CSS Selectors are an incredibly powerful tool : they allow us to target specific HTML elements in our markup without having to rely on unnecessary classes , IDs and JavaScripts .
Most of them are n’t new to CSS3 but are not as widely used as they should be .
Advanced selectors can be helpful if you are trying to achieve a clean , lightweight markup and better separation of structure and presentation .
They can reduce the number of classes and IDs in the markup and make it easier for designers to maintain a style sheet .
Attribute selectors
Three new kinds of attribute selectors are a part of CSS3 specs :
[ att^= " value " ]
Matches elements to an attribute that starts with the specified value .
Matches elements to an attribute that starts with the specified value .
[ att $ = " value " ]
Matches elements to an attribute that ends with the specified value .
Matches elements to an attribute that ends with the specified value .
[ att * = " value " ]
Matches elements to an attribute that contains the specified value .
tweetCC uses an attribute selector to target links that have a title attribute ending in the words “ tweetCC ” :
a[ title$ = " tweetCC " ] { position : absolute ; top : 0 ; right : 0 ; display : block ; width : 140 px ; height : 140 px ; text - indent : - 9999 px ; }
Browser support :
The only browser that does n’t support CSS3 attribute selectors is IE6 .
Both IE7 and IE8 , Opera and Webkit - and Gecko - based browsers do .
So using them in your style sheet is definitely safe .
Combinators
The only new kind of combinator introduced in CSS3 is the general sibling selector .
It targets all siblings of an element that have the same parent .
For example , to add a gray border to all images that are a sibling of a particular div ( and both the div and the images should have the same parent ) , defining the following in your style sheet is enough :
div~img { border : 1 px solid #ccc ; }
Browser support :
All major browsers support the general sibling selector except our favorite : Internet Explorer 6 .
Pseudo - Classes
Probably the most extensive new addition to CSS are new pseudo - classes .
Here are some of the most interesting and useful ones :
: nth - child (n )
Lets you target elements based on their positions in a parent ’s list of child elements .
You can use a number , a number expression or the odd and even keywords ( perfect for Zebra - style table rows ) .
So , if you want to match a group of three elements after the forth element , you can simply use : name= " code " >:nth - child ( 3n+4 ) { background - color : #ccc ; }
: nth - last- child (n )
Follows the same idea as the previous selector , but matches the last children of a parent element .
For example , to target the last two paragraphs in a div , we would use the following selector : name= " code " > div p:nth- last-child ( - n+2 )
: last - child
Matches the last child of a parent , and is equivalent to name = " code " >:nth - last-child ( 1 )
: checked Matches elements that are checked ; for example , checked boxes .
: empty Matches elements that have no children or are empty .
: not (s ) Matches all elements that do not match the specified declaration (s ) .
For example , if we want to make all paragraphs that are n’t of the class “ lead ” to appear black , we would write : name = " code " > p:not ( [ class * = " lead " ] ) { color : black ; } .
On his website , Andrea Gandino uses the : last - child pseudo - selector to target the last paragraph of each blog post and apply a margin of 0 to it :
# primary . text p:last - child { margin : 0 ; }
Browser support : Webkit - based and Opera browsers support all new CSS3 pseudo - selectors .
Firefox 2 and 3 ( Gecko - based ) only support : not(s ) , : last- child , :only - child , :root , : empty , : target , : checked , : enabled and : disabled , but Firefox 3.5 will have wide support of CSS3 selectors .
Trident - based browsers ( Internet Explorer ) have virtually no support of pseudo - selectors .
Pseudo - Elements
The only pseudo - element introduced in CSS3 is ::selection .
It lets you target elements that have been highlighted by the user .
Browser support :
No current Internet Explorer or Firefox browsers support the ::selection pseudo - element .
Safari , Opera and Chrome do .
2. RGBA And Opacity
RGBA lets you specify not only the color but the opacity of an element .
Some browsers still do n’t support it , so it ’s good practice to specify before the RGBa color another color without transparency that older browsers will understand .
Tim Van Damme uses RGBA colors on hover effects on links
On his website , Tim Van Damme uses RGBA colors on hover effects ; for example , on the network links on his home page :
# networks li a :hover , #networks li a : focus { background : rgba( 164 , 173 , 183 , .15 ) ; }
When setting an RGBA color , we must specify the red , blue and green values either with an integer value between 0 and 255 or with percentages .
The alpha value should be between 0.0 and 1.0 ; for example , 0.5 for a 50 % opacity .
The difference between RGBA and opacity is that the former applies transparency only to a particular element , whereas the latter affects the element we target and all of its children .
Here is an example of how we would add 80 % opacity to a div :
div { opacity : 0.8 ; }
Browser support : RGBA is supported by Webkit - based browsers .
No Internet Explorer browser supports it .
Firefox 2 does’t support it either , but Firefox 3 does , as does Opera 9.5 .
Opacity is supported by Opera and Webkit - and Gecko - based browsers , but is not supported by either IE release .
3. Multi-Column Layout
This new CSS3 selector lets you achieve multi-column layouts without having to use multiple div s .
The browser interprets the properties and create the columns , giving the text a newspaper - like flow .
tweetCC uses CSS3 multi-column selector on its home page
tweetCC displays introductory text in four columns on its home page .
The four columns are n’t floated div s ; instead , the Web designer uses the CSS3 multi-column layout as follows :
.index #content div { - webkit - column - count : 4 ; - webkit-column-gap : 20 px ; -moz-column-count : 4 ; -moz-column-gap : 20 px ; }
We can define three things with this selector : the number of columns ( column - count ) , the width of each column ( column - width , not used in the example ) and the gap between columns ( column - gap ) .
If column - count is not set , the browser accommodates as many columns that fit in the available width .
To add a vertical separator between columns , we can use the column - rule property , which functions pretty much as a border property :
div { column - rule : 1 px solid # 00000 ; }
Browsers that do n’t support these properties render the content as simple text , as if there were no columns .
Related properties : column - break - after , column - break - before , column - span , column - fill .
Browser support : Multi-column layouts are supported by Safari 3 and 4 and Firefox 1.5 + .
4. Multiple Backgrounds
CSS3 lets you apply multiple layered backgrounds to an element using multiple properties such as background - image , background - repeat , background - size , background - position , background - origin and background - clip .
The easiest way to add multiple backgrounds to an element is to use the shorthand code .
You can specify all of the above properties in a single declaration , but the most commonly used are image , position and repeat :
div { background : url( example.jpg ) top left no - repeat , url ( example2.jpg ) bottom left no - repeat , url( example3.jpg ) center center repeat-y ; }
The first image will be the one “ closest ” to the user .
A more complex version of the same property would be :
div { background : url( example.jpg ) top left ( 100 % 2em ) no -repeat , url ( example2.jpg ) bottom left ( 100 % 2em ) no -repeat , url ( example3.jpg ) center center ( 10 em 10 em ) repeat-y ; }
In this case , ( 100 % 2em ) is the background - size value ; the background image in the top - left corner would stretch the full width of the div and be 2em high .
Because very few browsers support it , and because not displaying backgrounds on a website can really impair a website ’s visual impact , this is not a widely used CSS3 property .
However , it could greatly improve a Web designer ’s workflow and significantly reduce the amount of markup that would otherwise be needed to achieve the same effect .
Browser support : multiple backgrounds only work on Safari and Konqueror .
5. Word Wrap
The word - wrap property is used to prevent long words from overflowing .
It can have one of two values : normal and break - word .
The normal value ( the default ) breaks words only at allowed break points , like hyphens .
If break - word is used , the word can be broken where needed to fit the given space and prevent overflowing .
The WordPress admin area uses word - wrap in data tables .
In the WordPress admin area , the word - wrap property is used for elements in tables ; for example , in lists on Posts and Pages :
. widefat * { word - wrap : break - word ; }
Browser support : word - wrap is supported by Internet Explorer and Safari .
Firefox will support it in version 3.5 .
6. Text Shadow
Despite existing since CSS2 , text - shadow is not a widely used CSS property .
But it will very likely be widely adopted with CSS3 .
The property gives designers a new cross - browser tool to add dimension to designs and make text stand out .
You need to make sure , though , that the text in your design is readable in case the user ’s browser does n’t support advanced CSS3 properties .
Give the text and background color enough contrast in case the text - shadow property is n’t rendered or understood properly by the browser .
Beakapp uses the text - shadow property on its website : for the content area .
BeakApp.com uses the text - shadow property for the content area , adding depth and dimension to the text and making it stand out without the use of an image replacement technique .
This property is visible only in Safari and Google Chrome .
The CSS for the website ’s main navigation shows the following :
.signup_area p { text - shadow : rgba( 0,0,0,.8 ) 0 1px 0 ; }
Here , we have the shadow color ( using RGBA , see above ) , followed by the right ( x coordinate ) and bottom ( y coordinate ) offset , and finally the blur radius .
To apply multiple shadows to a text , separate the shadows with a comma .
For example :
p { text - shadow : red 4px 4px 2 px , yellow - 4px - 4px 2 px , green - 4px 4px 2 px ; }
Browser support : Webkit - based browsers and Opera 9.5 support text - shadow .
Internet Explorer does n’t support it , and Firefox will only support it in version 3.5 .
7. @font-face - Attribute
Despite being one of the most highly anticipated CSS3 features ( even though it ’s been around since CSS2 ) , @font - face is still not as widely adopted on the Web as other CSS3 properties .
This is due mainly to font licensing and copyright issues : embedded fonts are easily downloaded from the Web , a major concern to type foundries .
However , a solution to the licensing issues seems to be on the way .
TypeKit promises to come up with a solution that would make it easier for designers and type foundries to agree on licensing issues that would significantly enrich the typography in Web design and make the @font - face attribute usable in practice .
Mozilla Labs JetPack website resorts to the font - face rule to use the DroidSans typeface
One of the few websites that use the property is the new JetPack MozillaLabs .
@font - face{ font - family : ' DroidSans ' ; src : url ( '../ fonts/DroidSans.ttf ' ) format ( ' truetype ' ) ; }
To use embedded fonts on your websites , you have to declare each style separately ( for example , normal , bold and italic ) .
Make sure to only use fonts that have been licensed for such use on the Web and to give the designer credit when required .
After the @font - face rule , you can call the font with a normal font - family property in your style sheet :
p { font - family : " DroidSans " ; }
If a browser does n’t support @font - face , it will revert to the next font specified in the font - family property ( CSS font stacks ) .
This may be okay for some websites , if the @font - face font is a luxury for supported browsers ; but if the font plays a major role in the design or is a key part of the visual identity of the company , you will probably want to use another solution , such as sIFR or Cufón .
Bear in mind , though , that these tools are more appropriate for headings and short passages of text , and copying and pasting this kind of content is difficult and not user - friendly .
Would n’t it be nice to have such type for body copy on the Web ?
Dave Shea experiments with Cufón and Museo Sans. Beautiful !
Browser support : @font - face is supported by Safari 3.1+.
Internet Explorer supports it if EOT fonts are used .
Opera 10 and Firefox 3.5 should support it .
8. Border Radius
Border - radius adds curved corners to HTML elements without background images .
Currently , it is probably the most widely used CSS3 property for the simple reason that rounded corners are just nice to have and are n’t critical to design or usability .
Instead of adding cryptic JavaScript or unnecessary HTML markup , just add a couple of extra properties in CSS and hope for the best .
The solution is cleaner and more efficient and can save you from having to spend a couple of hours finding clever browser workarounds for CSS and JavaScript - based rounded corners .
Sam Brown ’s blog using border - radius on headings , categories and links .
On his website , Sam Brown uses the border - radius property heavily on headings , links and div s.
Achieving this effect with images would be time - consuming .
This is one of the reasons why using CSS3 properties in our projects is such an important step towards efficiency in Web development .
To add rounded corners to category links , Sam uses the following CSS snippet :
h2 span { color : # 1a1a1a ; padding : .5em ; - webkit - border - radius : 6 px ; - moz - border - radius : 6 px ; }
We can go one step further and add the original CSS3 property and Konqueror proprietary extension , making it :
h2 span { color : # 1a1a1a ; padding : .5em ; - webkit - border - radius : 6 px ; - moz - border - radius : 6 px ; - khtml - border - radius : 6 px ; border - radius : 6 px ; }
If we want to apply the property to certain corners of our element , we can target each corner separately :
div { - moz - border - radius - topright : 6px ; - moz- border- radius - topleft : 6px ; -moz-border-radius - bottomright : 6px ; -moz-border-radius - bottomleft : 6px ; - webkit-border-top-right- radius : 6px ; - webkit-border-top-left-radius : 6px ; - webkit-border-bottom - right - radius : 6 px ; - webkit - border - bottom - left - radius : 6 px ; border - top - right - radius : 6 px ; border - top - left - radius : 6 px ; border - bottom - right - radius : 6 px ; border - bottom - left - radius : 6 px ; }
Browser support : border - radius is supported by Webkit - and Gecko - based browsers but not by any version of Internet Explorer or Opera .
9. Border Image
The border - image property allows you to specify an image for the border of an element , freeing you from the usual solid , dotted and other border styles .
This property gives designers a better tool with which to consistently style the borders of design elements , being better than the background - image property ( for advanced designs ) or rigid default border styles .
We can also explicitly define how a border should be scaled or tiled .
The SpoonGraphics blog uses the border - image property for its images borders
On the SpoonGraphis blog , border - image is used for the images borders as follows :
# content . post img { border : 6 px solid # f2e6d1 ; - webkit-border-image : url( main - border.png ) 6 repeat ; - moz- border-image : url( main - border.png ) 6 repeat ; border - image : url( main - border.png ) 6 repeat ; }
To define the border - image , we must specify the image location , which part of the image should be cropped and used for each side of the element and how the image should be scaled and tiled .
To create a div that uses the image below as its border , we would use the following code ( we will add in the Opera and Konqueror extensions for this example ) :
div { border - width : 18px 25 px 25 px 18 px ; - webkit-border-image : url( example.png ) 18 25 25 18 stretch stretch ; - moz- border-image : url( example.png ) 18 25 25 18 stretch stretch ; -o- border-image : url( example.png ) 18 25 25 18 stretch stretch ; - khtml-border-image : url( example.png ) 18 25 25 18 stretch stretch ; border - image : url( example.png ) 18 25 25 18 stretch stretch ; }
The last value of this property can be stretch ( default ) , round ( only a whole number of repeated images will fit the space allowed ) or repeat .
In our example , the top , bottom , left and right border images are stretched .
If we want only the top and bottom sides to stretch , we would use this CSS :
div { ( ... ) border - image : url( example.png ) 18 25 25 18 stretch repeat ; }
We can also target each corner separately if we want to use a different image for each :
div { border - top - image : url( example.png ) 5 5 stretch ; border - right - image : url( example.png ) 5 5 stretch ; border - bottom - image : url( example.png ) 5 5 stretch ; border - left- image : url( example.png ) 5 5 stretch ; border - top - left - image : url( example.png ) 5 5 stretch ; border - top - right - image : url( example.png ) 5 5 stretch ; border - bottom - left- image : url( example.png ) 5 5 stretch ; border - bottom - right - image : url( example.png ) 5 5 stretch ; }
If a browser does n’t support the border - image property , it will ignore it and only apply the other defined border properties , such as border - width and border - color .
Browser support : border - image is currently only supported by Webkit - based browsers .
Support in the next release of Firefox is not certain .
10 . Box Shadow
The box - shadow property adds shadows to HTML elements without extra markup or background images .
Like the text - shadow property , it enhances the detail of a design ; and because it does n’t really affect the readability of content , it could be a good way to add that extra touch .
10to1 uses the box - shadow property for its navigation background and hover states .
10to1 adds a simple shadow to its navigation area and uses the property for a hover effect on the navigation links :
#navigation { - webkit - box - shadow : 0 0 10 px #000 ; - moz - box - shadow : 0 0 10px #000 ; } #navigation li a :hover , #navigation li a : focus { - webkit - box - shadow : 0 0 5px # 111 ; - moz-box - shadow : 0 0 5 px # 111 ; }
The box - shadow property can have multiple values : horizontal offset , vertical offset , blur radius , spread radius and shadow color .
Horizontal and vertical offset and shadow color are the most commonly used .
To apply a red shadow positioned four pixels to the right and bottom of a div , with no blur , we would need the following code :
div { - moz - box - shadow : 4px 4px 0 # f00 ; - webkit - box - shadow : 4px 4px 0 # f00 ; box - shadow : 4px 4px 0 # f00 ; }
Browser support : box - shadow is currently supported only by Webkit - based browsers , but the upcoming Firefox 3.5 will very likely support it as well .
11 . Box Sizing
According to CSS 2.1 specifications , when calculating the overall dimensions of a box , the borders and padding of the element should be added to the width and height .
But legacy browsers are well known for interpreting this specification in their own and quite creative ways .
The box - sizing property lets you specify how the browser calculates the width and height of an element .
WordPress uses the border - box property in all input fields ( text type ) and text area elements in the admin panel .
The WordPress admin area demonstrates this property in all its input tags with a text type and textarea tags ( among other elements ) :
input [ type =" text " ] , textarea { - moz - box - sizing : border - box ; - webkit - box - sizing : border - box ; - ms - box - sizing : border - box ; box - sizing : border - box ; }
The third property ( - ms- box - sizing ) only works in Internet Explorer 8 .
With other selectors , the WordPress style sheet also adds the Konqueror property : - khtml - box - sizing .
The box - sizing property can have one of two values : border - box and content - box .
Content - box renders the width as specified in CSS 2.1 .
Border - box subtracts the padding and border from the specified width and height ( as done by legacy browsers ) .
Browser support : box - sizing is supported by IE8 , Opera and Gecko- and Webkit - based browsers .
12 . Media Queries
Media queries let you define different styles for different devices based on their capabilities .
For example , you may want your website ’s sidebar to appear under the main content when viewed on devices with a viewport narrower than 480 pixels , in which case it should n’t be floated and displayed on the right side :
# sidebar { float : right ; display : inline ; /* IE Double - Margin Bugfix */ } @media all and ( max - width : 480 px ) { # sidebar { float : none ; clear : both ; } }
You can also target devices with color screens :
a { color : grey ; } @media screen and ( color ) { a { color : red ; } }
The possibilities are endless .
This property is useful because you no longer have to write separate style sheets for different devices , nor do you have to use JavaScript to determine the capabilities and properties of each user ’s browser .
A more popular JavaScript - based solution to achieve a flexible layout would be to use an adaptive fluid layout , making the layout more responsive to the user ’s browser resolution .
Browser support : Media queries are supported by Webkit - based browsers and Opera .
Firefox plans to support them in version 3.5 .
Internet Explorer currently does n’t support them and does n’t plan to support them in upcoming versions .
13 . Speech
The speech module in CSS3 lets you specify the speech style of screen readers .
You can control various aspects of the speech , such as :
voice - volume
Set a volume using a number from 0 to 100 ( 0 being silence ) , percentages or a keyword ( silent , x - soft , soft , medium , loud and x-loud ) .
Set a volume using a number from 0 to 100 ( 0 being silence ) , percentages or a keyword ( , , , , and ) . voice - balance Control which channel sound comes from ( if the user ’s sound system supports stereo ) .
Control which channel sound comes from ( if the user ’s sound system supports stereo ) .
Speak Instruct the screen reader to spell out particular words , digits or punctuation .
Available keywords are none , normal , spell - out , digits , literal - punctuation , no-punctuation and inherit .
, , , , , and .
Pauses and rests
Set a pause or rest before or after an element ’s content is spoken .
You can use either time units ( for example , “ 2s ” for 2 seconds ) or keywords ( none , x - weak , weak , medium , strong and x-strong ) .
, , , , and ) .
Cues
Use sounds to delimit particular elements and control their volume .

voice - rate Control the speed at which elements are spoken .
This can be defined as a percentage or keyword : x - slow , slow , medium , fast and x -fast .
Control the speed at which elements are spoken .
This can be defined as a percentage or keyword : , , , and .
voice - stress Indicate any emphasis that should be applied , using different keywords : none , moderate , strong and reduced .
For example , to tell a screen reader to read all h2 tags in a female voice , from the left speaker , in a soft tone and followed by a particular sound , set the CSS as follows :
h2 { voice - family : female ; voice - balance : left ; voice - volume : soft ; cue - after : url ( sound.au ) ; }
Unfortunately , this property has very little support now but is definitely worth keeping in mind so that we might improve the accessibility of our websites in future .
Browser support : Currently , only Opera browsers for Windows XP and 2000 support some of the speech module properties .
To use them , use the - xv- prefix ; for example , - xv-voice - balance : right .
Conclusion
CSS3 properties can greatly improve your workflow , making some of the most time - consuming CSS tasks a breeze and allowing for better , cleaner and more lightweight markup .
Some properties are still not widely supported , even by the most recent browsers , but that does n’t mean we should n’t experiment with them or give visitors with modern browsers advanced features and CSS styling .
In this regard , keep in mind that educating our clients is both useful and necessary : websites do n’t have to look exactly the same in every browser , and if a difference does n’t negatively affect the aesthetics or usability of a website , it should be considered .
If we continue to waste valuable time and money making every detail pixel - perfect ( instead of adopting more flexible and future - oriented solutions ) , users wo n’t have an incentive to upgrade their browsers , in which case we would have to wait a long time before older browsers become legacy browsers and robust modern browsers become the standard .
The earlier we experiment with and adapt new CSS3 properties , the earlier they will be supported by popular browsers and the earlier we ’ll be able to use them widely .

With the formation of the Confederate States of America in early 1861 , one of the first orders of business was to create a flag for the new nation .
The Committee on the Flag and Seal was formed , and given this task .
There were basically two schools of thought in creating the flag .
One was to create something that looked very similar to the existing United States flag .
The second school of thought was to create a flag very different than the existing United States flag .
At the time , there was still feelings of allegiance to the original US flag , and popular opinion was lining up in support of a flag that was similar to the familiar United States flag .
Such a flag was created and proposed .
This flag is pictured at right .
With the controversy abounding over the Confederate Flag , we thought it would be appropriate to include this brief history on the origin and evolution of the flag .
I have had two abortions .
The first one was when I was twenty - seven .
I was playing professional beach volleyball .
I was playing volleyball eight hours a day and I spent two hours a day at the gym .
I noticed that I was getting tired more easily , but I thought it meant I needed to train harder .
Then one weekend , a doctor friend on a visit saw me drop a plate one day , and a vase the next .
I told her my hands just gave out because they were so tired .
She said I was anemic .
Then she said , “ Maybe you 're pregnant . ”
“ I 'm not , ” I said .
“ I have a regular period . ”
It turns out , though , that you can have a regular period and still be pregnant .
And I was .
Fourteen weeks .
My friend said , “ Schedule the abortion now .
You 're already late for it . ”
I did n't do anything .
I was in shock .
My boyfriend was in shock .
Neither of us had ever had a pregnancy .
I could n't believe the whole process actually worked , to be honest .
I told my mom I was pregnant .
She said , “ Get an abortion . ”
I did n't say anything .
I was n't really thinking I had any choices .
I did n't have a job that could support a child .
And I was n't sure if I was planning to marry my boyfriend , although we were living together .
I knew that I had big ideas for my life and I had n't figured things out yet .
My mom got militant .
“ You 'll destroy your career possibilities . ”
She riffed on this theme for a week , calling me every night .
Her passion is understandable .
My mom took a job when I was young because she hated being home with kids .
She endured interview questions like , “ Does your husband want you away from home working ? ”
She was one of the first women to become an executive at her Fortune 500 company .
She blazed trails so I could have career goals that required an abortion to preserve .
Here 's what else happened : Other women called .
It turned out that many , many women I knew had had an abortion .
This is not something women talk about .
I mean , I had no idea how ubiquitous the procedure was , at least in my big-city , liberal , Jewish world .
Each of those women told me that I should get an abortion so that I could keep my options open .
“ You 're a smart girl .
You can do anything with your life right now .
Do n't ruin it . ”
My boyfriend was laying low .
He was no slouch when it came to pro-choice politics and he knew it was , ultimately , my decision .
But the minute I said I would get an abortion , he was driving me to Planned Parenthood .
You had to go once to set up the appointment , and then go back .
When I went back , I had a panic attack .
I was on the table , in a hospital gown , screaming .
The nurse asked me if I was a religious Christian .
The boyfriend asked me if I was aware that my abortion would be basically illegal in seven more days .
I could n't stop screaming .
I was too scared .
I felt absolutely sick that I was going to kill a baby .
And , now that I know more about being a mother , I understand that hormones had already kicked in to make me want to keep the baby .
We left .
No abortion .
My boyfriend started panicking by suddenly staying really late at work and going out with friends a lot .
I stopped playing volleyball because I got tired so quickly .
People kept calling me :
They said , “ Think about how you 'll support the child .
Think about what you 'll do if your boyfriend leaves you .
You 're all alone in LA with no family .
How will you take care of yourself ? ”
People gave me advice :
Get a job .
Once you have established yourself in a career , you 'll feel much better about having kids .
Figure out where you fit in the world .
Get a job , then get married , and then have kids .
I scheduled another abortion .
But it was past the time when Planned Parenthood will do an abortion .
Now it was a very expensive one at a clinic that seemed to cater to women coming from Christian countries in South America .
I knew that if I did not go through with it this time , no one would do the abortion .
I was too far along .
So I did it .
I went to sleep with a baby and woke up without one .
Groggy .
Unsure about everything .
Everything in the whole world .
People think abortion is such an easy choice–they say , “ Do n't use abortion as birth control . ”
Any woman who has had one will tell you how that is such crazy talk .
Because an abortion is terrible .
You never stop thinking about the baby you killed .
You never stop thinking about the guy you were with when you killed the baby you made with him .
You never stop wondering .
So the second time I got pregnant , I thought of killing myself .
My career was soaring .
I was 30 and I felt like I had everything going for me — great job , great boyfriend , and finally , for the first time ever , I had enough money to support myself .
I hated that I put myself in the position of either losing all that or killing a baby .
I did n't tell anyone I was pregnant .
I knew what they 'd say .
So I completely checked out emotionally .
I scheduled the abortion like I was on autopilot .
I told my boyfriend at the last minute and told him not to come with me .
He said forget it .
He 's coming with me .
I remember staring at the wall .
Telling myself to stop thinking of anything .
The doctor asked me , “ Do you understand what 's going to happen ? ”
I said yes .
That 's all I remember .
I got two abortions to preserve my career .
To keep my options open .
To keep my aspirations within reach .
I bought into the idea that kids undermine your ability to build an amazing career .
And here I am , with the amazing career .
But also , here I am with two kids .
So I know a bit about having kids and a career .
And I want to tell you something :
You do n't need to get an abortion to have a big career .
Women who want big careers want them because something deep inside you drives you to change the world , lead a revolution , break new barriers .
It does n't matter whether you have kids now or later , because they will always make your career more difficult .
There is no time in your life when you are so stable in your work that kids wo n't create an earthquake underneath that confidence .
I think about the men I was with when I had the abortions .
They were not bad men .
One is my ex-husband .
So much of life is a gamble , and I think I might have had as good a chance of staying together with the first guy as I did with my ex-husband .
And I am not sure that my life would have turned out worse if I had had kids early .
I am not sure it would have turned out better .
I 'm not even sure it would have been that different .
You never know , not really .
There is little certainty .
But there are some certain truths :
It 's very hard to have an abortion .
And , there is not a perfect time to have kids .
And I wonder , are there other women out there who had abortions in the name of their career and their potential ?
What do those women think now ?
A breach at Network Solutions has exposed details for more than 500,000 credit and debit cards after hackers penetrated a system it used to deliver e-commerce services and planted software that diverted transactions to a rogue server , the hosting company said late Friday .
The unauthorized software was in place from March 12 to June 8 and affected transactions Network Solutions processed on behalf of 4,343 merchant websites that mostly belonged to small businesses , spokeswoman Susan Wade said .
While the company discovered the software in early June , it waited until the close of business Friday to disclose the breach .
Wade said it took until July 13 for forensics investigators to crack the code and understand how it worked .
" We have been working around the clock to get this announcement ready , " she told The Register .
" We 're really making an effort to be forthcoming .
This is really tough on our customers that were impacted , and we feel very badly . "
Network Solutions is working with undisclosed law enforcement agencies to figure out who is responsible for the breach and how it happened .
In all details for 573,928 card holders may have been siphoned in the attack , which affected different merchant websites at different times over the three - month period that the rogue software was in place .
So far , there are no indications that any of the exposed cards have been misused .
Network Solutions has offered to foot the bill for notifying affected cardholders so those costs do n't have to be born by the merchants who used the company 's e-commerce service .
In Most US states , laws require such notices to be made when breaches are discovered that expose credit card information .
The company is also making 12 months of fraud - monitoring services available free of charge to cardholders whose information was exposed .
Affected merchants and cardholders can enroll by visiting this site , which walks them through the process . ®
E -commerce web design and development presents some unique challenges that you wo n’t always face with other types of web design .
For sites that exist primarily to sell products , it ’s very easy to look at sales and have a measuring stick to use when evaluating the success of the website .
However , there are any number of factors that can influence the success of an e-commerce site , and identifying areas of strength and weakness is not always so simple .
In this article we ’ll look at nine specific factors that are generally present on well - designed e-commerce websites .
1. Ease of Navigation
When attempting to sell products to visitors , the first requirement for selling a product is that the shopper has to be able to find specifically what he or she is looking for .
Effective navigation is important to any website , but it ’s especially critical for e-commerce sites .
Lost visitors will result in lost sales , so every effort should be made to have a site with clear , logical navigation .
E -commerce sites often face considerable challenges with navigation because of the number of products that are presented on the site .
Large sites , such as those of department stores , have to be especially careful with navigation , because finding what you want will usually become increasingly difficult with more options .
One factor to consider is how the average visitor will attempt to find a particular product .
What makes sense to the designer or to the company owing the site may not be the same path that the average visitor would take to find a product .
Sufficient user testing is extremely helpful for identifying potential navigational issues .
2. The Design Does Not Overpower the Products
The focus of an e-commerce site should be on the products that are available for purchase .
A design that is extravagant for no legitimate reason will usually do more harm than good , as it will draw attention to the design of the site and away from the products .
Yesterday we posted a showcase of e-commerce sites with a minimal design approach .
There sites have chosen to keep the design simple so that the products do n’t have to compete for the attention of visitors .
3. Easy Checkout
User experience on e-commerce sites is critical to success .
If the checkout process involves too many steps or is confusing , shoppers will wind up abandoning their cart with items left unpurchased .
Ideally , the checkout should involve a minimal amount of steps and should be as easy as possible for shoppers .
4. Branded
Many shoppers are influenced in their purchasing decisions by the brand , and so the need to establish a strong brand is import for both online and offline selling .
In the cases of stores that sell online as well as in physical locations , the website is only a part of an overall branding strategy .
In these cases the website should work well with other branding efforts of the company so that customers feel comfortable on the website .
5 . The Design Style Matches the Products
Like any other type of website , e-commerce sites can have countless different design styles .
However , when designing an e-commerce site it ’s important to consider the style of the products that will be available on the site .
This is a little bit more relevant for smaller stores with a specific type of product and for websites of a particular brand or company that has established a certain identity .
If the design style does not match very well with the particular products that are for sale , there will be a disconnect that exists and visitors may have a hard time relating to products and determining if it is right for them .
6. Showcases the Most Popular Products
Many e-commerce sites make an effort to showcase items that are likely to be of interest to visitors , obviously with the intention of helping visitors to find something that they will buy .
A number of sites are using a large area on the homepage that they can use to promote current sales , new product lines , or whatever will generate interest .
On theses sites , this area will often be updated frequently , or it may include some type of slideshow .
7. Promotes Related Products
One of the keys to a successful e-commerce store is the promotion of related products that the customer may also be interested in .
Sometimes you will see related products listed and shown on item detail pages , and other times you will see suggestions being made after adding an item to your cart .
Promoting the right products that buyers are likely to be interested in is key regardless of the approach that is used .
8. Effective , Accurate Product Photos
Selling online is different than selling in a physical store because the buyer cannot touch the product or see it in person before making a buying decision ( unless they have seen it somewhere else ) .
Providing quality photos that accurately portray the product can help to overcome this challenge and can make the buying decision easier on visitors .
9. Effective Site - Wide Search
Although navigation is critical for making it easy on visitors to find what they want , there is still the need to allow them to search .
Some visitors will still have trouble finding a specific product even with good navigation , and with larger e-commerce sites it may often be more feasible to simply do a search than to move through several layers of links .
The type of search and the amount of options that should be offered to narrow the search should be based on the size of the site and the items that are available .
Examples :
Ride Four Ever
Mom & Popcorn
The Affair
K2 Snowboarding
Storenvy
Edge of Urge
’ 47
Levi’s
Saddleback Leather Company
Kate Spade
Yellow Bird Project
Clever Craft

Despite the fact that bandwidth costs for ISPs are dropping as fast as user traffic rates rise , many ISPs still face congestion problems at the last mile , and Bell Canada is no exception , as internal data recently showed .
Not content with simply throttling P2P traffic for ten hours a day , the company has just announced plans to impose usage - based billing on the small ISPs that buy wholesale access from Bell .
In some cases , the " free " monthly limit will be as low as 2GB .
No , that 's not a typo .
News of the move began to percolate through online forums this week as small ISPs expressed outrage over a practice that could make them even less competitive with Bell , and it then expanded ( a bit ) into blogs and outlets like the CBC .
The Canadian government requires
Bell to lease access to other firms because of its infrastructure dominance , but Bell recently extended its P2P throttling techniques from its own ISP service ( Sympatico ) to wholesalers as well .
This spawned its own outrage , as the small ISPs argued that Bell was forcibly removing one of the main ways that they could distinguish themselves from Sympatico ( no throttling ! ) .
The news that Bell would institute caps on new wholesale user accounts was seen as another attempt to undermine the small ISPs , which will soon have one less selling point ( unlimited downloads ! ) .
Some wholesalers complain that this simply makes them , in effect , into mere resellers of Bell 's own service .
Fairness is in the eye of the beholder
In Bell 's view , however , the move is about fairness .
To understand why , let 's take a step back : when small ISPs purchase wholesale access from Bell , they do n't pay by the amount of information transferred .
Instead , they purchase " aggregation links " that are rated by capacity ( i.e. , size of the tube ) rather than bits transferred ( i.e. , the amount of water that is pushed through the tube each month ) .
So , for purposes of example , assume an ISP purchases a 1 Gbps wholesale link from Bell Canada .
In a given month , the ISP could push anywhere between 0GB and 324,000GB — and the ISP would pay the same amount to Bell .
It 's then up to the ISP to make sure this capacity is enough to serve its users ; if not , the ISP buys additional links .
Bell claims that these links are seeing much heavier usage than in the past .
The company tells
Ars it plans to shift to usage - based billing ( UBB ) soon in an attempt to deal with the " tremendous growth ( and expected continued growth ) of bandwidth consumption . "
Bell 's plan is to offer new wholesale accounts a set amount of included " free " transfer ; after hitting that limit , ISPs ( and therefore users ) would have to pay by the amount of data transferred .
For 512 K bps users ( the lowest speed ) , the limit is 2 GB a month ; for 5 M bps users , the limit is 60 GB a month , according to the CBC .
Bell tells us that UBB is " just one element , along with investment and network management , of our three - pronged approach to insuring our network continues to operate at optimum levels . "
Which , rather surprisingly , sounds like Bell will continue to throttle P2P apps .
" Let the traffic flow "
The entire idea is of course anathema to the ISPs .
Tom Copeland , who heads the coalition of small ISPs known as CAIP , tells
Ars that UBB is the wrong way to go .
It 's " not a carrier class method of doing business , " he says .
" Carriers buy capacity on networks and they utilize that capacity in a manner that allows for the efficient delivery of products and services .
The wholesale vendor of such a facility should n't interfere with the delivery of the product or service nor should they apply what amounts to a surcharge when an end user decides to make use of the product or service . "
But if Bell is going to implement UBB , Copeland calls on the company to remove " speed profiles and traffic shaping from the equation .
Let traffic flow . "
Bell Canada has no real interest in offering the services that make its own competition possible , though , and is in fact asking the government to remove the mandatory wholesale access provisions altogether due to all the " competition " in the ISP space .
Without line - sharing , of course , much of that competition could disappear , as it did in the US when telco line - sharing rules were repealed .
IT 'S hardly a new charge against atheists , but it has come up again several times recently in the blogosphere : that today 's secularists , atheists , anti-theists and whatnot , including the publicly active ones , are " just as fundamentalist as the fundamentalists " .
It appears again and again in reader e-mails sent to Andrew Sullivan 's blog ( currently in the hands of guest - bloggers ) .
This trope needs to be laughed out of existence , immediately .
First and most salient , as Oxford 's Tim Garton Ash writes , " there are no al - Darwinia brigades making bombs in secret laboratories in north Oxford . "
Yes , sigh , many atheists like Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennet are just as convinced that there is no God as Osama bin Laden is convinced that there is no god but God and Muhammad is his messenger .
On one hand you have faith that makes people fly planes into buildings , genitally mutilate young girls , murder abortion doctors ( in church ) , stone adultresses , outlaw certain forms of consensual sex or even just make it impossible to buy beer on Sunday in some states .
On the other hand there is the atheist " faith " that makes people write smug op - eds , put ads on buses ( see photo ) , file frivolous lawsuits against nativity scenes on public property , and the like .
Show me what harm in the world a prominent atheist intellectual has done .
Ah , but Stalin and Hitler and Mao !
Give me a break .
Sure , they were atheists .
But they did not kill because they were atheists .
Hitler was a fanatical racist and Mao and Stalin fanatical communists , and they killed in the name of those fundamentalist philosophies .
If atheism somehow correlated with fanaticism , Denmark would be the most violently radical place on earth .
Instead , as Daniel Dennett notes , it is one of the safest , richest and happiest .
Finally , there is the bogus equivalent with atheist certainty and religious certainty .
Yes , Answers in Genesis is certain that the world is 6,000 years old , and Richard Dawkins is certain that it is n't .
The fact is that only one of them is right , and I 'm going to say it right here : it 's Mr Dawkins .
There is a difference — call it a fundamental one — between being certain and wrong and being certain and right .
Atheists can be smug and annoying .
So can Christians and Jews , Yankee fans and Red Sox fans .
The claims of religious writers and atheist writers should be debated on their merits .
But let 's can the " fundamentalist atheist " meme .
The fundamentalist mindset is defined as one that cannot be changed by evidence .
As Sam Harris , another atheist , has said , God could easily prove all the world 's atheists wrong .
( Mr Harris 's challenge : " I have just written a 30 - digit number on a scrap of paper and hidden it in my office .
If God tells you [ or any of our readers ] what this number is , I will be appropriately astounded and will publicize the results of this experiment to the limit of my abilities ...
Hint to the Creator : I 'm thinking of an even number , and it 's not 927459757074561008328610835528 " . )
Until god does prove the atheists wrong with an indisputable miracle and Messrs Harris , Dawkins and Dennett still cling to their atheism , fundamentalist religion and " fundamentalist " atheism can not be put on the same footing .
And until those al - Darwinia brigades arrive and start beheading people , " fundamentalist " is a slander against athiest journalists and academics whose sharpest weapon is a pen .

Arabic names of Palestinian cities inside Israeli borders and Jerusalem changed to Hebrew IMEMC News Wednesday July 22 , 2009
In a recent and bold move by the Netanyahu government , the Arabic names of cities within Israeli borders and Jerusalem are being changed to Hebrew .
The Israeli Minister of Transport has been charged with the task of erasing the Arabic names in Israel , in what has been condemned as a bigoted attempt to deconstruct the Palestinian legacy , especially in Jerusalem .
The Arabic name of Al Quds is also set to be changed , as is Nazareth , and other cities within Israel .
Palestinian Chief of Justice has responded by declaring this as a means of erasing the Arab idenity in Jerusalem and greater Israel .
The Chief Justice and Chairman of the Comission in Support of Islamic and Christian Sanctities in Jerusalem has made similar statements , and calling it an act of racism .
In addition to these implications , it is against international law to make such changes to a city that is still constested territory .
From the creation of the Israeli state , Jerusalem has been a heavily contested area , subjected to many changes , land confisaction , home demolitions , evacuations , and settlements to cut the city off from its Palestinian heritage .

Iran 's endogenous civil - rights movement needs international solidarity , not political meddling .
Academics , universities and non-governmental organizations can help .
“ Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb - bomb , Iran , ” sang John McCain to the tune of The Beach Boys ' Barbara Ann at a US presidential campaign event in 2007 .
McCain , a Republican senator for Arizona , later insisted he was joking .
Yet the spur - of - the - moment instinct behind the ' joke ' sums up aptly the tendency of some politicians both in the West and in Iran to demonize each other 's peoples as a faceless enemy .
But that kind of demonization has become passé over the past few weeks , as images of mass protests against Iran 's allegedly fraudulent presidential election on 12 June have allowed many in the West to see faces of ordinary Iranians who are far from the crude stereotype .
And many Iranians , although suspicious of the reactions of foreign governments , have been struck by the worldwide outpouring of empathy for their quest for fundamental civil liberties and self - determination .
“ The research community should do everything possible to promote continued contacts with colleagues in Iran . ”
In the past , unfortunately , Western governments and research organizations have bought into former US president George W. Bush 's ' axis of evil ' rhetoric by discriminating against Iranian researchers , denying or delaying visa applications , subjecting them to disproportionate vetting and showing lacklustre interest in collaborating .
Moreover , the international scientific community has been laggard and passive in responding to the current situation .
But Iranian scientists say that the solidarity of the international academic and scientific community is needed now more than ever .
They are quick to caution that the last thing the civil - rights movement needs is overt or covert support from Western governments .
That would simply play into the Iranian regime 's portrayal of the home - grown uprising as a foreign - inspired velvet revolution .
The consensus among Iranian researchers is that the only steps that foreign governments should take are to refuse to recognize Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president , and to condemn human - rights violations such as denying Iranians their constitutional right to freedom of peaceful assembly .
Much more useful , they say , is broader pressure from Western academics , their institutions and other non-governmental organizations , which can impartially yet forcefully endorse Iranians ' human rights , and condemn attacks on Iran 's universities and the detention of Iranian academics ( see Nature doi:10.1038/news.2009.597 ; 2009 ) .
Non-governmental assistance
Research bodies and universities — and perhaps a few Nobel laureates — need to speak out louder .
They should encourage , rather than discourage , collaboration , and replace past discrimination by welcoming Iranian researchers and students .
With the continuing Iranian crackdown on academics , for example , an exodus of young researchers can be expected .
They will need the kind of assistance being provided by organizations such as the Scholars at Risk Network based in New York , an international network of universities and colleges that helps to find work for researchers seeking political asylum anywhere in the world .
The international research community should find ways to support and expand such efforts .
Likewise , with Iran 's decision on Monday to confirm the re-election — albeit under a cloud of illegitimacy — of Ahmadinejad , who is backed by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who controls nuclear policy , hopes for intergovernmental progress on curbing Iran 's nuclear ambitions have been dealt a severe setback .
The research community should thus do everything possible to promote continued contacts with colleagues in Iran , if only to promote détente between Iran and the West when relations are bellicose .
Meanwhile , the diaspora of Iranian academics is playing a key part in helping to get across the complexity of the situation in Iran .
In informal public meetings , newspaper opinion pieces and discussions with governments and reporters , they say that , in contrast to what is often reported by Western media , the uprising has little to do with any desire to topple the regime .
It is above all a broad civil - rights movement that extends far beyond the ' Twittering ' classes .
It is led by young people — 70 % of Iranians are under 30 — who are not ideologically motivated , but instead are hungry for the greater freedoms that were one of the main , but unrealized , goals of the 1979 Iranian revolution .
The majority of Iranian scientists are behind the movement .
The green wave
Iranian émigré scientists also point out that Mir-Hossein Mousavi — who ran against Ahmadinejad in this year 's elections — is an unlikely leader of the protest movement .
As prime minister of Iran from 1981 to 1989 he presided over a cultural revolution in which Iranian universities were violently purged of influences other than Islam , and many scientists fled the country to avoid death or imprisonment .
But Mousavi , although a conservative , is now part of a broad coalition of political and ethnic forces — ethnic Iranians make up just half of the population of Iran — who want greater democracy and openness to the world .
The protests surpass the issues of the contested election , and the green colour of Mousavi 's presidential campaign has now become the symbol of this broader civil - rights movement .
Ahmadinejad is another matter entirely .
Iranian expatriate academics explain that , after stalling immediately after the 1979 revolution , science gained momentum under reformist governments starting in the late 1990s .
Ahmadinejad has maintained government support for science since his election as president in 2005 .
However , his regime has systematically savaged academic freedom in general , by purging universities of reformists and social scientists , and appointing government stooges to many senior university positions .
His term in office has also been marked by the arrests of Iranian and foreign academics on trumped up charges of fomenting a revolution — having a damaging effect on international collaboration ( see Nature 457 , 511 ; 2009 , and Nature 447 , 890 –891 ; 2007 ) .
In the short term , academic freedom and the isolation of Iran 's scientists are likely to worsen under a regime desperate to cling onto power by crushing reformist elements , and targeting thousands of students , academics and other intellectuals for arrest .
Seventy academics were arrested on 24 June after meeting Mousavi to give their analysis of current Iranian society , and other academics are reported to have been detained since , although reliable information is scarce .
Academics are now in the front line , says one Iranian researcher who returned from Iran just days ago .
In the face of this bleak news , however , Iranian academics are surprisingly optimistic .
They tend to buy into the argument that , despite the current crackdown , greater democracy is inevitable in Iran , which will provide an open society that is more conducive to science and critical thinking .
They point out that Iran and Turkey are the two Muslim countries with the strongest democratic and secular traditions — and that academics have played a major part in helping the society resist religious obscurantism .
Iran is not the only country in the region where human rights and democracy are violated ; and the West has hypocritically been relatively silent on similar abuses by several of its allies in the Middle East .
But in Iran at least , the country 's long traditions of democracy , education and free thinking — suppressed for decades by the regime , and in particular the current hard - line leadership — are now out in the open .

So what do we have to counter this scary prospect ?
We have the Obama stimulus plan , which aims to create 3 ½ million jobs by late next year .
That ’s much better than nothing , but it ’s not remotely enough .
And there does n’t seem to be much else going on .
Do you remember the administration ’s plan to sharply reduce the rate of foreclosures , or its plan to get the banks lending again by taking toxic assets off their balance sheets ?
Neither do I .
All of this is depressingly familiar to anyone who has studied economic policy in the 1930s .
Once again a Democratic president has pushed through job - creation policies that will mitigate the slump but are n’t aggressive enough to produce a full recovery .
Once again much of the stimulus at the federal level is being undone by budget retrenchment at the state and local level .
So have we failed to learn from history , and are we , therefore , doomed to repeat it ?
Not necessarily  but it ’s up to the president and his economic team to ensure that things are different this time .
President Obama and his officials need to ramp up their efforts , starting with a plan to make the stimulus bigger .

Just to be clear , I ’m well aware of how difficult it will be to get such a plan enacted .
There wo n’t be any cooperation from Republican leaders , who have settled on a strategy of total opposition , unconstrained by facts or logic .
Indeed , these leaders responded to the latest job numbers by proclaiming the failure of the Obama economic plan .
That ’s ludicrous , of course .
The administration warned from the beginning that it would be several quarters before the plan had any major positive effects .
But that did n’t stop the chairman of the Republican Study Committee from issuing a statement demanding : “ Where are the jobs ? ”
Tough customer wo n't end siege of Castle
By JAMES ELI SHIFFER , Star Tribune
Last update : July 2 , 2009 - 12:00 PM
It was after midnight when Ariel Wade rolled into the drive - through at the 24 - hour White Castle , one block from the State Capitol .
Wade rolled away " madder than fish grease " after the staff refused to hand over any burgers .
The reason :
She was riding in an electric mobility scooter .
The drive - throughs are for licensed motor vehicles only .
White Castle says it 's a safety measure that 's standard in the industry , to keep pedestrians from getting creamed by cars .
But Wade , who uses the scooter because of degenerative arthritis in her back , says the policy discriminates against people who do n't or can't drive .
The White Castle dining room closed at 11 p.m. , so she had no choice but to order her Slyders in the drive - through .
Complimentary burgers and consoling words from the district manager the next day have n't stopped Wade from taking her gripe to a law firm that advocates for the disabled .
Her drive - through dispute now could test a relatively uncharted area of disability law .
" You can try to butter me up all you want to .
Free meals ain't going to work , " said Wade , 37 .
" I want to make sure they do n't discriminate against another person . "
The Minnesota Disability Law Center is weighing whether to take on Wade 's case , said Justin Page , a staff attorney .
It 's an " unsettled " area of law , with few cases testing the issue , he said .
But on first glance , the policy strikes Page as inconsistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act .
" I would argue if you 're open 24 hours , you need to be accessible and provide accessibility 24 hours , " Page said .
The confrontation on Rice Street pits the venerable 418 - restaurant straight - edged hamburger chain based in Columbus , Ohio , against a onetime exotic dancer from New Orleans who until recently worked selling bingo tickets at a St. Paul bar .
Wade uses her Pride Mobility Celebrity X scooter ( top speed : 6 mph ) to go just about anywhere .
She rides it in the street when the sidewalks are blocked or unplowed , which is legal under a seven - year - old state law .
Unlike motorcycles and motor scooters , mobility scooters are n't licensed or titled in Minnesota , and the law does n't give them the same rights to share the roadway as bicycles .
Nevertheless ,
Wade 's scooter has a headlight and a tail - light , and the squads just drive by when she 's moving down the street .
After getting off work on June 4 , Wade and a close friend , Anthony Shaver , set off from her home near Payne Avenue .
By the time they arrived at the White Castle , the dining room was closed , as is usual for six hours every night .
A sign in the window beckoned , " Open 24 hours , because cravings do n't sleep . "
The drive - through was deserted , Wade said , so she approached the intercom , with 20 bucks to spend .
" The guy that was answering the phone told me I had to leave the parking lot because they could not serve me because I was not in a motorized vehicle , " she said .
But she was , she argued .
Wade called the toll - free number for food orders and managed to talk her way through to customer service .
Still hungry , Wade and Shaver made their way to the McDonald 's on Marion Street .
Once again , the dining room was closed , so they went to the drive - through .
This time , they got their fast food , but it came with a warning not to try it again .
Courtney Henry , franchise owner for the McDonald 's on Marion Street , offered this statement : " In the best interest of our customers ' safety , we only allow motor vehicles in the drive - thru that are authorized to drive on streets and highways .
We 're sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused one of our customers . "
Jamie Richardson , White Castle System Inc.'s vice president for corporate relations , said the company feels " sorry that it was an unfortunate incident for her " but that the free meal was offered as a chance to explain the company policy , which he said is similar to " virtually all the other chains . "
" When folks do approach [ the drive - through ] , not in a vehicle , our policy is not to serve folks , " Richardson said .
" It really is about safety first . "
" Candidly it can be kind of an unsafe zone , with cars coming around quicker than they should , " he said .
" If we were to set aside safety , we would be doing a disservice to the millions of people coming through . "
Wade thinks that those policies do a disservice to everybody without a car .
She 's not interested in money for her inconvenience .
She wants the fast - food giants to serve every customer , regardless of mode of transport , whenever they 're open .
" They pissed off the wrong person , " she said .
Welcome To Wimbledon : Feel Free To Park On The Dead
Most people would stop their cars before they rolled on people ’s graves .
Not British tennis fans .
St Mary ’s Church in Wimbledon Village has raised money for charity by allowing fans heading to Wimbledon to park on their premises .
In previous years , they have parked cars on the graves of people whose descendants cannot be traced , but this year someone screwed up and allowed cars to be parked on any grave .
It does n’t seem like anyone should be leaving their car on anyone ’s grave , but who are we to argue with British custom ?
One driver said , “ We were told : ‘ Go and reverse between these gravestones . ’
I thought : ‘ This is very odd ’ .
But we did it and went to Wimbledon . ”
How lovely .
The practice has been stopped & the church has apologized , but not before graves were parked on for several days .
So if you see a bunch of angry zombie valets in London , you know where they ’re headed .

Monday ’s agreement between Arnold Schwarzenegger , the governor of California , and state legislators seemed to promise a temporary resolution to an ongoing budget crisis .
But before legislators had even had a chance to vote on it , Californians were indulging in that peculiar mix of sanctimony and surrealism which marks almost all political discourse in the state .
“ What about the children ? ” ran the headline over the letters section of the San Francisco Chronicle , as if the important divide in the state ’s politics were between those who “ care ” and those who do not .
Caring has nothing to do with it .
California ’s problems are those of “ direct democracy ” .
The state ’s laws are shaped by plebiscites to a degree unmatched outside of Venezuela .
In voting on “ propositions ” , which sometimes touch on detailed budgetary matters , citizens of the Golden State have stood up consistently for two principles : the state should provide vastly more services to its citizens , and citizens should pay vastly less to the state .
In 1978 , Proposition 13 halved government ’s take from property taxes ; a decade later , Proposition 98 required the state to spend 40 per cent of its “ general fund ” on schools .
Adding to the problem is the requirement of supermajorities for raising taxes .
The present impasse reflects a problem of long standing , even if its severity is unprecedented .
Ronald Reagan won the state ’s governorship in 1966 by promising to do something about the budget deficit , which had by then risen to a calamitous $ 194 m .
Today , the state not only has a $ 26.3 bn ( £ 16bn , € 19 bn ) budget gap but is constrained by all sorts of powerful institutions and laws from closing it .
Until recently the state issued “ revenue anticipation notes ” but its contractors will no longer accept them .
California ’s bonds are the lowest - rated of any state .
Facing insolvency , Mr Schwarzenegger and legislators have proposed selling off billions of dollars ’ worth of state assets , cutting the state ’s university budget by 20 per cent and releasing 27,000 inmates from prison .
Already the state has given mandatory furloughs of three days a month to state employees .
“ Furlough ” is a euphemism .
It means you do not get paid .
At least those are concrete steps .
But much of the budget plan hammered out on Monday consists of accounting tricks .
Unable to go to the banks to borrow , the state is borrowing billions from local counties and communities by simply not disbursing the money it is supposed to .
If cities really want their programmes funded , they can try the credit markets themselves .
A payday that was supposed to come next June has been pushed back into July , so that it will fall in the following fiscal year .
Another trick is the accelerated withholding of state income tax .
Instead of deducting 25 per cent of taxes per quarter , the state will deduct 70 per cent in the first six months of 2010 , so that 20 per cent of revenues from the next fiscal year will be brought forward into this one .
This is not a solution .
This is changing your phone number so you can get some rest from the bill collectors who are dunning you .
Commentators often say that the problem in California is that it is too difficult to raise taxes .
This is misguided on two levels .
First , for all its difficulties , the state still manages to level the sixth - highest taxes in the nation .
Second , when you are talking about economic growth or the role of the state , tax rates matter ; but when you are talking about balancing the budget , what matters is that receipts , however they may be collected , match outlays .
It is an enduring mystery why US pundits should see a difference between the philosophy of Democrats ( who stand for spending more than you raise ) and the Republicans ( who stand for raising less than you spend ) .
Typical was a Chronicle editorial blasting Republicans for their insistence that the budget crisis be resolved in a way that did not involve tax hikes .
“ Many of them , ” the paper wrote , “ would sooner see their children in second - rate schools and their cars on Third World roads before they would break their anti-tax pledges . ”
But wait .
California already has second - rate schools .
In fact , for all its mandates and its massive spending , it has abysmal schools .
In the federal government ’s National Assessment of Educational Progress , California usually vies with such states as Louisiana and Mississippi for the 50th spot .
A stronger case can be made that tax revenues are too unpredictable .
Here Proposition 13 is blamed for moving the burden from property to income taxes , which are more sensitive to economic fluctuations .
In a boom economy , there is plenty of money to pay for the unemployment benefits that no one needs .
When you have 12 per cent unemployment , as California does now , the state is too strapped to do anything .
This accusation is true enough – tax systems themselves can be speculative .
But a comparison of California ’s fiscal crisis to the one that roiled Ireland this winter is instructive .
Ireland ’s problem was that it collected too much of its revenue through taxes on property ( in that case , on transactions ) and not enough through taxes on income .
California ’s fiscal difficulties are like a lot of things in life .
Everyone warns you that there are certain hard and fast rules – like not confusing wishes with entitlements – that you break at your peril .
You begin to break them and what happens ?
Nothing !
Nothing at all , and for the longest time .
You are like a ship that has lost its anchor .
You can drift very pleasantly , day after day , believing you do not need an anchor at all , before one day you realise , quite suddenly , that you do .

Hookworm ( Necator americanus )
This parasitic nematode worm begins life outside the body and is transmitted through contaminated water , or fruits and vegetables .
The hookworm larvae grow inside the human intestines where they attach to the wall of the intestine and drink the blood of the host , sometimes causing a form of anaemia called anchylostomiasis .
Symptoms : weakness , abdominal pain , nausea , diarrhoea , anaemia
( Image : Science Photo Library )
Scabies mite ( Sarcoptes scabiei var .
hominis )
Commonly known as the human itch mite , the parasite is transferred by physical contact .
The female mite lays her eggs on the skin of a human , causing a reaction and inflammation .
This is exacerbated when the mother begins burying the eggs under the skin causing intense itching , a condition commonly known as scabies .
Symptoms : itching , soreness , pus- filled nodules , skin irritation
( Image : Science Photo Library )
Roundworm ( Ascaris lumbricoides )
These are the largest of the intestinal nematodes affecting humans , growing to 15 - 35 centimetres in length .
They are transferred by ingestion .
The eggs hatch and quickly penetrate the intestinal wall , where they enter the bloodstream .
From there , the roundworm makes its way to the lungs , from where it is coughed up and swallowed , returning it to the gut .
Symptoms : fever , tiredness , allergic rash , vomiting , diarrhoea , nerve problems , wheezing / coughing
( Image : Science Photo Library ) Advertisement
Flatworm blood fluke ( Schistosoma mansoni , S. haematobium , S. japonicum )
These small flukes live in the bloodstream of infected hosts and cause schistosomiasis , also called bilharzia .
They live in water , and penetrate the skin of victims who come into contact with contaminated water .
The parasite causes inflammation ( swelling ) and damage to organs , particularly the liver .
The adult worms can persist in their human host for decades , and may not cause any symptoms for years .
They leave the host in faeces and spend part of their lifecycle in a snail host .
Symptoms : fever , aching , cough , diarrhoea , swollen glands , lethargy
( Image : Science Photo Library )
Tapeworm ( Taenia solium )
Transmitted through infected food , a tapeworm attaches itself to its victim 's intestine with hooks on its " head " , or scolex .
They mature over three to four months , during which time the reproductive organs develop .
Tapeworms can survive for up to 25 years in humans .
Their eggs are excreted in faeces and can survive on vegetation , where they are then consumed by cattle or pigs , or passed on to humans .
Symptoms : nausea , vomiting , inflammation of the intestine , diarrhoea , weight loss , dizziness , fits , malnutrition
( Image : CDC )
Pinworm ( Enterobius vermicularis )
Pinworms are a common human parasite , causing enterobiasis .
Adult females range from 8 to 13 millimetres in length and have a long , pin-shaped posterior , for which the worm is named .
Pinworms mate by traumatic insemination - the male stabs the female with his penis - after which the male dies .
They make their home in the host 's intestines , but unlike many parasites they do not pass into the blood and cannot survive in other parts of the body for any length of time .
They lay their eggs outside the body , usually around the anus , causing itching : this assists the larvae 's spread via hand contact .
Symptoms : Irritation and scratching
( Image : Public Health Image Library )
Wuchereria bancrofti
Mosquitoes carry this parasite , which they release into the bloodstream of a human host as they feed .
The larvae move to the lymph nodes , which are predominantly in the legs and genital area , and develop into an adult worm over the course of a year .
They are commonly responsible for the tropical disease filariasis , but in extreme cases can cause elephantiasis .
Symptoms : fever , chills , skin infections , painful lymph nodes , thickened skin , swelling

Toxoplasma gondii
A common , crescent - shaped parasite that invades the central nervous system .
Humans become infected with this organism by eating undercooked meat or by handling infected cat litter .
Most people have been exposed to this parasite and show antibodies for it , but few individuals show symptoms .
Those with a compromised immune system are more susceptible , and fetuses can suffer serious or fatal effects from infection .
Symptoms : flu symptoms , fever , chills , fatigue , headache

Giardia lamblia
Giardia lamblia is a flagellated protozoan parasite .
It lives and reproduces in the intestine , causing an infection of the small intestine known as giardiasis .
When it takes up residence in a human 's gut , it results in inflammation and and other damage , reducing the gut 's ability to absorb nutrition and causing diarrhoea .
The parasite is highly resistant to water treatment and is known to exist in drinking water .
Symptoms : diarrhoea , nausea , abdominal pain , weight loss , characteristic " rotten - egg " - tasting burps

When rumors of Gobliiins 4 first began circulating , I half - expected it to be a joke , or at least nothing more than wishful thinking from a devoted niche .
The odd , humorous series by French developer Coktel Vision was impressive in its day , but it ’s been fifteen years since the last game , and even its biggest fans must have doubted the possibility of a resurrection after all this time .
Especially since they are n’t even typical adventure games , but rather a slapstick , escape - the - room style puzzle experience with light story elements , something often frowned upon by genre veterans .
Still , the series is fondly remembered by those who played the originals .
They had a unique charm , they were funny , and their bizarre puzzles were fully absorbing , and the years have done little to quell the desire for more goblin adventures .
Much to my delight , the news of a sequel was no joke at all , and better yet , it has proven to be arguably the best game in the series to date .
Spared of the license limbo afflicting so many older series , this latest installment was developed by Société Pollene and produced by a Russian company , Snowberry Connection , but series creator Pierre Gilhodes was back at the helm , ensuring the new game shares the same Gobliiins style that fans have come to love .
For newcomers , yes , this new iteration is still decidedly puzzle - based , but Gobliiins 4 gives you plenty of reasons to care about the surreal world in which you ’ve been placed , even if it ’s just to see the next gag , creature or contraption .
Whatever your motivation , this title is a treat , and you ’ll find yourself soon wrapped up in the challenging but addictive puzzles and the comical interactions of the goblins .
The previous games have varied their approaches to puzzling , as well as the number of playable characters ( which , cutely , are represented by the number of i’s in the title ) .
The original Gobliiins had the right dynamic ( three goblins for maximum mischief , single screens ) , but there was an unnecessary health meter that punished you for missteps in a largely trial - and - error adventure .
The second title , Gobliins 2 , featured ( you guessed it ) two goblins and no more health bar .
Although the goblins could move simultaneously , their antics were toned down with one fewer member , and you occasionally had to traverse multiple screens to solve puzzles .
Goblins Quest 3 , published by Sierra , was mostly a lone goblin affair , aside from picking up sidekicks to help with puzzles .
While a worthwhile game in many respects , it did n’t have the tight - knit , focused feel of the original , and consequently felt too much like a meandering King ’s Quest game than a unique Gobliiins title .
Gobliiins 4 represents the best of all worlds .
Here Gilhodes has used what worked in Gobliiins ( one ) : a motley cast of three clumsy yet plucky goblins , weird worlds to explore one screen at a time , and a wide assortment of devious puzzles — but this time without the cruel health bar .
There is no way to permanently mess things up in a level , meaning restarts are unnecessary .
And , like Gobliins 2 , characters can move at the same time , working together to solve the problems facing them .
On top of that , each level in Gobliiins 4 has a distinct , clear goal , which other games in the series rarely had .
While perhaps streamlined a little too much for some , this format greatly eases potential frustration and boredom .
My own biggest draw to the adventure genre is the pacing .
It ’s often ponderous , almost meditative .
Even when inevitably getting “ stuck ” , I ’m mellowed out enough at that point from carefully exploring environments to handle the situation with a certain thoughtful clarity .
And yet there ’s nothing worse than walking back through dozens of screens with little idea of where to go or even what to look for .
So it ’s to this sense of pace that I can attribute to a good chunk of my love for Gobliiins 4 .
By keeping things toned down to easily digestible single - screen puzzle scenarios , the game provides some of the most manageable yet challenging experiences in any adventure game .
One feature the Gobliiins series never featured prominently was story , and it ’s true that Gobliiins 4 is equally short on plot , which is advanced only by short comic - style panels between the self - contained chapters .
The game is free of introductory cinematics and narrative cutscenes , but the premise involves helping the King Balderone find his missing aardvark Riri … only to get caught up in plenty of obstacles along the way .
The first challenge is merely gathering your busy cohorts for the King ’s mission , but once together , the trio land themselves in such predicaments as spider - friendly dark tunnels , a field of singing “ foolweeds ” , and even on other planets .
The lack of story is never a distraction , as it keeps the focus squarely on the puzzles themselves , and yet throughout this very weird tangent of odd , distracting missions , you ’ll always feel like there ’s a good reason for your actions .
Upon starting the game , you ’ll find that the opening menu screen serves as a tutorial .
It looks exactly like one of the levels you ’ll be playing , only there ’s no real goal , and clicking on items will give you a brief primer on how to control the goblins .
Moving the three heroes around is easy to do , and to complete puzzles it ’s necessary to utilize each goblin ’s distinct shtick : detective Tchoup is the only one who can pick up and use items as inventory , Perluis the wizard can bring things to life with magic , while Stucco the Viking possesses brute strength .
The opening two stages are played with one and two goblins , respectively , introducing each character ’s abilities and easing players into the more complex task - sharing of the later levels .
It is n’t always easy to know which goblin to choose ( or what to do with whomever you select ) , but there ’s a certain sense to these puzzles once connections are made .
Some might call Gobliiins 4 ’s puzzles illogical , but really they just rely on " dream - logic " , requiring you to get into the goblin world mindset to understand .
That ’s not to say you wo n’t experience some trial - and - error or tedious pixel - hunting ; there ’s a little bit of both .
But mostly you ’ll have an idea of what needs to be done : in one stage , you ’ll simply need to punch a ticket … but in this game , of course , you wo n’t do it with anything you ’d expect .
The game encourages you to think creatively , and never punishes you for mistakes .
Potential frustration is leavened by the silly , playful nature of the game .
Mistakes do n’t feel wrong , they simply feel exploratory .
For example , Stucco can punch a giant mushroom , which bounces back and knocks him out .
As a result , the other goblins guffaw at your mishap , but Stucco revives none the worse for wear .
And for the most part , you ’ll get an idea of who needs to interact with what from these animations , so it never feels like a waste of time to experiment .
There are some time - sensitive actions required occasionally , and these could prove troublesome , but such moments are short and can be tried again if necessary .
The earlier levels may lull you into a fall sense of confidence with their pass - like - clockwork degree of puzzle solving , but really they ’re meant to serve as a simple transition into the extremely difficult levels you ’ll encounter later .
The signature style and artwork of the older Gobliiins games have returned , but this game marks the series transition into 3D .
The detailed sprite work of previous games is certainly missed this time around , but the cartoonish look and animation of Gilhodes ’ characters is certainly true to form .
You ’ll meet many large , friendly creatures and even talking vegetables in your travels through continually unique environments .
One stage takes place in a train station with a living train , another in an oversized and demented children ’s room laden with riddles , and yet another places your adventure inside comic book panels .
During all this , you ’ll notice plenty of animated background delights to keep you distracted , many of them surreal — such as a fish flying cheerfully around a castle , or a skeleton peeking out from behind boxes .
On a technical level , the graphics are n’t quite up to snuff with the current generation of games , but the characters manage to be lively and well animated , with a personality that ’s refreshingly different from most 3D adventures .
Aside from the goblins ’ physical gags ( and the friendly mocking that ensues ) , much of this game ’s personality comes from the noises they make .
The sound effects are n’t as wild and cartoonish as they were in previous games , but the odd , unintelligible voices are definitely present , and faithfully so .
The English subtitles that accompany this gibberish are almost as strange , and yet I found myself giving in to whatever requests or statements were made by characters .
When I encountered a self - proclaimed dentist trapped in the teeth of a monster ’s mouth , I thought , “ why , of course ! ”
When I eagerly embraced the instruction to steal lettuce from a creature named Saladini to feed a sick worm - friend that I was riding , I knew the game had brilliantly sucked me into its craziness .
Whether by voice or text , the game ’s language is instrumental to adding believability and texture to its world .
The instrumental music is odd too , but not in the way you ’d expect , as it ’s not really weird like the rest of the game .
There ’s the bizarre instrument here and there ( the jaw - harp in the first stage was a surprise ) , but mainly you ’ll be hearing a lot of medieval compositions with piano , flutes , and plucked string instruments .
While sometimes tinny - sounding and lo-fi , it ’s surprisingly pleasant , and most importantly , non-repetitive , as you can expect a new , varied track with each stage .
Getting around is a simple point - and - click affair .
Click on a character to control him , and point to where you want to go or what you ’d like to interact with .
Double - clicking allows you to run , which is useful since it can take some time to traverse screens otherwise .
Switching characters on the fly is easy , and perfect for multi-tasking ; you can have one goblin head towards one object while having another goblin fiddling with another on the other side of the screen .
The only other element of the interface is Tchoup ’s inventory , which is accessible with a right - click .
The inventory is relatively minimal , and you ’ll notice that only particular items carry over from level to level .
This feels odd at first , but you ’ll likely appreciate the reduction of ( inevitable ) trial - and - error puzzling .
A few of the items feel a tad overused , since they ’re used in much the same way , making new puzzles feel slightly less dynamic , but this is a small gripe .
The save system , however , is a little troublesome .
As much as I appreciate the series faithfulness of this entry , I ’m not quite sold on the archaic password system used by Gobliiins 4 at level completion .
Sure , I love me some retro games , but getting out a pad and paper to write down a ten - digit code ?
Not a fan .
The game auto - saves your latest level anyway , but the inability to save mid-level or have any control over save files is one aspect the series should have left behind for good .
There are “ only ” 16 stages in this game , which may sound short , but there can be a dozen or so puzzles in each level , all working towards one cohesive goal .
And there ’s plenty to do in all of them , so you could easily end up spending over an hour ( or even days ) wracking your mind over a tiny puzzle within one level .
One of these levels is a bonus stage , unlocked only if you collect an elusive gold tooth in previous chapters .
Some are more difficult to see or find than others , but if you do miss one , you ’ll probably want to go back anyway , as the puzzles in this game are rewarding , and the solutions never feel too out of reach .
There are those who will dismiss Gobliiins 4 as a mere puzzle game , but unless you play adventures only for their stories , I can safely say that this game is worth the time of any point - and - click adventurer .
More is n’t always better , after all , so if you ’re up for a challenge in something a little different , get comfortable during the easy first stages , then prepare to explore fantastical surreal worlds one screen at a time , succumbing to their dream - logic puzzles , and laughing at the antics of the stooge - like goblins in this very welcome return .
Video games , of sorts , have been around since the 50’s when inventor and Physicist Willy Higinbotham created the very first table - top game in Brookhaven National Laboratory played on an oscilloscope .
Since then , once parties far more interested in marketing and consumerism got their hands on them , arcades and home consoles have exploded in popularity .
Of course , the industry , like everything else , had its ups and downs and with the invention of the home console marked the imminent demise of the arcade .
Here ’s a really cool Video Game Timeline that illustrates some of the bigger achievements in the market , though not as concise with actual gaming moments .
That ’s where this breakdown comes in .
If you ’re a video gamer or just interested in origins of stuff , check out this dozen of sweet video game firsts .
The First Coin - Op Arcade Machine
Galaxy Game ( 1971 )
Installed at the Tresidder Union at Stanford University in September , 1971 , eight weeks prior to the release of Computer Space , was the first mass - produced , coin - operated arcade game .
Only one unit was originally built , although the game later included several consoles allowing users to play against each other .
So , in essence , this was also the first player versus player machine , too .
The First 1st - Person - Perspective Auto Racing Game
Night Driver ( 1976 )
Also claiming to be the original use of Real - Time First - Person Graphics , Night Driver pitted the player and vehicle against a swerving and hair - pin turning race track in the dead of night bordered only by visible white flares .
The car itself was but a plastic sheet inserted under the screen , but the levels of excitement made that fact hold little value .
The First Third - Party Game Developer
Activision ( 1979 )
This from Wikipedia : “ It was founded on October 1 , 1979 and was the first independent developer and distributor of video games for gaming consoles .
Its first products were cartridges for the Atari 2600 video console system .
Activision is now one of the largest third party video game publishers in the world and was also the top publisher for 2007 in the United States On January 18 , 2008 , Activision announced they were the top US publisher in 2007 , according to the NPD Group . ”
The First Ability to Store Full Initials
Asteroids ( 1979 )
Asteroids was one of the most influential and popular games of the Golden Age of Video Games .
Using vector graphics and a 2 - dimensional view that wraps around both screen axis , Asteroids made full use of its space with floating rocks and the occasional UFO fly - by .
You control an arrow head - shaped space ship and spent your time blowing apart space boulders into smaller bits .
Given the wrap - around capability , you were also able to fly off the screen and appear on the opposite .
The ‘ deep - tone heartbeat ’ as the soundtrack made the game that much more exciting .
And now you , too , can be ASS when you win .
Fun !
First Use of Synthesized Human Voices
King and Balloon ( 1980 )
King & Balloon is a fixed shooter arcade game that was released by Namco .
It runs on the same Namco ‘ hardware ’ as Galaxian , but with an extra processor for speech ; the King speaks when he is captured ( “ HELP ! ” ) , when he is rescued ( “ Thank you ” ) , and when he is carried away ( “ BYE BYE ! ” ) .
Additionally , the balloons make the same humming alien sound as the ships in Galaxian , which was released the previous year .
The player ’s shots also have the same sound effect as the player ship in said game .
Unlike Galaxian , you had as many ‘ cannons ’ as necessary since the object was just to save the King each time he was lifted away .
First True 3D Games ( Arcade and Console )
Battlezone ( 1980 ) and 3D Monster Maze ( 1981 )
Using vector graphics instead of the rasterized styles for other games , the 3D came into its own thanks to a similar training game used by the US Military for training called Bradley Fighting Vehicle .
Battlezone was very similar in which you , a tank , must take out the enemy tanks using radar and your cannon .
It had a great effect when your machine was struck : the image shook and went static -y for a moment .
In 3D Monster Maze you are trapped in a 16 x 16 cell labyrinth in which is housed a T. Rex .
All you need to do is escape through the only available exit .
However , the closer you and the dino get to one another , the higher your anxiety and the more lost you can potentially become .
First Horror Survival Video Game
Haunted House ( 1981 )
Though a first in its extensive genre , it is , unfortunately , one of those games where the box art is far superior to the game .
Basically , you , as represented by a set of eyes , must traverse your way through a spooky mansion avoiding such horrors as tarantulas , bats , and the spirit of the homeowner himself .
You have a torch during some of the trek , but in later levels you ’re reduced to only matches .
It ’s fun and pretty scary and an interesting precursor to the horror games of today .
First True 16 - Bit Home Console System
Intellivision ( 1983 )
This from Wikipedia : “ One of the slogans of the television advertisements stated that Intellivision was “ the closest thing to the real thing ” ; one example in an advertisement compared golf games .
The other console ’s games had a blip sound and cruder graphics , while the Intellivision featured a realistic swing sound and striking of the ball , and graphics that suggested a more 3D look , although undoubtedly crude when compared with modern gaming consoles .
There was also an advertisement comparing the Atari 2600 to it , featuring the slogan “ I did n’t know ” . ”
First One - On -One Fighting Game
Yie Ar Kung - Fu ( 1985 )
You are Oolong and in order to earn the title of Grand Master you must bare - handed fight your way through many opponents bent on stopping you with any means necessary .
Oh sure , the can use weapons .
Oh well .
The good thing is that you have a pretty wide selection of punches and kicks in your arsenal .
Oh , and unlike the multitude of crazy ways the beaten can crumble to the ground in more modern games , here , men fall legs akimbo , twitching like bugs , and women fall all daintily on their sides .
Funny stuff .
First Use of Blood and Gore
Chiller ( 1986 )
Actually banned in the UK , Chiller was , at the time , considered the most gratuitously and overtly violent and gory video game ever .
The game made use of ‘ light gun ’ technology allowing the player ability to shoot their way through a gruesome house of horrors in order to destroy several Talismans .
The arcade featured one ‘ torture ’ room in particular that gave the player a sick thrill shredding humans in various forms of punishment .
NES released a far less graphic cart that maintained only some of the original ’s violence .
First Single Console - Exclusive 1st Person Shooter
Golden Eye ( 1997 )
Only on the Nintendo 64 .
Boy do I remember owning this game .
Nothing was more fun than gathering three of your buddies and blasting the snot out of each other in 4 - player mode .
If you had the codes for infinite ammo and all the cool guns , you ruled this game .
The story mode was equally as exciting and allowed you to sneak , snipe , and slaughter all in the same adventure .
Great game and tons of James Bond fun .
Three of the world 's most prominent movie studios got together last month to launch EpixHD .
Their mission : to create a Hulu for movies .
However , there was one major differentiation between their product strategy and that of Hulu : you can only access EpixHD.com if you have the Epix TV channel .
Instead of ads , the partnership would generate revenue from platform deals .
Now the first such deal has been struck , with Verizon FiOS .
Customers that already have Verios FiOS TV and Internet in their homes will be able to watch streams of Iron Man and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button as much as they would like .
Epix , for those who did not see our first article , is both a TV channel and a website .
Both provide full HD streams of movies from Paramount , Lionsgate , and MGM , free of ads .
While it acts like both HBO and Hulu , you do n't have to pay for either - so long as your Internet and TV provider have a deal with Epix .
The website specifically offers an array of new releases and classic movies and includes features such as Private Screening , which lets you watch a movie with friends in a virtual theater .
It 's the movie collection though that 's most impressive , which includes :
- All the Indiana Jones movies ( including the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ) - Iron Man - Saw ( and all its sequels ) - The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - Cloverfield - Every single James Bond movie
Okay , do you see why Epix such an attractive commodity ?
Shop these assets around and companies are bound to sign with you .
There are about 2 million FiOS TV subscribers currently .
Lucky them .
In an exchange about the constitutional right to privacy with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - R.I. ) , the discussion — naturally — devolves into pot use .
But Sotomayor puts to rest any questions about her own interest in the matter : “ I ’m not an expert in marijuana growing . ”
– Article from Politico .
Transcript
SOTOMAYOR : I think , as I understand your question , Senator , that there are two issues , if not more , but the two that I note as more starkly for me in your question is the one of the search and seizure and the Fourth Amendment as it applies to taking evidence from an individual and use it against him or her in a current proceeding .
WHITEHOUSE : Yes , which is a constant .
That stayed the same .
SOTOMAYOR : That ( inaudible ) the structure .
In — not so long ago , the Supreme Court dealt with a technologically new situation , which was whether an individual had a right to expect the warrant to be gotten before law enforcement flew over his or — I think it was a “ his ” in that case — his home and took readings of the thermal energy emanating from his home , and then going in to see if the person was growing marijuana .
WHITEHOUSE : The ( inaudible ) case .
SOTOMAYOR : Exactly .
And in that case , the reason for that case is that , apparently — I ’m not an expert in marijuana growing — but apparently , when you ’re growing marijuana , there ’s a — certain heating lights that you need , at least that ’s what the case was describing , and it generates this enormous amount of heat that would n’t generally come from a home unless you were doing something like this .
And what the court did there , in an opinion by Justice Scalia , I believe it was , is it looked at the embedded questions of privacy in the home that underlied the unreasonable search and seizure .
And the court there , as I mentioned , determined that acts taken in the privacy of one ’s home would commonly not be expected to be intruded upon unless the police secured a warrant .
And to the extent that the law had generally recognized that , if you worked actively to keep people out of your home — you locked your windows , you locked your doors , you did n’t let people walk by and peek through , you did n’t stand at your front door and show people what you were doing , that you were exhibiting your expectation of privacy .
And to the extent that new technology had developed that you would n’t expect to intrude on that privacy , then you were protected by the warrant clause .
And the police had an obligation to go talk to a magistrate and explain to them what their evidence was and let the magistrate — I use the magistrate in that more global sense .
It would be a judge , but in the — you would let a judge decide whether there was probable cause to issue the warrant , reasonable suspicion , probable cause — probable cause to issue the warrant .
That ’s how the courts address the unreasonable — or have addressed , the Supreme Court has , the unreasonable search and seizure and balance the new technology with the expectations of privacy that are recognized in the Fourth Amendment .

Verglichen mit dem Netz ist das Leben ein rechtsfreier Raum Twister ( Bettina Winsemann )
" Das Internet darf kein rechtsfreier Raum sein " lautet eine wohlbekannte Floskel von Anwälten , Politikern oder Lobbyisten .
Dabei ist das Internet so stark reglementiert , dass das " reale Leben " , damit verglichen , wie Sodom und Gomorrha wirkt .
My name is ... my name is ... my name is ...
Slim Shady
Wer Mottoparties mag , der wird nicht selten auf eine Vielzahl von Damen und Herren stoßen , die , je nach Motto , Andrea Jürgens , Gottlieb Wendehals , Slim Shady / Eminem , Axl Rose , Nana Mouskouri oder Dieter Bohlen heißen .
Während der Party sprechen sich die Gäste gerne mit diesen Namen an , erfreuen sich an den oft sehr detailverliebten Kostümen und freuen sich , gemeinsam mit " Andrew Eldritch " zu " Temple of Love " tanzen und über die gute alte Zeit plauschen zu können .
Bei den Faschingsparties nennt sich jemand schon einmal B. Ahlsen und schwenkt die Kekstüte , während er als Prinzenrolle verkleidet durch die Lande tanzt .
Kaum jemand würde auf die Idee kommen , diese Herrschaften wegen " ihrer " Namen abzumahnen .
Anders in Onlineforen - dort kann schon die Verwendung eines Markennamens als Pseudonym zu einer Abmahnung führen .
Nutzungsbedingungen weisen oft genug darauf hin , dass Pseudonyme so gewählt werden sollen , dass keine Verwechslung mit Personen des öffentlichen Lebens stattfinden kann und keine Markenrechte berührt werden .
Natürlich ist es möglich , gegen eine solche Abmahnung rechtlich vorzugehen und gegebenenfalls wird dieser Fall sogar vom Abgemahnten gewonnen .
Da die Rechtsschutzversicherungen im allgemeinen Markenrechtsstreitigkeiten nicht abdecken und die Gerichte sehr uneinheitlich entscheiden , ist dies jedoch ein hohes Risiko .
Daher sichern sich die Forenbetreiber ab , so dass derjenige , der noch bei der letzten Tanzparty Slim Shady oder " der Neckermann " war , sich hüten sollte , diesen Namen auch in einem Forum zu benutzen .
We don´t play guitars
Wer Gitarrespielen lernen möchte , der ist am Anfang häufig frustriert .
Dies resultiert aus der Tatsache , dass sich die Träume vom " schnell über die Saiten fahren und einen tollen Sound hinkriegen " mit der gleichen Geschwindigkeit verflüchtigen , wie sich Blasen an den Fingern bilden .
Insbesondere jene , die Probleme mit dem Notenlesen haben , sind dann oft geneigt , aufzugeben .
Gitarrenlehrer nutzen daher Gitarrentabs , die es ermöglichen , auch ohne Kenntnisse im Notenlesen zu spielen .
Oft wird eine Seite eines Buches schnell einmal kopiert und dem Lehrling diese Kopie in die Hand gedrückt , auf dass er zu Hause fleißig übe .
Gleichermaßen geben Gesangslehrer ihren Zöglingen Kopien der Noten und Texte der Stücke in die Hand , welche bis zum nächsten Mal einstudiert werden sollen .
Wer dieses Verfahren online anwendet und seinen Schülern auf der eigenen Homepage Texte und Noten von populären Musiktiteln oder Gitarrentabs erfolgreicher Rocksongs zur Verfügung stellt , hat gute Chancen auf eine kostenintensive Abmahnung .
Der Räuber und der Prinz
Peinliche Videos , die einen beim ersten Töpfchengang , dem Spielen mit der Quietscheente oder aber beim Imitieren der ersten großen Popstarliebe zeigen , sind leider ein Highlight bei Familienfesten .
Während Torte und Kaffee in Massen verschlungen werden , zeigen sich die Verwandten begeistert ob der vielen Erinnerungen , die durch diese Videos entstehen , während die Protagonisten nicht selten in guter alter Pharisäertradition Rum oder Baileys in ihren mit Schlagsahne verzierten Kaffee gießen um zu vergessen , dass sie tatsächlich dort auf dem Bildschirm oder der Leinwand zu sehen sind , " Holiday " von Madonna , " You can win if you want " von Modern Talking oder " Boys don´t cry " von The Cure trällernd beziehungsweise zum Sound von " New kids on the block " ein Tänzchen wagend .
Wohl kaum ist damit zu rechnen , dass in einem solchen Moment jemand aufspringt um die Erziehungsberechtigten des kindlichen Raubkopierers zu verklagen , da er mit seinem Auftritt ja gegen Urheberrechte verstößt .
Im Internet dagegen ist damit zu rechnen , dass selbst ein Kurzauftritt des Sprösslings als Verstoß gegen den Digital Millenium Copyright
Act geahndet wird , so im Hintergrund unautorisiert ein Musikstück läuft .
Chemicals between us
Die öffentlichen Bibliotheken , so sie denn gut bestückt sind , bieten in den Chemiebüchern diverse Versuchsanleitungen , bei denen es wahlweise zu einem Knall , Rauchentwicklung oder Funkenstieben kommt .
Sich mit anderen über derartige Versuche auszutauschen ist kein Problem .
Auf diese Weise können Fehler vermieden und neue Ideen entwickelt werden .
Veröffentlicht jemand im Netz beispielsweise die " Einführung in die Sprengchemie " , muss er dagegen mit einer Hausdurchsuchung sowie einer Anklage wegen Verstoßes gegen das Waffengesetz rechnen .
H-i-t- l-e-r/ Sweet Sixteen
Weder bei einem der diversen Aufmärsche von Neonazis , noch bei deren Kundgebungen , ist es den Zuhörern verboten , sich durch das Anhören der " Argumente " der Damen und Herren ein eigenes Bild über die dahinterstehende Ideologie zu verschaffen .
Wohl kaum jemand käme auf die Idee , eine Hundertschaft einzusetzen , die sämtlichen Zuschauen die Ohren und Augen zuhält , auf dass zwar weiterhin die Reden gehalten , jedoch nicht mehr wahrgenommen werden können .
Anders im Netz - dort werden seit langem Forderungen nach Netzsperrungen laut , die nicht etwa erreichen sollen , dass bestimmte Inhalte nicht mehr verbreitet , sondern vielmehr nicht mehr wahrgenommen werden sollen .
Ob bei rechtsradikalen Inhalten oder bei der Kinder - und Jugendpornographie : der Politik , den Strafverfolgern und den Lobbyisten fällt diesbezüglich viel ein .
Besonders absurd sind solche Regelung für selbstgemachte Posingphotos , die seit kurzem als " Jugendpornographie " verboten sind .
Wer in der wärmeren Jahreszeit an FKK - Stränden , im Freibad oder in der Stadt Jugendliche in engen Tops , knappen Bikinis , Mini-Stringtangas oder hüllenlos sieht , der fragt sich , inwiefern es legitim sein kann , dass das Betrachten von Jugendlichen und Kindern im realen Leben , auch wenn diese wenig bis gar nichts tragen , kein Problem darstellt , während es im Internet als Begründung für Netzsperren dient .
Es geht hier ja nicht , wie suggeriert wird , nur um die Bilder von " live vergewaltigten Kindern " , es geht auch um Bilder von Kindern und Jugendlichen , die in " aufreizenden Posen " zu sehen sind , egal ob bekleidet oder nicht ( von den Schriften usw .
ganz zu schweigen )
Hear no bullshit , say no bullshit ...
Wer einen Diskussionsabend initiiert , der wird , auch bei kontroversen Themen , nicht wissen , ob es nicht auch zu gegebenenfalls strafrechtlich relevanten Äußerungen kommt .
Es ist unwahrscheinlich , dass er verpflichtet wird , sämtliche Redebeiträge vorab zu prüfen und gegebenenfalls abzulehnen .
Gleichermaßen ist nicht damit zu rechnen , dass er zur Verantwortung gezogen wird , wenn es zu Redebeiträgen kommt , die strafbar sind .
Wer über eine bestimmte Softwarefirma referiert , der muss damit rechnen , dass auch Kommentare wie " legt die doch mit einem DoS lahm " getätigt werden .
Wird der Sachverhalt auf das Internet übertragen , so kann nicht nur der Forenbetreiber als " Störer " belangt werden , er muss vielleicht sogar sämtliche Beiträge vorab prüfen , ob sie eventuell strafrechtlich relevant sein könnten .
Verglichen mit dem Netz ist das Leben ein Sündenpfuhl .
Das Gerede vom " rechtsfreien Raum " kann also nur von Menschen kommen , die sich nicht einmal entfernt mit dem Internet und den Urteilen zu Störerhaftung , Urheberrecht , Markenrecht usw .
befasst haben .
Der Kampfbegriff des " rechtsfreien Raumes " wird exzessiv genutzt , obgleich er erwiesenermaßen falsch ist .
Hierbei wurde die Tatsache , dass Länder versuchen , ihre Rechte auf sämtliche Inhalte des Netzes auszudehnen , nicht einmal erwähnt .
Ebenso wenig wie die Tatsache , dass z.B. bei YouTube je nach Landesauswahl manche Videos nicht zur Verfügung stehen .
Im realen Leben wäre dies so als würde eine Disco in den USA die deutschen , französischen , italienischen ...
Gäste bei manchen Stücken herausbitten .
Manches Verhalten ist im Netz weitaus gefährlicher als im realen Leben .
Wer sich ein Fahndungsplakat ansieht , wird nicht vom nächsten BKA - Mann beschattet , wer sich dagegen eine Webseite des BKA ansieht , muss schon einmal damit rechnen , dass die digitale Spur aufgenommen wird .
Wer angesichts all dieser Urteile , Regelungen und Ideen noch vom rechtsfreien Raum spricht , der nutzt diesen Begriff lediglich , um das ohnehin schon viel zu stark und unübersichtlich reglementierte Internet mit all seinen Diensten noch weiter in gesetzliche Fesseln zu legen , auf dass eine der wenigen Möglichkeiten , sich gegebenenfalls noch mit anderen zu solidarisieren oder sich unabhängig zu informieren , weiter eingeschränkt wird .
Denn Solidarität ist nicht erwünscht und freie Information ebenso wenig .

Viking Graffiti in Hagia Sophia
Tagma ton Varangion , the Varangian Guard , was first created in the Byzantine Empire under Basil II Bulgaroctonus ( Slayer of the Bulgars ) , one of the outstanding Byzantine emperors .
After the death of John I Tzimisces in 976 , who governed the empire before Basil , two powerful generals revolted and received military support from Georgia and Baghdad .
Basil II and his great - uncle , Basil the chamberlain , were able to defeat them by 989 only with the help of Vladimir of Kiev .
There were many Scandinavians among Russian soldiers who faught for Basil II under Vladimir , and some Varangians eventually remained in Basil II ’s service .
The emperor distrusted the native Byzantine guards and employed the Vikings , who came from Russia , as his personal bodyguards .
New recruites from Scandinavia came to serve in the Varangian guard until the late 11th century .
Military service in Miklagard ( the Great City , thus Vikings termed Constantinople ) was so popular that Sweden passed a law according to which no one could inherit while staying in Greece .
Viking mercenaries who fought for Byzantians but were not members of the Varangian Guard , were known as Megali Eteria ( the Great Companions ) .
They took part in Byzantine naval expeditions against Crete in 902 and 949 .
They participated in the Italian expedition in 936 .
They also faught Arabs in Syria as part of the Byzantine army in 955 .
These Vikings lived in Constantinople for long periods and they certainly visited Hagia Sophia , the greatest Christian cathedral of the empire .
Their presence is attested by runic inscriptions found there .
The first one was discovered in 1964 on a parapet on the top floor of the southern gallery .
The inscription is not well preserved so that only a fragment can be deciphered : - alftan , which certainly stands for Halfdan .
The second inscription was discovered in 1975 in a niche in the western part of the same gallery .
It contains the name Ári or Árni .
Five more possible runic inscriptions in Hagia Sophia were reported to the Norwegian Runic archive in 1997 .
Many others are possibly waiting to be found .

The New Yorker has a great profile of Sheila Bair , the populist Republican who's at the helm of the FDIC .
( h/t Riverdaughter )
As you may already know , Bair is not well liked by the Wall St. crowd that 's running the White House show .
( Apparently she has this bizarre idea that her job is to look out for working folk .
Crazy talk ! )
Well , she 's very popular with regular people - the administration would n't get rid of her , it would make a stink .
Instead , they 've just neutered her :
These debates entered into the Administration ’s discussions about building a new regulatory architecture .
In late March , Geithner previewed for Congress some of the key concepts that Treasury wanted .
The outline seemed to match the Bair camp ’s ideas .
[ Ladies , has this ever happened to you ? ]
A new authority with the power to take over large financial institutions that posed a systemic risk to the economy was modeled on the F.D.I.C. , which , Geithner suggested in his testimony , would be an equal partner with Treasury in resolving such firms if they failed .
He seemed to be saying that although he and Bair may have disagreed about how to handle the current crisis , there was much more consensus about how to deal with a future one .
But in the white paper detailing the new legislation , which the Administration released on June 17th , all the new authority to regulate firms that posed systemic risk was vested in the Federal Reserve .
During Geithner ’s testimony before the Senate , Jim Bunning , of Kentucky , echoing Bair , was incredulous .
“ It took fourteen years for the Fed to write one regulation on mortgages after we gave it the power to do that , ” he said .
“ What makes you think that the Fed will do better this time around ? ”
In addition , while the March plan said that the “ Secretary and the FDIC would decide ” how to resolve a failing firm , the new plan said such power should “ be vested in Treasury . ”
Geithner could appoint the F.D.I.C. to do the technical work of cleaning up the firm , but between late March and mid-June — when Bair ’s aggressive ideas about how to handle Citigroup leaked to the press —
Bair ’s agency had been downgraded from Treasury ’s equal partner to a sidekick .
The senior Treasury official said that stripping authority from the F.D.I.C. had nothing to do with pressure from the banks .
“ Making a group decision on something that must be done really quickly is not easy , ” he said .
“ At the end of the day , someone has to have the ability to make a call , and it ’s better to have that authority vested in one person . ”
When I asked Bair about the plan , she said , “ I think it reflected a lot of input from a lot of different agencies , and the private sector , and insurance and consumer groups .
It ’s a very difficult task to try to balance all the different perspectives and come up with a package , and every compromise is going to have people who are unhappy about various parts of it .
So I think it ’s a starting point . ”
I said that she sounded disappointed .
“ I do n’t know if ‘ disappointed ’ is the right word , ” she replied .
A father has refused permission for his daughter 's Oxford school to take her fingerprints - fearing it is step towards a ' Big Brother ' state .
Ben Emlyn - Jones 's daughter Louisa , 12 , attends St Gregory the Great School in Cowley - which is planning to use fingerprint recognition software in its library .
On Tuesday , it was revealed that Windale Primary School , Glory Farm Primary School , Matthew Arnold Secondary School and The Cherwell School currently use fingerprint systems in libraries and Cheney School uses the technology to register pupils .
Mr Emlyn - Jones said : " I am really quite disturbed about it , it reminds me of a Big Brother state .
" There may be advantages in having a fingerprint database , but the price you pay is too high . "
He refused to allow his daughter 's fingerprints to be taken and was also concerned that the school had not contacted parents .
He added : " It is as if they know it is wrong and have done it secretly , hoping no - one finds out . "
Mr Emlyn - Jones said he was opposed to the principle of biometric data being used by schools .
" Once people are on a computer then the world 's your oyster as far as the Government is concerned .
" It also desensitises kids .
When they 're grown up and they apply for a passport and apply for jobs they wo n't bat an eyelid about having fingerprints taken or a laser being shined in their eyes . "
This week , Liberal Democrats called for Government guidelines to be introduced to control the use of the technology in schools .
But Mr Emlyn - Jones said that would not satisfy his concerns .
He said : " Once the infrastructure is in place those guidelines could be abolished .
That 's my concern . "
St Gregory the Great 's learning resources manager Hilja Bassett said the library system , which would be operational next term , was very efficient and secure .
She added : " It can only be used in this one place , in this one way , for this purpose . "
She said fingerprints were not stored , just certain data taken from the print .
Parents had been informed through a newsletter , she added , and pupils who did not wish to use the system could still make use of library services .
Insurance giant AIG is trying to seize a $ 490 million charitable endowment — and claw back $ 27 million it already awarded to New York charities — to pay executive bonuses , The Post has learned .
The endowment , called Starr International Foundation , is run by former AIG chairman Hank Greenberg , and has given millions to the Sept. 11 Memorial and Museum , Citymeals and other local groups .
At issue is a legal conundrum that started in the 1970s , when Greenberg was building AIG into the world ’s largest insurance empire , and wanted a way to reward his executives off the books .
He and several co-founders set up their own offshore piggy bank — unaffiliated with AIG ownership — and seeded it with their own stock shares that would pay dividends and build up nest eggs and bonuses for retiring executives .
The separate company , Starr International Co. , worked well for decades .
But in 2005 , Greenberg was pushed out of AIG in a boardroom coup , foreshadowing AIG ’s collapse .
Greenberg closed his piggy bank for any future bonuses beyond 2005 , though AIG executives who had vested by that point can collect when they turn 65 .
The rest of the AIG shares held by Starr International Co. — about 290 million — were transferred to a charitable subsidiary , Starr International Foundation .
AIG said it ’s entitled to the whole pot of stock going back to 2005 , when it was worth about $ 20 billion .
A year ago , it was worth nearly $ 11 billion , until AIG ’s recent collapse .
At Friday ’s close , the shares were worth $ 490 million .
AIG says it has the right to seize the stock because Greenberg set up the company specifically for company employees .
The insurer says in a legal filing that it needs the foundation ’s money “ for the exclusive purpose of being distributed to AIG employees in the future . ”
AIG intends to go to trial in federal court June 15 .
AIG lawyers said in documents it would seek not just the shares still left in the foundation ’s coffers , but the shares the foundation already cashed out in the past three years to raise $ 27 million in grant money .
That money went to groups like the Sept. 11 Museum ( $ 1 million ) , Seedco ( $ 500,000 ) and Citymeals ( $ 250,000 ) .
AIG did n’t return calls by The Post about how the seizure and potential clawbacks of assets would impact charities .
Greenberg declined to comment .
AIG has stuck by its previous statement that it needs the charity ’s assets “ so the company can attract and retain top employees to manage the business , preserve and restore stockholder value and ultimately repay taxpayers . ”
Legal experts say that if AIG wins its case , it would have the right to sue to claw back some of the $ 27 million already awarded to charities .
The government owns nearly 80 percent of AIG due to the Treasury ’s $ 70 billion cash infusion and loans for up to $ 85 billion .
Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - Calif. ) , who has often grilled AIG in congressional probes , said that if AIG wins the money from the foundations and other charities , “ it should go to taxpayers , not for bonuses . ”

' I miss my son a lot , I can think of nothing else ' [ Jun. 16th , 2009 | 01:45 pm ] 6 Degrees 6degreesaa
[ dongthimai ]
My husband was twenty years older than me , but he was a good husband .
Then , one day , it all went wrong .
I found out I was pregnant , and he said I had a choice - either he would give me US $ 5,000 and I should come back to Vietnam and have the child there , or I should have an abortion .
I asked him why I should make such a choice , but all he would say was that was the only choice he could give me .
I did not want to have an abortion , and I thought he would come round in time , so I said I accepted to come back to Vietnam to have the baby .
I never saw him again .
The next day his sister came to the house to take me to the airport , but she gave me less than US$ 100 .
I came back home , but I was here only three days before I got a bad feeling in my stomach .
I thought that something bad must be going on with my husband , and I was worried .
So I took out a loan and bought a ticket to go back to Taiwan .
I went to his sister 's house , and she told me he was dead .
He had killed himself on the very day I had found out I was pregnant .
I could not believe it .
I begged my sister - in - law to tell me the truth , but she said that was the only truth she knew .
She said that I could stay with her until the baby was born , and that it would be better than going back to Vietnam .
So I stayed with her throughout my pregnancy and she treated me well .
But as soon as my son was born , this all changed .
She took my son away as soon as he was born , and I did not even get a chance to look at him .
She would not let me tell my parents he had even been born .
I cried and cried and cried , but she would not let me see my son , even though I begged her on my knees and tore at her skirts .
I was weak from the birth , and it made no difference .
The sister then forced me to sign a legal document - at the time I did not know what it was , but she told me afterwards that I had signed away my rights to my son - my mother 's rights have been refused , so the sister gets the child .
Then the sister gave me US $ 5,000 to come back to Vietnam and leave my son behind .
I used the money to pay off the loan I had to take out to go over there in the first place .
But once I was here , I had time to gather my strength and to recover from everything .
Then , not long afterwards , I knew I had to go back and try and get my son .
I then bought another ticket to back to Taiwan .
A guy in Ho Chi Minh cCty charged me US$ 300 to process it , and the ticket itself cost US$ 300 .
I have n't yet seen my own son .
I flew back and I was alone on the flight and I do n't think I have ever felt that alone before .
I had not told my family what was going on , so they could be of no support to me .
The sister came to the airport to meet me , but instead of taking me to her house , she left me at the house of another sister , who told me that , if I ever wanted to see my son , I had to work as her housemaid .
She was very cruel to me , I could tell she did not like to even look at me .
She hit me and often gave me no food .
Then , after about two weeks , I awoke in my room one night to find her trying to stab me with a pair of scissors .
She was trying to kill me .
I was so shocked and scared - I only just managed to get away .
I ran to a neighbours ' house and they called the police .
They did not know I 'd even been next door to them .
The police sent me back to Ho Chi Minh , and I managed to get lifts back to my village .
I have n't told my family any of this .
I do n't want to make them nervous .
They think I will get my son back when he is ten and that he is to get a good education in Taiwan first .
What else can I tell them ?
They would be so sorry to hear what has happened , and I can not shame them like that .
This is my burden .
I miss my son a lot .
I am obsessed with him , I can think of nothing else .
These feelings are so strong , but I do n't dare go back .
I think they would not hesitate to attack me again .
I cannot even earn a living for my family at the moment .
My health is very fragile at the moment , I find it impossible to work .
I am ill from the thought of the whole experience .
Taiwan was a nightmare for me , I hardly dare recall the memory of that time for the pain it brings .
My son calls my sister - in - law mother now .
But , if his life could be better , I would rather he grew up in Taiwan .
I want to go out and earn a living now , but I am too scared of strangers .
I am frightened to see or hear of quarrels , fighting , beating .
It all affects me .
No one can guide me or console me .
I do n't even know the exact words to describe my experience .
Mrs Brown is fast approaching her 25,000th library loan
An avid reader in south west Scotland is on the brink of borrowing her 25,000th book from her local libraries .
Louise Brown , 91 , from Stranraer , took her first book on loan from Castle Douglas library in 1946 .
Since then she has borrowed at least six books every week throughout each year and has recently increased that to about 12 volumes every seven days .
Library staff said they were amazed by the achievement , particularly since Mrs Brown has never had an overdue fine .
The Dumfries and Galloway pensioner first became a member at Castle Douglas library and has particularly fond memories of the staff there .
' Remarkable lady '
She began using Stranraer Library in October 2002 when she moved there to live with her daughter .
Staff at the library described Mrs Brown as a " remarkable lady " and said they looked forward to her weekly visits .
They also believe that her book borrowing figures could constitute a Scottish record .
They have asked any library with a more prolific reader to contact them .
Janice Goldie , the cultural services manager for the region , said they had not heard of anyone who could match her .
She said : " We are fascinated to know if Mrs Brown 's record can be beaten .
" There may be other people out there who can beat them and we would love them to get in touch .
" We very much want Dumfries and Galloway to be celebrated as a reading region . "
In parts 1 and 2 of this series , we looked at PHP namespace basics , the use operator , and name resolution .
In this final article we discuss some of the more advanced namespace options .
The __NAMESPACE__ Constant
__NAMESPACE__ is a PHP string that always returns the current namespace name .
In the global space it will be an empty string .
<? php namespace App\Lib1 ; echo __NAMESPACE__ ; // outputs : App\Lib1 ?>
The value has obvious benefits during debugging .
It can also be used to dynamically generate a fully - qualified class name , e.g .
<? php namespace App\Lib1 ; class MyClass { public function WhoAmI ( ) { return __METHOD__ ; } } $c = __NAMESPACE__ . '\ \ MyClass ' ; $m = new $ c ; echo $ m-> WhoAmI ( ) ; // outputs : App\Lib1 \MyClass :: WhoAmI ?>
The namespace Keyword
The namespace keyword can be used to explicitly reference an item within the current namespace or a sub-namespace .
It is the namespace equivalent of self within classes :
<? php namespace App\Lib1 ; class MyClass { public function WhoAmI ( ) { return __METHOD__ ; } } $m = new namespace \MyClass ; echo $ m-> WhoAmI ( ) ; // outputs : App\Lib1 \MyClass :: WhoAmI ?>
Autoloading Namespaced Classes
One of the best time - saving features of PHP 5 is autoloading .
In global ( non-namespaced ) PHP code , a standard autoload function could be written :
<?php $ obj1 = new MyClass1 ( ) ; // classes / MyClass1.php is auto - loaded $ obj2 = new MyClass2 ( ) ; // classes / MyClass2.php is auto - loaded // autoload function function __autoload ( $ class_name ) { require_once ( " classes /$class_ name.php " ) ; } ?>
In PHP 5.3 , you can create an instance of a namespaced class .
In that situation , the fully - qualified namespace and class name is passed to the __autoload function , e.g. the value of $ class_name could be “ AppLib1MyClass ” .
You could continue to place all your PHP class files in the same folder and strip the namespace from the string , however , that could result in file name clashes .
Alternatively , your class file hierarchy could be organized in the same way as your namespace structure .
For example , a MyClass .
php file could be created in the folder / classes / App / Lib1 :
\classes \App\Lib1\MyClass.php :
<? php namespace App\Lib1 ; class MyClass { public function WhoAmI ( ) { return __METHOD__ ; } } ?>
A file in root folder could then use the following code :
myapp.php :
<? php use App\Lib1 \MyClass as MC ; $ obj = new MC ( ) ; echo $ obj->WhoAmI ( ) ; // autoload function function __autoload ( $ class ) { // convert namespace to full file path $ class = ' classes \ ' . str_replace ( '\\ ' , '/' , $ class ) . '. php ' ; require_once ( $ class ) ; } ?>
Explanation :
The class AppLib1MyClass is aliased as MC. new MC( ) is translated to new AppLib1MyClass ( ) during compilation .
The string “ AppLib1MyClass ” is passed to the __autoload function .
This replaces all namespace backslashes with file path forward slashes , and modifies the string so the file “ classesAppLib1MyClass.php ” is loaded .
I hope you found this series of PHP namespace articles useful .
Will you be namespacing in your PHP code ?

Using the Minimum Wage to Hamper Your Rivals By David Henderson
In my 2001 book , The Joy of Freedom : An Economist ’s Odyssey , I told of how unions have pushed for minimum wage laws to hamper low - wage competition ( traditionally much of that competition came from black workers ) and how some firms have done the same .
I wrote :
The loss in jobs caused by the minimum wage is not an accidental byproduct of higher minimum wages .
It is the consequence intended by those who most avidly support increasing minimum wages .
Unions do n’t support minimum wage increases because their own members are working at the minimum wage .
Virtually all union employees –I ’ve never heard of an exception –work at wages above the minimum .
Northern unions and unionized firms , for example , have traditionally supported higher minimum wages to hobble their low - wage competition in the South .
In the late 1960s , Otis Elevator pushed for an increase in the minimum wage in New York state because it had begun to specialize in converting human - operated elevators to automatic elevators and wanted an increase in demand for its services .
Forty years ago , the politicians who pushed for the increased minimum wage did not hide their motives .
Nor , in an era of state - sanctioned segregation , did they feel the need to hide their knowledge of who the intended victims of minimum - wage increases would be .
In a 1957 Senate hearing , minimum - wage advocate Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts , who just four years later would be President of the United States , stated , Of course , having on the market a rather large source of cheap labor depresses wages outside of that group , too – the wages of the white worker who has to compete .
And when an employer can substitute a colored worker at a lower wage–and there are , as you pointed out , these hundreds of thousands looking for decent work–it affects the whole wage structure of an area , does n’t it ?
Over at marginalrevolution.com , Alex Tabarrok shows that that motive may be alive and well in many businesses ’ support for minimum wage laws today .
A New York Times reporter expresses surprise that businesses already paying more than the minimum wage would support an increase in the minimum .
There is , of course , another possible motive , which Alex points out .
These businesses may support the increase because they believe paying higher wages is the right thing to do .
But one of the easiest things to do in the world is to advocate that other people be forced to do what you ’re already doing voluntarily .
There ’s nothing admirable about that whatsoever .
One of Alex ’s commenters states that those who want to pay higher than the minimum are already paying for their views .
But he misses the point of his own comment .
If they ’re already paying , then the incremental cost to them of the minimum wage increase is zero .
Federal authorities in North Carolina on Monday arrested seven men who they said had trained with high - powered weapons as part of a terrorist conspiracy to wage an Islamic holy war overseas .
The men -- including a father who , authorities said , trained in jihad camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan , and his two sons -- sought to provide material support to terrorists and to murder , kidnap , maim and injure people overseas , according to a seven - count federal indictment .
The indictment did not allege that the group was plotting attacks on U.S. soil .
If convicted , the suspects , all but one of whom are U.S. citizens , could face life in prison .
At least some of the men were willing to die as martyrs , according to the indictment , which described a plot that began in 2006 and lasted until earlier this month .
It said that the North Carolina residents had raised donations to support their training and had recruited and radicalized others -- “ mostly young Muslims or converts to Islam , to believe . . . the idea that violent jihad was a personal obligation on the part of every good Muslim . ”

The men also offered weapons training and helped arrange overseas travel and contacts for others seeking to wage holy war , the indictment said .
Two federal law enforcement officials on Monday said the men did not commit any violent acts .
Although the indictment provided few details , it outlined a plan among four of the suspects “ to meet up ” in Israel , as well as other overseas forays .
The conspiracy , according to the government , included other suspects “ known and unknown , ” and its aim was to provide money , training , transportation and personnel to those wanting to fight a holy war against countries friendly to the United States .
David Kris , assistant attorney general for the Justice Department ’s national security division , singled out Daniel Patrick Boyd for conspiring “ to recruit and help young men travel overseas in order to kill . ”

“ These arrests today show there are people living among us , in our communities in North Carolina and around the U.S. , that are honing their skills to carry out acts of murder and mayhem , ” said Owen D. Harris , special agent in charge of the FBI ’s Charlotte , N.C. , division , which led the investigation .
The Charlotte division includes Raleigh , Durham and Chapel Hill , N.C. , where authorities say the men conspired .
The indictment alleged that Boyd , 39 , traveled to Gaza in March 2006 and attempted to enter farther into the Palestinian territories with one of his two sons .
A year later , the indictment said , Boyd -- who called himself Saifullah , or Sword of God -- his son Zakariya Boyd and two other suspects went to Israel to wage jihad but returned without success .
Defendant Ziyad Yaghi , according to the indictment , traveled to Jordan in 2006 to “ engage in violent jihad . ”
And Hysen Sherifi , a 24 - year - old U.S. legal permanent resident , traveled to his native Kosovo in July 2008 to “ wage violent jihad , ” then returned to North Carolina to raise support for Islamic militants , the indictment said .

Daniel Patrick Boyd and the other suspects showed others how to fire Kalashnikov AK - 47s and other weapons similar to those used in Afghanistan , authorities said .
Over the last two months , Boyd and some of the others honed their weapons skills on private property in rural Caswell County , the indictment said .
The seven men made preliminary court appearances Monday and are due to appear at detention hearings Thursday in federal court in Raleigh .
No attorneys for the men were listed in the criminal filings unsealed Monday .
Authorities would not comment on an unidentified associate of the men who the indictment said left the U.S. on Oct. 7 , 2008 , “ to travel to Pakistan to engage in violent jihad . ”

The indictment unsealed Monday has highlighted the complexities of the U.S. presence in Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent decades .
Daniel Patrick
Boyd once fought in Afghanistan and trained in guerrilla camps there and in Pakistan , the indictment said .
But , it added , he did so between 1989 and 1992 in an effort to fight the occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union .
Washington led and financed that campaign against its Cold War enemy with hundreds of millions of dollars in military and intelligence assistance , training and manpower .
The Associated Press reported that Boyd , a drywall installer in Willow Spring , N.C. , and his brother had been convicted of bank robbery in Pakistan in 1991 and of carrying identification showing they belonged to the radical Afghan guerrilla group Hezb - i - Islami .

In practise I have seen data that shows it has no effect whatsoever .
The tobacco companies admit to putting in ammonium phosphate but this is just to supplement the ammonia that is already there as during distillation and burning , ammonia is formed .

Nicotine is a tobacco alkaloid .
It produces a reaction with nicotinic receptors and produces effects on muscles and the brain .
The pleasures of smoking are caused by nicotine itself .
It relaxes people making them feel good .
You can measure the blood level of nicotine and research has shown that as that level drops the smoker will reach for another cigarette , the blood level will go back up again and they will be happy .
It is without doubt the most pharmacologically active agent .
Every chemical is dangerous if you have high enough levels of concentrations .
Everyone knows that when children first smoke they become sick , have headaches and can vomit .
The same can be said of tobacco pickers , they absorb tobacco through the skin , when initially exposed to it they get nausea .
This is low exposure and these people recover .
But for the average smoker , it would certainly not be the nicotine that would do them harm .
The tobacco industry seem to be lowering and lowering the levels of nicotine , I ’m not sure that is necessarily a good thing because there is a case to be made for increasing the level of nicotine and keeping the tar down " .

Similarly the nitrosamines are formed chemically in the body .
These substances were widely used as solvents at one time .
Luckily that 's all stopped now .
They are without any doubt carcinogenic .
It 's difficult to take them out of tobacco smoke because they are not in tobacco , they are actually produced during the burning process .

North Korea is thought to have thousands of missiles North Korea has test - fired a series of missiles in an apparent act of defiance on 4 July , American Independence Day .
Reports say at least seven Scud - type ballistic missiles were fired , with a range of about 500 km ( 312 miles ) .
South Korea and Japan called the latest tests , which follow several others in recent weeks , an " act of provocation " .
North Korea is banned from all ballistic missile - related activities under UN sanctions imposed after a second underground nuclear test in May .
South Korea 's Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) said the missiles were fired from one of the North 's east coast launch sites on Saturday morning .
All landed in the Sea of Japan , known in South Korea as the East Sea .
NORTH KOREA 2009 TESTS 4 July - Seven suspected ballistic missiles fired 2 July - four short - range cruise missiles launched 25 May - second underground nuclear test brings new UN sanctions 25 / 26 May - series of short - range rockets fired 5 April - N Korea says long - range rocket was satellite launch
North Korea 's missile programme
What is North Korea 's game plan ?
" Our military is fully ready to counter any North Korean threats and provocations , " the JCS said in a statement .
A South Korean defence official said Saturday 's tests were of greater concern than four short - range ones on Thursday , as the missiles had longer ranges .
" Thursday 's missile tests were apparently made as part of a military drill but today 's launches , which came on the eve of the US Independence Day , are believed to be aimed at political purposes , " the official told Yonhap news agency .
The South Korean government condemned the launches for being in breach of the recent UN security council resolution .
A spokesman for the US state department , meanwhile , described North Korea 's behaviour as " not helpful " and urged it not to aggravate tensions , AFP news agency reported .
Nuclear warhead fears
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says the launches are seen there as part of North Korean efforts to ratchet up the tension .
The missiles ' estimated 500 km reach - although still technically short - range - brings most of South Korea withing striking distance , our correspondent says .
Japanese and South Korean media have reported that North Korea may be preparing to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile .
Our correspondent says there are no signs that such a test could be imminent .
Pyongyang is banned from testing ballistic missiles under UN resolutions but launched a long - range rocket in April , which many governments saw as a thinly disguised test of Taepodong - 2 missile technology .
There are fears that North Korea is trying to produce nuclear warheads small enough to put on missiles - but experts say this appears to be several years away .
After six -nation talks aimed at curbing North Korea 's nuclear ambitions broke down earlier this year , Pyongyang said it would " weaponise " its plutonium stocks and start enriching uranium .
On 12 June the UN Security Council approved a resolution allowing inspection of air , sea and land shipments in and out of North Korea suspected of carrying banned arms and weapons - related material .
The North has said it will treat any interception of its ships as a declaration of war .
Korea analyst Aidan Foster - Carter told the BBC that the international community will have to wait and see what North Korea wants , while reprimanding it and taking what action it can .
He believes that the political situation inside North Korea could be behind its recent behaviour .
There are questions over the health of leader Kim Jong - il , after his apparent stroke last year .
Reports suggest he has named his youngest son as his successor - and some analysts believe the recent bellicosity could be a show of strength aimed at securing domestic support for his plans .

Significant new capabilities have been added to the US Air Force 's latest superfighter , the F - 22 " Raptor " .
The USAF 's Raptors cost more than $ 300 m each , and are generally thought to be the most advanced combat jets in service worldwide .
However , until recently they were unable to cross the international date line owing to a software bug in their navigation systems .
A group of F - 22s heading across the Pacific for exercises in Japan earlier this month suffered simultaneous total nav-console crashes as their longitude shifted from 180 degrees West to 180 East .
Luckily , the superjets were accompanied by tanker planes , whose navigation kit was somewhat less bleeding - edge and remained functional .
The tanker drivers were able to guide the lost top - guns back to Hawaii and the exercises were postponed .
" Every time we fly this jet we learn something new , " Raptor squadron commanding officer Lt - Col Wade Tolliver said .
But enemies of democracy who may have been planning an opportunistic attack on Hawaii followed by a retreat to safety across the date line should n't get their hopes up .
The software bug has been rectified , and the Raptors have now successfully travelled to Kadena Air Base in Japan , where air - combat exercises are now well underway .
" This is history in the making , " said Brigadier Punch Moulton , commanding the Kadena - based 18th Wing .
The deployment is expected to last more than three months . ®

Somali-Americans subjected to first Obama “ terror ” prosecution
By Bill Van Auken
16 July 2009
The US Justice Department unsealed an indictment in Minneapolis Monday against two young Somali - Americans in what is the latest in a long line of cases charging defendants with “ material support ” for terrorism .
This case bears particular scrutiny in that it is the first major terror - related prosecution initiated under the Obama administration .
While most previous cases have involved hapless individuals lured into FBI - concocted “ terror plots ” by government agent provocateurs , Federal prosecutors are portraying this case as of a different caliber , involving “ homegrown ” jihadists , radicalized in the US itself .
They suggest that it is an indication of how the supposedly long arm of al Qaeda can reach into the American Midwest .
Charged in the indictment are Abdifatah Yusuf Isse , 25 , and Salah Osman Ahmed , 26 .
Court documents indicate that Isse pleaded guilty months ago and has been cooperating with the FBI investigation .
They were two of an estimated 20 young Somali - American men from the Minneapolis area who are described as “ missing . ”
Federal investigators have charged that they returned to their families ’ homeland to join a group called the Al Shabaab , which is Arabic for “ youth . ”
The government has portrayed the organization as the Somali branch of Al Qaeda .
Relatives of some of those who returned have denied that they went back to fight , insisting that they were visiting family members in Somalia .
The indictments were preceded by an FBI dragnet in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota , with scores of Somali - Americans interrogated and three money transfer businesses serving local Somalis raided by government agents .
Similar aggressive tactics are being employed in Somali communities elsewhere , including in Atlanta , Georgia .
The national media has picked up the story , highlighting it as an ominous indication of continuing threats of terrorism in the United States .
The New York Times , which published a three - page feature on the Minnesota Somali - Americans just one day before the indictment was released , attributed the Somali - American ’s actions to “ the vulnerability of Muslim immigrants in the United States to the lure of militant Islam . ”
It said that they demonstrated “ how a far - flung jihadist movement found a foothold in America ’s heartland . ”
Acting as a virtual press agent for the Justice Department and the FBI , the Times described the case as the “ most significant domestic terrorism investigation since Sept. 11 . ”
Largely glossed over in the coverage of the case are the concrete circumstances that apparently prompted a number of young men , who had spent most of their lives in the US , to return to fight in their native land .
Relatively little has been revealed about the concrete charges and evidence against the two indicted men — a federal judge ordered the case sealed on Wednesday , apparently at the request of the government , and defense lawyers have made no comments .
But it is clear that it was the conditions that prevailed in Somalia — not some ubiquitous “ lure of militant Islam ” that prompted the politicization of a number of young Somali - Americans in Minnesota and elsewhere .
In December 2006 , the Ethiopian army , accompanied by US Special Forces troops , invaded Somalia to overturn the government formed by the Islamic Courts Union movement , which had brought the country a measure of social peace and economic revival for the first time in 15 years .
This act of US - sponsored “ regime change ” was accompanied by widespread carnage and brutality .
Testimony given to the House Foreign Affairs committee by Human Rights Watch in October 2007 , around the time that the Minnesotan Somalis began returning to their homeland , gives an indication of the horrific conditions created by the US - engineered intervention .
The report spoke of the indiscriminate Ethiopian shelling of the Somali capital of Mogadishu , “ a city where hundreds have died and up to 400,000 people were displaced from the past six months of intense violence . ”
Ethiopian troops , the report said , had “ violated the laws of war by widely and indiscriminately bombarding highly populated areas of Mogadishu with rockets , mortars and artillery .
Its troops on several occasions specifically targeted hospitals and looted them of desperately needed medical equipment . ”
It also cited “ documented cases of Ethiopian forces deliberately shooting and summarily executing civilians . ”
As a result , it said , “ Tens of thousands of displaced people are living in desperate circumstances without sufficient food , water , shelter or medical supplies , easy prey to extortion and abuse by the warring parties . ”
It cited even more horrific crimes in the Ogaden , part of the Somali region of Ethiopia , reporting “ many killings by the Ethiopian forces ; the burning of villages ; widespread sexual violence ; the arbitrary detention and torture of thousands in military custody ; denial of access to wells ; confiscation of livestock and hostage - taking to compel families to turn in family members suspected of [ resistance ] . ”
During the same period , the US military carried out missile attacks on Somalia that left large numbers of civilians dead .
It was these crimes , in which the Ethiopian military was acting as Washington ’s proxy , that prompted at least some Somali - American youth to go back to their homeland , apparently to defend those under attack .
The Al Shabaab group was the most prominent in organizing resistance to foreign occupation .
Moreover , when the youth from Minnesota allegedly became involved with it , Al Shabaab was not classified by the US government as a “ terrorist organization . ”
That designation came only in March 2008 .
The portrayal of Al Shabaab as a Somali branch of al Qaeda is a gross distortion .
It has been implicated in no attacks or threats of attack on American targets , either in the US or elsewhere .
Its Islamist ideology notwithstanding , the organization was justifiably seen by Somalis as a movement of national resistance to foreign occupation .
The definition of such resistance as “ terrorism ” has a long and shameful history bound up with the crimes of European colonialism in Africa .
These crimes are now being repeated by US imperialism in Somalia as in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere .
The violence and death unleashed by US militarism on the peoples of these countries constitute the real acts of terrorism .
The frame - up of these young Somali - Americans is an indication that the Obama administration , like its predecessor , is seeking to terrorize the American people with manufactured terror threats in order to suppress opposition to policies of aggressive war abroad and attacks on democratic rights at home .
Lenin addresses the opening of the second congress of the Communist International .
By Barry Healy
June 28 , 2009 , was the anniversary of the two bookends of World War I , in which it is estimated more than 15 million people died .
On that date in 1914 Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo and , five years later , in 1919 , 90 years ago this year , the Versailles Treaty was signed in Paris .
The first war in which the capacity of modern industry to deploy , feed , arm and dismember people was so hideously demonstrated , WWI was experienced by its victims as the " war to end all wars " .
Unfortunately , it proved not to be .
Out of the ashes of the conflict two competing visions of world peace arose : Versailles and the revolutionary and democratic alternative represented by the Communist International ( Comintern ) emanating from the 1917 Russian Revolution .
US President Woodrow Wilson swept into the treaty negotiations declaring : “ The world must be made safe for democracy . ”
Over six months of intense horsetrading at Versailles a new imperialist order was hammered out , resulting in many of the conflicts that followed .
The number of people who have died because of the Versailles Treaty is beyond counting .
Wilson 's policy was enunciated in his famous January 1918 ``Fourteen Points '' speech to a joint sitting of the US Congress .
He spoke of open diplomacy , as opposed to the dreadful secret diplomacy that preceded WWI , providing “ mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike ” .
Lenin's Decree on Peace
His speech was attempting to dampen the international resonance of Lenin ’s October 1917 Decree on Peace , through which Russia ended its part in WWI .
Lenin demanded an immediate peace without annexations and without indemnities .
“ The workers ' movement will triumph and will pave the way to peace and socialism ” , Lenin proclaimed .
Wilson 's speech was designed to protect US post - war interests through free trade , collecting the European war debt , open maritime navigation and access to a US Pacific empire .
At least 27 nations were represented in the treaty process , but the only ones that counted were the victorious major powers : the British Empire , France , Italy and , above all , the USA .
Australia ’s great contribution was to oppose a push by Japan to have a clause inserted proscribing discrimination on the basis of race or nationality .
Colonised and oppressed peoples came from all around the world as supplicants , begging for their national rights .
For example : there were Vietnamese asking for independence from France and Koreans hoping for freedom from Japan .
In central Europe , with the collapse of the Austro - Hungarian Empire , new nationalist movements were springing up .
Poland declared independence ; the Czechs and Slovaks produced a newly merged state .
The Croatians and Slovenians joined with Serbia to form what became Yugoslavia .
Various Middle Eastern peoples , including Syrians , Lebanonese , and an Arab delegation led by Prince Faisal with Lawrence of Arabia as translator , articulated their national desires .
Crumbs
What these emergent nations got was whatever crumbs the Powers were prepared to allow them , and it was n’t much .
The decisions were literally made in private , initially by four men : Woodrow Wilson , Georges Clemenceau , Lloyd George and Vittorio Orlando of Italy .
Orlando left in a huff when a territorial grab he made was rejected , leaving the fate of the world in the hands of the remaining three .
Among other things , they redrew the borders of Europe to suit their nations ' ruling clasees ' purposes , began the League of Nations to administer their new order and inflicted crippling reparations on Germany .
The new European nations were at least allowed some say in their borders , not so the people of the Middle East after the shambolic collapse of the Ottoman Empire .
There , new borders , nations and rulers were not decided by the people on the ground , but by Britain and France .
Oil and strategic considerations determined the British and French governments '
Middle East policy , plus blatant racism .
The winner in the area was the Zionist movement , which emerged , through the Balfour Declaration , with the right to establish their own state in Palestine .
However , the ghost haunting the conference , unspoken but terrifying , was revolutionary Russia .
Russia was excluded on the technicality that it had settled a separate peace with Germany .
But , Communist parties were springing up in emulation of the Bolsheviks all over Europe and beyond and revolution was in the air .
Comintern
The Comintern , founded in March 1919 in Moscow on the Bolshevik ’s initiative , combined revolutionaries from various backgrounds : Marxists , anarchists and anti-colonialist nationalist fighters .
Because of the raging civil war and the imperialist blockade , only 51 delegates could get to the Congress .
Twenty - two countries were represented .
Twenty per cent of delegates represented Asian peoples .
Lenin declared that the Comintern 's foundation “ heralds the international republic of soviets , the international victory of communism ” .
Even though the Russian Revolution was still desperately fighting for its survival against right - wing gangsters and foreign armies , Lenin proposed to the congress some theses explaining the nature and potential of soviet power .
These theses , expounding a new vision of democracy based on soviets , or workers ’ councils , were a clarion call to all the peoples of the world .
“ The permanent and only foundation of [ soviet ] state power , the entire machinery of state , is the mass - scale organisation of the classes oppressed by capitalism ” , the theses said in part .
Soviet power “ is so organized as to bring the working people close to the machinery of government ” .
That is why , the theses explained , the councils were workplace - based , not territorial .
The working people 's mass organisations were joined in “ constant and unfailing participation in the administration of the state ” .
Obstacles to democracy such as the capitalist armed forces , bureaucratic and judicial apparatus were done away with .
At the Comintern ’s 1920 second congress colonial peoples began leading discussions about their liberation .
Indian delegate MN
Roy later said “ for the first time , brown and yellow men met with white men who were no overbearing imperialists but friends and comrades ” .
The second congress resolved to unite “ the proletarians and toiling masses of all nations ” in a common struggle “ to overthrow the landowners and the bourgeoisie ” .
To achieve that “ all communist parties must directly support the revolutionary movement among the nations that are dependent … and in the colonies ” .
It also called for “ a vigorous campaign against restrictive immigration laws ” , equal wages for non-white workers and their unionisation - issues that still need to be resolved .
The Bolsheviks had already demonstrated their commitment to such principles when , in 1917 , they proclaimed the right of all subject peoples within the former Russian empire to “ free self - determination up to and including the right to secede ” .
This emancipatory line was strengthen at the Comintern - organised 1920 Baku Congress of Peoples of the East .
The nearly 2000 delegates called for a peoples ’ “ holy war ” for liberation of the East .
They called for ending “ the division of countries into advanced and backward , dependent and independent , metropolitan and colonial ! ”
Stalinism
The historical tragedy , of course , is that Stalin came to corrupt and reverse these revolutionary sentiments .
Beginning in 1924 he took control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and , in 1928 , began his infamous repression of the party 's revolutionary wing .
In 1922 , the Comintern ’s fourth congress restated its revolutionary principle : “ The proletarian revolution can never triumph completely within a single country ; rather must it triumph internationally , as world revolution . ”
Two years later , Stalin stated “ the possibility of building a complete socialist society in a single country ” is “ indisputable truth ” .
Soon , the Stalinised Soviet Union began manoeuvring against the world 's revolutionary masses and with the Great Powers .
Humanity was herded towards World War II .

A group of chemists from the University of Santiago de Compostela ( USC ) has developed a method to quantify the fragrance allergens found in baby bathwater .
The researchers have analysed real samples and detected up to 15 allergen compounds in cosmetics and personal hygiene products .
A team of scientists from the Department of Analytical Chemistry , Nutrition and Bromatology at the USC has developed a method to detect and quantify the 15 most common fragrance allergens included in soap , gel , cologne and other personal hygiene products .
" Applying the method to eight real samples obtained from the daily baths of a series of babies aged between six months and two years old , we discovered the presence of all the compounds under study in at least one of the samples , " co-author of the study published this month in Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry , María Llompart , explained to SINC .
The scientists found at least six of the 15 compounds in all the samples .
In some cases , concentrations were " extremely high " , exceeding 100 ppm ( parts per million = nanograms / millilitre ) .
Some of the substances that appeared were benzyl salicylate , linalol , coumarin and hydroxycitronellal .

" The presence and levels of these chemical agents in bathwater should be cause for concern , " Llompart said , " bearing in mind that babies spend up to 15 minutes or more a day playing in the bath and that they can absorb these and other chemicals not only through their skin , but also by inhalation and often ingestion , intentional or not . "
New Method to Detect Fragrances
Allergens were able to be detected due to the high level of sensitivity of the method , which for the first time applies the Solid - Phase Micro Extraction ( SPME ) technique to determining the ingredients of cosmetics and child hygiene products .
This technique makes it possible to concentrate and isolate chemical components from a sample by absorbing them into fibres with a certain coating .
The researchers have also employed gas chromatography to separate compounds and mass spectrometry to identify and measure the abundance of each of the fragrances .
European regulations stipulate that the presence of such substances should be indicated on the label of the product when levels exceed a certain limit ( 0.1 or 0.01 % , depending on the type of compound ) , but some associations believe these limits are excessively tolerant , particularly where child hygiene and baby and child care products are concerned .

The Problem of Panhandling
This guide addresses the problem of panhandling .†
It also covers nearly equivalent conduct in which , in exchange for donations , people perform nominal labor such as squeegeeing ( cleaning ) the windshields of cars stopped in traffic , holding car doors open , saving parking spaces , guarding parked cars , buying subway tokens , and carrying luggage or groceries .
The guide begins by describing the panhandling problem and reviewing factors that contribute to it .
It then identifies a series of questions that might help you in analyzing your local problem .
Finally , it reviews responses to the problem , and what is known about those responses from evaluative research and police practice .
Generally , there are two types of panhandling : passive and aggressive .
Passive panhandling is soliciting without threat or menace , often without any words exchanged at all — just a cup or a hand held out .
Aggressive panhandling is soliciting coercively , with actual or implied threats , or menacing actions .
If a panhandler uses physical force or extremely aggressive actions , the panhandling may constitute robbery .
Isolated incidents of passive panhandling are usually a low police priority .
1
In many jurisdictions , panhandling is not even illegal .
Even where it is illegal , police usually tolerate passive panhandling , for both legal and practical reasons .
2
Courts in some jurisdictions have ruled that passive panhandling is constitutionally protected activity .
Police can reasonably conclude that , absent citizen complaints , their time is better spent addressing more serious problems .
Whether panhandling and other forms of street disorder cause or contribute to more serious crime — the broken windows thesis — is hotly debated , but the debate is as yet unsettled .
3
Panhandling becomes a higher police priority when it becomes aggressive or so pervasive that its cumulative effect , even when done passively , is to make passersby apprehensive .
4
Panhandling is of greater concern to merchants who worry that their customers will be discouraged from patronizing their business .
Merchants are most likely to call police when panhandling disrupts their commerce .
5 , †
Police must also be concerned with the welfare of panhandlers who are vulnerable to physical and verbal assault by other panhandlers , street robbers ‡ or passersby who react violently to being panhandled .
6
Panhandlers often claim certain spots as their own territory , and disputes and fights over territory are not uncommon .
7
Broadly speaking , public policy perspectives on panhandling are of two types — the sympathetic view and the unsympathetic view .
The sympathetic view , commonly but not unanimously held by civil libertarians and homeless advocates , is that panhandling is essential to destitute people 's survival , and should not be regulated by police .
8
Some even view panhandling as a poignant expression of the plight of the needy , and an opportunity for the more fortunate to help .
9
The unsympathetic view is that panhandling is a blight that contributes to further community disorder and crime , as well as to panhandlers ' degradation and deterioration as their underlying problems go unaddressed .
10
Those holding this view believe panhandling should be heavily regulated by police .
People 's opinions about panhandling are rooted in deeply held beliefs about individual liberty , public order and social responsibility .
Their opinions are also shaped by their actual exposure to panhandling — the more people are panhandled , the less sympathetic they are toward panhandlers .
11
While begging is discouraged on most philosophical grounds and by most major religions , many people feel torn about whether to give money to panhandlers .
12
Some people tolerate all sorts of street disorder , while others are genuinely frightened by it .
This tension between opposing viewpoints will undoubtedly always exist .
This guide takes a more neutral stance : without passing judgment on the degree of sympathy owed to panhandlers , it recognizes that police will always be under some pressure to control panhandling , and that there are effective and fair ways to do so .
Related Problems
Panhandling and its variants are only one form of disorderly street conduct and street crime about which police are concerned .
Other forms — not directly addressed in this guide — include :
† In some instances , there is a fine distinction between panhandlers who use brief entertainment as part of their solicitation and more - accomplished street musicians , jugglers , mimes , and other skilled entertainers .
Some of these other forms of disorderly street conduct may also be attributable to panhandlers , but this is not necessarily so .
These problems overlap in various ways , and a local analysis of them will be necessary to understand how they do .
Factors Contributing to Panhandling
Understanding the factors that contribute to your panhandling problem will help you frame your own local analysis questions , determine good effectiveness measures , recognize key intervention points , and select appropriate responses .
Whether Panhandling Intimidates Passersby
Panhandling intimidates some people , even causing some to avoid areas where they believe they will be panhandled .
13
One - third of San Franciscans surveyed said they gave money to panhandlers because they felt pressured , and avoided certain areas because of panhandling ; nearly 40 percent expressed concern for their safety around panhandlers .
14
But most studies conclude that intentional aggressive panhandling is rare , largely because panhandlers realize that using aggression reduces their income , and is more likely to get them arrested or otherwise draw police attention to them .15
Whether panhandling intimidates passersby depends , of course , on how aggressive or menacing the panhandler is , but it also depends on the context in which panhandling occurs .
In other words , an act of panhandling in one context might not be intimidating , but the same behavior in a different context might .
16 Among the contextual factors that influence how intimidating panhandling is are :
The time of day ( nighttime panhandling is usually more intimidating than daytime panhandling )
The ease with which people can avoid panhandlers ( panhandling is more likely to intimidate motorists stuck in traffic than it is those who can drive away )
The degree to which people feel especially vulnerable ( for example , being panhandled near an ATM makes some people feel more vulnerable to being robbed )
The presence of other passersby ( most people feel safer when there are other people around )
The physical appearance of the panhandler ( panhandlers who appear to be mentally ill , intoxicated or otherwise disoriented are most likely to frighten passersby because their conduct seems particularly unpredictable ) 17
The reputation of the panhandler ( panhandlers known to be aggressive or erratic are more intimidating than those not known to be so )
The characteristics of the person being solicited ( the elderly tend to be more intimidated by panhandlers because they are less sure of their ability to defend themselves from attack )
The number of panhandlers ( multiple panhandlers working together are more intimidating than a lone panhandler )
The volume of panhandling ( the more panhandlers present in an area , the more intimidating and bothersome panhandling will seem ) .
Who the Panhandlers Are
Typically , relatively few panhandlers account for most complaints to police about panhandling .
18
The typical profile of a panhandler that emerges from a number of studies is that of an unemployed , unmarried male in his 30s or 40s , with substance abuse problems , few family ties , a high school education , and laborer 's skills .
19 Some observers have noted that younger people — many of whom are runaways or otherwise transient — are turning to panhandling .
20 , † A high percentage of panhandlers in U.S. urban areas are African - American .21
Some panhandlers suffer from mental illness , but most do not .
22 Many panhandlers have criminal records , but panhandlers are nearly as likely to have been crime victims as offenders .
23
Some are transient , but most have been in their community for a long time .
24
Contrary to common belief , panhandlers and homeless people are not necessarily one and the same .
Many studies have found that only a small percentage of homeless people panhandle , and only a small percentage of panhandlers are homeless .
26 , ‡
Most studies conclude that panhandlers make rational economic choices — that is , they look to make money in the most efficient way possible .
27 Panhandlers develop their " sales pitches , " and sometimes compete with one another for the rights to a particular sales pitch .
28
Their sales pitches are usually , though not always , fraudulent in some respect .
Some panhandlers will admit to passersby that they want money to buy alcohol ( hoping candor will win them favor ) , though few will admit they intend to buy illegal drugs .
29
Many panhandlers make it a habit to always be polite and appreciative , even when they are refused .
Given the frequent hostility they experience , maintaining their composure can be a remarkable psychological feat .30 Panhandlers usually give some consideration to their physical appearance : they must balance looking needy against looking too offensive or threatening .
31
Some panhandlers hope that candor will increase donations .
Here , a panhandler 's donation box reveals that the money will be spent on beer as well as on food .

Who Gets Panhandled and Who Gives Money to Panhandlers
In some communities , nearly everyone who routinely uses public places has been panhandled .†
Many who get panhandled are themselves people of modest means .
Wealthy citizens can more readily avoid public places where panhandling occurs , whether consciously , to avoid the nuisances of the street , or merely because their lifestyles do not expose them to public places .
Estimates of the percentage of people who report that they give money to panhandlers range from 10 to 60 percent .
34
The percentage of college students who do so ( between 50 and 60 percent ) tends to be higher than that of the general population .
There is some evidence that women and minorities tend to give more freely to panhandlers .
35
Male - female couples are attractive targets for panhandlers because the male is likely to want to appear compassionate in front of the female .
36 Panhandlers more commonly target women than men,37 but some find that lone women are not suitable targets because they are more likely to fear having their purses snatched should they open them to get change .38 Conventioneers and tourists are good targets for panhandlers because they are already psychologically prepared to spend money .
39 Diners and grocery shoppers are good targets because dining and grocery shopping remind them of the contrast between their relative wealth and panhandlers ' apparent poverty .
Regular panhandlers try to cultivate regular donors ; some even become acquaintances , if not friends .
Where and When Panhandling Commonly Occurs
Panhandlers need to go where the money is .
In other words , they need to panhandle in communities and specific locations where the opportunities to collect money are best — where there are a lot of pedestrians or motorists , especially those who are most likely to have money and to give it .40 Panhandling is more common in communities that provide a high level of social services to the needy , because the same citizens who support social services are also likely to give money directly to panhandlers ; panhandlers are drawn to communities where both free social services and generous passersby are plentiful .
41
With respect to specific locations , panhandlers prefer to panhandle where passersby cannot readily avoid them , although doing so can make passersby feel more intimidated .
42
Among the more common , specific panhandling locations are the following :
Near ATMs , parking meters and telephone booths ( because ATM users , motorists and callers are less likely to say they do not have any money to give )
Near building entrances / exits and public restrooms with a lot of pedestrian traffic
On or near college campuses ( because students tend to be more sympathetic toward panhandlers )
Near subway , train and bus station entrances / exits ( because of high pedestrian traffic , and because public transportation users are likely to be carrying cash to buy tickets or tokens )
On buses and subway trains ( because riders are a " captive audience " )
Near places that provide panhandlers with shade and shelter from bad weather ( such as doorways , alcoves and alleys in commercial districts )
In front of convenience stores , restaurants and grocery stores ( because panhandlers ' claims to be buying food or necessities for them or their children seem more plausible , and because shoppers and diners often feel especially fortunate and generous )
At gas stations ( because panhandlers ' claims that they need money for gas or to repair their vehicle seem more plausible )
At freeway exits / entrances ( because motorists will be stopped or traveling slowly enough to be able to give money )
On crowded sidewalks ( because it is easier for panhandlers to blend in with the crowd should the police appear )
At intersections with traffic signals ( because motorists will be stopped )
Near liquor stores and drug markets ( so the panhandlers do not have to travel far to buy alcohol or drugs ) .
43
There are typically daily , weekly , monthly , and seasonal patterns to panhandling ; that is , panhandling levels often follow fairly predictable cycles , which vary from community to community .
For example , panhandling may increase during winter months in warm - climate communities as transients migrate there from cold - weather regions .
Panhandling levels often drop around the dates government benefits are distributed , because those panhandlers who receive benefits have the money they need .
Once that money runs out , they resume panhandling .
44 Panhandling on or near college campuses often follows the cycles of students ' going to and coming from classes .
45
There are usually daily lulls in panhandling when those panhandlers who are chronic inebriates or drug addicts go off to drink or take drugs .
Regular panhandlers keep fairly routine schedules , typically panhandling for four to six hours a day .
46
Economics of Panhandling
Most evidence confirms that panhandling is not lucrative , although some panhandlers clearly are able to subsist on a combination of panhandling money , government benefits , private charity , and money from odd jobs such as selling scavenged materials or plasma .
47
How much money a panhandler can make varies depending on his or her skill and personal appeal , as well as on the area in which he or she solicits .
Estimates vary from a couple of dollars ( U.S. ) a day on the low end , to $ 20 to $ 50 a day in the mid-range , to about $ 300 a day on the high end .
48 Women — especially those who have children with them — and panhandlers who appear to be disabled tend to receive more money .
49
For this reason , some panhandlers pretend to be disabled and / or war veterans .
Others use pets as a means of evoking sympathy from passersby .
Panhandlers ' regular donors can account for up to half their receipts .
50
Panhandlers spend much of their money on alcohol , drugs and tobacco , although some money does go toward food , transportation and toiletries .
51 Panhandlers rarely save any money , partly because they risk having it stolen , and partly because their primary purpose is to immediately buy alcohol or drugs .
52
Economic , Social and Legal Factors That Influence Panhandling Levels
Broad economic , social and legal factors influence the overall level of panhandling , as well as community tolerance of it .53
Tolerance levels appear to have declined significantly during the 1990s , at least in the United States , leading to increased pressure on police to control panhandling .
The state of the economy , at the local , regional and even national level , affects how much panhandling occurs .
As the economy declines , panhandling increases .
As government benefit programs become more restrictive , panhandling increases .
54
At least as important as economic factors , if not more so , are social factors .
The stronger the social bonds and social network on which indigent people can rely for emotional and financial support , the less likely they are to panhandle .
55
Thus , the weakening of social bonds throughout society affects the indigent most negatively .
As substance abuse levels rise in society , as , for example , during the crack epidemic , so too do panhandling levels .
As the skid rows in urban centers are redeveloped , the indigent people who live there move to areas where their panhandling is less tolerated .
As people with mental illnesses are increasingly released into the community , often without adequate follow - up care , panhandling also increases .
Where there are inadequate detoxification and substance - abuse treatment facilities , panhandling is high .56
As courts strike down laws that authorize police to regulate public disorder , and as police are less inclined to enforce such laws , panhandling flourishes .57
Arrest and incarceration rates may also affect panhandling levels : convicted offenders often have difficulty getting jobs after release , and some inevitably turn to panhandling .

Mrs Freeman refuses to show her face to strangers
Sultaana Freeman , a United States citizen who converted to Islam six years ago , had her licence revoked after she refused to remove the veil , called a niqab , for the picture .
She filed a lawsuit in January 2002 claiming that forcing her to remove the niqab , which leaves only her eyes uncovered , violated her constitutional right to religious freedom .
However , Judge Janet
Thorpe found that " the momentary raising of her veil for the purpose of the ID photo does not constitute a substantial burden on her right to exercise her religion " .
The requirement that all potential drivers have their driver 's licence photos taken unveiled , uncloaked , and unmasked does not unconstitutionally burden the free exercise of religion
Judge Janet Thorpe
Judge
Thorpe said it was essential that drivers could be identified from their licence photographs in order the ensure that the public were kept safe from " criminal activities and security threats " .
" The state 's need to be able to immediately identify subjects of investigative traffic stops and criminal and intelligence investigations outweighs anyone 's need to pose for a driver 's licence photo wearing any garb that cloaks all facial features except the eyes , " she said .
Sensitive issue
Mrs Freeman , who testified wearing the veil , said that her faith banned her from revealing her face to strangers or men outside the family .
Islamic scholars differ on what constitutes correct dress for women and consequently Muslim women adopt widely differing dress codes .
Civil rights groups say anti-Muslim feeling increased after the 11 September attacks
In the wake of the 11 September attacks in New York and Washington the US has massively beefed up its public security measures
Following Mrs Freeman 's refusal to remove her veil the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles accused Mrs Freeman of being " hypersensitive " .
Jason Vail , an assistant state attorney , said the requirement did not target a particular religion .
" It targets everyone , " he said .
But civil rights and privacy advocates with the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) backed Mrs Freeman 's lawsuit .
They said the state acted out of prejudice against Muslims which became heightened after the attacks in Washington and New York , blamed on Muslim terrorists from the al - Qaeda network .

Video games are on the list of the most popular mainstream media , which makes up an important percentage of social activity for a considerable portion of youngsters worldwide .
The Middle East region is no exception ; video games are as popular in the region as it is anywhere else in the world despite the minimal support / focus of the major hardware players Nintendo , Sony and Microsoft .
Their lack of interest in the region – so far – keeps the doors open for piracy to nourish and dominate the regional video games industry .
For instance , almost every Nintendo Wii in Saudi Arabia is modified with a special chip to allow the machine to play pirated games that cost 3 $ to 8 $ in comparison to the original games costing around $ 80 – $ 100 in the region – even higher than their prices in many western countries -.
Is price the issue here ?
Partially yes , but not for the entire region .
We have to bear in mind that countries in the Middle East differ substantially in their income levels .
There are the richer Gulf countries where people ’s income rivals the income of European countries , and there are other countries which are not rich at all and where people ’s incomes are much lower .
Both cases can be treated differently with a proper distributor from the major hardware players .
The answer maybe an adequate price point for original content that fits these markets .
Rotana , the biggest Arabic music producer and distributor figured it out , and provided an excellent model of pricing for their music productions that left little room for piracy .
The same can apply to video games .
Localized content and cultural conflicts …
Pricing is not the only barrier holding up the growth of video games in the Middle East .
Other major factors include language , localized content and cultural barriers .
Wall - E , a game built based on the popular animated film produced in 2008 , has been the first world game to be localized for the Middle East .
We are talking here about a single game which received very poor reviews and considerable criticism .
The fact is that localization of games for this market is very minimal , thus leaving out a big pool of people who simply find it hard to understand English .
On the other hand , the Arabic culture and heritage is rarely portrayed the right way in video games produced in the west .
That is understandable in a way because it may not be easy for one to reflect the right cultural heritage of another nation especially when they do n’t have to – games produced are usually targeted for western audience -.
Beside stereotyping ( Delta Force ) and oriental - ism ( Aladdin ) , there are no real Arabic characters that would get video game players in the region to relate to .
It ’s gotten even worse , because – like in Hollywood – major video games that incorporate Arabic characters are usually based on recent Middle Eastern conflicts and thus depicting Arabs as enemies and terrorists !
Local video games productions strike back !
The offensive portrayal of Arabs in some Western video games has triggered local Arab production companies to come up with their own version of video games to protect their identity and perspective of the state of affairs of the regional conflicts .
Afkar Media , a Syrian company , has already produced different games with nationalism streak : Under Ash , a political game that tells the story of the first intifada from the Palestinian perspective .
Under Siege , is another political game that tells the story of a Palestinian family and their struggle during the second intifada ( 1999 - 2002 ) .
Quraish , the first Arabic 3D real strategy game ( RTS ) , tracks the origins of Islam in the desert of Arabic 590 A.C .
Big potential …
With the population of the Middle East approaching 300 million , there is a big market for localized and focused video games .
High rate of illegal software use may be an obstacle , but it can be worked out with proper strategies if there is a good will to penetrate the Middle Eastern market .
Local offices or partnerships with local development companies can also help in delivering some good quality content .
Relatively cost - effective and skilled labor is also available in the region especially in Jordan and Egypt .
Is piracy really what ’s preventing Nintendo , Sony and Microsoft from taking the full advantage of the market ?
Is it a strategic decision – or lack of it – to hold off targeting the M.E. ?
Or is it the lack of consideration of the religious and cultural differences between the East and the West ?
Australia 's most extreme stunt man to the awesomest max
If you have a party , wedding or BBQ that you need a show for , please contact me and I will do you a good price .
I will soon be famous and the price will go up so be quick .
Email me a stunt that you think would be extreme to the awsomest max :
Put aluminium foil in the microwave .
Run in the hallway .
Do n't step off the escalator when it gets to the top .
Talk to strangers .
Get stuck bread out of the toaster with a knife .
Sharpen a pencil with a stanley knife without cutting away from yourself .
Lick a frozen pole .
Run with scissors .
Wear brown shoes with a black belt .
Ask Shannon for petty cash .
Eat ham from the fridge on the 9th when its use by date is the 7th
Touch a cat in the street
Leave the T.V plugged in during a lightning storm .
Coss the road in the middle of the block without even going to the corner ( unless a car is coming ) .
Hello , my name is Mr Carganovsky and I have been a professional stunt man for nearly four weeks .
In that time I have looked death in the face many times .
My career began when someone clipped the side mirror of my Datsun 180B while I was parked at a K - Mart .
I was inside purchasing credit for my phone at the time and did not notice the cracked mirror until I was driving home .
A police car , with sirens and lights flashing , came up behind me before overtaking and due to the refraction caused by the shattered mirror , when I looked I thought there were about forty police vehicles behind me and I almost had an aneurysm .
I have a few outstanding parking fines .
I swerved and mounted the curb , almost hitting a dog , before bringing the vehicle under control .
The dog was on the other side of the road and behind a fence but if it had n't been , the outcome could have been very different .
The adrenalin rush was unlike anything I had ever experienced and I knew I had found my calling .
The rest of the way home I drove sixty three even though it was a sixty zone as my yearning for the extreme had been fueled .
Last week I ran on the concrete at my local swimming pool and last night I lit myself on fire .
If you hold a gas lighter in your palm with the button depressed then spark it , the gas ignites for a couple of seconds .
My nephews said it was the best trick they have ever seen .
To prepare for each stunt , I enter a deep meditative state through circular breathing execises and twelve hours in my friend Simon 's floatation tank .
As Simon does not own a tape of whale sounds , he makes the noises himself through a hole in the lid which is quite annoying .
I am currently preparing for my latest stunt in which I intend to play with pointy sticks then eat and go swimming without waiting thirty minutes .
Safety is paramount in the stunt business .
My car is completely fitted out with a St Johns first aid kit in the glove compartment .
The vehicle predates manufacturer requirements for air bags but I have glued several rubber stress balls to my steering wheel and replaced the interior lining with bubble wrap .
The car 's exterior , engine , transmission and tyres are completely shot but apart from that the vehicle is in excellent condition so it is worth spending money on .
Last week I had signwriters paint ' Mr Carganovsky , Exteme Stunt Man to the Awesomest Max ' on the side and this has attracted a lot of attention .
I also need to buy a cassette player to play my new theme song while I am doing stunts :
Mr Carganovsky to the Extreme
By Mr Carganovsky , music by Proclaimers
It 's Mr Carganovsky ,
Being extreme to the awesomest max ,
Did you see what he just he did ?
No ?
Pity because it was amazing .
Dont push him , cause he is close to the edge ,
Woh !
As I do not currently have a stereo in the car , I am forced to nod my head and tap the steering wheel to disguise the fact at traffic lights so that people do not point and say " Look there 's Mr Carganovsky sitting in his car in silence .
He must be poor " .
Also , if I am touching metal when I turn the ignition key , I receive a short but painful shock which often causes me to black out for an hour or two .
This accounts for my being late to work at least three times a week and I am on my last warning .
I dont care if I get sacked though as I will be famous soon .
My job consists of googling pictures of cats for ninety percent of the day and the other ten percent constructing reasons why no work gets done .
They have not caught on yet as I hide my browser window by displaying pornography when anybody enters my office .
While my co-workers are in production meetings discussing why nothing is produced , I steal office supplies and sell them on eBay using the proceeds to promote my stunt man career .
Thanks to a bulk office purchase of liquid paper , I was able to have t- shirts made and often I come into work after hours and use the photo copier to print my promotional tour posters .
I usually post a few thousand a week on walls and poles around town so the office UHU sticks have also come in handy .
With the money I make from being a famous stunt man , I am hoping to one day open a stunt school offering courses such as ' Flicking the Light Switch On and Off Repeatedly ' and ' Sitting Too Close to the Television ' .
Karl Rove was deposed by attorneys for the House Judiciary Committee according to Conyers , the panel chairman .
Rove deposed in U.S. attorney probe
Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove was deposed Tuesday by attorneys for the House Judiciary Committee , according to Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) , the panel ’s chairman .
Rove ’s deposition began at 10 a.m. and ended around 6:30 p.m , with several breaks , Conyers said .

Conyers would not comment on what Rove told congressional investigators , what the next step in the long - running Judiciary Committee investigation would be or whether Rove would face additional questioning .
“ He was deposed today , ” Conyers said in an interview .
“ That ’s all I can tell you . ”
Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , declined to confirm or deny that his client had appeared before the committee .
Luskin said there was an agreement that the depositions would remain confidential until they were completed .
However , in a court filing Monday , the Justice Department indicated that the deposition set for this week would be the committee 's last .
Conyers ’ panel had first subpoenaed Rove in 2007 as part of its probe into the firing of nine U.S. attorneys .
But the Bush White House , citing executive privilege , refused to make Rove or White House Counsel Harriet Miers available for any deposition .
Conyers ’ panel responded by filing a civil lawsuit against the White House and prevailed in district court last year but the appeals court had yet to address the issue .
With an agreement between the Obama White House , the Bush White House and House Judiciary Committee , the current Justice Department avoided having to choose sides in court and risk an appeals court precedent which could undercut executive privilege or Congress 's right to investigate alleged government malfeasance .
Miers was interviewed by Judiciary Committee staffers in June .
Our anonymous submitter in Quebec says this note is posted on the door of an apartment in her building .
“ Looks like somebody had a rough breakup , ” she speculates … in which case I think dude is probably better off .
Still , I think the ambiguity here presents a wealth of other possible scenarios , no ?

Not a joke :
The whereabouts of Gov. Mark Sanford have been unknown to state officials since Thursday , and some state leaders are questioning who is in charge of the executive office .
Neither the governor ’s office nor the State Law Enforcement Division , which provides security for governors , has been able to reach Sanford after he left the mansion in a black SLED Suburban SUV , said Sen .
Jake Knotts and three others familiar with the situation but who declined to be identified .
Sanford ’s last known whereabouts were near Atlanta , where a mobile telephone tower picked up a signal from his phone , authorities said .
First lady Jenny Sanford told The Associated Press today her husband has been gone for several days and she does n't know where he is .
The governor ’s personal and state phones have been turned off and he has not responded to phone and text message since Thursday , a source said .
Jenny Sanford said she was not concerned .
She said the governor said he needed time away from their children to write something .
The governor ’s office issued a statement Monday afternoon : " Gov. Sanford is taking some time away from the office this week to recharge after the stimulus battle and the legislative session , and to work on a couple of projects that have fallen by the wayside .
" We are not going to discuss the specifics of his travel arrangements or his security arrangements .
One official familiar with the situation said there is no indication that foul play is involved because Sanford occasionally makes trips without his security detail .

Rough and quick t/l :
Spoiler : Umm ... I guess it 's okay now ?
Endless Eight was organized to be produced as 6 episodes .
Kadokawa 's back sponsor got furious and by the time it was too late , the producer had been fired .
There was huge confusion over whether they were going to skip the produced 4th and 5th episodes and skip to airing the 6th .
By the way , the 6 ep organization was Kadokawa 's instructions .
The fired producer was a scape goat to appease the angry back sponsors .
Kadokawa 's ultimate goal was to blow smoke over the fans by having 12 episodes that would consist of E8 , Sigh , and a new Mikuru 's adventure .
And the disappearance images they had pulled from would remain exactly that ... ( Unsure )
Currently Kadokawa does not feel like animating Disappearance
The purpose of this new production is simple to pull money from the fans ( Extreme paraphrase )

Cash for Clunkers Program Reportedly Suspended
According to reports , the Cash for Clunkers Program could be running out of money , although the White House denies claims that the clash for clunkers program is being suspended .
The Cash for Clunkers program is designed to provide an incentive for people to trade their older vehicles for a new more fuel efficient car .
Those that trade in a car that is 4mpg for fuel efficient receive $ 3,500 and $ 4,500 is provided for a 10 mpg increase .
As part of the program , the traded in vehicle must be destroyed .
The Cash for Clunkers program was slated to run until November 01 , 2009 or until its $ 1 Billion budget had been expended .
However , it has become very popular and by July 28 , around 16,000 dealers had signed up for the program .
If each of the dealers currently participating in the Cash for Clunkers program were to submit only 18 applications , the program ’s budget would be completely depleted and there are reports that some dealers have already submitted more than 250 claims .
At midnight on Thursday , the Department of Transportation reported that the Cash for Clunkers program was being suspended , but these claims were later refuted by the White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs who said , “ We are working tonight to assess the situation facing what is obviously an incredibly popular program . ”
Gibbs went on to say , “ Auto dealers and consumers should have confidence that all valid cars transactions that have taken place to date will be honored . ”
Reports that the Cash for Clunker program had been canceled fueled an increase in nighttime purchases by car dealers .
To date , $ 150 million has already been paid out as part of the Cash for Clunkers program and $ 850 million is slated for pending applications .
Both Congress and the White House are reportedly looking for ways to continue funding for the Cash for Clunkers program , as it has proved an effective means of increasing new vehicle purchases and upgrading to more fuel efficient vehicles .
What Is a Watershed ?
A watershed is also known as a water basin or water catchment .
It is a water storage area which is designated like a dam .
Mostly , the water is collected from the rains over the hills , ridges , and mountains .
It is directed through channels into the watershed .
Mostly , people use the watershed to harvest water from the rains .
In turn , they are able to harness a lot of water which would have otherwise gone as run-off .
Eventually , they can use the water during the dry seasons when water becomes somehow scarce .
A watershed is mostly a community resource which can be accessed by any member .
What are the Health Benefits associated with a Watershed ?
Water is life .
It is a component of animals ’ and plants ’ bodies .
Also , water is very important for domestic use and for manufacturing functions .
Thus , storing water in watersheds is an important aspect in life that ensures survival .
Here are some healthy benefits of watersheds .
a) Water Retention for Ecological Health
With a watershed , large volumes of water will be harvested during the rainy seasons .
Eventually , the rivers and streams will not run dry even after the rainy seasons are over .
The streams and rivers will keep flowing with waver throughout the year .
This is important for the plants , crops , and animals .
This is healthy for both human beings and animals too .
b) To Increase the Fish Population for More Nutrients
During the rainy seasons , many fish , especially spawns , rest , and salmons increase within major lakes and rivers .
Due to this increase , most of them prefer moving from the rivers and lakes and go to other areas .
Watersheds can be a good place to settle the moving fish .
This will act as a rich place for fishing .
This is healthy as it adds nutrients in the diet .
c ) Watersheds Increases the Potential for Nature Access and Adventure
Water pools at home are artificial and limited in size .
At the same time , oceans are miles away from home and with mostly overpopulated beaches .
However , with watershed , community members have a chance to experience nature through access .
People can sail over the watersheds .
Also , watersheds allows for growth of vegetation in the near localities .
People can sail over and watch the most interesting and adventurous part of nature .
Science proves that nature exposure is essential for mental and physical health .
d) Climate Change and Control
The communities which are geared for sustainable development have opted to develop watersheds .
Watersheds are crucial in providing water to the soil for crops and plants to absorb nutrients .
Eventually , many trees and other vegetation are increased in the environment .
More forests , vegetation , and even water bodies are developed .
In places which are dry and with high temperatures , climate control can be easily done using watersheds .
Cooling effect , increased rains , and increased amount of water available comes as a result of watersheds .
This is important for human health .
it aids in control of direct sunlight which might cause cancer .
Also , it helps curb the global warming effect and to increase the volumes of water available for use .
Conclusion
The benefits of watersheds are numerous .
Watersheds are essential for human health in a couple of ways .
They maintain safe ecological condition and also help in controlling and changing the climate .
As a result , food and water increases among populations .
This helps in reducing the rate of diseases outbreak and also reducing unsafe environment conditions .
Tim Lincecum looked worthy of some Cy Young hype with his effort agains the Pittsurgh Pirates Monday night .
Lincecum pitched a complete gams and struck out 15 Pirates .
The San Francisco Giants won the game 4 - 2 .
The two Pirate runs were unearned gifts courtesy of wishy - washy and heavily traveled shortstop Edgar Renteria .
Lincecum only surrendered three hits and made the Pirate lineup look foolish from top to bottom .
No doubt about it , The Freak was cranked up and rolling at the bay !
Granted the fete was somewhat downplayed because it happened against the Karen Carpenter - offense of Pittsburgh .
The Pirates had been shut out their last two starts and Lincecum was not the man they needed to see to get the offensive bus moving forward .
Kharkiv as many other cities in the western part in the USSR was occupied by the Nazi army in the WWII .
It was a big industrial and populated city in the Soviet Ukraine , and so it was very important for German army to have it as soon as possible .
The German troops entered the city on 25 October , 1941 , and the Red army tried to regain it several times .
Kharkiv remained under the occupation for a year and a four months , and at last it was liberated in February 1943 , though , not for long .
It was taken by the enemy soon and the Soviet army set it free only in August 23 , 1943 .
This photos show how was the live under Nazi in a city , which for some time used to be the capital of Ukraine .

With 7.1 percent of the vote , the Swedish Pirate Party has shocked its critics and secured a seat in the European Parliament .
The Pirates received more votes from those under 30 than any other party in the European elections yesterday , and this was celebrated with pints of rum and loads of pirate chants .
Late Sunday night , Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt congratulated the Pirate Party on their unprecedented win at the European elections .
The Pirate Party is seen a serious competitor in Swedish politics now , a fact underscored by the Prime Minister who said that his own party will formulate a clear policy regarding net integrity and copyright issues in preparation for the Swedish national elections in September 2010 .
A few hours earlier , the party dinner had come to a close with volunteers and members singing “ The Broadband Hymn ” .
They had fittingly gathered at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm , and as Swedish TV published the exit polls results indicating that the Pirate Party would get around 7 % of the votes , wild cheers broke out .
Party leader Rick Falkvinge took to the stage .
“ Together we have today re-shaped the political map in Europe , ” he said .
“ Right now , Europe is watching what is happening here and politicians everywhere are scrambling to understand our issues .
They now know that the party that has information - political perspectives can win many votes . ”
And yes , it did .
214,313 of them in Sweden on Sunday .
7.1 percent of the vote and a guarantee of at least one seat in the European Parliament .
The Pirate Party was the most popular party among voters under 30 years of age .
Taking into account that Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt ’s Moderate Party is the most popular party among voters over 65 years of age , one can understand why Reinfeldt later in the evening said he will sit down with the Moderate Youth leader Niklas Wykman – a critic of the surveillance legislation and anti-filesharing laws – to discuss Internet issues .
“ We ’ll share files in Brussels ! ” a young man shouted as he ran to the bar at election night .
Meanwhile , journalists from all over Europe who had flown in to cover the unique occasion tried to get their piece of party leader Rick Falkvinge and vice chairman Christian Engström .
Rick Falkvinge and Christian Engström
The latter , who will probably take the party ’s seat in the EU parliament , held a short speech in which he thanked all the volunteers .
The Pirate Party stays true to its net - roots and has no formal organization .
Anyone who thinks he or she can contribute is welcome to do so simply by posting on the forum and going out and doing it .
No formal decisions on campaigning are taken and the thousands of party ballots have been distributed to voting centers simply by someone living close and wanting to play their part .
“ It ’s amazing that it worked .
I never thought it would , ” Engström joked .
A journalist from Swedish radio broke into the celebrations with a question for party founder Rick Falkvinge on how he felt .
With champagne in his hand and pride in his eyes , he just smiled : “ How does it feel to write history ?
It feels pretty damn good . ”
Today , after a night spent drinking rum and chanting seafarer standards , the pirates woke up finding themselves on the front pages of the Swedish newspapers .
Pirates waving Jolly Rogers .
Pirates taking celebratory late night dips in fountains .
Pirates laughing .
Pirates hugging .
And there is consensus among the op-eds and political pundits on how it could happen : Enthusiasm paid off .
The two large parties in Sweden , the Social Democrats and the Moderate Party , are heavily criticized because of their lack of engagement in the European Parliament .
Meanwhile , the Green Party ( which also had a great election with 10.9 % ) and the Pirate Party positioned themselves on their respective expert issues and built a lot of support from the base .
When the EU parliament meets after summer , there will be at least one pirate in the midst of European parliament .
If the Lisbon treaty is voted through , there can be two .
It may not seem a lot in order to make a difference , but as a blogger put it :
One pirate can hijack a whole ship .
Mr Ellwood was taken to hospital for treatment to his injuries A 17 - year - old boy has been arrested after an MP was beaten by a group of youths when he tried to stop them playing football in the street .
Tobias Ellwood , Tory MP for Bournemouth East , confronted the gang in Boscombe High Street on Saturday afternoon .
They got angry when he took photographs of them on his mobile phone as evidence so he could alert police .
Witnesses saw Mr Ellwood being punched in the head .
Police have told the BBC a teenage boy has been arrested over the attack .
Mr Ellwood went to hospital with minor head injuries and a swollen ear , which has temporarily damaged his hearing .
I 'm reluctant to say too much because I want it to go to trial
Tobias Ellwood The Conservative MP , a former army officer , had finished meeting constituents at a surgery and was on his way to meet his wife and son when the attack happened .
Mr Ellwood said : " I was involved in a serious attack involving four youths which resulted in me having to go to hospital .
" I 'm reluctant to say too much because I want it to go to trial . "
The MP was involved in a similar incident last year when he confronted a gang on the Townsend Estate , in his constituency , when they urinated in someone 's garden .
The gang verbally abused him and threw stones at him when he threatened to call police .
He has previously said he feels more ordinary people should be prepared to tackle anti-social behaviour .
A Dorset Police spokesperson said they received a call from a man reporting he was being assaulted on Roumelia Lane in the Boscombe area of Bournemouth .

Glenn Beck and his fellow wingnuts -- the ones who have been whipping up hysteria among their right - wing populist followers since Obama 's election and before -- essentially announced they have no intention of reflecting on their roles in today 's horrifying shooting at the Holocaust Museum in D.C .
They did this by doing what they always do whenever these situations arise :
First call it all an " isolated incident " committed by a " lone nutcase " who just happens to be acting out beliefs emanating from their own quadrant .
Then , when that fails , blame it on the Left .
Beck offered the following rationale on his Fox News show tonight :
Beck :
What they 're missing is :
The pot in America is boiling .
And this is just yet another warning to all Americans of things to come .
Actually , Beck has this exactly right .
But frankly , it 's boiling because of people like Glenn Beck , ranting hysterically every night about impending apocalypses of various forms -- looming " liberal fascism , " the " economic meltdown , " the " New World Order , " violence spilling over the Mexican border , even FEMA concentration camps .
As I tried to explain in the case of the shooting of Dr. George Tiller , when you spread far - right conspiracy theories through mainstream channels the way Beck does with such abandon , it not only validates their beliefs , it rather hyper - validates them :
It tells these people -- who see the Becks and O'Reillys as part of the " liberal media " -- that things are even worse than they thought , and it often spurs them into action .
But Beck , naturally , has no intention of observing this reality .
He 's running as hard in the other direction as he possibly can :
Beck :
This guy is a lone gunman nutjob .
...
You 're going to see a lot of nutjobs coming out of the woodwork now .
There are two very important things that are happening here .
First one :
It 's what I talked about two years ago , um , when I talked about the " Perfect Storm " -- I said that there is a storm formulating .
And it is the economy , it is political correctness , it 's corruption in Washington , it 's militant Islam .
It 's all of these things .
I said when it comes onshore , there 's going to be a " go go go " mentality .
And that 's what this is .
There is a mentality in our enemies .
Our country is now vulnerable .
Those people who would like to destroy us -- our enemies like , uh , Al Qaeda .
There are also enemies like white supremacists or 9/11 Truthers who would also like to destroy the country .
They 'll work with anybody they can .
...
We are under attack in almost every shape and form in America .
We need to look out for enemies foreign and domestic .
Second :
There is gonna be a witchhunt , I believe , in this country , and quite possibly all around the world .
For two groups .
First group : Jews .
It happens every time .
Second group : I think , Conservatives .
...
Meanwhile , the Department of Homeland Security reports about right - wing extremists .
You remember that came out a few weeks ago ?
Left - wing bloggers and some in the media have blamed conservative hosts like me or Bill O'Reilly for just stirring the pot !
I 'm not stirring the pot .
I 'm pointing out the pot is boiling and there is trouble in America .
Since when -- have you ever heard of ' do n't blame the messenger ' ?
Only when the messenger is n't also one of the people causing the phenomenon they 're describing .
Then it becomes celebration .
And it 's obvious that Beck has positively relished seeing the " boiling point " go higher and higher .
Indeed , he 's been doing his best to apply a white - hot flame to the pot .
Beck :
This is not the work of right - wing conservatives .
This is the work of someone today who is racist , crazy , or most likely , both .
Common sense tells you that there are very hateful people on the Right and the Left .
Yes , but it seems that only one the Right do they do things like shoot up police officers who come to arrest them , or walk into Jewish centers of various kinds and start shooting ( remember Buford Furrow ? ) .
And there is little doubt that James W. Von Brunn was a right - winger -- a far right - winger :
Von Brunn has a long history of associations with prominent neo -Nazis and Holocaust deniers .
In the 1980s or early 1990s , von Brunn was employed by Noontide Press , a part of the Holocaust denying Institute of Historical Review , which was then run by Willis Carto , one of America ’s most prominent anti-Semites .
Von Brunn is the author of the 1999 book , “ Kill the Best Gentiles , ” a racist and anti-Semitic tome that argues that whites are seeing “ today on the world stage a tragedy of enormous proportions : the calculated destruction of the White Race and the incomparable culture it represents .
Europe , former fortress of the West , is now over - run by hordes of non-Whites and mongrels . ”
A raging anti-Semite , von Brunn blames “ The Jews ” for the destruction of the West .
The book is dedicated to prominent neo -Nazis and racists including Revilo Oliver and Wilmot Robertson .
In 2003 , AP reported that von Brunn had painted a portrait of Rear Adm .
John Crommelin , a raging anti-Semite who was a close associate of neo -Nazi William Pierce , whose book The Turner Diaries inspired Timothy McVeigh ’s bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building .
He 's also a " birther . "
But the truly telltale aspect of his record :
In 1981 , he was arrested for attempting a " citizen 's arrest " of Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve Building in D.C. and was sentenced to a prison term for it .
Von Brunn claimed " sovereign citizenship " at the time , which almost certainly means he was an adherent of the white - supremacist / far - right movement called Posse Comitatus , and was acting on those beliefs .
More to the point , this is precisely the same belief system that today fuels the cottage industry in conspiracy theories -- promulgated by the likes of Ron Paul and Alex Jones -- that the Fed is part of a massive conspiracy of " international [ read : Jewish ] bankers " to enslave Americans and destroy the country .
It 's been around quite awhile , but lately it 's been gaining the patina of being regurgitated for mainstream consumption on right - wing media .
And in particular , on Glenn Beck 's programs .
Here , for example , is the time Beck devoted an entire segment to promoting this conspiratorial view of the Fed .
And then there was the more recent hour - long segment ( promoted by Neil Cavuto on Fox as well ) devoted to the latest permutation in these Patriot - movement conspiracy theories -- the " Civilest War " hour promoting " state sovereignty " :
As I said at the time :
Now , it 's one thing to point out the radical origins of these " constitutional theories . "
But it 's also important to understand where they want to take us -- to a radically decentralized form of government that was first suggested in the 1970s by the far - right Posse Comitatus movement .
They essentially argue for a constitutional originalism that would not only end the federal income tax , destroy all civil - rights laws , and demolish the Fed , but would also re-legalize slavery , strip women of the right to vote , and remove the principle of equal protection under the law .
Beck 's not alone in trying to recast Von Brunn as just a " lone nutcase " inspired more by the left than the right .
So is Michelle Malkin , who tries out the right 's usual plaintive line , well - rehearsed for these situations : " [ S ] hooter was n't ' left ' or ' right , ' just plain loony . "
Um , no , actually , when you look at his record , he was indeed " Right . "
With a capital " R . "
Malkin's main evidence that he has " left wing " associations ?
The fact that he 's also a Troofer .
This is , of course , rich .
Now , it should be noted first that there are certain zones of extremist wingnuttery that attract True Believers from both the Left and the Right .
All of them are fundamentally conspiracist in their worldview .
So you 'll find anti-Semitic crap floating around hippie barter fairs of a nature similar to what you might find at a militia gun show .
Conspiracy theorists like the Troofers attract people from both the Left and the Right .
The wingnuts have been trying frantically to make the public forget about the lethal existence of right - wing extremists ever since that Homeland Security bulletin came out -- largely because they want to cover up the fact that the distance between themselves and the real nutcases has become so short indeed .
But the violent extremists never let us forget .
Sooner or later , they act on their beliefs .
And that 's when we start to see just how short that distance has become -- regardless of their attempts to claim the opposite .
It was about four years ago when I first saw a 20Q ball .
The tiny handheld device scrolled text across its meager one - line screen , inviting me to challenge it in a game of 20 Questions .
I immediately thought of an object I figured it would n't guess ( " iPod " ) and began to play the game .
After a series of slightly odd questions -- including " Does it bring joy to people ? " -- the little ball gave its guess : " MP3 player . "
Wow .
It was right .
So how does this 20Q device work ?
The short answer is " artificial intelligence . "
The long answer involves lots of practice .
In 1988 , Canadian inventor Robin Burgener programmed a neural network ( a specialized form of computer program ) capable of playing 20 Questions , but without a library of knowledge about common objects .
He proceeded to teach it twenty questions about the object " cat , " then handed the program ( on floppy disk ) to friends and encouraged them to play , recording their play sessions as it went .
For 20Q , playing equals learning , as it develops " synaptic connections " whenever it receives answers to questions .
It 's able to reinforce connections by playing games over and over with different people , gradually learning which answers are correct and which are n't .
( Thus it 's difficult to " poison " the system by purposely giving it wrong answers . )
The program can then use these connections to pose clarifying questions , eventually arriving at an answer .
By 1995 , Burgener had a good body of connections in his neural network .
He put a version of the 20Q program on the web and encouraged web visitors to play with it ( thus training it in the process ) .
After the online version of 20Q had played one million games ( amassing 10 million synaptic connections in the process ) , Burgener boiled down the 20Q system into a simplified 20 Q - on - a - chip version .
The hardware version was incapable of learning , but contained information about the 2,000 most popular objects chosen by users of the online program .
As such , it embodied a shocking " intelligence " that toy makers later put into the 20Q balls , now available at toy stores everywhere for under $ 15 .
( Specialized versions are also available , including a Harry Potter unit , and later versions of the handheld game have more information built - in . )
Today ( or at least as of late 2006 , the last time its online FAQ seems to have been updated ) , the online version of 20Q guesses correctly about 80 % of the time , and if you allow it 25 questions , it claims a 98 % success rate .
With over 60 million games played online , the neural net continues to learn -- and this learning can be translated into future versions of the 20Q handheld games .
In an interview with Kevin Kelly , Burgener said , " It is learning , but it is not increasing its success rate .
What happens is that it is learning to play more kinds of people , people who do n't speak English easily , or who have never played 20 questions , or who come from different cultures , and to understand more difficult kinds of things . "
You can play 20Q
Online for free , or pick up a handheld version at any reputable toy or game store .
You can read a bit more about the game at Wikipedia or check out more on neural networks for a deeper understanding .
Some companies fail by honest error .
Despite their hard work and honest intentions , they succumb to bankruptcy for neutral reasons – the wrong business model , a bad economy , or superior competitors .
Far more interesting , however , are the stories of companies that were driven into bankruptcy maliciously , through fraud , corruption , or scandal .
Often times , these were proud and profitable businesses whose only mistake was putting too much power into unsavory hands .
Their stories provide both intrigue and a cautionary tale for other businesses to heed .
Here are 12 of the most infamous such bankruptcies .
Lehman Brothers
( Image )
Lehman Brothers possessed more assets – over $ 600 billion – than any U.S. company ever to go bankrupt .
According to SeekingAlpha.com , it was Lehman ’s risk management strategy ( or lack thereof ) that was the main determinant in the company ’s demise .
“ Yes , they had risk management , but it mostly used the “ Value at Risk ” system invented by JP Morgan Chase & Co. ( JPM ) in the early 1990s .
VAR appears to have been designed to let the traders get on with the business of making real money , while at the same time keeping the top brass from worrying too much about the risks traders were taking . ”
The problem , according to AlphaSeeker , is that this model of risk management fails to take into account what could go wrong under , the other 1 % ” of scenarios not forecast by the model .
This turned out to be critical , as Lehman Brothers was staggeringly over - leveraged by a 30:1 ratio that was simply unsustainable .
Public outcry over the situation worsened when it was announced in September 2008 that , in the words of the UK ’s Times Online , “ … staff at Lehman ’s New York office who helped to cause the world ’s biggest corporate bankruptcy are to share in a $ 2.5 billion bonanza , ” of bonus money despite their role in the firm ’s meltdown .
Enron

Enron will forever be the poster child for scandal - driven bankruptcy .
The energy trading titan famously hid billions of dollars in losses from shareholders and the media , engaging in what prosecutor Andrew Weissman called , “ … sanitizing the records so the SEC would have less information . ”
The combined effect of Enron ’s shady accounting practices produced an unprecedented plummet in the ( and any ) company ’s stock price , which sank from $ 90 per share in the late 1990 ’s to $ 0.10 in October of 2001 .
BusinessAndMedia.org reports that this wiped out at least $ 11 billion of stockholder equity , including many of its employees ’ retirement funds .
Prior to WorldCom ’s 2002 collapse ( and the Lehman bankruptcy that eclipsed it ) Enron and its $ 63.4 billion in assets was the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history .
WorldCom

It did n’t take long for Enron to be overshadowed as the quantitatively largest bankruptcy in our history .
Just one year later , in 2002 , telecommunications giant WorldCom and its $ 103 billion in assets were done in by an accounting scandal of epic proportions .
Set into motion by the company ’s own Chief Financial Officer ( Scott Sullivan ) , the swindle was exposed after internal auditing uncovered what CBS News called “ improper accounting of more than $ 3.8 billion in expenses over five quarters . ”
Ousted CEO Bernard Ebbers was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in the debacle .
In addition to WorldCom ’s stock price tanking , “ … as much as 76 % ” in the hours immediately following the news break , roughly 17,000 of the company ’s employees were promptly fired and left without work .
Together with Enron , the disastrous fate of WorldCom has come to define the early 2000 ’s as a decade of corporate malfeasance and misconduct .
Adelphia
( Image )
The downfall of Adelphia Communications is perhaps the saddest bankruptcy story in recent memory .
After decades of hard toil to become the fifth largest cable provider in the United States , founder John J. Rigas and his son Timothy conspired to embezzle millions of dollars from the company they started .
According to the Washington Post , federal prosecutors , “ … alleged that that the Rigas family siphoned $ 100 million from Adelphia to pay for personal extravagances , hid $ 2.3 billion in debt and systematically deceived investors about Adelphia ’s subscriber growth and its bottom line . ”
Adelphia ’s remaining assets were scooped up by Comcast and Time Warner Cable in bankruptcy court and as such , the company no longer exists as an independent entity .
The father - son duo of deception received prison sentences of 15 and 20 years , respectively .
Refco
( Image )
Add Refco to the long and shameful list of financial services firms swallowed by securities fraud .
As reported by CFO.com , Refco CEO Phillip Bennett illicitly used a hedge fund to conceal $ 430 in liabilities stemming from transactions dating back to 1998 ( the year Bennett took command as CEO . )
The fraudulent setup came to light in 2005 , when Bennett was suspended from his post and forced to repay the full amount owed .
Refco later announced that it would need to , “ … restate its financials going back to 2002 ” and the Wall Street Journal notes that the company , “ … sold its regulated futures and commodities business to Man Financial , ” in November 2005 .
Tyco
( Image )
The story of Tyco ’s embezzlement - triggered collapse epitomizes why so many are outraged by corporate misconduct .
Former CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski and CFO Mark Swartz were handed prison sentences of up to 25 years after the pair was found to have , “ … pilfered some $ 600 million from the company including a $ 2 million toga birthday party for Kozlowski ’s wife on a Mediterranean island and an $ 18 million Manhattan apartment with a $ 6,000 shower curtain , ” according to MSNBC .
The first attempt at convicting Kozlowsky and Swartz on 22 counts of grand larceny , securities fraud , falsifying business records and conspiracy ended in a mistrial when one of the jurors was threatened , but the second trial secured the guilty verdict so many had hoped for .
IndyMac Bancorp
( Image )
IndyMac Federal Bank has earned infamy among journalists and pundits for executing a costly “ backdating ” scandal in 2007 - 2008 .
According to ABC News , Treasury Department regional director Darrel W. Dachow , “ … allowed IndyMac to backdate its deposits to hide its ill health . ”
In essence , this consisted of IndyMac recieving an $ 18 million deposit from its parent company on May 9 but recording the cash as if it had arrived before the end of the previous quarter , on March 31 .
This enabled the company to conceal how under - capitalized it was and continue enticing customers to deposit money with the struggling bank .
Indeed , the LA Times reports that IndyMac reeled in some $ 90 million more in uninsured deposits before being placed into receivership .
Washington Mutual
( Image )
The BloggingStocks.com article “ Drugs , Fraud , and Betrayal at Washington Mutual ” paint a horrifying picture of how that company spiraled into bankruptcy and despair .
Asking in vane why regulators did not sense the company ’s troubles , the article reports that the CEO “ snorting methamphetamine every morning ” while embezzling $ 88 million from 2001 - 2007 during the height of the company ’s mortgage fraud fiasco .
A chilling New York Times piece describes the company as having “ built an empire of bad loans ” and reveals how little scrutiny and background checking was exercised in handing out money to untrustworthy borrowers hand over fist .
“ By 2005 , the word was out that WaMu would accept applications with a mere statement of the borrower ’s income and assets — often with no documentation required — so long as credit scores were adequate , according to Ms. Zaback and other underwriters . ”
When all was said and done , J.P. Morgan Chase bought what remained of the failed bank for $ 1.9 billion in a deal brokered by federal regulators , according to the Wall Street Journal .
Conseco
( Image )
Conseco offers yet another example of a once - proud company done in by fraudulent accounting practices .
The University of Chicago law school ’s blog ran a penetrating exposé of Conseco CEO Stephen Hilbert ’s tactics , which included structuring the books in such a way that he was entitled to low - interest loans from company funds and the fact that Conseco “ engaged in accounting fraud related to certain mortgage - backed securities offered by subsidiary Green Tree Financial . ”
The company succumbed to bankruptcy soon thereafter , making Conseco ’s shares ( which were the sole collateral for Hilbert ’s illicit loans ) totally worthless .
Fortunately , Conseco has since cleaned up its act and according to the Wall Street Journal , “ trades publicly and carries a market capitalization of $ 270 million . ”
Tribune Company
( Image )
Staggering under a whopping $ 13 billion in debt , Tribune Company ( parent of the Chicago Tribune newspaper ) filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2008 .
However , many have speculated that there is more to the story .
Disgraced ex-Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich is reported to have threatened to withhold state funds from the Chicago Tribune unless it fired editorial writers who had been critical of Blagojevich ’s policies .
The New York Times reports that Blagojevich told his chief of staff , “ … our recommendation is fire all those [ expletive ] people , get ’em the [ expletive ] out of there and get us some editorial support . ”
It was further speculated that the Blagojevich family delayed Tribune from selling the Chicago Cubs baseball team long enough to force the company into bankruptcy .
Blagojevich ’s wife Patti is reported to have said , “ … hold up that [ expletive ] Cubs [ expletive ] , ” [ expletive ] them . ”
Worse yet , a Chicago Sun-Times article suggests that Tribune editor Sam Zell considered complying with Blagojevich ’s demands to secure $ 100 million in state funds .
Bernard Madoff Securities

Bernard Madoff
Securities did n’t have the brick - and - mortar presence of Enron or Lehman Brothers , but at one point , it held some $ 60 billion swindled from high - profile individuals like New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon and legendary director Steven Spielberg .
( The Wall Street Journal ‘s running tally of victims is a veritable “ who ’s who ” of famous corporations and wealthy individuals from all walks of life . )
So complex are the bankruptcy proceedings for Madoff ’s “ company ” that Irving Piccard and a squad of lawyers have been appointed to dissect it piece by piece .
The Huffington Post quotes the lawyers as saying that Madoff treated the money entrusted to him by victims , “ … as his personal bank account , taking funds when he needed them and transferring funds to other Madoff entities or family members when it suited his whim and purposes . ”
Semgroup
( Image )
Oil trucking and pumping firm Semgroup was pushed into bankruptcy in 2008 by fraudulent trading , according to several sources .
CFO.com reported that SemGroup ’s lender admitted this to be the case in court documents .
Forbes elaborates in its eye - opening article “ Inside The Semgroup Bust ” , noting that CEO Thomas Kivisto illicitly borrowed $ 290 million and lost it on personal trading .
It should be noted that this represented only a fraction of the company ’s total losses , clocked by Forbes at $ 2.4 billion .
Kivisto was ousted from Semgroup in July 2008 after the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy .
Additionally , TulsaWorld reports that Kivisto ( along with ex-CFO Gregory Wallace ) was sued in 2009 seeking the return of $ 362 million in company funds squandered in their own private lives .
The letters asked for the information “ in lieu of subpoena ” but strongly suggested that subpoenas might follow if the requests were not fulfilled .
A banking trade group and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency brought suit to block Mr. Spitzer ’s request , contending that the National Bank Act and rules issued by the Bush administration in 2004 gave that kind of law enforcement authority to the comptroller and prohibited such efforts by the states .
A federal district court ruled against the states , and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the lower court ’s decision .
Writing for a 5 - to - 4 majority , Justice Antonin Scalia concluded that the attorney general had not been engaged in the broad “ visitorial powers ” reserved by the federal government , in which the government acts like a supervisor with free access to bank records on demand .
The court , he wrote , has always understood that visitorial powers are “ quite separate ” from the power to enforce the law , and the attorney general was acting in the role of “ sovereign - as - law - enforcer ” in seeking the information .
Normally , Justice Scalia wrote , the court would defer to an agency ’s interpretation of the law when the terms in dispute are ambiguous .
But in this case , which turned on such terms as “ visitorial powers , ” he stated that even though the term was “ somewhat ambiguous , ” the court could discern “ the outer limits ” of the term , “ even through the clouded lens of history . ”
The meaning that could be wrestled from the phrase , Justice Scalia wrote , did not include restrictions on “ ordinary enforcement of the law ” by the states .

The decision brought together an unusual coalition .
Justice Scalia , one of the court ’s most conservative members , was joined by the court ’s more liberal wing of John Paul Stevens , David H. Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer .
Some children were stunned with their parents ' consent
Three US prison officers have been dismissed and two others have resigned after 40 children in Florida were deliberately shocked with stun guns .
The incidents at two prisons occurred last month during a national day when people take their children to work .
In one case , a group of children were told to hold hands in a circle before one of them was shocked with a stun gun and the shock ran round the group .
No one was seriously hurt , but an official said it was " inexcusable " .
In the other case in a second prison , children were given individual shocks .
The children , aged from five to 17 , were all sons and daughters of employees of the Florida Department of Corrections .
Some parents had given permission for their children to receive the shocks , but this did not justify the actions of officials , said the department 's secretary , Walter McNeil .
" We believe this behaviour is inexcusable , " he said .
" I apologise to the children and parents .
None of these kids should have been exposed to these devices . "
He said that the circle shock demonstration was common practice during training classes for prison officers .
A stun gun delivers an electric shock intended to disable someone temporarily , without resorting to firearms .
Workers from the occupation have issued the following statement .
“ As workers at a wind turbine manufacturer , we were confident that as the recession took hold that green or renewable energy would be the area where many jobs could be created – not lost .
So we were horrified to find out that our jobs were moving abroad and that more than 525 jobs from the Isle of Wight and Southampton were going to be added to the already poor state of island unemployment .
This has sent , and will continue to send , shockwaves of uncertainty through countless families on the island – many of which are being forced to relocate away from the island .
We find this hard to stomach as the government are getting away with claiming they are investing heavily in these types of industry .
Only last week they said they would create 400,000 green jobs .
How can the process start with 600 of us losing our jobs ?
Now I ’m not sure about you but we think it ’s about time that if the government can spends billions bailing out the banks – and even nationalise them – then surely they can do the same at Vestas .
The people of Vestas matter , and the people of the island matter , but equally importantly the people of this planet matter .
We will not be brushed under the carpet by a government which is claiming to help us .
We have occupied our factory and call on the government to step in and nationalise it .
We and many others believe it is essential that we continue to keep our factory open for our families and livelihoods , but also for the future of the planet .
We call on Ed Milliband as the relevant minister to come to the island and tell us to our face why it makes sense for the government to launch a campaign to expand green energy at the same moment as the country ’s only major wind turbine producer closes .
Please show your support . ”
-- Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe
by Ken
In an interview with The Wayne Independent Wednesday morning , U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak , D - Pa. , confirmed his intention to run against Specter , a long - time Republican who switched to the Democratic party earlier this year .
“ I am going to get into the race against Arlen Specter ... for senator , ” said Sestak in his first media interview as part of a three - week tour through all of the Commonwealth ’s 67 counties .
Wayne County was his first stop where he met with local Democrats prior to his interview with The Wayne Independent .
Rep. Carolyn Maloney
Both challenges appear doomed , but the more important seems to me the Pennsylvania one .
There is also a case to be made , and I 've seen it made by one of the smartest people I know , that the New York challenge is going to cut seriously into the money and attention available for the Sestak challenge in Pennsylvania , even as the politics of a challenger to her left ( though not very far to her left ) drive Senator Gillibrand back toward the right ( she has been seriously more liberal in her time in the Senate than she was in the House ) , both in the campaign and in the Senate .
This prognosticator predicts that people " on all sides " will live to regret this extremely expensive race .
I would only disagree that people on all sides will be deeply unhappy but wo n't know what hit them , and will instead resort to the usual mutual finger - pointing .
#
Under closer questioning , the 's Jim Myers reports , Senator Inhofe acknowledged that he was referring to Minnesota 's then - not - yet senator - elect , Al Franken when he said , in connection with the likely outcome of the Minnesota Senate race , " I ’ll tell you what a lot of people are thinking , and that is it looks like things are going to be over and we are going to get the clown from Minnesota .
" Periodically -- in periods that are far too frequent for the country 's mental as well as political health -- the senator , who is Congress 's leading Christian - crazy climate - change denier and , in general , sworn foe of rational scientific inquiry , opens his mouth and we are treated to the effluvia thrown off by the vortex of his dementia .
Since Oklahoma has the distinction of being represented by two U.S. senators who are certifiably insane , let 's make it clear here that we 're not talking about Doctortom Coburn , the wingnut loon who specializes in unilaterally stopping the Senate from advancing on any issue that catches in his vestigial brain , and delights in being called " Dr. No . "
Senator Inhofe is the raving wingnut loon -- OK , no difference so far -- who believes that protection of the environment is not only a scam but is actually anti-Christian because real Christians understand that we only need the earth until the imminent Rapture .
This is , by the way , the man who , in one of life 's most savage ironies , was until the Democrats regained control of the Senate chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .
Now he 's merely the ranking minority member .
Senator
Inhofe made his original crack about his soon - to - be Senate colleague in connection with his forecast that , despite the imminent seating of the clown , the climate - change bill just passed by the House is " dead in the water " on arrival in the Senate .
But he also had to deal with the blowback from some of his other recent pronouncements .
( This is itself a climate change of sorts .
It used to be that he was never asked to answer for the imbecilities he spews . )
Specifically , he has had to back down from his much - publicized accusation that the EPA had suppressed a global - warming - debunking report , by one of his GW - denier cronies .
Pumped up by his friends the Fox Noise liars , he was insisting that the matter warranted criminal investigation .
In his Tuesdayinterview , " he said he has " no way of knowing " whether any wrongdoing was committed , and " also conceded that his own investigation into the matter has not uncovered anything that would warrant a criminal investigation .
" As we all know , White House political operatives have been in cahoots with political heavyweights in both Pennsylvania , notably Gov. Ed Rendell , and New York , notably senior Sen .
Chuck Schumer , to prevent forestall divisive and expensive primary challenges to freshly minted " Democratic " Sen.
Arlen Specter and merely appointed Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand .
As Howie has been reporting , in both states this political " fix " has aroused a good deal of anger , both for the anti-democratic ( " small d " ) high - handedness of the maneuvering and for the distinctly conservative cast of the beneficiaries , and there have been serious rumblings of " nevertheless " challenges . , where admiral - turned - congressman Joe Sestak has been sending fairly consistent signals that he 's gearing up for such a race , Steve McConnell reported yesterday on the Wayne Independent 's website : , despite the virtual lockdown on normally available political resources engineered by Senator Schumer and his White House coconspirators , is reportedly mere days away from announcing formally that she will mount a Democratic primary challenge to Kirsten Gillibrand , appointed by Gov. David Paterson to replace now - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Senate until next year 's special election .
The current hubbub concerns what was being described as an apparent endorsement of Maloney by former President Bill Clinton , who is scheduled to appear at a July 20 fund - raiser for the congresswoman .
However , this does n't appear to be the case .
Rather , it appears that the former president is doing a Clinton - family " thank you " tour , repaying pols who supported Hillary Clinton 's presidential bid , which the former candidate herself is prevented from doing by her current position .

America is trying to lure other countries into starting an " Internet arms race , " said Fei Li in China ’s Xinhua Net ( via Watching America ) .
With its control over the Web ’s " core technology " and 10 of the 13 global Internet root names , the U.S. could make any county whose domain name it controls " instantly ' disappear ' from the Internet , " among its other " terrifying powers . "
Russian hackers are justifiably " famous worldwide " -- their attack on Georgia " created a classic case of cyber war " -- but when the big " Internet war breaks out , " not even Russia will be any match for America ’s 88,700 - strong " electronic warfare staff . "
And that ’s how the U.S. wants to keep it .

When asked why there are n't more people of color in the Italian fashion industry , officials have cited a lack of candidates in homogeneous Italy .
Five African - born designers in Italy want to put that view to rest .
Blood tests show that the animals at ' Stingray City ' in the Cayman Islands have weaker immune systems and are in poorer health than those left undisturbed
It features regularly on lists of things people want to do before they die , but swimming with stingray may not be the life - enhancing experience expected – at least not for the animals .
A new study has revealed that stingray at a tourist hotspot in the Cayman Islands are suffering because of all the human attention .
The Grand Cayman sandbank , dubbed Stingray City , is regularly swamped with up to 2,500 visitors at a time , most of whom have paid handsomely for the chance to feed , stroke and swim with the creatures .
The study highlights the risks to animals posed by the growing " wildlife tourism " industry .
Experts say wild populations of creatures such as dolphins , penguins and sharks are also affected by increased contact with curious people .
The study was one of the first to investigate direct effects on the physiology of animals involved in such tourism .
Blood tests showed that the stingrays at Stingray City had weaker immune systems and were in poorer health than animals not disturbed by tourists , perhaps making them more vulnerable to disease and storms .
The experts warn that the " long - term health and survival of tourist stingrays have a significant probability of being affected " and they call for tighter regulation of the industry .
Similar crowded tourist sites across the world will be doing similar damage to stingray , they say .
Christina Semeniuk , an ecologist at Simon Fraser University in Canada , who led the research , said : " Our study is the first to definitively show negative physiological impacts that indicate long - term costs to the animals ' health . "
She added : " The implications of these findings will not only affect the wildlife .
Reduced stingray numbers , or injured , unhealthy - looking stingrays can cause the visitor site to become less attractive and may cause a decline in tourist numbers and have an economic impact . "
The stingray at the site are regularly injured by boats , the scientists found , while the crowded conditions encourage parasites .
The creatures have also come to rely on hand - fed squid , which stingray do not usually eat .
" These impacts can have long - term health effects , in terms of reduced longevity and reduced reproductive effort , " Semeniuk said .
The results will be published in the journal Biological Conservation .
Other studies have looked at the impact of wildlife tourism on grizzly bears , penguins , dolphins , sharks and lizards .
" The majority of these studies have looked at changes in the animals ' behaviours or their stress responses , " Semeniuk said .
" Each has suggested that wildlife tourism should be both continually researched and managed . "
Vincent Janik of the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St Andrews University said : " It 's an important issue , and there does n't need to be physical contact .
Even just watching animals can sometimes bring problems . "
Studies have shown that dolphins regularly targeted by tourist boats are more likely to be injured and to abandon their young , he said .
Swimming with wild dolphins is banned in many places because of the likely impact on the animals .
Courtney Vail of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society said the treatment of captive dolphins was to blame for the way people treated the animals they encountered in the wild .
" You get people trying to ride on their backs and holding on to the dorsal fin .
They are trying to recreate the Sea World experience with wild dolphins . "
Janik said efforts to control wildlife tourism , such as the stingray experience in the Caymans , need to be handled carefully .
" If the tourists are n't there then these animals could just be hunted or eaten .
The best way is to educate the operators and the customers . "
Many of the negative effects of wildlife tourism are likely to be restricted to local populations of animals , he said .
Semeniuk said new legislation in the Cayman Islands has recently been introduced to address the impact of tourists on wildlife .
New Wildlife Interaction Zones , including the North Sound of Grand Cayman where Stingray City is located , forbid people taking marine life out of the water .
Feeding wildlife will also be more strictly regulated .
But not all of the recorded impacts of wildlife tourism on animals are bad .
While most wild creatures react as if the humans are predators , some see tourists as beneficial , either because they reduce the risks of predation by others , or because they supply food .
This can allow the animals to dedicate more valuable energy supplies to rest and reproduction .
Disturbia
Dolphins : Creatures in Australia targetted by tourists are more likely to abandon their young
Killer whales :
Whale watching in Canadian waters is shown to reduce animal feeding time
Penguins : Even minimal human contact is shown to double the heart rate of New Zealand 's yellow - eyed penguins
Apes : Mountain gorillas of Uganda , Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are known to be susceptible to human diseases
Egoboo Development Diary Part 5 - 25.02.2016
Hello and welcome back for yet another development diary for Egoboo .
We have some exciting news for you !
Nightly builds are up and running .
So now you can download the game in it 's current development state and try out all the new features .
Feedback for additional bug reports or suggestions for improvements or other tweaks are welcome !
You report issues here .
So what is going on ?
We are still rewriting old legacy code to C++ and optimizing the rendering code so that it can run on any integrated Intel HD graphics card ( no dedicated GPU hardware required ) .
A vast amount of bugfixes and porting has already been done , so the overall state of the game and code - base has been vastly improved since last year .
The code is now more clear and concise after removing a lot of legacy code , which makes it easier to maintain and add additional features in the future .
The game currently runs fine on Windows , Linux and Macintosh systems both in 32 - bit and 64 - bit mode .
Other than the source code itself , we also want to rework the data files so that it is easier to maintain and bugfix the datafiles themselves while keeping the simplicity and moddability Egoboo has .
The last few development diaries mentioned various new game features like Perks , a brand new Stealth system and numerous other gameplay improvements .
Our aim is to make the game easier and more fun to play !
It is all in the Details We have done some extra attention to graphical details , improving texture detail , particle effects and reflections among other things .
Floor reflections have proper reflection falloff if you jump or fly above the ground .
The text messages on top of the screen fade away gradually instead of suddenly disappearing .
The floating text that indicates the amount of damage you deal or take now becomes bigger or smaller depending on the amount of damage dealt .
Here are a few screenshots on some examples of improvements :
Higher quality texture for Wizard Starter floor pentagram
Better flame and smoke effect from Braziers
Improved fog effect in G’nome Starter
ayu2hami is working on HD version of textures for characters and monsters
Bonus :
A new spellbook icon for evil necromancy spells !
A new Map Editor
We have begun working on a new in - game map editor that allows you to create and modify game modules using the game engine .
This allows you to see exactly how the module will look in - game and allows for rapid play testing in - game .
By re-using the game engine we can more easy maintain and improve the map editor as the game evolves .
It is also completely cross-platform and has no additional dependencies above that Egoboo itself requires !
This new map editor replaces the previous two map editors Cartman and EgoMap .
Creating a proper mapping tool is no easy task , so do not expect it to be fully functional with all required features in the near future .
Nightly Builds up and running !
We finally have nightly builds for Windows binaries !
This allows you to download the latest development version and help us test the game and give us feedback to improve the game .
You can get them here : Download Link

Egoboo Development Diary Part 4 - 11.09.2015
It ’s time for the fourth part of the development diary series of Egoboo !
We introduce introduce a special perk in the new perk system called Stealth , a charge bar for spells and improvements to the physics system .
Stealth
We have implemented a completely new and standardized stealth system .
The Stealth ability is acquired from a Perk and is activated by pressing the Stealth button .
While your character is in Stealth mode , he / she will move slower but can not be detected by enemy monsters .
You cannot enter stealth while enemies can see you and there is a chance based on your Agility vs their Intellect if you are detected while stealthing .
For monsters looking directly at you , this chance is significantly increased .
Bumping into enemies , jumping or attacking automatically reveals your position .
Stealth !
The Stealth system can be used to sneak behind monsters and backstab them , sneak past monsters to avoid fights or to surprise sleeping monsters without waking them up !
There are a couple of Perks that improve your stealth ability , allowing you to jump , move faster and even hide in plain sight !
The Rogue starts with the basic Stealth perk while the Adventurer , Archaeologist , Elf , Tourist , Valkyrie and Zombi can learn this ability at later levels .
There are numerous monsters that also take advantage of the new Stealth system , so look out and keep a wary eye towards the shadows !
Spell Channeling
When using magic , there is now a channeling bar which displays how much you need to charge the spell before it is ready to be cast .
The charge bar is also split into levels for spells that have different effects depending on how long you charge them ( e.g the Missile spell shoots more missiles the longer you charge it ) .
The charge bar automatically scales depending on your Spell Power ability .
Note the charge bar in the top right corner .
Unleashing the spell now would summon 2 additional missiles .
Game Physics
This update has been long overdue .
Major improvements and fixes have been made to the game physics .
This gives a better overall feel when colliding with other objects or walls .
You can no longer glitch through other objects or get stuck inside walls .
You can no longer slide into boxes , tables or corners of bookshelves
Improved platform physics for easier jumping between platforms
Particle physics have been improved for better collision detection
Slippery ice works again !
Its easier to jump on top of mounts
This should also fix a couple of physics related bugs like activating switches when bumping or triggering weight related traps or buttons .
More GUI Improvements ] This is still work in progress , but we ’ve added two new tabs to the Character Window ( the one with the Attributes and Inventory ) .
A list of known perks that your character has mastered .
As you gain many levels , the list of perks you ’ve learned grows long and with this window you can select any of the perks you ’ve learned to read how it works and what triggers its activation .

The usual bunch of minor bugfixes
Egoboo Development Diary Part 3 - 03.08.2015 t’s time for the third part of the development diary series of Egoboo !
Last time we focused on converting to SDL 2.0 , fixing bugs and converting the codebase to C ++.
This time we are happy to announce some new gameplay improvements in addition to the usual list of bugfixes .
In - Game GUI Egoboo finally has a proper user - interface in - game .
We have designed the current system so that it is easy to expand or improve upon .
This features a new inventory and character screen .
Now you can finally examine your character attributes and defences .
New character and inventory interface
The minimap can now be moved around and resized using the M button .
Now the icon of characters or monsters is drawn on the minimap instead of tiny blips .
New minimap zoom feature
A new simplified and improved Video Options screen is implemented .
A similar screen for Audio and Input Binding is in the works .
Attribute Revamp
Some focus has been made into making the character attributes more interesting .
Egoboo currently features the following character attributes :
Might : Formerly known as Strength .
Represents the fortitude , power and physical prowess of your character .
Your Might attribute directly affects the following :
This increases damage with melee weapons
Determines knockback effect
Jump power
Block chance for shields and chance to break a Block
Increases character size Formerly known as Strength .
Represents the fortitude , power and physical prowess of your character .
Your Might attribute directly affects the following : Agility : Formerly known as Dexterity .
Represents how fast , energic and quick your character can react and move .
A character 's Agility directly affects the following things :
Increases attack speed
Movement speed
Hit chance with ranged weapons
Damage with ranged weapons
Chance to disarm traps and unlock chests Formerly known as Dexterity .
Represents how fast , energic and quick your character can react and move .
A character 's Agility directly affects the following things : Intellect : Both the Intelligence and Wisdom attributes were merged into a single Intellect attribute .
Too little separated these two attributes in terms of game mechanics so it made sense to merge them to make intellect an overall more interesting attribute .
Intellect is the measurement how clever , wise and perceptive your character is and affects the following : Damage with all spells ( both Arcane and Divine )
Hit chance for spells
Experience gain
Chance to find traps and hidden treasure Both the Intelligence and Wisdom attributes were merged into a single Intellect attribute .
Too little separated these two attributes in terms of game mechanics so it made sense to merge them to make intellect an overall more interesting attribute .
Intellect is the measurement how clever , wise and perceptive your character is and affects the following : Mana Regeneration :
How fast your mana regenerates per second .
Was formerly called Mana Return .
How fast your mana regenerates per second .
Was formerly called Mana Return .
Life Regeneration : A completely new attribute that determines how fast your life regenerates per second .
Only special effects and magic usually gives life regeneration .
A completely new attribute that determines how fast your life regenerates per second .
Only special effects and magic usually gives life regeneration .
Spell Power : Formerly known as Mana Flow , your Spell Power determines which spells you can cast and how powerful they are .
For example : a Wizard with 3 Spell Power can summon 3 Magic Missiles while an Adventurer with 1 Spell Power can only summon one Magic Missile .

For example : a Wizard with 3 Spell Power can summon 3 Magic Missiles while an Adventurer with 1 Spell Power can only summon one Magic Missile .
Perks !
Character development is integral in any rogue - like RPG and Egoboo is no exception to that .
We felt that the old level up system did not really feel satisfying so we have expanded this using the new GUI system mentioned above .
Each time your character gains an experience level , you clearly see which of your attributes is improved and by how much .
Furthermore you get to select a Perk to learn .
A Perk is a unique bonus that your character gains permanently .
Some of them unlock new abilities or improve your existing ones .
Each class has a different set of Perks to select from and some Perks are unique to each class .
So far we have added almost 100 unique Perks !
Here are some examples of the Perks an Adventurer can learn :
Athletics : +25 % Jump Power and +50 % movement in water
Rally : Nearby allies gain +10 % movement speed and attack damage
Dodge : +1 % chance per Agility to avoid damage .
Which one to pick ?
Bugfixes and Changes Fix collision boxes so that attacks actually hurt their targets and cause knockback
Faster texture loading by only loading textures into memory when they are actually needed
Fix Gonne particles spawning in the ground
Changed how damage resistance works so that it allows for more granularity and prevent resistance to block damage completely .
( unless complete immunity was intended )
Fix so that particles spawned by Weapons are owned by the holder of the Weapon
Fix particles not properly de-spawning ( e.g Soldier Starter )
Replaced or removed some IDSZ flags in Objects that were n’t doing what was intended
Fix some Particles not being properly rendered
Healer and Paladin Healing cloud can now properly hit multiple enemies or friends
Fix knockback logic
Swipe weapons like Claw or Sword can properly hit multiple enemies
Make aiming with ranged weapons easier
Improve renderer logic
Improved memory management to reduce chance of memory leaks
Screenshots are not saved in PNG format
Prevent some in - game messages from being spammed
Game performance improvements
Improved cross-platform interoperability
Crash fixes
Many , many other minor bugs resolved We need you !
We always welcome help !
Pop into the developer chat if you wish to help us .
We need anything from coders , graphic artist , web designer to game testers .
We would like to have someone draw a new interface for the main menu among other things .
This website sorely needs to be remade and kept up to date with 2015 .
We have now fully migrated to Visual Studio 2015 and dropped support for 2013 so that we can fully utilize the new features of C++11 .
We have also an up - to - date build system for both MinGW and Linux using GCC .
OS X has also a working build system .
Egoboo Development Diary Part 2 - 03.06.2015
Hello and welcome to the second part of the Egoboo Development Diary series !
We are happy to announce that the game is already in a much better and stable state since our previous diary post .
There still remains work to be done before the game is playable enough for end - users ( some options features missing , still some game blocking bugs ) .
We still need playtesters though and to facilitate this we are working towards introducing daily - builds to give playtesters access to the bleeding - edge version of Egoboo !
Upgrade to SDL 2.0
One of the major milestones of the roadmap has been completed , the conversion to SDL 2.0 .
For the user this means many minor improvements such as better platform compatibility , improved fullscreen support , improved keyboard support and many minor annoyances are gone .
SDL 2.0 also has support for iOS and Android platforms , but development for those are not in focus yet - let 's get this game working properly on PC first !
Bugfixing
While some bugs still remain , many fixes have been implemented already .
Here is a short excerpt of some of the bugs we have fixed since January : Weather effects work again ( rain , snow , etc . )
Fix item grabbing not working properly
Fix particle animations not looping properly
Lava now actually hurts you
Save games properly work again
Coins bounce again and make coiny noises
Blud hits the ground again and de-spawns
Water is properly rendered again
Lighting effects work properly again
Weapons have proper hitboxes again
Money can be picked up again !
Fixed many graphical issues or glitches like transparency , reflections or shine
Whips now uncoil when used
Memory leaks fixed
Various crash fixes
Many other minor bugs Game Updates
We also took the liberty of improving some various game mechanics : Looting a chest now drops its contents in front of the chest instead of all around it ( leading to items stuck behind or inside the chest object )
Changes the story and some content of the Wizard Starter
Game logic now supports more than 4 armour types ( no class has more than 4 yet )
Adventurer Starter now starts with a Knife
Improved module loading screen
Module difficulty is now represented by skulls
Game now runs at 60 FPS ( was normally capped to 30 before ) Conversion to C++
We have already reaped the benefits of converting the codebase to C++.
Major performance improvements and many bugfixes .
There is still a lot of code to port from C to C++ and if you are interested in helping , do n't be shy to contact us on gitter .

Egoboo Development Diary Part 1 - 29.03.2015
Egoboo is actively maintained again
The dungeon crawler Egoboo is now actively developed again : A team of developers is reviving the cross-platform dungeon crawler Egoboo on GitHub .
This is the first post of the " Egoboo Dev Notes " series in which the developers keep you informed on the course and progress of the development of Egoboo .
It was pleasant surprise for the developers that resuming the development of Egoboo found some resonance .
There still seem to be quite a few people out there who care for this odd piece of gaming history called Egoboo .
For the ones who have never heard of Egoboo : it is a dungeon crawler and quite an entertaining game ; however , its development stalled for a long time , bugs and glitches were not fixed and the game did not evolve .
However , it is actively maintained now again .
This is more or less normal progress for open source software such as Egoboo , but there are perfectly normal questions any open source project should answer - for one thing : indeed Egoboo is and will stay open - source and subjected to the GPLv3 license and you can download the game and its source code for free as before .
This is the first question any open source project should answer .
However , there are many more and those can not be answered that easily : as a consequence , the team decided to start this monthly series of posts - primarily targeting prospect developers and content creators - that will keep you informed on the course and progress of development on Egoboo .
In this first post of this series , we will describe a few changes that are made or being planned to Egoboo 's technological basis and we talk about graphics and sound , controls and user interface .
More importantly , we try to communicate our relation to to various aspects of Egoboo , in particular what we intend to change and what we intend to keep - eventually , this is important to some people out there as gamers really hate when something changes for the worse .
Last but not least , we provide you with a target date for a first binary release .
Who we are is less important , what we do is maintain Egoboo , an old , weathered piece of code and data that had a bad start and allegedly suffered a lot .
However , somehow it managed to stay a unique , entertaining game .
Maybe this is the reason , why people still care for Egoboo .
In any case , we care .
This is why we want to ensure that Egoboo withstands the test of time as it did before for years to come .
We want to improve and maintain the technology as well as the assets , to ensure that Egoboo lives long and prospers - and eventually we will make some old scars vanish .
Things to Change : Technology
The Egoboo developers wish to begin the time - consuming task of bringing Egoboo 's code and data up to date , so that it fulfills the quality requirements that ensure proper maintainability and documentation .
We want to ensure that Egoboo withstands the test of time .
Drastic changes on the underlying technology are made such as the final transition from C to C++ shows : Egoboo compiles now with recent C++ compilers under Linux , Windows and Mac , the amount of C code / C-ish code is decreasing steadily ( ultimately , Egoboo should take advantage of what C++ 11 and beyond offers to us ) .
An improved build system and updating external dependencies ( for instance , the transition from SDL 1 to SDL 2 is being prepared ) are part of the roadmap plan .
Egoboo accumulated quite a few bugs that over the years in which Egoboo was subject to irregular maintenance and wild expansion : bug - fixing is imperative .
As a matter of fact , most of those bugs could have been avoided and in fact will simply vanish .
Principles , methods and techniques that are widely known are employed - well - known algorithms , reasonable documentation and automated testing are prevalent examples .
Indeed , Egoboo will receive a unit testing framework and a reasonable in - source and out - of - source documentation .
We do not refrain from subjecting parts of Egoboo to more exhaustive methods , though .
The goal here is simple : Egoboo - like any game - needs to be maintainable and expandable - to achieve that , it needs a good basis , a stable core with calm maintenance , reliable functionality such that the " hotter " parts can rely and build upon it .
Things to Change : Assets
The team also feels that improvements to graphics , sound , controls , user interface and game mechanics are long overdue .
Partially , coders can do that , however - or as many Open Source projects slowly learn - graphics and sound are not part of the graphics or audio API used .
The assets ( e.g. graphics / sounds ) need to be created and used in content ( e.g. levels ) .
Egoboo contains a decent amount of assets and content , however , creating / improving this requires more than coders :
In the Open Source sector , the species capable of creating assets and content - namely graphic artists , audio artists and level designers - are rare : the team will improve the tool set that Egoboo offers to those , hopefully attracting those precious specimen .
Things to Keep : Egoboo
A perfectly normal question is ( in case you have looked at the source code of Egoboo ) : " Why do n't you rewrite the whole thing ? "
The team decided against a rewrite of Egoboo in a sense of " starting from scratch " for technical and non-technical reasons .
On the technical side , content exists for Egoboo already and this content can not be trivially accessed without the underlying game engine .
But this would only be half the truth .
An important non-technical reason is the feeling , that the unique spirit of Egoboo would be lost during the course of a full rewrite .
Drastic changes to underlying technology do not necessarily imply that the feeling of a game is destroyed .
They do , however , bear the danger .
We are in fortunate situation to have one of the original designers of many of the modules among its members .
Together with refactoring instead of rewriting , the risk of losing something without realizing it and effectively destroying the game , is reduced .
An important aspect of Egoboo is that it enabled users and developers to create their own adventures ( called " Modules " in Egoboo ) .
The existing content of Egoboo demonstrates the power of Egoboo 's provided tools .
However , the tools are also dated and difficult to use so the content eventually demonstrates the capacity for suffering of the content creators .
We think this is not necessary ; there are great examples of tools that make content creation simple and fun ( Neverwinter Nights 2 is such an example ) .
To attract asset and content creators and for that we think that the ability to create your own content is an essential element of what Egoboo constitutes , tools receive a lot of attention from us .
As before , the tools to be created should satisfy players and developers alike .
That way , we hope to retain the feeling of Egoboo when evolving Egoboo to something that will last another few years :
We want to keep the spirit of Egoboo alive .
Things to Come : Binary Release
In this post , we want to answer one of the more pressing questions of many people : A stable binary release is scheduled for around Christmas 2015 / 2016 .
See you next month .

STILL ALIVE ! - 09.05.2011
We are still alive , this time with many screenshots !
It has been a while since last update , but life has been busy for all the developers !
There has been some progress however .
First we can proudly release a proper Macintosh release again thanks to Jonathan Fischer our " Mac guy " .
Macintosh users can download the game from
[ image missing ]
This is still a work in progress and the final version will not look like that !
There are a few key issues that need to be fixed before we can release Egoboo 2.8.2 as Stable .
But wait , there is more !
AI is now improved by the so called A* pathfinding algorithm .
This means that monsters and helpers alike are much smarter in picking their paths toward where they want to walk .
No more monsters getting stuck in corners !
Here is a small screenshot of A* in action :
[ image missing ]
Oh yes , we also have a nifty new inventory system : D. This should make handling inventories a lot easier than before .

introducing SVN Builds - 5.07.2010
We now offer pre-compiled binaries from the repository for all the windows users out there .
The SVN build is located to the right of the screen .
What is the SVN build ?
The current SVN build is the very latest version of Egoboo that is available for download from the Web Page .
It includes the latest new features , but might also include the latest bugs .
The SVN build is for those who want to use the latest updates from the SVN , but who do not want to compile the code themselves .
Why should I download this ?
Latest SVN build will contain the latest bugfixes and also the latest bugs that were introduced .
These bugs can be game breaking and make the game very unstable .
For all the latest game content in the SVN to work properly , you will need the latest SVN build .
Installation
You will need a program like TortoiseSVN to access the SVN repository .
Simply run the extractor to your Egoboo SVN folder and run the new binary .
( egoboo - svn - r1090.exe for revision 1090 for example ) Link to the SVN : https://egoboo.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/egoboo/branches/2.6.x
Development update - 24.06.2010
We are finally closing in on the 2.8.0 release !
There is still a lot to be done , especially bugfixing .
With all the new improvements , massive rewrites and new features , many old things that used to work will probably work different or even not work at all .
We need to locate these bugs and you can help us to do so !
bgbirdsey is working on a performance issue that prevents the game from being played on older computers , but he claims he will be ready in a few days ( give it a week ! ) .
By then we will try to release a 2.8.0 Development ( i.e unstable ) version .
Everyone can report a bug or issue through either the forums ( under Bug Report ) or through Trac ( our very own Feature / Bug tracker ) .
I just finished another module for the Imprisoned One series and only 1 module is missing before the quest line is complete .
This module is kinda interesting .
You have to protect the portal from waves of monsters to win this module ( as shown below ) :
Notice the new yellow XP progress bars below the character icon.
bgbirdsey has worked on some more " advanced " physics effects for particles as well .
This includes particle interaction with wind and under water .
And we added a few more new weapons and scenery for you to discover in the game !

FLORENCE  Every day , Darren Newsom ’s three Bitterroot Valley Ammunition facilities crank out 300,000 rounds of ammunition .
It ’s not nearly enough .
 I ’m going about 100,000 rounds in the wrong direction every day ,  Newsom said .
 We probably have about six months of back orders right now . 
Newsom has been in the ammunition manufacturing business for more than 20 years and he ’s never seen demand this high .
Fearful of the Obama administration ’s potential to tighten gun control laws , people from all over the country are stocking up on guns and ammunition .
 I went through the Clinton years and there was a bit of a scare then ,  Newsom said .
 This is like the Clinton years on steroids .
On the day of the election , our phones started going nuts .
It has n’t stopped since . 
As a master distributor for ATK  the world ’s largest ammunition business  Bitterroot Valley Ammunition supplies other ammunition manufacturers around the country with the components needed to make bullets .
 I get a million primers in every other day and most are shipped out the very next day ,  he said .
 I have 100 million primers on back order right now .
We just ca n’t get enough of them . 
At a recent gun show in Salt Lake City , Newsom sold somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 rounds in the first two hours .
 It ’s just unreal ,  he said .
 Somewhere in lots of basements around the country , there are millions of rounds of ammunition being stored . 
Local businesses have felt the ammunition shortage .
At Bob Ward ’s in Hamilton , Mike Matteson said there has been quite a run on ammunition and reloading supplies like bullets and powder since the election .
 We are especially low right now with pistol ammunition ,  Matteson said .
 There are four or five calibers that we do n’t even have on our shelves . 
Matteson said he did n’t believe manufacturers were prepared for the panic buying that ’s occurred since the election .
 They tell us that they ’re months behind on some calibers  .22 ammo is really tough to come by ,  he said .
 Our gun sales are up somewhere between 30 ( percent ) to 35 percent or better .
A good percentage of those sales are pistols . 

There 's no such thing as the perfect joke .
For every five friends who borrow my Strangers with Candy or Mr. Show DVDs , one comes back with a bad review .
Hell , I 've dated two women who did n't even like Ghostbusters .
Ghostbusters .
I do n't want to sound like a nerd , but I 'll learn how to masturbate in Klingon before I put my dick in something that can't have fun watching Ghostbusters .
So I understood that when I got into this joke writing business that a few people were going to hate it , and a few of those people were going to tell me all about it .
I normally write off this crushing emotional trauma as an occupational hazard , but last week I did an article on how people who play World of Warcraft suck at video games .
As you can imagine , some of them took this personally .
Well , I 'm not ignoring it this time .
I 'll be goddamned if I 'm going to sit around and take crap from a bunch of orcs and wizards coming into my world and talking shit .

Bankruptcy filings are soaring in the United States .
In the last data point , we had 134,282 bankruptcy filings for the month of March 2009 .
Bankruptcy data usually lags 3 or 4 months but the trend is ominous .
For the last 12 months some 1.2 million bankruptcy filings have occurred .
Much of this is linked to the 26,000,000 unemployed or underemployed Americans being unable to pay their bills or even service their debt .
What is more telling is the amount of Chapter 7 bankruptcies occurring since these are straight liquidations and not like a Chapter 13 restructuring .
Let us examine the most recent data for bankruptcies that highlight this troubling trend :
What you ’ll notice is a significant spike in the March data point .
This monthly jump was enormous .
This was the largest number of quarterly bankruptcy filings since December of 2005 when many were rushing to beat the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 .
Yet even with the law making it harder for people to file bankruptcy , most are being forced into austerity and it is hard to squeeze anything further out of a turnip .
What this tells us is that for average Americans there is still a significantly large amount of pain in the real economy .
The unemployment rate is understated by the 9.5 percent headline number .
Below is data showing quarterly bankruptcy filings :
It is interesting to note , that even during the supposedly boom times of this decade , there were more people filing bankruptcy than during the bust since the recession started in December of 2007 .
The new bankruptcy legislation is designed to make it much harder for borrowers to file but ironically , during this same time banks have been having nearly unlimited borrowing power from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve .
As I discussed in a previous article the Federal Reserve will protect banks before it seeks to protect consumers .
The major sticking points of the 2005 legislation requires means tests , higher filing fees , mandatory credit counseling , and other obstacles preventing people from filing bankruptcy .
If you put enough hurdles , you will see a decline .
But let us flip the tables for a second .
Imagine if we required this from banks that we have been bailing out .
Have we had them go through “ credit counseling ” or have we required them to go through means tests ?
If anything , they have been given the money simply because they demanded it .
For the consumer bankruptcy is the last option but for banks , the only option is a taxpayer funded bailout .
But as the times have gotten tougher in this recession , there really is n’t much a bank can do when someone has lost their job and is unable to pay their bills .
By any standard , someone who has no money will fall below the median household income for that state .
The average American household brings in roughly $ 46,000 to $ 50,000 per year so there is n’t much room to maneuver .
With credit drying up , this was virtually the last lifeline .
And banks refuse to lend because now after a decade of lax lending they are now verifying basic levels of capital and collateral :
Banks are holding tight to the funds because they want to avoid their own bankruptcy .
Consumers are left to their own devices .
As the year goes on , we can expect surging levels of bankruptcy creating further writedowns for banks .
A $ 50,000 credit card debt that once was an asset for a bank can quickly turn into a loss when the borrower defaults .
After all , some of this money might have been spent on food , medical costs , vacations , and other things that have no remedy of being recovered .
The rise in bankruptcy is a key indicator that the economy is still feeling much pain .

BEER is serious business in Japan .
When employees of Mitsubishi Corporation , a huge trading house , go on a beer binge they are ( informally ) required to quaff Kirin — a company under Mitsubishi 's wing .
Similarly , parties at Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group serve only Asahi , a big client of the bank .
Corporate Japan teems with these ties , which makes striking new alliances or mergers hard .
But not too hard when there is an absolute necessity .
On Tuesday July 14th Kirin and Suntory , two of Japan 's biggest beer and beverage companies , announced they were in merger discussions .
The mere fact that they are in talks promises to shake up not only the international drinks market , but corporate Japan too .
The combined firm would be one of the world 's biggest drinks companies , with sales of ¥ 3.8 trillion ( $ 41.1 billion ) , around 45 % from alcoholic beverages alone .
It would control half of the Japanese beer market — raising an antitrust hurdle before the deal can go through .
But in Japan such transactions move slowly : the companies , which began talks last year and already co-operate on some procurement and distribution , plan to seal a deal by the end of the year and integrate operations a few months later .
A merger is vital for the firms .
The Japanese market is dominated by four big drinks companies ( the other two are Asahi and Sapporo , a smaller rival ) .
Joining forces will allow Kirin and Suntory to save money through joint procurement .
They could join forces to buy aluminium cans , the single biggest cost of each drink they sell , as well as raw ingredients such as malt .
It will also give the new firm greater pricing power .
But the main motivation for the deal is the state of the global market .
The domestic business is shrinking as Japan 's population ages and declines , and consumer tastes shift from beer to wine and other drinks .
Beer consumption has fallen by three - quarters over the past 15 years .
The overall market for alcoholic drinks is declining as well , according to Intage , a market - research firm .
So the Japanese firms need to go abroad for growth .
Yet when they do , the bump up against bigger rivals .
In recent years , mergers have created powerhouses such as Anheuser - Busch InBev and SABMiller .
The only way to compete — in order to move into new markets , form alliances , or buy overseas firms — is to have greater heft , which the merger would provide .
Indeed , over the past year both Japanese firms have made international expansion the cornerstone of their strategy .
In April Kirin said it would buy a controlling stake in Lion Nathan , an Australian brewer , for around $ 2.4 billion , and it acquired nearly half of San Miguel Brewery of the Philippines for $ 1.2 billion in February .
Meanwhile , Suntory bought Frucor , a juice firm , from France 's Danone earlier this year for around € 600 m ( $ 837 m ) .
If the Kirin - Suntory merger happens , the combined firm will use its greater strength to compete more forcefully around the world .
However , combining the companies will be difficult .
Kirin is a public company that is tied to one of the country 's biggest conglomerates .
Suntory is a private , family - run firm .
And the deal faces a particularly domestic obstacle : trimming costs usually entails shedding staff , culling less profitable brands and closing redundant factories .
All these measures are generally resisted by Japanese managers or only take place in time scales measured in years , not months .
That the firms are considering a deal is a big surprise for corporate Japan , and will act as a test case for how a new wave of mergers might take place .
The deal involves two winners in their industry , not a distressed firm looking for a corporate saviour , as is the custom ( Panasonic 's recent agreement to buy Sanyo is a good example ) .
If the integration goes well , it could set an example for other Japanese companies that need a global presence to compete , but are reluctant to team up with others .
Many industries — from electronics and cars to machinery , steel and chemicals — are composed of several excellent companies , but such an abundance of mediocre ones that the best ones are starved of resources .
How Kirin and Suntory deal with their overlapping operations — and their wide - ranging non-core divisions — will be closely watched .
Both companies have sprawling operations that could do with paring .
Among Kirin 's roughly 400 subsidiaries are a bio-chemical firm , a property company , hotels , a tennis club , and even a flower company .
It also boasts pharmaceutical businesses that account for 8 % of sales and a pleasant 17 % of income .
Likewise , Suntory is stuffed with an IT - services firm , a chain of fitness clubs , silverware and jewellery shops , an advertising agency and a flower company of its own .
If a deal goes through one of the first jobs of a merged management team may well be to spin off these combined flower arms .

After the budget is tabled , it takes the finest mind to read between the lines .
In a conversation with eight PGPX students from IIM -A , DNA took a 360 degree view of the budget and its impact on the public .
The expert panel comprised Vinod Gupta expert in Petrochemicals , Oil & Gas , Vinod Ramachandran — expert in Telecom , Yogesh Soman expert in Infrastructure , Rishi Dhariwal , Rachna Salgia and Viplove Chaturvedi expert in Banking , Anirudha Gupta — expert in information technology
On an overall , how do you feel about Budget 09 ?
Vinod Gupta : Background ( Petrochemicals , Oil & Gas )
It is a well balanced document with good intent .
The budget has the potential of being excellent provided it is put into action .
The finance minister had a tough job of balancing various aspects in these challenging economic circumstances .
Industry , market and public in general had high hopes from the budget .
After attaining a fine balance , the finance minister has even bigger responsibility .
He has set the ball rolling and next few months will be crucial .
If government is able to follow up the budget with more policy initiatives , corrective action as per emerging economic scenario and efficient execution of schemes , we can return to the high growth path much earlier than rest of the world .
Vinod Ramachandran ( Telecom )
Overall , I feel that much more could have been done for the telecom industry .
Yogesh Soman ( Infrastructure )
- Due to reduction in income tax surcharge and increase in the taxable income limit , there will be a little more money playing in the hands of the population and that could give boost to the economy in the current downturn .
Although it has been argued that the relief is n't much when compared to the rate of inflation , I will still maintain that whatever little extra that everyone will have will add up to a big chunk given the large population that we have .
Rishi Dhariwal ( Banking )
The union budget is no longer an instrument for the government to articulate its policy .
This has been observed for the last 3 - 4 years .
In any case , with global economic scenario changing rapidly , the government cannot take a year long view of things and stick to it .
If the monsoons fail , can we expect the government to follow only the fiscal measures outlined in the budget ?
What happens if oil prices see another spike ?
The point is , governments too need to articulate their short term and long term policies .
Budgets meant for a year do not fit the bill either ways .
So , if you were disappointed with the budget , do n't be !
Viplove Chaturvedi ( Banking )
Given the fact that this budget is the first from a government that has the people 's mandate to rule for next five years , it was expected that the budget would outline broad framework of policies that the government propose to follow during its tenure .
More so , since the ruling party is now free from the constraint of managing ideology conflict within the ruling coalition that it faced during previous tenure , it was expected that some of the long pending policy reforms in the area of divestment of PSU , labour reforms etc. would be initiated .
The budget has been uninspiring as far as that is concerned .
Anirudh Gupta ( IT )
This is a confused budget .
Many matters are undertaken for ' appeasement ' of certain quarters .
Earlier , in the initial 2 - 3 years of a new regime government had the flexibility to announce tough measures .
So it 's a lost opportunity of sorts .
Has the budget taken care of core sectors like infrastructure , energy , banking , information technology ?
Vinod Gupta : Focus of the budget has been infrastructure and energy sector .
Initiatives like inclusion of gas in petroleum products , clarity in NELP ( New Exploration Licensing Policy ) tax rebate clause and allowing depreciation on investment in gas / petroleum pipeline will give boost to economy .
India needs to spend heavily on this sector and these initiatives will attract more players in this sector .
Another important aspect is extension of tax holiday for refineries up to 2012 .
Unfortunately , our reserves are not adequate to meet our fuel requirement .
Policy initiatives like this will help in having higher value addition within the country rather than outside the country .
This will ease some burden on our Forex .
However , in order to attract more private players in this sector and to allow existing players to take part in retail segment , price control mechanism need to be phased out .
Vinod Ramachandran : From the telecommunications sector 's perspective , the budget has been slightly disappointing .
Apart from the continuing exemption of 4 % countervailing duty , which can boost mobile handset manufacturing in India , there was very little mention of other initiatives .
Yogesh Soman : National Highway Authority of India has been given a 23 % increase in its budget over the last year .
This will boost the highway development work which has been almost stalled after the completion of the Golden Quadrilateral in 2005 .
India needs much better transport infrastructure within the country for efficient transport of goods .
There is no mention of outlay for development of ports in the budget .
This is a disappointment as ports are in major need of modernisation and expansion .
Our exports depend critically on development and efficiency of ports and that sector should also have been covered adequately
Rishi Dhariwal :
The crucial highlight of the budget for spurring growth of the economy are the increase in allocation for NHDP ( up by 23 % ) and the loan take out by IIFCL for infrastructural loans .
' De - bottlenecking ' projects are especially valuable to leverage economic activity .
If the same holds true for India also , the incremental job creation as well as the spur in consumption caused by the same is a good way to stimulate the economy and a much better measure than giving subsidies which do not have a similar multiplier effect .
Viplove Chaturvedi : Picking up discussion threads from where Yogesh left ......
In the backdrop of stated objective of achieving 9 % investment in infrastructure , while provision of take - out financing from IIFCL for projects financed by banks under PPP is welcome , the combined fiscal deficit of central government , state government , food / oil / fertiliser subsidy at 12 % has potential of pushing out other participants from markets and making funding scarce .
Mayank Kumar : Government has decided to implement GST with effect from 01.04.2010 .
Currently we have Central VAT and state Value Added Tax ( VAT ) .
GST will unify both these taxes .
Credit of central VAT will be available to wholesalers and dealers who pay state VAT .
Currently this CENVAT credit is not available to them .
This also means that state governments will lose lot of revenue because dealers will only be paying tax after adjusting amount of CENVAT credit available to them .
They will be required to revise tax rate .
Current rate of 8 % or 12 % of state vat needs to be increased .
GST rate at state level should be pegged be around 16 - 18 % .
Fixation of rate and calculation of revenue loss or gain will be very crucial .
This should be done at priority if we want to implement GST with effect from 1.4.10 .
Rate should be fixed so that state revenues are not affected much .
Next crucial step will be change in legislation required and to redesign all forms , returns to take care of new system of taxation .
Central and state governments need to move very fast and quick to ensure that GST is a reality by April 2010 .
Anirudh Gupta :
The finance minister has extended tax sops for IT exporters by one year under Sections 10A and 10B of the IT Act .
This is a temporary stop gap measure at the best as it does not encourage new companies to set shop given the 1 - yr extension .
This will benefit only the existing companies to face the global downturn .
So lacks a strategic vision .
Government 's steps on Unique ID project , Biometric smart card for BPL Families are appreciable .
The measure to relieve employers from paying fringe benefit
tax — however , this entire burden is being borne now by the employees and thus dampens the Income Tax benefits by the removal of 10 % surcharge .
Rachna Salgia :
The budget has reflected its concern to improve the status of women in the society .
Some welcomed changes in the budget include the comparatively reduced tax for women employees which will encourage women to join the productive workforce and will help them to come forwards in various walks of life .
Another one is the budget proposals for national literacy mission for girls ' education is welcome .
Personally , I have welcomed the full excise exemption on branded jewellery .
Sometimes , some things are just too good to be true .
Earlier this week , Microsoft made a relatively stunning announcement that it would contribute some 20000 lines of code to the Linux kernel , licensed under the GPL .
Microsoft is n’t particularly fond of either Linux or the GPL , so this was pretty big news .
As it turns out , the code drop was brought on by … A GPL violation .
This story begins when Stephen Hemminger , principal engineer with open - source network vendor Vyatta and Linux contributor , finds out that a network driver in Microsoft ’s Hyper - V uses open source components licensed under the GPL .
These components were statically linked to closed - source binaries , which the GPL does not allow .
Consequently , Hemminger contacted Linux Driver Project head Greg Kroah - Hartman , who works for Novell .
Commendably , Hemminger wanted the case to be worked out without fireworks and massive media attention .
“ Since Novell has a ( too ) close association with Microsoft , my expectation was that Greg could prod the right people to get the issue resolved , ” he writes on his blog .
When the code drop was announced Monday , nor Microsoft , nor Kroah - Hartman spoke of the violation .
To confirm the story , About - Microsoft blogger Mary - Jo Foley contacted Kroah - Hartman , and he confirmed that Hemminger is indeed correct : the code drop seems to have been brought on by a GPL violation .
A “ break from the ordinary ” and a “ significant milestone ” ?
None of that – just a silently handled case , with an overdose of marketing spin , to prevent a major embarrassment for Microsoft .
Updates FBI Joins Fox In Hunt For Stolen ‘ Wolverine ’ Pirated On Web
SUNDAY UPDATE : News Corp issued the following statement from Los Angeles today confirming my reporting from Saturday — “ Roger Friedman ’s views in no way reflect the views of News Corporation .
We , along with 20th Century Fox Film Corporation , have been a consistent leader in the fight against piracy and have zero tolerance for any action that encourages and promotes piracy .
When we advised Fox News of the facts they took immediate action , removed the post , and promptly terminated Mr. Friedman . ”
SATURDAY PM EXCLUSIVE : News Corp like all major Hollywood studios takes the crime of piracy very seriously .
Nor will the Fox parent company tolerate it if its employees do n’t .
Especially after a stolen , early and unfinished work print of 20th Century Fox ’s big summer blockbuster X - Men Origins : Wolverine was put onto the Internet illegally this week in a major scandal that the FBI is now investigating .
So there was universal shock on Friday when long - time “ Fox 411 ” freelance columnist Roger Friedman wrote what I ’m told his bosses felt was a blatant promotion of piracy on his Fox News web outlet .
Besides writing a review from watching the purloined print of Wolverine , Friedman posted , “ I did find the whole top 10 [ movies in theaters ] , plus TV shows , commercials , videos , everything , all streaming away .
It took really less than seconds to start playing it all right onto my computer .
I could have downloaded all of it but really , who has the time or the room ?
Later tonight I may finally catch up with Paul Rudd in I Love You , Man .
It ’s so much easier than going out in the rain ! ” I ’m told that Fox News ’ actions were swift and severe .
First , Roger Ailes , who oversees Fox News , deleted the offending post after he was contacted by 20th Century Fox about it .
And then Ailes fired Friedman as a freelance Fox News entertainment writer .
I hear the move was done with the full support of News Corp .
“ He promoted piracy .
He basically suggested that viewing a stolen film is OK , which is absolutely intolerable .
So we fired him , ” a source told me Saturday .
“ Fox News acted promptly on all fronts . ”
Friedman has written his gossip column , “ Fox 411 ” , for FoxNews.com for more than a decade and peppers it with celebrity items , industry news , and off - the - cuff movie reviews .
He has long been a controversial writer who quite frequently angers the publicity machine surrounding actors , directors , producers , studios , celebrities , movies and TV .
Occasionally he has scoops , especially about the music biz .
Still , how could he not have known that his writings Friday would hit a nerve with his employers .
After Friedman ’s column on FoxNews.com appeared , both News Corp and Fox condemned it as “ promoting a pirated version of Wolverine “ .
News Corp issued this statement : “ Roger Friedman ’s views in no way reflect the views of News Corporation .
We , along with 20th Century Fox Film Corporation , have been a consistent leader in the fight against piracy and have zero tolerance for any action that encourages and promotes piracy .
Once we learned of Roger Friedman ’s post we asked Fox News to remove it , which they did immediately . ”
And Fox said , “ We ’ve just been made aware that Roger Friedman , a freelance columnist who writes Fox 411 on Foxnews.com – an entirely separate company from 20th Century Fox — watched on the internet and reviewed a stolen and unfinished version of X - Men Orgins : Wolverine .
This behavior is reprehensible and we condemn this act categorically — whether the review is good or bad . ”
UPDATE : I did reach Friedman for comment .
He emailed back only that he was at the Paul McCartney concert .
Abandon your MySpace account for Facebook ?
You might just be a racist .
At a keynote speech during New York ’s Democracy forum at Lincoln Center , Danah Boyd spoke of the racial disparity and possible reasons for mass abandonment of MySpace for the “ more cultured ” and “ less cheesy ” social networking site Facebook .
Boyd , a social media researcher for Microsoft and fellow of the Harvard University Berkman Center for Internet and Society , stated :
“ We might as well face an uncomfortable reality … what happened was modern day ‘ white flight ’ . ”
Boyd also observed that :
“ The fact that digital migration is revealing the same social patterns as urban white flight should send warning signals to all of us .
It should scare the hell out of us . ”
Referring to MySpace as the “ ghetto of the digital landscape , ” Boyd indicated that MySpace users are more likely to be “ brown or black ” and espouse a different set of ideals in conflict with those espoused by the teens she surveyed over four years .
She said that patterns in migration across social networking sites echoed those of a white exodus from cities in the past .
Boyd also said that teens who use Facebook are more likely to condescend their MySpace - favoring peers .
“ Any high school student who has a Facebook page will tell you MySpace users are more likely to be barely educated and obnoxious … like Peet ’s is more cultured than Starbucks and jazz is more cultured than bubblegum pop .
And Macs are more cultured than PCs . ”
Teens are n’t even the worst culprits when it comes to socio-economic social media judgment passing .
The New York Observer cites a quote from Michael Wolff in an interview with BusinessWeek ’s Jon Fine in December 2008 :
“ If you ’re on MySpace now , you ’re a [ expletive ] cretin .
And you ’re not only a [ expletive ] cretin , but you ’re poor .
Nobody who has beyond an 8th grade level of education is on MySpace .
It is for backwards people . ”
Boyd ’s research indicated that the class divisions were likely to only worsen over time , as the media continues to portay MySpace as a seedy stomping ground for pedophiles and Facebook as a “ utopian savior . ”
She contends :
“ There ’s a cultural wall between users .
If there ’s no way for people to communicate across the divide , you can never expect them to do so . ”

Dog Bites : An Overview
Between 4 million and 5 million people are bitten by dogs every year in this country , and the incidence only seems to be rising .
Dogs can attack people for any number of reasons , from naturally aggressive genetics to specific training or abuse .
Often dogs will bite to protect their territory , for instance , or to express dominance , or because they are redirecting aggression from another incident .
It is not unusual for dogs to target people who may feel they already " know " the dog in question - after all , dogs are animals , and we cannot always accurately predict their behavior .
Dog bites and animal attacks often result in significant physical injury , including scarring and disfigurement .
Many times , the victim of a dog bite or animal attack is an innocent child .
No matter who is the victim , the costs of medical care , including rehabilitation and plastic surgery , can be exorbitant .
Even minor bites can lead to soreness , lingering wounds and infections , especially if the dog in question harbors dangerous bacteria in its mouth .
Ringworm , rabies and other ailments can also travel through a dog bite as a vector , meaning you may contend with grave health issues down the road .
Whatever the circumstances behind a dog bite , it is essential to understand your legal rights in the event of an attack .
What To Do if You Are Bitten
So what should you do if you are the victim of a dog bite ?
The most important thing is to seek medical care immediately .
Dog bites can carry any number of pathogens , and the injuries alone can be critical without proper intervention .
Once you are stable and safe , be sure to document your injuries in some way , either by taking pictures , or getting copies of the medical report , or both .
It is also crucial that you get the information of the dog's owner at the point of attack so that you can pursue action if necessary .
Finally you will want to contact an attorney who has experience in cases such as these .
Illinois law is ironclad in its emphasis on " strict liability , " meaning you may be entitled to significant damages no matter what the owner did or did not know about the dog 's tendencies .
An Experienced Lawyer Fighting For You
At Klest Injury Law Firm , our personal injury lawyer has considerable experience successfully representing dog bite victims and animal attack survivors throughout metropolitan Chicago , including in Chicago 's many forest preserves and along the Lake Michigan shoreline .

Stand Up To Insurance Companies Who Deny Compensation

You are wrong .
Insurance companies have a vested interest in paying you as little as possible .
We have extensive experience successfully negotiating with insurance companies .
If you cannot come to our offices in downtown Chicago or Schaumburg , attorney Joseph Klest will meet with you at your home , hospital , or another convenient location .

Exclusive Twitter announcement once again reveals a new Executive Department , married with Web 2.0
President Barack Obama made headlines this weekend after achieving another of many firsts : for the first time , the White House announced an upcoming full news conference through social networking Web site Twitter .
The San Francisco - based social media startup was in a bit of turmoil early last week over news that a hacker had breached the site ’s security , accessing hundreds of executive documents .
Because the hack will probably not have very lasting serious effects , the company is moving on .
And this past Friday ’s announcement from the White House quickly took the hack off of everyone ’s minds as we are all reminded of Twitter ’s incredible influence .
The White House , since the election of President Obama , is no stranger to Web 2.0 technology and social media .
In the months leading up to the 2008 election , Obama offered a pretty clear view of things to come , as his campaign team aggressively utilized the power of the Internet to spread their message of “ Change . ”
Now with the election long over , t hose campaign strategies have transformed into White House announcement platforms , informing U.S. citizens across the spectrum of social media .
Here ’s a comprehensive roundup of the White House ’s social media presence :
Official Web site .
This is the central hub for all information coming out of the Executive Department .
For anyone looking to investigate the nitty - gritty of what ’s happening in the White House , what legislation the President is pushing for , or just to take a look at long - term plans , the main Web site is the place to start .
Blog .
Updated multiple times a day , the White House blog ( accessible right from the official Web site ) probably serves as the all - around best place to quickly and easily see what the President and Vice - President are doing in Washington on a daily basis .
Facebook .
This page is essentially a summary of what is being published on the blog , but if Facebook users subscribe , they can have updates show up on their news feed .
YouTube and Vimeo .
Primarily hosts to President Obama 's weekly address , these competing video sites both provide access to the same videos on the Executive Deparment 's various activities .
Twitter .
Like the Facebook page , this is ( for the most part ) a republishing of blog news .
With the administration experimenting with a special announcement this past Friday , however , the instant tweets could become the main source of up - to - the - minute updates .
Flickr .
The number one spot for professional high - quality photographs of the President and his day - to - day doings .
MySpace .
Even more than the Facebook and Twitter pages , the White House MySpace page appears to be little more than a slightly modified replication of the White House blog .
The best part about the White House ’s widespread permeation through social media networks is that it eliminates the often - cited excuse by apolitical citizens that their apathy stems from lack of information and governmental transparency .
Whether you enjoy reading blogs , watching videos , or simply checking your Facebook or Twitter , there ’s at least one avenue for you to see what your government is doing .
No matter what the history textbooks say about his administration ’s various political feats and blunders — those to come and those already passed — President Obama will undoubtedly go down as not only the first African American president , but also the first Web 2.0 president .
Here ’s to hoping his successors do n’t put an end to the tweets .
If your neighbors were making a terrible racket , would you offer to pay them to stop ?
Of course not .
Sure , they 'll stop today .
But they 'll soon be clamoring for more payments .
One of the major features of the Waxman - Markey cap - and - trade bill – the ambitious climate change legislation recently passed by the House – offers just such payments .
It pays polluting countries not to pollute .
And , as with the noisy neighbor , this will just encourage a continuing racket .
Here 's the story : India has offered to cap its greenhouse - gas emissions – but only at a level 10 times higher than its own emission rate .
China will not accept a cap at all , and at the Major Economies Forum on July 9 , China and India even blocked setting a target for world emissions in 2050 .
This trend confirms that other developing countries will also stick with their anti-cap positions , leaving half the world 's emissions unchecked and growing far faster than emissions from the industrialized nations .
The Waxman - Markey bill was supposed to remedy this problem by providing US leadership , which poor nations would follow by accepting caps .
But this hope ignored the inequities of caps and ignored the bill 's offer of an estimated $ 13 billion a year – growing to $ 83 billion annually in 2050 – to buy " international offset credits " from developing countries .
Such offset purchases encourage poor countries not to accept caps .
Global cooperation requires a reversal in US climate policy toward developing countries .
We must reward cooperation rather than the lack of it .
Buying offset credits pays emitters in developing countries to emit " less than they would have emitted . "
But implementing a cap cuts back on what " they would have emitted , " and reduces their profits from selling offsets .
The House bill did not create this offset problem .
The European Union 's cap - and - trade scheme has long allowed European companies to buy UN - certified offset credits instead of cutting their own emissions .
As Stanford researchers Michael W. Wara and David G. Victor found over a year ago , Europe 's offset purchases have not drawn developing countries into " substantial limits on emissions , " but have , " by contrast , rewarded them for avoiding exactly those commitments . "
As a result of this perverse incentive , Europe 's cap - and - trade market is considering rules to ban the purchase of UN offset credits from major developing countries .
One of the offset schemes that Europe might ban involves a type of chemical plant found , among other places , in China .
While dumping a notorious greenhouse gas into the atmosphere , the plant 's owners suggest to the UN that the plant could incinerate the gas instead – if the owners were allowed to sell offsets .
The particular gas emitted is 11,700 times worse than carbon dioxide , so naturally the UN agrees that the owners can sell 11,700 tons of emission offsets for every ton of gas incinerated .
With offsets worth about $ 15 a ton , the profits have been enormous .
By purchasing such offsets , Europe pays poor countries not to harm the climate , and the House bill would do the same .
Most markets , however , pay for " goods , " not for stopping " bads . "
In the private sector , we call a market for not doing harm a " protection racket . "
By offering to pay protection money – by buying offset credits – we invite the protection - racket way of thinking into the realm of international negotiations .
For example , if China had committed to even a weak cap or carbon tax , it would have curbed its horrendous chemical - plant emissions .
But instead , the Chinese and others have allowed these emissions to continue and have offered to protect the world from them – for a price .
There 's nothing wrong with contributing funds to fight climate change in poor countries .
They have done little to harm the climate .
But our contributions should reward those who commit to join us in the fight .
Although China and India are not likely to reconsider caps , there is still hope for a policy that rewards cooperation .
Top economists , from N. Gregory Mankiw on the right to Joseph E. Stiglitz on the left , have long recommended a carbon tax as far better than a cap .
Poor countries reject effective caps because they limit their per-person emissions to far less than our own .
But carbon taxes lack this offensive inequality .
So China , India , and others might well commit to taxing carbon , especially if given some assistance for doing so .
With half the world rejecting caps , we must change course .
First , remove the foreign offsets from the Waxman - Markey bill .
They cost us dearly and only work against us .
Then , devise a policy to reward those who commit to join us .
Offering to be the " mark " for a global protection racket is no way to lead the world toward climate stability .

Transcripts and audio files of a leaked phone conversation between the secretive CEO of Texas - based EEStor , Dick Weir , and an as yet undisclosed source have been doing the rounds online for the last 24 hours creating a stir amongst technologists and environmentalists around the world .
Whilst you'd be forgiven for thinking that a leaked phone conversation on the internet was merely yawn worthy , this particular conversation saw eeStore CEO , Weir confirming that they are mere months away from launching an uber capacitor which is an electrical component that would fully charge up in minutes yet hold enough juice to power electronic gadgets for days .

Should this leaked conversation be something more than a cleverly orchestrated PR stunt , and EEStor 's invention actually work , the implications are nothing short of revolutionary .
Electric cars could finally become a viable option .
Photovoltaic solar cells and wind turbines could store their own energy , reducing global dependence on less clean forms of energy and most importantly giving us notebook PCs and iPods that charge in seconds but run for days .
If this all sounds more than a little Buck Rogers , there has been some independent corroboration of eeStor 's claims .
In May ZENN Motor Company ( who hold exclusive rights to the eestor capacitor system for vehicles under 1,400 kg ) confirmed that their own independent testing verified that EEStor 's capacitors were on track to performing as promised .
This said , eeStor 's claims have also attracted scepticism from capacitor experts and to date no uuber capacitor prototypes have been publicly tested .
The leaked conversation delves into the ins and outs of building capacitors in excruciating detail .
The leaked conversation even alludes to a involvement with military contractors Lockheed Martin .
Weir also confirms that pre-production prototypes of what he calls an electrical energy storage unit ( EESU ) could be revealed as soon as the end of this year .
EEStor is not the first company to claim it's about to revolutionise energy generation or storage , with Steorn announcing in 2006 that they 'd circumvented the law of conservation of energy with its " Orb " generator to produce clean , free and constant power .
After a botched demonstration in 2007 where Steorn blamed heat from the camera lights for the failure , Steorn has yet to deliver any free energy .
Will EEStor come up with the goods ?
Only time will tell .

Early reports suggest the Cash For Clunkers program is creating some new cars sales , but it 's also creating questions : are there incentives for recyclers ?
Can you strip down your own car ?
Is the CARS Act " horseshit beyond repair " for recyclers ?
According to the law , there are approximately 7,700 car recyclers who have the ability to process cars because they are part of a government program designed to remove mercury switches safely from vehicles .
If they wish , they can apply to be Cash For Clunkers vehicle recyclers and contract out with dealerships .

Here 's where the law gets tricky .
These are the individuals who can process cars under the law and , from what we can tell from the three we 've talked to , they have started to sign up with dealerships .
Because this happened so quickly , it 's unclear to us , and to them , whether or not there is a great deal of money it in for them to do so .
This is because the law requires destroying the engine and the transmission , which makes up to 60 % of a vehicle 's salvage revenue according to the Automotive Recyclers Association .
Being unable to sell these parts means the value has to come from the scraps and whatever parts they can strip for sale within 180 days of receiving the vehicle .
After this period they are required by law to destroy it .

Bruce Luther of Rock And Roll Auto Recycling in Pleasanton , California says the " The CARS act , as written ... is horseshit beyond repair " and points out the current scrap value is $ 140 a ton , which means a two - ton vehicle is only worth $ 280 as scrap .
Subtract out the estimated cost of $ 200 to detox the vehicle as required by law and the total value is only $ 80 per car if nothing can be sold on it .
Other recyclers we 've spoken to have similar estimates of the cost and say , for the most part , it depends on the condition of the cars turned in because nice aluminum wheels and other parts ( motors , controls ) on the car can be worth anywhere between $ 2 and $ 10 a piece .

Jim Butler of Butler Auto Recycling in Pensacola , Florida , said he 's participating in the program not because of the promise of a big payday , which he admits is unlikely , but in order to " do a favor for the dealerships who have to get rid of these cars and hopefully build some relationships . "
His company currently has 25 contracts to remove cars .
We 've also spoken with the NHTSA about whether consumers are able to do some of the scrap recycling yourself to try and make a little extra money before trade - in on their vehicle .
According to a National Highway Safety Administration spokesperson :
" There is nothing from a federal standpoint to stop a consumer from removing the radio , doors , etc . "

Of course , few people want a stock radio according to scrap experts and there are certain parts of a car you can't remove and sell yourself without a proper license in some states .
Among the parts of some value you can turn in from a car into the program and qualify for include spoilers , nice wheels ( assuming you turn it in with some wheels at all ) , aftermarket radios , rare pieces and back seats .
" I think you 're representing a very small minority of people .
I think the vast majority of people are n't going to take the time to remove a part , " said Luther .

If anyone does end up taking matters , and doors into their own hands , please take a photo of it at the dealership and add them to this post .
Maybe we need a contest for the most stripped clunker , eh ?

Phoenix published a cover story about
When thepublished a cover story about the potential tipping point in the fight to end marijuana prohibition , we smelled something in the air : it seemed more than ever that such a resolution might be possible .
Now another step forward has been taken .
This past month , Democratic Massachusetts representative Barney Frank , for the second year in a row , filed two bills seeking decriminalization .
The Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults
Act of 2009 would lift punishment for the " possession or not - for - profit transfer " of small amounts of marijuana ; it would also create a $ 100 civil fine for smoking pot in public .
The Marijuana Patient Protection
Act , meanwhile , would prevent federal authorities from prosecuting growers and users of medical marijuana in any state where the medical use of pot is legal .
The bills do n't go as far as many would hope ; they wo n't end federal prohibition against selling pot for profit , for instance — so any arguments about legalizing and taxing the stuff are moot .
In addition , neither piece of legislation would change marijuana 's status as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act , and neither upends any existing state or local law .
The diehards in the marijuana - reform movement " clearly would like to have marijuana legalized , " says Allen St. Pierre , executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) .
" They see decriminalization as a half - baked loaf .
But those of us here on K Street [ in Washington , DC ] that actually have to lobby and litigate this stuff , [ see that ] there is no support , overtly , in Congress for legalizing marijuana .
So while the grassroots are harping for legalization and taxed access , I can say that , of the 435 members of Congress , there are probably five who genuinely , strongly support legalization .
There 's probably 200 to 250 who support the notion of decriminalization — but they 've never had a vote on such . "
" I do n't know what the difference is between legalization and decriminalization , " argued Frank with characteristic bluntness when we spoke for our May 29 story .
" Something is either legal or it 's criminal .
You may only legalize some aspects of it , but what is a ' decriminalized activity ' ?
Does that mean you can do it ?
Then it 's legal .
If it 's against the law , then it 's criminal . "
Not exactly , counters St. Pierre , citing Massachusetts 's recent decriminalization referendum by way of example .
" Run out to Faneuil Hall right now with an ounce of marijuana ; you 'll pay the $ 100 fine . "
Try to sell it , on the other hand , and " you 'll end up with a felony against you . "
But right now , the legalize / decriminalize debate should n't obscure the bigger issue , says St. Pierre .
With support for pot-policy reform at a high ebb , it 's time to act — and any realistic chance at chipping away federal marijuana laws should be embraced .
Luckily , he says , these bills appear to have a fair chance of actually passing .
" Unlike last year , " when similar legislation filed by Frank and Paul never made it to a vote , " this year it would seem that they 've really struck a note because of the marijuana Zeitgeist that seems to be around the United States these days . "
More and more Americans , having " seen the ineffectiveness of the all - out prohibition approach , " with its " overcrowded prisons and overstretched law enforcement , " are " more skeptical of government intervention , " Frank told the Phoenix in May .
Ultimately he hopes to convince his colleagues in Congress that " people should be allowed personal freedom if they 're not hurting anyone else . "
Joey Barton seems certain to be shown the door by Newcastle United this summer , whatever division the club are playing in .
The troubled midfielder has spent time in prison and received a handful of final warnings since arriving at St James ' Park from Manchester City for £ 5.8 m two years ago , but his sending - off at Anfield on Sunday almost certainly came as the final straw .
Ignoring Alan Shearer 's exhortations to stay out of trouble , Barton instead marked his comeback from injury by being shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge on Xabi Alonso ­during Newcastle 's 3 –0 defeat at Liverpool .
It is understood that , having specifically warned the 26 - year - old immediately before kick - off against ­making similarly ill - advised tackles , Shearer refused to accept the player 's post - match apology .
The pair are said to have clashed verbally in the dressing room and it was reported last night that Barton has been told to stay away by the club for a fortnight .
Barton , playing his first game since fracturing a foot in January , will be suspended for Newcastle 's final three games of the season at home to Middlesbrough and Fulham and away at Aston Villa .
He will also be fined two weeks ' wages – £ 128,000 – by the club .
" I thought he could do something different , " said Shearer yesterday .
" But I did n't think he'd go on and get a red card .
I 'd asked him not to do that . "
Although a suspended six - game ban imposed by the Football Association last September still hangs over his head in the wake of Barton 's training - ground assault on his former City team - mate Ousmane Dabo in 2007 , Newcastle have been advised that it will not be activated by the tackle on Alonso as it is thought the ­sending - off was almost certainly for ­serious foul play .
It would take a dismissal for violent conduct to trigger that additional ban and the FA expects to confirm that this is not the case on receipt of the referee Phil Dowd 's report tomorrow .
Mike Ashley , Newcastle 's owner , tried to offload Barton when he was imprisoned for 77 days last summer as the result of an assault in Liverpool 's city centre in December 2007 .
However , Kevin Keegan , the club's then manager , talked Ashley out of it , persuading him that Barton deserved a final chance .
When Bolton made a bid for his services in January , Shearer 's predecessor , Joe Kinnear , again dissuaded Ashley from selling while also fending off interest from Ports­mouth .
Future suitors will not be similarly discouraged .
In the meantime , though , Newcastle 's focus is on avoiding relegation .
To do so they will almost certainly be required to beat their relegation rivals , Middlesbrough at home on Monday .
" If we do n't win against Middlesbrough it will be extremely difficult to stay in the Premier League , " said Jonás Gutiérrez , Newcastle 's Argentinian winger .
" It 's a difficult situation we are now faced with , but we can turn it round with the two matches we have at home .
We will have to perform like they are two cup finals .
If we take six points it will be a different situation . "
Although Gutiérrez understandably side - stepped the Barton issue – " We can't think about Joey now , we have to think about players who can play , " he said – the winger conceded that Michael Owen was desperately disappointed to start the Liverpool game on the bench in arguably the most controversial decision of Shearer 's Tyneside tenure .
Like Barton , Owen will almost ­certainly be leaving Newcastle in the summer , but Shearer is expected to restore the ­erstwhile England striker to a three - man attack against Middlesbrough .
" Michael wanted to play , " said Gutiérrez .
" He wanted to start rather than be on the bench but the manager is the manager and he decides who is in the team .
But there is no doubt in my mind that Michael will be right for next week . "
Reaction Formation Explanations > Behaviors > Coping > Reaction Formation Description | Example | Discussion |
So what ?
Description Reaction Formation occurs when a person feels an urge to do or say something and then actually does or says something that is effectively the opposite of what they really want .
It also appears as a defense against a feared social punishment .
If I fear that I will be criticized for something , I very visibly act in a way that shows I am personally a long way from the feared position .
A common pattern in Reaction Formation is where the person uses ‘ excessive behavior ’ , for example using exaggerated friendliness when the person is actually feeling unfriendly .
Example A person who is angry with a colleague actually ends up being particularly courteous and friendly towards them .
A man who is gay has a number of conspicuous heterosexual affairs and openly criticizes gays .
A mother who has a child she does not want becomes very protective of the child .
An alcoholic extols the virtues of abstinence .
Discussion
A cause of Reaction Formation is when a person seeks to cover up something unacceptable by adopting an opposite stance .
For example the gay person who has heterosexually promiscuous may be concealing their homosexual reality .
This may be a conscious concealment but also may well occur at the subconscious level such that they do not realize the real cause of their behavior .
Reaction Formation thus can turn homosexual tendencies ( love men ) to homophobic ones ( hate men ) .
Freud called the exaggerated compensation that can appear in Reaction Formation ‘ overboarding ’ as the person is going overboard in one direction to distract from and cover up something unwanted in the other direction , such as a person who fears war becoming a pacifist , convincing themselves that war is wrong ( rather than the ‘ cowardly ’ position that war is scary ) .
Reaction Formation goes further than projection such that unwanted impulses and thoughts are not acknowledged .
Extreme patterns of Reaction Formation are found in paranoia and obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , where the person becomes trapped in a cycle of repeating a behavior that they know ( at least at a deep level ) is somehow wrong .
Reaction formation is one of Anna Freud 's original defense mechanisms .
So what ?
When a person takes a position or stance on something , and particularly if that position is extreme , consider the possibility that their real views are opposite to this .
This offers you two options in persuasion .
You can either support their current position or carefully expose how their underlying tendencies are opposite ( and how it is ok to admit this ) .
To cause a Reaction Formation pattern , show the other person that a particular behavior is socially unacceptable .
Then give them the space and ideas to react against this undesirable pattern and create their own way of showing how they are actually very far away from the undesirable behavior .
In a therapeutic situation , help a person who is dysfunctionally forming contrary reactions by first create a supportive environment where they can admit and accept what is happening to themselves .
Then support their changing of position to somewhere that is more acceptable and appropriate for them .
Remember that defense mechanisms are usually symptoms of deeper problems and addressing them directly can be ineffective or even counter - productive .
Simply showing the person that their position is opposed to their real feelings can just cause deeper entrenchment .
Before this , you should first work on their primary conflict .

Abstract : In Constructive Type
Theory , recursive and corecursive deﬁnitions are subject to syntactic restrictions which guarantee termination for recursive functions and productivity for corecursive functions .
However , many terminating and productive functions do not pass the syntactic tests .
Bove proposed in her thesis an elegant reformulation of the method of accessibility predicates that widens the range of terminative recursive functions formalisable in Constructive Type Theory .
In this paper , we pursue the same goal for productive corecursive functions .
Notably , our method of formalisation of coinductive deﬁnitions of productive functions in Coq requires not only the use of ad - hoc predicates , but also a systematic algorithm that separates the inductive and coinductive parts of functions .
I am almost somewhat reluctant about posting this post , since I 've already written so many posts about Krugman recently , so it might give the impression that I 'm obsessed with him ( which I 'm not ) .
However , he is unfortunately a very influential pundit , and lately he has produced unusually many misleading and dangerous posts / columns , including his infamous " treason to the planet " - column Now Krugman claims that some unnamed commentators have accused him of being a Malthusian , something which he reacts to not by trying to differentiate his views from Malthus ' but by defending him .
While acknowledging that Malthus ' dire views about population growth have been dead wrong for the last two centuries ( which is to say the two centuries that have passed after Malthus made his predictions ) , he claims that Malthus was right before that .
This is a perfect example of an own goal from Krugman 's part .
I wo n't bother to argue with his data despite the fact that they are extremely unreliable given the fact that statistics authorities did n't exist until the twentieth century and given the fact that most people at the time were mostly self - sufficient farmers , because the data if true actually argues against his own views .
Remember that the accusation arose because of his views that because of the alleged threat from global warming / " climate change " , we need to dramatically reduce and preferably end our use of fossil fuels ( like coal and oil ) .
The thing is here that one of the reasons why the Malthusian worldview has proven to be dead wrong for the last two centuries is precisely because we have started to use fossil fuels in large scale ( both coal and oil were used on a limited scale before the Industrial revolution , but it was only after that that large scale use of coal and oil started ) .
While the dramatically increased use of fossil fuels was n't the only reason why the dire Malthusian forecasts were proven wrong , it was certainly a very important factor .
By emphasizing indirectly ( without realizing it ) how it was only after the large scale use of fossil fuels that mankind lifted itself from the predictions dire Malthusian worldview , while at the same time pushing for the end of use of fossil fuels , Krugman is indirectly acknowledging ( without realizing it ) that he is pushing for the creation of a dire , suffering ridden Malthusian world .
What Is Scrum ?
One of the many reasons that I like working at Atalasoft it that the company is open to creativity , and open to creative change .
We have regular staff meetings that were OK .
You know , you mostly sit and take them in , but really not a lot of people were invested in the meeting .
This kind of meeting grows tiresome over time .
It becomes something you should do or something that you have to do , rather than something to anticipate and to enjoy .
Christina , our resident Jill of all Trades made the move to put the responsibility of the meeting in the hands of the masses instead of strictly in the hands of management .
It ’s made the meetings so much better .
At the previous meeting , she and Eric prepared a slide show about how we prepare for trade shows .
Seeing this , I thought that it would be good to show engineering process as well .
Here a video about the Atalasoft Engineering Scrum Process that I put together :
A few notes :
James Yeager , the owner of Tactical Response , has posted a video on youtube in response the controversy over the controversial training video which shows a photographer standing next to a target downrange of students shooting live ammunition .
Personally I respect everyone ’s right to train how they see fit , as long as they do it far away from me .
Although saying that , I think Mr Yeager could have made some better arguments in his video .
Yeager states many people do n’t like anybody standing even slightly forward of their muzzle when shooting .
That is true , and I can be included in this group of people , but the video showed somebody next to the targets , not just standing slightly forward of the muzzle .
He uses a car analogy in his response .
I know driving in a car is dangerous , but I do my best to mitigate the risks of driving as much as I can .
I drive a car that does n’t have any known safety problems , has seat belts , ABS brakes and air bags .
If I could afford a new car , I would buy one with those fancy electronic stability control systems .
Increasing risk when shooting just because driving is dangerous does not make sense to me .
Lastly , he says you can never be 100 % safe .
I belong to a rifle target shooting club that has their own private range .
The club is over 100 years old and as far as anybody can tell , there has not been an injury on the range in 100 years .
There have of course been negligent discharges , but nobody was downrange at the time .
Sure it is not 100 % safe , but pretty damn close .

SAN FRANCISCO / NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Steve Jobs was at the company ’s headquarters on Monday , underscoring speculation the pancreatic cancer survivor may have returned to work .
Apple Inc CEO

REUTERS / Robert Galbraith
Jobs , who has been on medical leave since January , was seen by a Reuters reporter leaving the Apple campus in Cupertino , California dressed in his trademark black turtleneck and jeans .
He walked out chatting with another person before climbing into a black car that then drove off .
Speculation has mounted that Jobs could be back at work soon , fueled in part by a Wall Street Journal article last weekend that said the CEO had a liver transplant two months ago .
On Monday , Jobs , 54 , was also cited in an Apple press release for the first time in months , triggering talk that the man considered the visionary behind Apple ’s innovation machine had returned from his leave of absence .
“ This is the first time we ’ve heard from Steve Jobs since he reported he was taking medical leave , ” said Oppenheimer & Co analyst Yair Reiner .
“ It ’s a sign Apple has its CEO back . ”
Apple said in the release that it had sold more than 1 million of its newest iPhone 3GS in the first three days of launch , beating analysts ’ expectations .
“ Customers are voting , and the iPhone is winning , ” Jobs said in the statement .
Apple , which has not disclosed details on Jobs ’ state of health while he ’s been on medical leave , declined to comment .
The company has said in the past that Jobs remains deeply involved in decision - making .
He has visited Apple periodically since starting his medical leave in January , according to blog reports that follow his every move .
The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Jobs had a liver transplant two months ago , but was expected back at work before the end of June .
DISTRACTIONS
Shares of Apple rose as much as 1.5 percent in early trading before falling with the broader market to end the day down 1.5 percent at $ 137.37 .
Its stock was flat to slightly lower in after - hours trading .
Analysts said the iPhone sales figures would distract some investors from concerns about Jobs ’ health to a certain extent .
“ Investors will realize that Apple executed well on the launch in Jobs ’ absence , ” said Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Jeffrey Fidacaro .
He said the 3GS sales were strong considering it was available in only eight countries .
The last iPhone was launched in 21 countries and also booked 1 million sales in its first weekend .
“ It shows that the iPhone momentum remains strong . ”
Despite the solid weekend sales , Fidacaro said some investors would still have concerns about Jobs ’ health and whether he can continue as a driving force at Apple .
“ He ’s obviously the clear visionary of the company , ” Fidacaro said .
“ There is a concern about his health and what Apple has told us about his health and what role he ’ll be playing when he returns . ”
Analysts have said Jobs may soon shift to a new role focusing on big- picture issues and products at Apple , leaving Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook to manage day to day .
Cook has been overseeing operations in Jobs ’ absence .
Shares of Apple have risen more than 60 percent this year as investors grow more comfortable with the executive bench beyond Jobs .
Continued strong sales and product launches at the company have also helped .
“ On the one hand , you have the Jobs news out there , which might give people some pause , but on the other hand , iPhone 3GS sales were good , ” said Canaccord Adams analyst Peter Misek .
Six million customers have downloaded the new iPhone 3.0 software in the first five days since its release , Apple said .
The 3GS , which offers faster speeds , longer battery life and the ability to take videos , hit stores last Friday , drawing plenty of fans but not the crowds that had swarmed previous iPhone releases , due in part to preorders .
Exclusively on AT&T Inc ’s network in the United States , the iPhone competes with BlackBerry phones from Research in Motion and the Pre from Palm Inc .
EXCLUSIVE :
U.S. counterterrorism officials have authenticated a video by an al Qaeda recruiter threatening to smuggle a biological weapon into the United States via tunnels under the Mexico border , the latest sign of the terrorist group ’s determination to stage another mass - casualty attack on the U.S. homeland .
The video aired earlier this year as a recruitment tool makes clear that al Qaeda is looking to exploit weaknesses in U.S. border security and also is willing to ally itself with white militia groups or other anti-government entities interested in carrying out an attack inside the United States , according to counterterrorism officials interviewed by The Washington Times .
The officials , who spoke only on the condition they not be named because of the sensitive nature of their work , stressed that there is no credible information that al Qaeda has acquired the capabilities to carry out a mass biological attack although its members have clearly sought the expertise .
The video first aired by the Arabic news network Al Jazeera in February and later posted to several Web sites shows Kuwaiti dissident Abdullah al - Nafisi telling a room full of supporters in Bahrain that al Qaeda is casing the U.S. border with Mexico to assess how to send terrorists and weapons into the U.S .
“ Four pounds of anthrax — in a suitcase this big — carried by a fighter through tunnels from Mexico into the U.S. are guaranteed to kill 330,000 Americans within a single hour if it is properly spread in population centers there , ” the recruiter said .
“ What a horrifying idea ; 9/11 will be small change in comparison .
Am I right ?
There is no need for airplanes , conspiracies , timings and so on .
One person , with the courage to carry 4 pounds of anthrax , will go to the White House lawn , and will spread this ‘ confetti ’ all over them , and then we ’ll do these cries of joy .
It will turn into a real celebration . ”
In the video , obtained and translated by the Middle East Media Research Institute , al - Nafisi also suggests that al Qaeda might want to collaborate with members of native U.S. white supremacist militias who hate the federal government .
Sean Smith , a spokesman for Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , said the U.S. takes such threats seriously .
“ We can never stop being vigilant while there are individuals who seek to do harm on the American people , ” he said .
“ We continue to step up our efforts with additional personnel and better technology along the northern and southern borders and continue to strengthen our sea , land and air ports of entry . ”
A U.S. counterterrorism official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said al - Nafisi is a “ person of interest ” and a veteran recruiter for al Qaeda .
Misidentified on some blog sites as a professor , he is a Kuwaiti dissident and al Qaeda associate who is thought to have communicated with senior al Qaeda leaders in recent years , the counterterrorism official said .
The recruiter is also said to have close ties to Mullah Mohammed Omar , the senior Afghan Taliban leader now thought to be in Pakistan .
Al - Nafisi “ is a significant ideological player in terrorist circles , and that makes him dangerous because he can inspire his followers to do extremely bad things , ” the official said .
Drug Enforcement Administration and Defense Department officials have been paying close attention to links between various terrorist organizations , such as Hezbollah , and drug cartels in South America , Central America and Mexico .
“ It should n’t be a surprise to anyone that terrorist organizations would utilize the border to enter the U.S. , ” said a DEA official who also asked not to be named because of his involvement in ongoing intelligence operations .
“ We ca n’t ignore any threat or detail when it comes to al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations bent on attacking the U.S. ”
The Times first reported in March that Hezbollah — an Iran - backed group based in Lebanon — is using routes that Mexican drug lords control to smuggle contraband and people into the United States to finance operations .
While Hezbollah appears to view the U.S. primarily as a cash cow to finance its operations elsewhere , “ it should not be viewed lightly , as the money raised can be used against the U.S. or assets in future operations , ” another counterterrorism official said .
No confirmed attacks in the U.S. have been linked to Hezbollah .
In the video , al - Nafisi emphasized that al Qaeda had chemical laboratories in Afghanistan prior to the U.S. invasion .
He described his admiration for Hezbollah and said that al Qaeda continues to have scientists and resources at its disposal .
“ The Americans are afraid that the [ weapons of mass destruction ] might fall into the hands of ‘ terrorist ’ organizations like al Qaeda and others , ” he told followers .
“ There is good reason for the Americans ’ fears .
… [ Al Qaeda ] had laboratories in north Afghanistan .
They have scientists , chemists and nuclear physicists .
They are nothing like they are portrayed by these mercenary journalists - backward Bedouins living in caves .
No , no , by no means .
This kind of talk can fool only naive people .
People who follow such things know that al Qaeda has laboratories , just like Hezbollah . ”
Intelligence officials said the video provides important insights into al Qaeda recruitment methods and views of the West .
In the 10 - minute clip , al - Nafisi suggested that al Qaeda might want to make common cause with what he claimed are “ 300,000 ” members of white supremacist and other militias in the U.S .
“ These militias even think about bombing nuclear plants within the U.S. , ” he said .
“ May God grant them success , even though we are not white , or even close to it , right ?
They have plans to bomb the nuclear plant at Lake Michigan .
This plant is very important .
…
May
God grant success to one of these militia leaders , who is thinking about bombing this plant .
I believe that we should devote part of our prayers to him . ”

Am I missing something here , or are these paragraphs at odds with each other :
For the last eight weeks , nearly 200 federal examiners have labored inside some of the nation ’s biggest banks to determine how those institutions would hold up if the recession deepened .
What they are discovering may come as a relief to both the financial industry and the public : the banking industry , broadly speaking , seems to be in better shape than many people think , officials involved in the examinations say .
That is the good news .
The bad news is that many of the largest American lenders , despite all those bailouts , probably need to be bailed out again , either by private investors or , more likely , the federal government .
After receiving many millions , and in some cases , many billions of taxpayer dollars , banks still need more capital , these officials say .
Exactly how bad did they think things were that they in better shape than they thought they would be , but STILL need hundreds of billions of dollars ?
And why are n’t the results being made public so people outside of government can discuss them ?
*** Update ***
The more I read about this , the more the stress tests sound like a t - ball game rather than an inspection of the bank ’s viability .
Everyone gets credit for playing the game , we ’re all winners , but we never kept score .
A sports biplane has crashed into a car after plunging from the air .
The pilot was performing aerobatics and struck a car , which was parked on a road near the airfield .
The impact of the collision tore the undercarriage off the aeroplane and left it , and the car in a nearby field .
A couple who were in the car at the moment of impact , suffered scratches while their daughter suffered some injuries , but no - one had to be taken to the hospital .
The pilot also suffered minor injuries but did not need to go to hospital .
" Clearly guardian angels had a hand in the outcome , " Grossostheim police said in a statement about the incident .
Tobacco is n't famous for its health benefits .
But now scientists have succeeded in using genetically modified tobacco plants to produce medicines for several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases , including diabetes .
The research is published in the open access journal BMC Biotechnology .
A large team of scientists from several European research organizations have participated in the study as part of the Pharma - Planta project ( http://www.pharma-planta.org/).
Led by Professor Mario Pezzotti at the University of Verona , they set out to create transgenic tobacco plants that would produce biologically - active interleukin - 10 ( IL - 10 ) , a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine .
They tried two different versions of IL - 10 ( one from a virus , one from the mouse ) and generated plants in which this protein was targeted to three different compartments within the cell , to see which would work most effectively .
The researchers found that tobacco plants were able to process both forms of IL - 10 correctly , producing the active cytokine at high enough levels that it might be possible to use tobacco leaves without lengthy extraction and purification processes .
The next step will be to feed the plants to mice with autoimmune diseases to find out how effective they are .
The authors are keen to use the plants to see whether repeated small doses could help prevent type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) , in combination with other auto - antigens associated with the disease .
The team has a particular auto - antigen in its sights – the 65 - kDa isoform of the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD65 ) – which they have also produced in transgenic tobacco plants .
According to Pezzotti , " Transgenic plants are attractive systems for the production of therapeutic proteins because they offer the possibility of large scale production at low cost , and they have low maintenance requirements .
The fact that they can be eaten , which delivers the drug where it is needed , thus avoiding lengthy purification procedures , is another plus compared with traditional drug synthesis . "

Fighting Mixed Combative have announced that Igor Vovchanchyn will make his comeback at Fighting Mixed Combative ’s second event in September .
A representative from FMC said that many fans in Korea have said that they want to see Vovchanchyn so he decided to negotiate with him .
It seems like they got him after a lengthy persuasion .
Because of their heavy Russian Sambo connections , FMC are looking at signing big name Russian fighters one after one .
Also on the September card , Aleksander Emelianenko vs. Blagoy Alexandre Ivanov is rumored to take place .
DREAM Super Hulk GP participant Jan Nortje has also been announced as a participant of FMC .
Ivan Emelianenko , “ Russia Edition Gina Carano ” Julia Berezikova , Mikhail Malyutin who turned around his career in 2008 , and four Korean names should also appear on their events .
FMC ’s first event will take place on August 15th .
FMC said from the get go that they want to be as big as UFC and PRIDE .
Signing former PRIDE fighters and Emelianenko brothers is a very good idea since both are very popular in Korea .
UFC drawing monster ratings on Korean TV does n’t hurt the interest of MMA there either .
Update :
It seems like FMC ’s second event will be a collaboration event with the annual world martial arts festival , which takes place from September 23rd to 27th .

That ’s right –you once again can have seamless access to your music , photos and videos from the current version of iTunes ( 8.2.1 ) . ” — Palm , July 23 , 2009
Devices “ falsely pretending to be iPods ” can once again sync with iTunes , whether Apple ( AAPL ) likes it or not .
Palm ( PALM ) this evening released an update to the Pre ’s webOS operating system that restores the iTunes syncing ability disabled by its Cupertino rival only last week .
“ Palm has released webOS 1.1 , which , along with offering more robust EAS support for business users , re-enables Palm media sync , ” said company spokesperson Lynn Fox .
“ Palm believes that openness and interoperability offer better experiences for users by allowing them the freedom to use the content they own without interference across devices and services , so on behalf of consumers , we have notified the USB Implementers Forum of what we believe is improper use of the Vendor ID number by another member . ”

" CHICAGO -- The self - proclaimed founding member of a street gang that purports to exert control through use of violence over hardcore punk rock music in clubs and concert venues in major cities nationwide was arrested yesterday by FBI agents in Los Angeles on a federal extortion charge filed in Chicago .
The defendant , Elgin Nathan James , allegedly extorted $ 5,000 from an unnamed victim , a popular recording artist from the Chicago area , while the victim's band was on tour in late 2005 and early 2006 , Patrick J. Fitzgerald , United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , and Robert D. Grant , Special Agent - in - Charge of the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , announced today . " [ FBI ]
The street gang they 're referring to is the notorious straight - edge crew FSU which stands for Friends Stand United , or as most know it ...
Fuck Shit Up ( or as the FBI document refers to it , " F ( _ _ _ ) S ( _ _ _ ) Up " ) .
The charges continue ...
On Nov. 27 , 2005 , the victim and several friends left a bar in Orlando , Fla. , and were jumped by a group of men , some of whom were wearing clothing with logos that said " FSU " and " FSU Nation . "
The victim escaped with one friend .
But another friend and that friend 's brother were severely beaten by the gang , the charges allege .
About an hour later , the victim received a telephone call from James , and according to the victim , James asked how the victim 's trip to Florida was going when the victim had never told James that the victim would be traveling in Florida ...... ..... On Feb. 25 , 2006 , under FBI surveillance , the victim met James outside the southern California club and handed James an envelope containing $ 5,000 , which the FBI had provided to the victim , according to the charges
As stated above , these charges are just coming now - over 3 years after the above incident happened .
Since then Elgin James moved to LA , released a short film starring Fall Out Boy 's Pete Wentz and became a Sundance recognized - filmmaker !

[ Elgin James ] befriended a group of kids from the tough Boston neighborhoods .
They started FSU ... in violent response to the number of Neo - Nazi hate groups on the rise across the country .
FSU was made up of a handful of Irish , Black and Puerto Rican kids .
Since they were usually outnumbered by their ' enemies ' ( Nazis , other street gangs ) they compensated with viciousness .
They would use makeshift weapons such as hammers , Cue balls in a sock and even a human thighbone .
Soon racist skinheads , who had been such a common sight at Boston hardcore and punk rock shows , became scarce .
To date there have been FSU chapters in Boston , New York , Philadelphia , New Jersey , Chicago , Dallas , Portland Maine , Seattle , and Los Angeles .
Despite the group 's anti-racist past , critics frequently accuse FSU members of instigating and perpetuating gang violence .
[ After successfully eliminating ] several Nazi groups ; Elgin turned his attention to drug dealers .
He eschewed the usual passive ideals of straight edge and instead went , in his own words " right after the heart of the enemy , money " .
He would rob drug dealers and then use the money to produce music and film that furthered ' straight edge beliefs ' .

He sleeps under a bridge , washes in a public bathroom and was panhandling for booze money 11 months ago , but now Larry Moore is the best - dressed shoeshine man in the city .
When he gets up from his cardboard mattress , he puts on a coat and tie .
It 's a reminder of how he has turned things around .
In fact , until last week it looked like Moore was going to have saved enough money to rent a room and get off the street for the first time in six years .
But then , in a breathtakingly clueless move , an official for the Department of Public Works told Moore that he has to fork over the money he saved for his first month 's rent to purchase a $ 491 sidewalk vendor permit .
" I had $ 573 ready to go , " Moore said , who needs $ 600 for the rent .
" This tore that up .
But I 've been homeless for six years .
Another six weeks is n't going to kill me . "
The bureaucrat told Moore that she found out about his business after reading about his success in this paper .
Along Market Street , Moore 's supporters are indignant .
Nothing happens when mentally ill men wander the street talking to themselves and drunkards pee in the alleys .
Yet Moore creates a little business out of thin air , builds up a client base , and the city takes nearly every penny he 's earned .
Christine Falvey , spokeswoman for Public Works , said the department 's contact with Moore was meant to be " educational . "
" We certainly do n't want to hamper anyone 's ability to make a living , " Falvey said .
" Our education efforts are actually meant to support that effort by making our streets an enjoyable place for people to visit . "
That is unlikely to mollify Moore 's clients .
" Nothing like kicking someone when they are down , " ranted attorney Loren Lopin , one of Moore 's clients who donated $ 100 to help him get housing .
" I am pissed . "
Moore is nothing if not dutiful .
He attempted to work his way through the byzantine city government channels , although he did n't get much help .
" I guess my gripe is that when the city came by and told him to get his papers in order but could n't tell him how to do it , " said Travis See , who manages the Custom Shop Clothiers on the corner of Market and New Montgomery .
" This lady could n't even tell him which building to go to so he could stand in line and waste all day . "
When Moore found the permit application , he got a money order and headed down to the appropriate department to pay .
But because he did n't have a valid ID card , they would n't take his money .
Could this be any more difficult ?
Moore does n't want to get into city housing , preferring to make it on his own .
But could you blame him if he gave up , kicked back and settled into a life of panhandling , subsidized housing and soup kitchen meals ?
Luckily , Moore has quite a few fans .
Lopin recruited a fellow attorney to donate to the first month 's rent fund .
See lets
Moore keep his shoeshine stand in the store so he does n't have to roll it up from the Bay Bridge exit ramp on Folsom where he sleeps .
Some of them remember Moore from the days when he was pushing a shopping cart down Market Street and holding the door open for customers at McDonald 's on the chance they might hand him a quarter .
" As soon as I got that money I ran down and got a bottle , " he said .
" I took my alcoholism very seriously .
I just got to thinking , why not take this seriously too ?
In 11 1/2 months , I have n't touched a drop . "
He 's turned into a bit of an institution at Market and New Montgomery .
His regulars drop off shoes in the morning and pick them up when they leave the office .
Guests at the Palace Hotel have become clients .
See said Moore has become so popular that panhandlers swipe his brushes and polish because he 's too much competition .
" He 's the best thing to happen to this corner in a long time , " said See .
" It just seems like this process is turning out to be particularly uphill for him . "
The only one who is n't furious about this is Moore .
He insists that city functionaries are giving him a break because they are letting him continue to shine shoes while he waits for a copy of his birth certificate to be sent from Kansas .
Once it arrives they will allow him to get an ID card and then hand over almost every cent he has .
What a deal .
" I 'll do whatever they want , " Moore said .
" But I wo n't jump through no more of those $ 491 hoops .
Those are getting expensive . "
( CNN ) --
The families of two U.S. journalists detained in North Korea made public pleas for their release , as their trial and the threat of years in labor camps loom .
The women , Laura Ling and Euna Lee , are to go on trial Thursday on spying charges .
" Our families have been quiet because the situation is very sensitive , and we 've been really trying to allow diplomacy to take its course , " Lisa Ling , Laura 's sister , said on CNN's " Larry King Live " on Monday night .
" But you know , you 'd have to be hiding under a rock not to see what 's going on in the Korean Peninsula .
" I mean tensions are so heated , " she continued , " and the girls are essentially in the midst of this nuclear standoff . "
Late last month , North Korea conducted nuclear and missile tests , drawing the condemnation of the U.N. Security Council .
" We just felt like it was time for us to talk publicly and try and encourage our two governments to try to communicate , to try and bring our situation to a resolution on humanitarian grounds -- to separate the issues , " said Ling , who is a special correspondent with CNN .
Laura Ling and Lee are reporters for California - based Current TV , the media venture of former U.S. Vice President Al Gore .
The pair was reporting on the plight of North Korean defectors living along the border of China and North Korea when they were taken into custody on March 17 .
North Korea said the reporters had entered the country illegally .
The women were accused of " hostile acts " and charged with spying .
Until now , their families had not commented publicly , citing the sensitive nature of the case .
Contact with the women has been extremely limited .
The Swedish ambassador to North Korea was allowed to see the two journalists Monday , according to the U.S. State Department .
Sweden represents the United States in North Korea because the two countries , which fought on opposite sides during the three - year Korean war in the 1950s , do not have diplomatic relations .
The ambassador also met separately with the two journalists on March 30 and May 15 .
Despite the limited communication , the families say they 've heard enough to know the women are " terrified " and " extremely scared . "
" While I am trying to remain hopeful , each day becomes harder and harder to bear , " Ling wrote in the letter that her husband , Iain Clayton , read on " Larry King Live . "
" I am so lonely and scared .
But baby , thinking of you gives me strength .
You know I can feel you here with me . "

The mounting movement to free the women is reminiscent of the one waged for Roxana Saberi , an American journalist released by Iran last month after originally being sentenced to eight years in prison for espionage .
Lisa Ling made a direct on - air appeal to North Korea in an effort to win the release of her sister and Lee .
" We do n't know the details of what happened on March 17th , but if at any point the girls went into North Korea , then we apologize on their behalf , " Ling said .
" They never intended to do so . "
" We beg your government to allow ( them ) to come home . "

Second , we 're PAYING for these messages .
These little 15 - second waits add up - - bigtime .
If Verizon 's 70 million customers leave or check messages twice a weekday , Verizon rakes in about $ 620 million a year .
That 's your money .
And your time : three hours of your time a year , just sitting there listening to the same message over and over again every year .
In 2007 , I spoke at an international cellular conference in Italy .
The big buzzword was ARPU -- Average Revenue Per User .
The seminars all had titles like , " Maximizing ARPU In a Digital Age . "
And yes , several attendees ( cell executives ) admitted to me , point - blank , that the voicemail instructions exist primarily to make you use up airtime , thereby maximizing ARPU .
Right now , the carriers continue to enjoy their billion - dollar scam only because we 're not organized enough to do anything about it .
But it does n't have to be this way .
You do n't have to sit there , waiting to leave your message , listening to a speech recorded by a third - grade teacher on Ambien .
Let 's push back , and hard .
We want those time - wasting , money - leaking messages eliminated , or at least made optional .
I asked my Twitter followers for help coming up with a war cry , a slogan , to identify this campaign .
They came up with some good ones :
" Where 's the Beep ? "
" Let it Beep "
" We Know . Let 's Go . "
" Lose the Wait "
" My Voicemail , My Recording "
" Hell , no , we wo n't hold ! "
My favorite , though , is the one that sounds like a call to action : " Take Back the Beep . "

( CNN ) -- Former figure skating champion and Olympian Nicole Bobek was free on bond Tuesday after New Jersey police accused her of being part of a drug ring .
Former figure skating champion Nicole Bobek faces drug charges in New Jersey .
Bobek , 31 , who won the U.S. figure skating title in 1995 , was arrested at her home in Jupiter , Florida , last week on a charge of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine in Hudson County , New Jersey , according to Guy Gregory of the Hudson County prosecutor 's office .
She waived extradition rights to face the charges in New Jersey and made her first appearance in court on Monday via video , entering a plea of not guilty , Gregory said .
Bobek was released Monday night on bond , according to Sean Wilkes of the Hudson County Jail .
According to the prosecutor 's office , 20 people have been arrested in connection with the alleged drug ring , which police have been investigating for nearly a year .
Bobek could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted .
Her attorney , Sam DeLuca , was not immediately available for comment .

Remember the great public - private argument ?
The passions it aroused seem to have peaked around five years ago .
Even if some unease about the hiving off of public services prevails , maybe all those acronyms and contractual complexities made it too arcane to compete with broad brush concerns like equality and climate change .
Perhaps the toning down of the zealous pro-private talk that marked the later Blair years has convinced a lot of people that , under Gordon Brown , the great outsourcing drive – despite plenty of contrary evidence – is in retreat .
Despite the canning of mail privatisation and the demise of the London Underground consortium Metronet , another big push now looms .
Austerity is the key .
Even if health and education are protected from cuts , " efficiency savings " in those areas will surely be the aim of whichever party wins the next election – and outside those two sacred services , the 16 % cuts forecast last week by the Institute for Fiscal Studies point towards much more contracting out .
No one , after all , offers help with scything down budgets more enthusiastically than the private companies now jockeying to extend their reach .
In a recent news story in the Financial Times , the chief executive of the services giant Capita said he would be " deeply disappointed " if its take from government does n't double over the next five years , while the boss of the outsourcing empire Serco predicted that dire public finances mean " boundaries will get pushed back further " .
The most jaw - dropping changes will probably hit the penal system , where havoc can be wrought so long as politicians stick to the obligatory tough talk .
If planned private prisons open on schedule and the tendering of jails in the public sector leads to their privatisation , by 2014 , 25 % of prisoners could be the responsibility of private firms – which offer prison officers basic pay about 40 % less than their publicly employed counterparts , are well ahead of the public sector on staff turnover , and score an average of 10 % less on the government 's measure of prisons ' performance .
It apparently matters not .
Should – or when – the Conservatives win the next election , they will sustain this mood , and then some .
Across all three main parties , too many politicians have yet to understand the nightmare thus created : supposed value - for - money being realised via the slashing of wages , corrosion of conditions , and a degraded quality of service ; or the reverse of cash savings , as contracting out creates private monopolies , and companies hailed for their dynamism turn out to be subsidy junkies .
Here is a dependency culture built around vast sums of money .
The mess of contractual intrigue surrounding the health service is a good place to start .
The crazy economics of private finance initiative deals are well known .
Not that it made many headlines , but in 2005 the government finally guaranteed that outsourced " ancillary " staff would be paid the same rates as in - house employees – by forcing NHS trusts to pay private contractors an additional £ 75 m a year .
Now , having put in a freedom of information request , Edinburgh University 's indefatigable Allyson Pollock has shone a light on the " take or pay " contract for Scotland 's only independent sector treatment centre ( ISTC ) , where money is paid by the NHS irrespective of treated cases .
In its first 13 months , operations by the South African firm Netcare accounted for only 32 % of the contract 's annual value – meaning an initial overpayment of up to £ 3 m .
What she infers from this is mind - boggling – given that " take or pay " applies to the 27 " first - wave " English ISTCs , and there is strong evidence of underperformance , the overspend south of the border could reach £ 900m .
Meanwhile , when contractors affect to be " efficient " , down comes the axe .
A report last year from the Department for Business claimed the average saving from outsourcing is about 20 % , but in hospital support services it put the figure as high as 34 % .
In one of its priceless passages , the text claimed that " the evidence on quality change is weaker and more limited than that on cost savings " – but on the ground , the stories pile up .
To have to replay such anecdotes after years of people drawing the obvious conclusions about hospital infections and privatised cleaning is painful , but anyway …
Not long ago , I met two hospital cleaners whose jobs in Bury St Edmunds had been outsourced to a company that blithely cut the workforce in half .
" We were always on about infection in the hospital , " one of them said .
" Instead of four cleaners on the ward , they said , ' We 're going to put it down to two people , but you wo n't have to hoover . '
Effectively , they were saying , ' clean less ' . "
And so to such trifles as democracy , public ethics and accountability .
My favourite public service company is the aforementioned Serco , which grew from specialising in cinema - cleaning to running education authorities , welfare to work schemes , leisure centres , prisons , military support services , the Docklands Light Railway in London , and more – as well as two immigration removal centres , including Bedfordshire 's infamous Yarl 's Wood .
Serco took these over from Group 4 in 2007 , and grabbed headlines thanks to a plan to cut staff numbers by over 50 % .
For the umpteenth time , Yarl 's Wood recently crashed into the news thanks to a bungled deportation of a Sudanese family , in contravention of a ministerial intervention , and a hunger strike and sit - in allegedly met with a brutal response by staff .
Should you want to shine a light on what happens there , you 're likely to be frustrated by the blanket of " commercial confidentiality " that covers no end of outsourced services .
In June , there was a flurry of optimism about the extension of the Freedom of Information Act , and that it might apply to private prisons and detention centres .
But this month , the justice secretary , Jack Straw , announced private contractors would still lie beyond its reach .
Here is the prospect of an expanding shadow state , whose soaking - up of the government 's traditional responsibilities has not only financial benefits , but can remove troublesome matters from scrutiny .
The prospect of more private prisons underlines warnings that contracting - out will soon threaten control of policy .
If a future government finally sees the light and decides to reduce Britain 's prison population , it will find the obligation to maintain plenty of big jails contractually locked down .
Worse , now that the outsourcing of probation is reportedly back on the agenda , the hiving - off of crucial links in the judicial and penal chain to firms that already run prisons threatens to result in insane conflicts of interest .
When the then home secretary Charles Clarke floated the idea in 2005 , the National Association of Probation Officers warned of " the absurd situation of Group 4 … writing court reports and recommending prison to boost numbers " .
At the time , such warnings seemed to be heeded .
But now ?
Here , anyway , is what increasingly seems to be the future : slick corporate logos flashing from prisons , hospitals , schools , detention centres , defence facilities , police stations and more , and a cut - price society pitched somewhere between Margaret Thatcher and Philip K Dick .
Real - life dystopias , let us not forget , tend to arrive by stealth ; whatever the political fashion , we need to start talking about all this again – and fast .
Unlike drug makers , which must demonstrate that a drug is safe and effective before the agency approves it for sale to the public , dietary supplements are a largely self - regulating industry .
Manufacturers of such products are themselves responsible for the safety and effectiveness and marketing claims of their products , and for voluntarily recalling them if problems arise .
The F.D.A. has authority to act only after it has received reports of serious health problems associated with products already on sale and it is able to prove a serious health hazard .
If a company refuses to voluntarily recall problem products , the agency can then file an injunction and seize the products .
Image Tren Xtreme and Mass Xtreme are among the eight supplements cited by the F.D.A. as containing steroidlike substances .
Such a reactive strategy puts consumers at risk , critics said .
“ I applaud what the F.D.A. is doing , but the law handcuffs their hands behind their backs when they are dealing with the tsunami of products that get on the shelves , ” said Mr. Tygart , the antidoping official .
“ This shows a glaring light on the ineffective regulatory scheme that allows these products to get to the market . ”
He added : “ The reality is that these products are still out , and consumers who do n’t hear or read about the warning will continue to use them because it ’s so hard to recall them . ”
Over the last two years , the F.D.A. has received 15 reports of serious health problems  including stroke , liver problems and pulmonary embolism  associated with body - building products from various makers , the agency said .
One of the five reports connected to American Cellular products concerned a 38 - year - old man who had severe liver and kidney problems that needed to be treated with dialysis after he used the company ’s products , according to warrants issued in the case .
Steroids are organic compounds , like hormones or cholesterol , that naturally occur in the body .
Some compounds called anabolic androgenic steroids , which affect both the metabolism and the endocrine system , are approved as drugs to treat medical problems like testosterone deficiencies .
But the F.D.A. ’s action pertains to unapproved forms of synthetic steroids  popularly known as designer steroids because they are intended to evade detection by sports authorities who test athletes for performance - enhancing drugs .
Hi , I ’m Mark Nottingham .
I currently co-chair the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups , and am a member of the Internet Architecture Board .
I usually write here about the Web , protocol design , HTTP , and caching .

Opera Turbo
HTTP performance is a hot topic these days , so it ’s interesting that Opera has announced a “ turbo ” feature in Opera 10 Beta ;
Ever felt a Web site was loading slowly ?
Do you think it will happen again ?
Think again : Opera Turbo is a compression technology that provides significant improvements in browsing speeds over limited - bandwidth connections like a crowded Wi -Fi in a cafe or browsing through your mobile phone while commuting .
They go on to give more details in their sales materials as well as a blog entry ( both found by a search engine , not linked from the feature description ) :
That ’s why we ’ve been working on Opera Turbo , a server - side optimization and compression technology that provides significant improvements in browsing speeds over limited - bandwidth connections by compressing network traffic .
This does not only make you surf faster , but also lowers the cost of browsing when you are on a pay per usage plan .
Note the use of “ server - side ” here .
The interesting thing here is that when I turn on Turbo and sniff the network to see what ’s going on , all of my connections seem to go to a server like this :
Macintosh : ~> nslookup 064.255.180.252 Server : 192.168.1.254 Address : 192.168.1.254#53 ** server can't find 064.255.180.252 : NXDOMAIN Macintosh :~> nslookup 64.255.180.252 Server : 192.168.1.254 Address : 192.168.1.254#53 Non-authoritative answer : 252.180.255.64.in-addr.arpa canonical name = 252.0-24.180.255.64.in-addr.arpa .
252.0-24.180.255.64.in-addr.arpa name = global - turbo-1-lvs-usa.opera-mini.net .
In other words , this is n’t a “ server - side ” technology ; it ’s a proxy .
From a technical standpoint , this is an interesting approach ; intermediation is a great way to introduce new features into the request stream ( here , they ’re compressing content and stripping headers , by the look of it ) .
However , I ’m in Australia , and they ’re sending all of my requests — even for Australian content — through a US proxy , which adds several hundred milliseconds to every request , and depending on my provider , may cost me more ( some AU providers make local content free ) .
Considering that the people who this technology ’s marketing will appeal to most — e.g. , those in the Australian bush , or rural India — wo n’t be served well by this , it seems like it would be important to point this out .
More damningly , a quick test shows that Turbo ’s proxy does n’t honour the Cache - Control : no-transform directive , and moreover , strips it from responses .
no -transform is specified to assure that clients and servers have a way of avoiding problems with transcoding proxies — just like Turbo ( emphasis added ) :
no - transform
Implementors of intermediate caches ( proxies ) have found it useful to convert the media type of certain entity bodies .
A non- transparent proxy might , for example , convert between image formats in order to save cache space or to reduce the amount of traffic on a slow link .
Serious operational problems occur , however , when these transformations are applied to entity bodies intended for certain kinds of applications .
For example , applications for medical imaging , scientific data analysis and those using end - to - end authentication , all depend on receiving an entity body that is bit for bit identical to the original entity - body .
Therefore , if a message includes the no-transform directive , an intermediate cache or proxy MUST NOT change those headers that are listed in section 13.5.2 as being subject to the no-transform directive .
This implies that the cache or proxy MUST NOT change any aspect of the entity - body that is specified by these headers , including the value of the entity - body itself .
To put it mildly , this is disappointing , given Opera ’s historical focus on standards compliance .
From a privacy standpoint , it gets worse .
Calling this a server - side technology is frankly unconscionable .
A reasonable person who reads the blurb and follows the in - browser instructions will have no idea that their requests are being routed through Opera , and no disclosure is made about what is done with that data .
I ’m a little surprised by this , considering that Opera is an EU - based company , and therefore subject to the European Data Protection laws .
It is worth noting that in their blog entry ( which again , has to be found separately ) , they do say
Your privacy is important Even when Turbo is enabled , encrypted traffic does not go through our compression servers .
This means that when you are on a SSL site , we bypass these traffic and let you communicate with the SSL site directly .
Opera generates statistics of the usage of Opera Turbo , but these are aggregated numbers and no information can be linked to a single user .
Opera does not store any users ’ private information .
So , their heart is in the right place , but this does n’t make up for not informing users up - front .
Yahoo's ( YHOO ) search deal with Microsoft ( MSFT ) looks like a big logistical and regulatory mess .
But years from now , at least Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer will be able to remember the morning that they got up early , held a conference call , and signed the " deal " with a huge purple pen .

A novel , glass - like form of carbon dioxide has been created in the laboratory by Italian scientists .
The discovery could shed light on the way CO 2 behaves under pressure inside planets and might one day find useful technological applications .
Under extreme pressures the researchers found that CO 2 forms a solid dubbed “ amorphous carbonia ” ( a - CO 2 ) .
The substance was created by Federico Gorelli and Mario Santoro at the European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy , based in Florence , Italy .
Carbon is a member of the same chemical group as silicon and germanium – elements that form solids when combined with oxygen .
Silicon , for example , becomes silicon dioxide , which is used to make normal window glass .

Carbon , by contrast , combines with oxygen under normal conditions to produce CO 2 gas .
It only solidifies , into so - called “ dry ice ” , when cooled to low temperature and subjected to increased pressure .
Piled on pressure
But by subjecting CO 2 to even greater pressures – 400,000 to 500,000 atmospheres ( 40 to 50 gigaPascals ) – the researchers created a novel , solid material .
The CO 2 molecules react to these conditions by forming a chaotic structure with oxygen molecules .
The resulting material is transparent , tough , and has an atomic structure resembling that of ordinary window glass .
At present a - CO 2 cannot exist outside of a pressure chamber as it reverts to normal CO 2 with decompression .
If it can somehow be made to remain solid under normal conditions , however , experts predict amorphous carbonia could have a range of applications .
“ Carbonia - based minerals and glasses could give rise to useful technological materials , ” says Paul McMillan , a chemist at University College London , UK .
He suggests , for example , that the material ’s unusual optical properties could prove useful in a laser .
McMillan , who was not involved with the project , says the work could even lead to new , less environmentally harmful ways to dispose of CO 2 .
He adds that it will help geochemists simulate conditions found inside planets :
“ These findings will also help set the rules for understanding structure , bonding and thermodynamic properties as we move our experiments into the high - pressure , high temperature conditions mimicking those deep inside planets , ” he says .

15 Signs You Might Be Stranger Than You Think
Posted : 11:02 AM ET
Some links to a video of an ESPN reporter undressing in her hotel room carry a computer virus , according to a security analyst .
Graham Cluley , a senior technology consultant at Sophos , a computer security company , told CNN that the viral video of Erin Andrews gives hackers an opportunity to compromise Mac and PC machines .
Someone reportedly shot the video of Andrews through her hotel room 's peephole .
A lawyer for Andrews says the reporter - voted " America 's Sexiest Sportscaster " last year by Playboy magazine - was unaware she was being taped , according to CNN affiliate WESH .
" There was a genuinely huge news story about this poor woman who had been filmed this way , and the hackers jumped on that and thought , ' Fantastic , everyone is going to be looking for this , let ’s create fake Web sites and infect them , ' " Cluley said .
It 's unclear how many people have been infected with the virus or if computers have been harmed by the incident , Cluley said .
The virus gets on computers when people try to play the video of Andrews , he said .
A message asks Internet users to download a video player and a virus instead infects their machines , he said .
The virus gives hackers the ability to do just about whatever they want with your computer , Cluley said .
Searches for the naked video of Andrews were spiking this morning on Google , according to Google Trends .
The two hottest searches on the site are related to the video .
Cluley urged people not to look for the clip .
" If you want to look at naked women buy yourself an adult magazine or go and get yourself a girlfriend , " he said .
" Searching on the Web is a really dangerous thing to do . "
Writing for CNET , a CNN.com content partner , Chris Matyszczyk says the video first was uploaded to the French site DailyMotion .fr .
" Naturally , it then wandered across the Internet like a rodent in search of Camembert , " he writes .
The video is flying across the Web on social networks , Cluley said , adding that shortened Web links , such as those from tinyurl.com and bit.ly , add to the problem because Internet users can't tell where the links go until they click them .
Firefox users can download a longurl add - on to address that problem , he said .
What do you all make of this incident ?
Any security tips ?
Feel free to chime in with comments .

ところで、アルゴリズムによって編集距離が微妙に違ってくるが、これは仕方がないことなのかなぁ。
編集距離を求めるもっとも一般的なアルゴリズムは、動的計画法(dynamic programming ) だろう。計算時間 はO( mn ) であり、手軽だ。C++で書いたコードを下に示す。尚、コード中に出てくる定数SIZEは扱う文字列にあわせて適当に決めておく。動的にメモリを確保することもできるが処理が遅くなるので、あらかじめ決め打ちしておく方が効率がよい。(2009/7/8 ) : コメントで指摘を受けたので、O(ND )/O( NP )アルゴリズムについて調べたところ、挿入と削除のみを使った操作の最小数(論文中ではshortest edit " script " ) を求めるアルゴリズムだった。つまり、置換は削除・挿入の2手順になる。上記の動的計画法の三項演算子の部分を、からと変更すれば同じ操作数を求めることができる。次に、O(ND)アルゴリズムを示す。Nは2つの要素数(m , n)の合計、Dは編集距離になる。つまり、編集距離が少なければ少ないほど高速に計算されるわけだ。原著論文は、
E. W. Myers . An O( ND ) difference algorithm and its variations .
Algorithmica , 1 , 251-266 ( 1986 ) で、日本語による解説では、後述のO( NP ) アルゴリズムとともに、 文書比較アルゴリズム が参考になる。以下にコードを示す。O( ND ) をさらに改良したアルゴリズムが、O(NP)アルゴリズムとなる。Pは、m , n ( m >= n)をそれぞれ要素数とした場合、P=(D-(m-n))/2で表される。経験的にはO(ND)の半分ほどになるらしい。原著論文は、
S. Wu , U. Manber , and G. Myers .
An O( NP ) sequence comparison algorithm .
Information Processing Letter . 35 (6 ) 317-332 ( 1990 ) だ。以下にコードを示す。最後にビットパラレル( bit-parallel)法を示す。これは動的計画法を応用しており、ビット演算を利用することで並列処理が可能となり、O(m/w n)で計算ができる。ここでwはワード長を示す。つまり、要素数mがワード長wと同じかそれ以下ならO(n)で計算ができることになり、非常に高速に処理ができる。原著論文は、
G. Myers .
A fast bit-vector algorithm for approximate string matching based on dynamic progamming .
JACM , 46(3 ) 395-415 , ( 1999 ) である。以下にコードを示す。ついでに、C++のbitsetを利用して、何ビットでも演算できるようにしてみた。bitsetではほとんどの場合、通常のビット演算が可能なので、コードは上記のコードとあまり変わらない。ただ、足し算の演算が用意されていないので、演算子オーバーロードでoperator+()
を用意した。もっとも、bitsetの利用はビット演算の高速処理が失われるのであまり意味はないかもしれない。コードは以下の通り。さて、これらのアルゴリズムがどれほどの速度で、どれだけの差があるのか、実際に計測してみた。環境は、Windows XP 、Intel Core2 6600@2.4 GHz、RAM
2GBで、"cl edist_test.cpp /EHsc /O2"としてコンパイルした。結果は以下の通りで、ビット長以下の文字列長ではやはりビットパラレル法が最も速い。今回の結果では動的計画法の20分の1以下の時間で計算が完了した。次いでO(NP)となり、O( ND )、動的計画法の順で遅くなった。遅いと云えばbitsetを利用したビットパラレル法も遅かったがそれでも動的計画法よりは速かった。また、文字列長やその組み合わせによって速度は大きく変わるので、今回の結果はそれらの一例として考えてもらいたい。因みに、文字列はDNAの塩基配列(acgt)となっている。参考までに、測定に用いたコードを示しておく。上でも書いたが、一操作を「挿入、削除、置換」とするか(動的計画法、ビットパラレル法 ) 、
「 挿入、削除」にするか( O( ND ) / O( NP ) アルゴリズム)の違いだった。いくつかのバグと一緒に修正しておいた。

The other side of the equation to free market enterprise and self - regulation is not the sole reliance on regulation by agency or governmental bureau , but robust , legally enforceable , generous ' whistle blower ' rewards and protections .
This is the self - serving equivalency of the personal gain incentive versus corporate , share holder , greed incentives .
Both sides of the equation then appear equal .
Corporate entity , step out of line ?
Someone in YOUR organization , who knows the rules of the game , will be finely rewarded to show the error of your ways .
Sleazy ?
Sure .
But , apparently , that is how the game is played .
You , corporate America , lobbied and made the rules .
Now , live by them .
Sorry if this solution seems like a simplistic solution and rather morally sleazy ... but hey , right or left , corporate America , this is the standard you live by and promote as solutions across the board to almost every issue , but only , if the solution is to YOUR benefit .
Live by the gun , die by the gun .
You know , it 's the 'eye for an eye ' thingy .
Thanks ,
While it ’s been long thought that colors can affect our mood and productivity , what about scents ?
Can filling a room with a specific scent help you focus or work more productively ?
I can understand that some of you might be skeptical .
I was at first too , but office aromatherapy has been effective at helping me get through the work day for years .
I ’ve always been a fan of aromatherapy , surrounding myself with candles , incense , and scented oils .
I work at home , so I can alter the scents around me at any time without worrying about upsetting other employees .
I knew two scents in particular had an effect on me–pine and pumpkin .
I tended to be more alert when I burned pine candles ( they would help me get through afternoon lulls for instance ) .
Pumpkin was a scent that relaxed me , so I often burned those candles in the evening .
There was Something to This Scent Thing
I did n’t really think much about it .
I just burned certain candles when I felt certain ways .
But one day I came across a news article .
It discussed a Japanese study on pine scent and productivity .
In essence , the researchers evaluated the productivity of employees with and without pine scent being put through the office ventilation system , and they found that employees worked more productively with a light pine scent in the air .
It interested me to see my own casual experiences backed up by a study , so I started experimenting with other scents in my own work life as well as researching the effects commonly associated with various scents in aromatherapy .
At that point , I started making more conscious decisions about what scents to burn when I was working .
I could barely get through the afternoon hours without a pine candle burning .
Another scent that ultimately worked for me was cinnamon .
I found that cinnamon incense helped me focus better on creative projects ( even though it ’s a scent I do n’t typically enjoy ) .
The key was experimentation .
While some scents have common associations , they may not affect everyone in the same way .
Try a few yourself ( if you ’re able to ) , and see how your mood and productivity change .
To help you get started , here are some scents and the effects they ’re commonly believed to have in aromatherapy :
Pine –
To increase alertness
Cinnamon –
To improve focus
Lavender –
To relax during a stressful work day
Peppermint – Another scent thought to perk you up
Citrus ( any ) –
To wake you up ( another scent when you need to be more alert )
These are some of the more readily available scents that would have a potentially positive effect in the workplace .
You can certainly experiment with others to find out which make for the most appealing work environment for you .
Aromatherapy in the Workplace Without Offending Others
If you work in an office with other employees , you probably wo n’t be permitted to burn candles or incense .
You also may upset coworkers if you ’re releasing any kind of strong scent into the shared workspace ( such as through scented oils ) .
However , there are a few options you can try that wo n’t create an overpowering aroma , but which you still might find effective .
Give these ideas a try :
Scented oil on a cotton ball –
Put a few drops of a scented oil onto a cotton ball and tuck it in a desk drawer or somewhere out of the way on your desk .
Just do n’t use too much oil , and you can avoid an overpowering aroma coming from your work area .
You could do the same with a lightly scented sachet .
Aromatic plants –
If you ’re allowed to keep a small plant on your desk , it could be a solution .
For example , if you have a stressful job you might want to keep a small pot of lavender .
Terra cotta with scented oil – Even if you keep a non-aromatic plant on your desk , try to keep it in a terra cotta pot ( or keep a small terra cotta plate or ornament around ) .
Put a few drops of scented oil on it .
The terra cotta absorbs the oil , dispersing the scent slowly as it eventually dries .
Try to be sensitive to your employees or coworkers if you decide to experiment with scents in a populated workplace .
A scent that affects you positively may annoy someone else , and there ’s always a possibility that someone will have an allergy to a plant or specific oil .
Always get your employer ’s permission to use aromatherapy in the workplace .
Otherwise you may need more than the right scent to improve your or your colleagues ’ moods .

TEHRAN , Iran – Iranian state television says 13 people were killed in violent clashes between police and what they call " terrorist groups . "
The report did not specify how the deaths occurred , but state television reported earlier that several people were killed Saturday when " rioters " attacked a mosque in western Tehran .
Sunday 's report on Iran 's official English language station said " rioters " set two gas stations on fire and attacked a military post .
Iran 's capital was wracked by violence Saturday as security forces clashed with supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims he won the June 12 presidential election .
The report was the second confirmation of deaths since unrest began .
State media said seven people were killed early in the week .
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE .

AP 's earlier story is below .
TEHRAN , Iran ( AP ) — Iranian state television says several people were killed when " rioters " attacked a mosque in western Tehran .
The report was the first confirmation of deaths during violent clashes Saturday between police and supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi , who claims he won the June 12 presidential election .
Sunday 's report did not specify how many people were killed .
Also Sunday , Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki criticized Britain , France and Germany for raising concern about reports of voting irregularities in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's victory .
Mottaki criticized France for taking " treacherous and unjust approaches " and said Britain " has always created problems " in relations between countries .

If a new research is anything to go by , automobile owners around the world may some day soon be driving on tires that are partly made out of trees , which could cost less , perform better and save on fuel and energy .
In the research , wood science researchers at Oregon State University ( OSU ) , US , made some surprising findings about the potential of microcrystalline cellulose – a product that can be made easily from almost any type of plant fibres – to partially replace silica as , a reinforcing filler in the manufacture of rubber tires .
A new study suggests that this approach might decrease the energy required to produce the tire , reduce costs , and better resist heat build up .
Early tests indicate that such products would have comparable traction on cold or wet pavement , be just as strong , and provide even higher fuel efficiency than traditional tires in hot weather .
“ We were surprised at how favourable the results were for the use of this material , ” said Kaichang Li , an associate professor of wood science and engineering in the OSU College of Forestry , who conducted this research with graduate student Wen Bai .
“ This could lead to a new generation ofautomotive tire technology , one of the first fundamental changes to come around in a long time , ” Li said .
Cellulose fibre has been used for some time as reinforcement in some types of rubber and automotive products , such as belts , hoses and insulation – but never in tires , where the preferred fillers are carbon black and silica .
Carbon black , however , is made from increasingly expensive oil , and the processing of silica is energy - intensive .
Both products are very dense and reduce the fuel efficiency of automobiles .
In the search for new types of reinforcing fillers that are inexpensive , easily available , light and renewable , OSU experts turned to microcrystalline cellulose – a micrometer - sized type of crystalline cellulose with an extremely well - organized structure .
It is produced in a low - cost process of acid hydrolysis using nature ’s most abundant and sustainable natural polymer – cellulose – that comprises about 40 - 50 percent of wood .
In this study , OSU researchers replaced up to about 12 percent of the silica used in conventional tire manufacture .
This decreased the amount of energy needed to compound the rubber composite , improved the heat resistance of the product , and retained tensile strength .
At high temperatures such as in summer , the partial replacement of silica decreased the rolling resistance of the product , which would improve fuel efficiency of rubber tires made with the new approach .

Advertisement Some mosques in the western Chinese city of Urumqi have opened their doors to worshippers , in spite of an earlier order for them to stay closed .
At least two mosques opened after crowds gathered outside .
It was not immediately clear if the authorities had sanctioned the move .
Urumqi , capital of the Xinjiang region , remains tense after days of ethnic violence that left 156 people dead .
Thousands of people are reportedly trying to leave the city .
The main bus station has seen 10,000 people go through its doors in recent days - double its normal traffic - an official there said .
Both Han Chinese and Muslim Uighurs are said to be fleeing the city , which still has a heavy security presence following the violence that began on Sunday .
Crowds gather Officials posted notices outside Urumqi's mosques , instructing people to stay at home to worship on Friday , the holiest day of the week in Islam .
I 'm glad they are letting us in today .
There would have been a lot of unhappiness if they had n't

One official told the Associated Press the decision was made " for the sake of public safety " .
But hundreds of Uighurs defied the order and gathered outside at least two mosques in the city .
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville , outside one of the mosques , was told by one worshipper that they had insisted they be allowed in - and the gates were opened without any resistance or violence .
" We decided to open the mosque because so many people had gathered .
We did not want an incident , " a policeman outside the White Mosque in a Uighur neighbourhood told the Associated Press .
" I 'm glad they are letting us in today , " one worshipper , Ahmedadji , was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying .
" There would have been a lot of unhappiness if they had n't " .
' Too risky '
Meanwhile , the city 's main bus station is reported to be heaving with people trying to escape the unrest .
Extra bus services have been laid on and touts are charging up to five times the normal face price for tickets , the AFP reports .

We are scared of the violence , " a 23 - year - old construction worker from central China said .
Many are university students , who have been told to leave the city earlier than they might have planned .
The violence began on Sunday when Uighurs rallied to protest against a deadly brawl between Uighurs and Han several weeks ago in a toy factory in southern Guangdong province .
Officials say 156 people - mostly Han - died in Sunday 's violence .
Ethnic
Han vigilante groups have been threatening to take revenge , leaving many Uighurs afraid to leave their homes .
The atmosphere remains tense , with troops in place across the city and armed police surrounding Uighur neighbourhoods , says our correspondent .
More than 1,400 people are thought to have been detained .
On Thursday , China said it had " a great deal of evidence " that some of those involved in the violence had " training from foreign terrorist groups including al - Qaeda " .
Foreign ministry official Qin Gang did not say what the evidence was , but said the groups were " inextricably linked with three vicious forces from abroad " .
Beijing has also accused US - based Uighur leader - in - exile Rebiya Kadeer of organising the disorder .
She has denied the allegations .
Tensions have been growing in Xinjiang for many years , as Han migrants have poured into the region , where the Uighur minority is concentrated .
Many Uighurs feel economic growth has bypassed them and complain of discrimination and diminished opportunities .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- House Democrats ' push on health care legislation hit a snag Thursday when a group of fiscally conservative Democrats , known as " Blue Dogs , " put on the brakes , pressing the Democratic leadership for significant changes to the draft bill .
Rep . Mike Ross , D - Arkansas , is a leading negotiator for the Blue Dog Coalition on health care .
As the Democratic leaders worked feverishly to finalize details of the legislation for a planned Friday rollout , the Blue Dog Coalition sent a letter late Thursday night saying the bill " lacks a number of elements essential to preserving what works and fixing what is broken . "
Forty of the group 's 52 members of the group signed the letter , making it clear that a major block of the House Democratic caucus wanted some concessions in order to get their votes .
Shortly after the letter 's release , a group of the Blue Dogs huddled in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's office with other leaders for nearly two hours .
Arkansas Democratic Congressman Mike Ross , a leading negotiator for the Blue Dogs on health care , told reporters he , Rep. John Tanner , D - Tennessee , and Rep. Allen Boyd , D - Florida , also met with White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel on Wednesday to go over their concerns .
" The message to him was the same as to the leadership -- that we could not support the current bill , " Ross said .
Boyd told CNN that no deals were struck Thursday night , but that the group agreed to meet with House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman , Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel and Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller , on Friday .
Boyd and other members representing rural areas pushed leaders to adjust the rates that rural doctors and hospitals are paid by Medicare for health care services .
" From a practical standpoint in terms of a timeline , a bill does n't come into the House chamber until you got the votes to pass it , and I do n't think they have the votes to pass it at this point .
We 've got to try to get to point where we 're comfortable , " Boyd said .
Pelosi repeated her pledge earlier Thursday that a government run health care plan would be included in the House bill .
Ross said conservative Democrats have major reservations about how a public option would work .
In the letter and in the meeting , the conservative Democrats stressed they did not want a " Medicare - like " structure for a public option .
" What we are saying is if there is a public option , it can't be based on Medicare rates unless the regional disparity in Medicare rates is fixed , " said Ross , who also planned to press for more controls on government spending on healthcare and more savings from changes to Medicare .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer waved off any suggestions that the development Thursday night was a setback .
" Let me make it very clear that everybody in that room thinks we ought to pass health care , " Hoyer said .
But he also acknowledged that they still need to work through the details .
All About U.S. House of Representatives • Health Care Policy
Over the past eight years , providing for the security of the United States has become a huge business , funded by taxpayers at the federal , state , and local level .
Thousands if not hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on the continued perception that there exists a vast alien menace that must be guarded against at all costs lest there be another 9/11 .
Voices suggesting that the threat is being overstated and even intentionally misrepresented are few and far between , but in reality the contention that groups are ready , willing , and able to stage an attack or even a series of terrorist attacks that would do serious damage to the United States is extremely questionable .
The few terrorist convictions obtained in the US since 9/11 have the air of a comic opera , with bizarre plots by pizza deliverymen and paint gunners exposed by agents provocateur inserted in their midst by the FBI .
If , as Osama bin Laden has sometimes asserted , the way to destroy the United States is by crippling its economy , then one can argue that the terrorists are already winning .
Hundreds of billions of dollars that could be used productively are being wasted every year in the endless war on terror while the United States sinks ever deeper into a sea of debt .
To be sure , with so many vested interests desperately wanting the money spigot to remain open , there is no shortage of propaganda and propagandists ready willing and able to tell the American people just how bad the terrorist threat is .
To help the cause along , everyone who might be regarded as a terrorist by anyone anywhere has been thrown into the hopper , with the United States government declaring universal and unending war .
Anyone who has studied the terrorism problem realizes that terrorists come in all sizes , shapes , and flavors .
The lumping together of all of them is more a political phenomenon than a practical response to the threat that they do pose .
George W. Bush ’s so - called " global war on terrorism " was an ill conceived rallying cry to extirpate all terrorists everywhere , but it was from the beginning highly selective .
Lethal terrorists in Sri Lanka , Kashmir , and in the Kurdish region of Iraq never received much attention while groups like Hezbollah and Hamas , that do not threaten the United States at all , seemed to be the object of disproportionate concern .
Given limited resources , even for the world ’s only remaining superpower , Bush should have triangulated the terrorism problem and focused all of the US efforts on the few groups that truly have an international reach and might be able to carry out terrorist attacks in America and Europe .
Most prominent among those groups is al - Qaeda , still ensconced along the Pakistan - Afghanistan border and still plotting attacks , if our intelligence services are to be believed .
That al - Qaeda is still in business is an indictment of the entire approach taken by the US government over the past eight years .
There is no sign that anything will change under President Barack Obama , though to be fair he inherited the mess that he must now try to clean up .
The drumbeat that terrorists are everywhere and that all terrorists are America ’s problem continues .
One of the most recurrent themes is that Hezbollah is the " A - team " of terrorist groups , far exceeding al - Qaeda in its proficiency and lethality .
This view was first posited in 2003 by deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage .
It was jumped on by Florida Democrat Senator Bob Graham , who was running for president at the time .
Graham said " It has a significant presence of its trained operatives inside the United States waiting for the call to action .
They are a violent terrorist group .
And they have demonstrated throughout their now 25 - year history a hatred of the United States and a willingness to kill our people . "
Graham did not provide a scintilla of evidence to support his assertion that the US is awash with Hezbollah operatives , information that might have proven to be of interest to the FBI if it were true .
The Hezbollah threat warnings have surfaced again , more recently , in a speech given by Richard Falkenrath , New York City ’s Deputy Commissioner for Counterterrorism .
Falkenrath is a Bush - Cheney homeland security product who has impressive credentials though one might note that he has always held what might be described as staff positions and has never actually worked directly against terrorists or terrorist targets .
Speaking at the AIPAC - founded Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP ) at the end of June , Falkenrath said that Hezbollah could " hit the US harder than al - Qaeda , " though he also noted that it has " more or less decided not to attack the United States interests directly in the continental United States at all . "
He added : " They would have too much heat on them if they did attack the United States , and they can accomplish most of their interests without it . "
The only situations in which Hezbollah would likely attack the United States , according to Falkenrath , is if the US were to take military action against either Iran or Hezbollah itself .
The remarks are similar to statements made by President Bush ’s Department of Homeland Security director Michael Chertoff who warned in briefings that the group ’s military capabilities are far ahead of those of al - Qaeda .
In a forthcoming memoir Chertoff has reportedly written " Al - Qaeda and its network are our most serious immediate threat , ( but ) they may not be our most serious long - term threat .
Having operated for more than a quarter - century , ( Hezbollah ) has developed capabilities that al - Qaeda can only dream of , including large quantities of missiles and highly sophisticated explosives . "
Wading through the fluff , the statements both by Falkenrath and Chertoff are clearly intended to depict Hezbollah as potentially the number one terrorist threat against the United States .
But exactly what kind of threat would that be and is the assertion itself credible ?
Hezbollah does not fit most definitions of a terrorist group .
It is a legal political party in Lebanon that controls a conventional guerrilla force .
It has only attacked the United States directly once , when US forces were in Beirut in 1983 .
Hezbollah was behind the bombing of the Marine barracks that killed 241 , reportedly in retaliation for a devastating shelling by the battleship New Jersey .
Apart from that , the group is locally focused on Lebanon and Israel and has no specific anti-American agenda .
Both Falkenrath and Chertoff concede that Hezbollah is not currently targeting the United States , though they suggest that could easily change .
One wonders what exactly Chertoff has in mind for the longer term Hezbollah threat .
Does he expect the group ’s trained guerrillas to use the missiles and explosives that they admittedly have to attack New York ?
It might be difficult to move the ordnance out of Lebanon and across the Atlantic Ocean .
Chertoff knows perfectly well that Hezbollah has no interest in the United States and threatens only Israel .
Likewise Falkenrath admits that the group has made the political decision not to operate against the United States unless Washington decides to attack Iran or Hezbollah itself .
Falkenrath might be forgiven for having a US - centric view of the world because that is how he makes his living , but anyone else might not be too surprised to discover that if you attack someone they might think of striking back .
That used to be referred to by a number of expressions that were not particularly pejorative , including deterrence and defense .
Someone should tell Falkenrath that if you want to avoid being counter - attacked you avoid initiating hostilities in the first place .
What Falkenrath and Chertoff are really doing is basing their analysis on the Bush Administration doctrine which basically accepted that all Israel ’s enemies are also the enemies of the United States because all terrorists are indistinguishable .
That is manifestly untrue and it is perhaps time to put the genie back in the bottle .
High officials who are in the counter - terrorism business should not be blamed for their prejudices on the issue of terrorism as they have made careers out of hyping all terrorists all the time .
There are indeed terrorists out there and some of them are quite likely able and willing to stage attacks against the United States , though it is reasonable to assume that the scale of the threat has been deliberately and consistently overstated .
Hezbollah is not a terrorist group with a global reach or with any evident ambitions to expand its activities .
If Chertoff and Falkenrath have any hard evidence that there is a threat to the US homeland posed by heavily armed guerrillas in Lebanon they have certainly not made much of a convincing case .
President Obama would be well advised to ask his terrorism advisers some hard questions to determine how many of the threats that America is reportedly confronted by are real and how many are bogus .

Stories of personal struggles to find affordable healthcare spilled out across the country this week in street - corner picketing , petition drives and rallies , as supporters of President Barack Obama ’s healthcare overhaul sought to counter what they fear is a weakening in the reform efforts in the U.S. Congress .
Their concern was that the so - called public option -- a government - run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers and possibly be more affordable and accessible -- may not survive in Washington .
“ They seem to be backing off on the public option , ” said David Quinly of Prairie Village , Kansas , who joined a group of about 40 protesters to picket outside the Kansas City office of U.S. Senator Sam Brownback , a Kansas Republican .
On Thursday alone , more than 150 similar demonstrations were held in communities around the United States , including outside U.S. senators ’ local offices in Minnesota , Georgia , Texas , Virginia , according to Justin Ruben , executive director of the MoveOn. org , the progressive political action group that organized the activities .
More grassroots events are planned in the next two weeks , he said , which coincides with expected intense activity on a drafting healthcare overhaul in Congress .
“ Our big focus is on making sure senators over the next few weeks ... are hearing from the public on the need for a strong public option , ” said Ruben .
Obama has made overhaul of the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare system his major policy goal and is pushing for a plan that would rein in costs and cover most of the roughly 46 million uninsured Americans .
BLUE DOGS
The public option is a key component of Obama ’s plan , but sharp opposition from the insurance industry and from a group of fiscally conservative House of Representatives Democrats , known as the Democratic Blue Dog Coalition , has threatened the viability of that provision .
“ It is the most provocative component of reform other than cost ... and it probably wo n’t carry the day , ” said William Peck , director of the Center for Health Policy at Washington University in St. Louis .
Critics argue a government - run plan could have an unfair advantage over private , for - profit players and could eventually squeeze private companies out of the market .
Forty of the 52 - member Blue Dog Democrats sent a letter Thursday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressing reservations about public option , which they said could hurt small hospitals and doctors by not providing adequate payments or forcing them to participate .
One alternative may be picking up steam .
Acknowledging the opposition to government - run health insurance plan , Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid , and Democratic Senator Charles Schumer , said this week they are amenable to the creation of a non-government member - owned health cooperative .
But that was n’t sitting well with people like William McEachen , whose 40 - year - old disabled daughter has struggled for years to obtain coverage for extensive medical needs .
Holding a sign declaring “ I want a public option , ” on a busy street corner in Overland Park , Kansas , McEachen joined Cook , Phipps and others to give Brownback ’s office a petition urging the senator to get behind the government - run option .
“ What we want is the same kind of plan Senator Brownback and his family enjoy paid for by the U.S. taxpayer , ” said Phipps , who said his marketing company ’s insurance premiums have jumped more than 20 percent in the last year alone .
Cook , who said she is struggling to pay for health insurance and save to put a child through college , said a public option that would counter rising premiums and insure access for all was imperative .
“ We ca n’t go on like this , ” she said .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China has banned electro - shock therapy as a treatment for Internet addiction , citing uncertainty in the safety and effectiveness of the practice after criticism in the local media .

The Ministry of Health announcement followed recent media reports about a controversial psychiatrist in Linyi , Shandong Province , who administered electric currents to nearly 3,000 teenagers in an attempt to rid them of their Internet habit .
The Chinese government has led a campaign for over a year against Internet addiction , saying young people ’s excessive time in Internet cafes , known as Web bars in Chinese , is hurting their studies and damaging family life .
“ Electroshock therapy for Internet addiction ... has no foundation in clinical research or evidence and therefore is not appropriate for clinical application , ” read the notice , posted on the ministry website ( www.moh.gov.cn).
The world ’s most populous country also has the world ’s largest Internet population , with almost 300 million users at the end of last year , according to the China Internet Network Information Center .
Problems caused by Internet over - use are also on the rise , especially among young Chinese seeking an escape from the heavy burden of parental expectations .
There are over 200 organizations offering treatment for Internet disorders in China .
The developer of the “ electric impact therapy ” is Doctor Yang Yongxin , also known as “ Uncle Yang , ” who runs a boot camp called the Internet Addiction Treatment Center at Linyi Mental Hospital , the China Youth Daily said .
Patients are given psychotropic drugs as well as electro - shocks , at a cost of 5,500 yuan ( $ 805 ) a month .
Strictly trained in military ways and accompanied by their parents , the young patients are prohibited from outside contact .
Most of them were sent to the hospital by force , the China Youth Daily added .
Neither
Yang nor his six colleagues at the camp were qualified psychotherapists , it said .

Last week :
What a thrill ride of news !
On June 23 , Ed McMahon died , and pontificators everywhere got to work fashioning remarks about the unsung virtues of second banana - dom .
On June 25 , Farrah Fawcett died , and we were treated to semiotic analysis of her hairstyle and famous red- bathing - suit poster .
Then , less than six hours later , news of the death of Michael Jackson briefly caused the Earth to stop turning .
And while all that was going on , California careened toward bankruptcy , election protests in Iran continued to boil into violence and the House passed a potentially historic climate change bill .
Still , a seemingly less compelling ( albeit salacious ) story managed to cut through the din .
I ’m talking about the case of South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , who had not only run off to Argentina to see his mistress , television producer Maria Belen Chapur , but lied about it by telling his family , his staff and , by extension , his constituency that he was hiking alone on the Appalachian Trail .
Advertisement
In a rambling , noticeably unscripted and rather bizarre news conference on June 24 , Sanford admitted he ’d been unfaithful to his wife .
He ’d “ spent the last five days of my life crying in Argentina ” ( or perhaps he was singing a song from “ Evita ” and had mangled the lyrics ) .
Meanwhile , a South Carolina newspaper released e-mail correspondence between Sanford and Chapur , which much of the nation seemed to have read by dinner time .
In the e-mails , Sanford revealed himself to be a man deeply smitten , if not exactly another Keats .
“ I love your tan lines ” proved among the more quotable phrases .
Despite the humiliation of it all , Sanford ’s peccadilloes seemed destined to be washed away in the tidal wave of coverage of Jackson ’s death .
From a public relations standpoint , it appeared the governor had received a get - out - of - jail free card from the ghost of the King of Pop .
I , for one , thought Sanford would roll off the screen crawl along with McMahon and Fawcett .
I was wrong .
A week later , even as the Jackson tributes have given way to rumors of autopsy leaks and conjectures about his children ’s paternity , we ’re still hearing about Sanford .
Tuesday , the Associated Press reported that he admitted he ’d “ crossed lines ” with other women in the past and that he considered Chapur “ his soul mate , ” but was “ trying to fall back in love with his wife . ”
Naturally , such “ news , ” despite being more banal than titillating -- or , more precisely , despite being a banality dressed up as titillation -- was ricocheting around the Internet within minutes .
I ’m tempted to assume that the staying power of the Sanford story is simply a function of its prurience .
Sex scandals , after all , are much better for ratings than serious -- read “ boring ” -- events .
It ’s also true that Sanford ’s lies take this saga beyond the realm of mere sexual impropriety and make it a genuine matter of political concern .
( Nevada Sen .
John Ensign , who confessed to an affair last week , has endured considerably less news coverage , perhaps because he at least had the good sense to keep his cellphone on during his dalliances . )

So what ’s left to say about the Sanford saga ?
Call me crazy , but amid all this finger - wagging , am I detecting just a little bit of -- gasp -- empathy ?
Is there something about Sanford ’s puppyish comportment , not to mention the fact that , unlike many adulterous politicos , he seems to be truly in love with his mistress ( or at least truly convinced that he is ) that ’s making him less a pariah and more a symbol of the male midlife crisis ?
For all his duplicity and entitlement , are some Americans -- particularly men -- feeling as much pity as outrage ?
Consider this small sample :
“ This is a story of loneliness , ” New York Times columnist David Brooks said on “ Meet The Press ” Sunday .
" [ These guys ] get to middle age , and they realize there ’s some emotional vacuum in their lives . ”
It “ was about something much deeper than politics , ” wrote Gary Kamiya in Salon .
“ It was awful , but it was real .
And painful as it is , in the repressed American sexual landscape , reality is better than artifice . ”
And then there was my dad , who told me the day of the Sanford news conference something to the effect that “ you have no idea how easy it is for men to completely lose their minds because of infatuation with women . ”

No one ’s excusing Sanford ’s behavior .
But as we slog through another week of the Jackson postmortem - paloooza and wonder at the fact that we ’re also still hearing about the South Carolina governor ’s love for certain tan lines , maybe it ’s worth asking ourselves why .
Is it because we ’re uncategorically appalled ?
Or is it because maybe , just maybe , there ’s a tiny bit of Mark Sanford in , if not all men , quite a few of them ?
And that ’s more than you can say of Michael Jackson .

The A++ Programming Language
Introduction to A ++
Update : Apologies to anyone who 's sensibilities were offended by the claim that A ++ is a " purely functional " language .
This was a mistake on my part .
While the only thing ( with the exceptions mentioned below ) you can really manipulate with A ++ is functions , you could perhaps say that A ++ is a " purely function - oriented " language , but since it does offer destructive assignment it is not " purely functional , " but more of a baby - Scheme .
I 'm going to go ahead and claim temporary sleep - deprivation - induced insanity , and offer a correction below .
Despite having the same name with just one more plus , A ++ is not related in any way to A+. A++ is a truly tiny , purely functional programming language language where ( almost ) everything is a function , whereas A + is anything but tiny and is far from being purely functional represents almost everything as arrays .
A++ , which is short for Abstraction + reference + synthesis , is an abstraction of the lambda calculus , with a syntax that is even simpler ( and thankfully contains only symbols which are on a standard keyboard ) .
This simplicity is due to the fact that it borrows its syntax from Lisp and Scheme , requiring parentheses to surround each expression .
The addition that A++ makes to lambda calculus is the ability to explicitly assign names to objects ( functions or values ) , something which lambda calculus only supports through binding via function calls .
A++ is intended to be a “ learning instrument for programming ” and thus does n’t try to add any extensions to the language which would make it too useful for everyday programming .
Due to its simplicity , it is a great language for getting to understand concepts which would normally be overshadowed by all the other stuff in a language .
A++ is a Lisp - 1 , with a single name space for both functions and data .
Indeed , in A ++ there is no operator to define a function , one simply * define *s a symbol to map to a lambda expression .
Since A++ uses lazy - evaluation , control structures such as if statements and while loops can be created with just lambdas , without having to add macros to the language .
There are some primitive functions built into the interpreter to allow for converting church numerals into regular numbers , and for displaying booleans and numbers .
There is support for primitive integers , strings , and symbolic constants .
However , the support for primitive integers is limited to the minimum needed for converting from a church - encoded integer to a primitive integer , so the primitive integer can be printed , and the support for strings is only in place to allow for loading of external files into the interpreter .
This means that in the language , you have to work exclusively with church numerals , and the only really useful primitive ( aside from lambdas and define ) are the symbolic constants .
All the standard lisp stuff , like car , cdr , map , filter , boolean operators ( true and false , once again , defined in church encoding ) , various predicates ( like nullp and zerop ) , while , and for - each are all built in the A++ language itself , and loaded automatically from a file when the interpreter is started , rather than being built - in functions .
So , when I said this was a purely functional language everything in this language is constructed using functions , I was n’t kidding .
The only difference from what most people would consider a purely functional language , is the fact that you can re-define a new value to the same name .
Of course , without the ability to do this , closures would be of limited usefulness .
My First A++ Program
I had a hard time coming up with an idea for a program to implement in A ++.
Mainly , anything more complex I wanted to do , I could n’t because of the very limited interaction with the outside world allowed by the A++ interpreter .
I looked at the list of solutions by programming task at Rosetta Code , and decided to implement the Roman Numerals task .
I based my solution off the first C solution for roman numerals .
Due to the lazy - evaluation provided by A++ , I was able to translate the macros used almost exactly .
While A++ makes possible functional and object - oriented programming , this example is imperative in nature , since it is copied more or less exactly from a C implementation of the same algorithm .
( define roman ( lambda ( n ) ( define iftrue ; standard if function requires an " else " bit ( lambda ( b t ) ( if b t nil ) ) ) ( define digit ( lambda ( loop num c ) ( loop ( gep n num ) ( lambda ( ) ( print c ) ( define n ( sub n num ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define digits ( lambda ( loop num c1 c2 ) ( loop ( gep n num ) ( lambda ( ) ( print c1 ) ( print c2 ) ( define n ( sub n num ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define hundred ( mult ten ten ) ) ( digit while ( mult ten hundred ) ' M ) ( digits iftrue ( mult nine hundred ) ' C ' M ) ( digit iftrue ( mult five hundred ) ' D ) ( digits iftrue ( mult four hundred ) ' C ' D ) ( digit while hundred ' C ) ( digits iftrue ( mult nine ten ) ' X ' C ) ( digit iftrue ( mult five ten ) ' L ) ( digits iftrue ( mult four ten ) ' X ' L ) ( digit while ten ' X ) ( digits iftrue nine ' I ' X ) ( digit iftrue five ' V ) ( digits iftrue four ' I ' V ) ( digit while one ' I ) ) )
You can download the A++ roman numeral program if you ’d like .
Sadly , A++ offers no way to build up a string for printing or to print multiple items on a single line , so each of the numerals will be printed on its own line .
Also , I chose this particular implementation because A++ does n’t provide a function to perform division !
continue on to learn more about A ++
Anatomy of an A++ Program
There are only three things you can do in an A++ program :
Define a name to have a value ( assignment ) .
Create a lambda expression .
Apply a lambda expression ( i.e. call a function ) .
One thing lambda calculus does n’t directly have is data , so in pure lambda calculus , data is represented by various nested lambda expressions via Church encoding .
A++ uses the same technique to encode most of its data .
For example , the numbers zero through ten are defined in the default A++ environment as follows :
( define zero ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( x ) x ) ) ) ( define one ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( x ) ( f x ) ) ) ) ( define two ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( x ) ( f ( f x ) ) ) ) ) ( define three ( lambda ( f ) ( lambda ( x ) ( f ( f ( f x ) ) ) ) ) ) ( define four ( succ three ) ) ( define five ( succ four ) ) ( define six ( mult two three ) ) ( define seven ( add three four ) ) ( define eight ( add four four ) ) ( define nine ( add four five ) ) ( define ten ( add five five ) )
A++ has lexical scoping , with variables in a function either being “ free , ” meaning they were inherited from a parent of the current scope , or “ lambda - bound , ” which means they were bound as arguments to the current function .
Since all lambdas are closures , you can create a state inside of a function , then return a function which will have access to that state .
This implements data - hiding .
You can use this feature to implement object - oriented programming or just use it to have a function save state between invocations .
Installing A ++
There are a couple of A++ interpreters available for download .
I chose to use the version in C .
You can get any of the implementations at the A++ download page .
I downloaded appc.tar.gz , unpacked it , installed the required dependency of the Boehm garbage collector , and compiled it as follows :
$ wget http://www.aplusplus.net/app/download/appc.tar.gz

And that ’s it !
You can now run the resulting arscint , and get a lovely shell you can play around with .
I timed the make , just to show that it takes less than a quarter of a second to compile .
It ’s a very tiny language .
Running A ++
Running A++ is done by simply starting up the shell like so :
$ ./arscint ... ARS - Eval ->
The “ … ” represents about 50 lines of stuff that ’s printed out as the init file is loaded as if you typed the lines in one - by - one .
After that , you get the ARS - Eval prompt , and you ’re ready to start running commands .
If you want to run my roman numeral function from above , you can use it as follows , assuming you have downloaded the file and put it in your appc directory :
ARS - Eval -> ( load " roman.ars " ) roman.ars > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > > lambda(n ) * eof * ARS - Eval -> ( roman ( add ten four ) ) ; ... and then wait about 5 seconds -->X -->I -->I -->I --> I lambda(x y ) ARS - Eval -> ( roman ( add four ( mult ten ten ) ) ) ; ... and then wait about 20 seconds -->C -->I -->I -->I --> I lambda(x y ) ARS - Eval -> ( define n ( add six ( mult ten ( mult ten ( add ten seven ) ) ) ) ) lambda( f ) ARS - Eval -> ( ndisp ! n ) -->1706 void ARS - Eval -> ( roman n ) ; .. and the first numeral prints out quickly , then a several minute pause ... then it accelerates toward the end --> M -->C -->C -->C -->C -->C -->C -->C -->I -->I -->I -->I -->I --> I lambda(x y ) ARS - Eval -> ( quit ) ; or CTRL - D if you want
Not the most efficient piece of code , but it gives you an idea of how things work in A ++
Learning more about A ++
The creator of A++ has written a couple of books on the language , and the one I ’d recommend starting out with is The Smallest Programming Language in the World .
It not only gives a good introduction to the language , but it goes into some detail on how and why things are done the way they are .
I ’ve left completely uncovered the way in which the author implements object - oriented programming in A ++ , but I would highly recommend you check out the section in the book on object - oriented programming in A ++.
Conclusion
Even though this is a simple , for - education - only language , it has already given me inspiration for ways to simplify the core of my own programming language ( which I will discuss in detail in a later post , when there ’s actually a working implementation to write about ) .
I would highly recommend for any aspiring programmer , or even professional programmer , to at least read the A++ book , even if you do n’t write a single line of A ++ code , I think you can get a lot out of seeing how it ’s put together .
PASADENA – The pastor of 60 - member San Marino Congregational United Church of Christ announced Friday he no longer will perform wedding ceremonies in California until the state ’s ban on same - sex marriage is “ repealed , overturned or corrected . ”
The Rev. Art Cribbs , speaking to a small crowd of church members and supporters near the Pasadena Court building , said the wedding he performed May 23 would be his last until gay couples are given an equal right to marry .
“ I have the support of most of the congregation , ” Cribbs said .
But he acknowledged that some of his flock were disappointed he would not be available to marry them or their children .
Calling his decision “ personal and painful , ” Cribbs said he understood why some people say same - sex marriage is against their religious beliefs .
But with Proposition 8 , he said , “ a boundary has been crossed ” between religion and civil law .
The state “ failed to protect a vulnerable minority from the tyranny of a majority , ” Cribbs said .
“ Our church is involved in justice issues , we are against discrimination , ” he said .
“ I personally have known the pain of rejection . ”
Three years ago , the San Marino church became an “ open and affirming ” congregation , welcoming same - sex unions , said church trustee Holy Burns .
Cribbs , who performed about 70 weddings a year , said he was never asked to preside over a same - sex wedding during the “ short time ” they were legal .
Supporters attending the news conference included the Rev. Susan Russell from All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena , where the first gay wedding ceremonies in the city were performed last year .
“ I stand in solidarity ( with ) this profound stand for justice , ” said Russell , president of Integrity USA , the 30 - year - old advocacy organization for the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender communities .
No one , she said , has the right to insert religious beliefs into the state Constitution .
“ Liberty and justice for all should really mean all , ” Russell said .
Cribbs said he was simply following his conscience by refusing to marry couples until gay marriage is legal again .
But he will continue to provide pre-marital counselling .
A list of ministers willing to conduct ceremonies in his place is available to his congregation , he said .
Elsa Seifert , a member of the Altadena Community United Church of Christ , said she and her pastor , Joe McGowan , came to support Cribbs ’ position .
Legally , Seifert said , she ’s not sure what should be done to overturn Proposition 8 .
“ But I do know that protests can help , ” she said .

The design keeps Herschel 's critical detectors in an ultra-cold state
More details
Europe 's new billion - euro Herschel space observatory , launched in May , has achieved a critical milestone .
The telescope has opened the hatch that has been protecting its sensitive instruments from contamination .
The procedure allowed light collected by Herschel 's giant 3.5 m mirror to flood its supercold instrument chamber , or cryostat , for the first time .
The observatory 's quest is to study how stars and galaxies form , and how they evolve through cosmic time .
The command sent on Sunday to fire two pyrotechnic bolts holding down the hatch was arguably the key moment in the European Space Agency ( Esa ) mission since the 14 May launch from Earth .
" We need the lid open or we can't see the sky , so it 's a really important event , " said Professor Matt Griffin , the principal investigator on SPIRE , one of three instruments inside the cryostat .
There is a YouTube video that shows what would have happened - in slow motion .
News of the hatch opening came on the eve of the Paris air show , a big event in the space calendar when Esa and the space industry come together to celebrate their achievements .
A Herschel display is a prominent feature in the Esa pavilion which the public can visit from Friday 19 June , after the trade days here at Le Bourget that run from Monday to Thursday .
Herschel 's instruments sit inside a tank kept at supercold temperatures During final ground testing ( L ) , the cryostat was sealed and evacuated Only in the vacuum of space ( R ) can the cryostat be opened up safely
The lid release allows light from the mirror to reach the instruments
It was a critical procedure - failure would have killed the entire mission
Scientists stress it will be a while yet before they are ready to release a " first light " image from the telescope .
Herschel is little more than half way through its check - out phase and it is still several weeks away from beginning full operations .
The astronomical community - and the public - will have to be patient as they wait for Esa 's flagship space telescope ( which is bigger than Hubble in mirror diameter ) to show off its capability .
Herschel is sensitive to light at long wavelengths - in the far - infrared and sub-millimetre range .
This will allow it to see past the dust that scatters visible wavelengths , and to gaze at really cold places and objects in the Universe - from the birthing clouds of new stars to the icy comets that live far out in our Solar System .
Herschel was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket in May The observatory is tuned to see the Universe in the far - infrared Its 3.5 m diameter mirror is the largest ever flown in space Herschel can probe clouds of gas and dust to see stars being born
It will investigate how galaxies have evolved through time
The mission will end when all the superfluid helium boils off
Telescope seeks cold cosmos
For the observatory to see these phenomena requires that it , too , be very cold .
Superfluid helium is used to take its instruments very close to " absolute zero " ( - 273C ) .
This is done inside a huge evacuated tank .
For nearly two years , the instruments have been locked away in the top of this cryostat to maintain their frigid state and protect them from contamination .
Only now - a month into the mission - was it considered safe to open the lid .
" Anything that 's launched into space always has some water vapour and various other contaminants - volatile gases - absorbed in its materials ; and in space the water and these volatiles slowly boil away into the vacuum of space , " explained Professor Griffin , who is affiliated to Cardiff University , UK .
" It is conventional and necessary to wait for this to happen , to make sure these contaminants do n't find their way inside the cryostat where they could condense in the instruments . "
Herschel is heading for an observation position some 1.5 million km from Earth .
It is more than 90 % of the way there .
Indeed , its distance from home is now so great it took almost five seconds for the pyro command to reach Herschel .
A slight temperature rise and a shaking detected on the spacecraft indicated to controllers that the lid opening was successful .

China – at least , its biggest commercial city – is to modify its one - child policy .
The authorities in Shanghai have declared that " eligible couples " – viz , two only - children – will be allowed , indeed , encouraged , to have a second child .
Just do n't run away with the idea that this is an outbreak of liberal , pro-choice individualism on the part of the authorities .
As Xie Linli , the director of the Shanghai Population and Family Planning Commission , said : " We advocate eligible couples to have two kids because it can help to reduce the proportion of the ageing people and alleviate a workforce shortage in the future . "
Mmm .
So the obvious downside of the one - child policy has only just occurred to them ?
Population growth is a bit like a pyramid selling scheme : unless you 've got income coming in at the bottom , you can't continue paying out to those at the top .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Regardless of its obvious economic advantages – and the proportion of over - 60s in Shanghai , now more than a fifth , will rise to a third by 2020 – it's hard to think of a measure that will do more , at a stroke , to increase the sum of human happiness , apart from letting people decide the size of their families for themselves .
And that 's something the Chinese have not been allowed to do for decades : the opposite of the one - child policy was Mao 's previous insistence that the Chinese should have large families .
The upshot is , there 'll be more people who know what the words sister and brother mean in a human , not linguistic , sense .
There 'll be Chinese in a generation 's time who will know what it is to have an aunt or uncle ; cousins , even .
This is not to say that I do n't see the advantages of only children .
I and half the population of China have that much in common .
Being an only child means that your place in the universe is secure .
You do n't have any of the tiresome competition for attention .
There 's no squabbling about the pecking order , or inheritance .
You are , in your own family at least , the Little Emperor .
Spoilt , I grant you , and occasionally lonely , but with the internal self - sufficiency that comes from having to amuse yourself quite a lot of the time .
As Wilkie Collins put it , in his novel , No Name : " Miss Marrable was that hardest of all born tyrants – an only child .
She had never granted a constitutional privilege to her oppressed father and mother , since the time when she cut her first tooth . "
From the parents ' point of view , the advantages are equivocal , apart from the purely selfish circumstance that you have more of your own money .
Your hold on posterity is fragile .
One of the unbearable implications of last year 's Chinese earthquake was that so many of the casualties – perhaps 68,000 – would have been only children .
A society where the old exceed the young is unbalanced .
In Confucian terms , the individual 's pre-eminent obligations are to parents , grandparents and ancestors .
Now we have something like descendant worship .
The partial reversal of the one - child policy – which was enforced by compulsory abortions and involuntary sterilisations – will have an environmental impact on the rest of us .
But we should give those environmentalists who rejoice in draconian population policies for other people very short shrift .
I 've come across any number of supposedly liberal academics who , sotto voce , will tell you of the immense benefits of China 's one - child policy .
Well , they 'll just have to come to terms with this advance in freedom .
For anyone who cares at all about human liberty , it 's something we should celebrate .
The sign is on a main road heading to Newcastle A pair of comedy road signs mocking Newcastle United 's relegation from the Premier League have been unveiled by cheeky Sunderland supporters .
One sign , on the A184 , has an arrow pointing towards Tyneside and reads : " Sid James ' Park , the biggest stadium in the ' Fizzy Pop ' league ' . "
The other , on the road to Sunderland , says : " The Stadium of Light , the North East 's only Premier League stadium . "
A video of the stunt was posted on the video sharing website YouTube .
They are entitled to laugh , after all we laughed at them when Sunderland were relegated in 2003 and then again in 2006
Newcastle fan John Monaghan
The signs have been fixed to empty posts which used to bear official road signs .
Last month , Newcastle owner Mike Ashley put the club up for sale after saying sorry to fans for the mistakes which cost them relegation to the Coca Cola Championship .
He said : " It 's been catastrophic for everybody .
I 've lost my money and made terrible decisions . "
Earlier this week , Sunderland supporters made scores of bogus bids for Newcastle United when the club asked for offers via email .
Newcastle fan John Monaghan , 35 , of Heaton , said : " They are entitled to laugh , after all , we laughed at them when they were relegated in 2003 and then again in 2006 .
" But it 's hard to find anything very funny at the moment if you 're a Newcastle fan . "

New European report on anti-semitism is shocking , but for different reasons
The British government has commissioned a shocking new report from the European Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism ( EISCA ) which among other things argues that the law should be changed so that political commentators cannot draw comparisons between the actions of the Israeli state and those of Nazi Germany .
writes :
“ If you said ‘ the way the IDF operated in Gaza was like the way the SS acted in Poland ’ and a Jew found this offensive , hurtful or harmful , you could , in theory , go to jail . ”
However that is neither the most shocking or hypocritical aspect of this report .
No , that prize goes to the section of the report which argues that one of the ways antisemitism is manifested is by :
“ Applying double standards by requiring of [ Israel ] a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation ”
Israel and the United States , of course , both permit and praise the Israeli military as well as Israel ’s “ sovereign right to defend itself ” ( source , source , source ) while at the same time requiring and expecting the Palestinian government to renounce violence and agree never to develop a military ( source , source , source ) .

In the never - ending quest to completely understand how to correctly pair food and wine , I admit to spending hours perusing magazines , wine sites , recipes , etc .
When I am not completely comfortable trusting my own judgment , I turn to various online wine pairing tools for a bit of reassurance .
There are numerous sites that have wine pairing guides , tools , widgets , etc. , so I wanted to share the 5 most common ones I turn to in my time of insecurity !
FoodTv Canada
This is basically the Food Network 's Canada site .
Their wine pairing tool is pretty helpful for basic food options , providing some more obscure wine pairings .
There are expanded categories for seafood , poultry , meat , vegetables , cheeses , desserts , pastas , and even pizza / snacks !
Although there are not a lot of options within each category , there are accompanying recipes with a very detailed explanation about the wine 's characteristics and the pairing summary itself .
The pairing summary is very helpful in understanding how the food and wine actually work together .
Nat Decants
Natalie MacLean is an accredited sommelier and wine writer .
She has a great wine matching tool on her site that breaks down the food categories even further to include fruit based dishes , spices and herbs , nuts , turkey dinner , eggs , and even breads .
Although there is not an actual pairing summary , you can mouse over the wine glass to learn more about the specific varietal itself .
One added benefit to this wine tool is the inclusion of both red and white pairing options in search results .
E&J Gallo Winery
Gallo Winery 's website pairing tool is very simple and not very customizable , but it provides more than one option for pairing .
Categories like chicken / pork / turkey are combined as are pasta / vegetarian , etc .
You can choose the spice or sauce , and your result will yield good , better , and best pairing options .
Just note , the wine varietals searched are actually only those produced by Gallo themselves , so the results are a bit skewed if you were interested in other varietals not on the list .
Wined In
Wined
In is a community based collection of suggested wine pairings with various meals .
Although there are no actual recipes provided , there are some very detailed pairings included , like halibut with mango chutney or braised halibut with fennel and cherry tomatoes .
If you cannot find something suitable , there is a place you can request a wine pairing and see if a fellow wine enthusiast will post a suggestion in response .
And if you feeling confident , you can submit your own pairing addition to the database !
The Wine Curators
Their website has a free version of the licensed software you can purchase in their Personal Wine Curator cellar management system .
The main difference is the inability to use two search characteristics under food , as that option is only available in the paid version .
It 's still worth a mention since the free version has some pretty detailed options in the food category and the search results are expansive , including both Old and New World wines .
Hopefully you will find these wine pairing tools as helpful as I have .
I always try to formulate a pairing suggestion first and then look to the various tools for additional support .
This gives alternative suggestions that I may not have thought of previously , helping enhance my wine knowledge .
Most of all though , just remember to have fun with your pairings - food and wine are meant to be fun , not stressful !
All the world ’s great religions contain Messianic prophecies , which promise that God will one day send a Promised One whose teachings will unite all humanity .
The Promised One is called by different names by different religions .
Jews look forward to a Prophet like Moses .
Hindus look for the return of Krishna .
Christians await the return of Christ .
Muslims look for the appearance of Imam Mahdi as well as Christ .
Buddhists await Buddha .
The fascinating aspect of all these prophecies is that they all seem to be pointing towards the same event .
All the major religions of the world have their own signs of Doomsday .

20 .
Half of Jerusalem is taken , and one third of the remaining Jews are holed up in the other half of Jerusalem .
21 . Jesus Christ returns and the Mount of Olives splits in two for the battle of Armageddon .
Jews
These signs were said to have been given in the historical books of the Hebrews , and depict the fifteen days before doom :
1 . All the water from the earth , including the seas will rice up to the clouds , above the mountains , so that the cry of the seals , the yelling of the sea-monsters and the roar of the whales will be on the dry strands after the water leaves them .
2 . The huge noise of the water falling down again the next day into their proper places will be heard , so that it goes deep into the earth ; and nobody knows where .
3 . All the water will freeze in its place and become hard , and armies will march on this .
4 . The sea-animals of the earth will rise up into the clouds , and will cry and clamour continuously for fear of the Day of Doom .
None other but God will understand what they are saying .
5 . All the birds on the earth will move continuously , without resting , and without eating any food or drinking anything .
6. Great rivers , with fiery and rough waves , will flow out of the firmament from sunrise to sunset .
7 . A huge , scary , ugly and unbearable sound will be heard from the heaven , and there will be thunder with many lightnings .
From the southern part of the sky , there will be seen a fiery red cloud rising and spreading all over all the earth , and crimson blood will pour from that cloud , and fill the earth – both the land and the sea .
There will be huge fires over all parts of the globe , and the world will face a mighty earthquake with a huge spark rising from every part of the earth .
The sea will also be ruthless on that day .
8 . There will be an excessive tremor and all the creatures of the earth will be numb with fear .
The waves of the sea will rise very high , and the ocean will be shaken from its very core with fiery winds .
The thundering seas and the water against rivers of fire , with no pleasure , no music throughout the world will leave a sad and distressful feeling .
9 . Each and every stone in this world , both small and big will break into four parts .
These parts will talk to each other , and except for God , nobody else will understand their language .
These stones will begin to tremble after losing their form .
All the woods of the earth will be completely uprooted , after they have all broken on that day .
Streams of sulphurous fire will rise from the earth so that the entire world is one single blaze of fire from sunrise to sunset .
10 .
All the stones and trees on the earth will be shedding blood .
Rough winds will rise and the whole world will be shaken at once .
All humans will be screaming , wailing , and crying , and pleading with the earth to open up for them , so that they do not have to witness all the evil .
They would prefer to die rather than be alive at that moment .
It is at that time that three hundred and sixty - five stars will fall on the earth .
The mountains will fall and they will be on the same level as the ground .
11 . Big thunders and the sound of four fiery winds from the four airts of heaven will make all the elements shrink and separate .
Five thousand three hundred and sixty - five stars will fall on earth just as ripe fruits falling on a windy day .
The moon will turn into the color of blood , the sun will grow dark , the mountains and all other structures will turn into ash .
A horrendous screaming of the burning birds will be heard .
Humans will face a sad , bitter , and heavy grief on that day .
All mankind will kneel in front of God , praying for Him to save them from the fire of Doom .
12 . All the lawless animals of the earth will have to leave their places , and be on the plains , howling and crying , with no food or clothing .
Every person that has tasted life will die on that day and the whole world will be on fire and hail .
Then the doors of the palace will open and the roar of the seven heavens will be heard at the coming of the Creator with His angels .
The heaven ’s angels will sing to the Creator to rescue them and the angels and the souls of the saints and the good people will be saved , so that the fire of Doom does not burn them .
13 .
All graves will open up and the dead will come out , and the world will be in grief , as there will be no place to live for the living or for the dead in this world .
14 .
All the living will die .
15 .
The final sign of the day before doom – The only Son of the King of heaven and earth and hell , with all the angels and archangels , in His company will go , on that day to the summit of Mount Zion to judge their deeds , both good and evil , for Adam ’s impure children .
Michael the Archangel will summon all the human beings to that great assembly .
All the dead will arise ; first , the apostles will arise , then the prophets and the confessors , the martyrs and the saints and the good people , then the virgins and penitents and in the end , baptized infants .
The whole human race will be aged thirty on that day , with no one being older or younger .
This is the age at which Adam was created and the age of Jesus when He was baptized .
Then the King of Glory will arise with His final Cross on his shoulder in everybody ’s presence .
He will have traces of all the wounds of His Passion upon Him , so that all the incurable wounds and tortures , which they themselves inflicted upon Him , may be manifested to the Jews .
Hinduism
According to Kaala Jnaana written by the Hindu mystic , Veera Brahmam , Kali Yuga will last for 5000 years after Lord Krishna passes away , after which evil will spread throughout the world .
Hindu legend states that at the end of kali yuga , Vishnu , the universal ruler will appear again under his form of the Kalki- avatara for doing away with the wicked and inaugurating a realm of righteousness and spirituality .
This will be the Doomsday .
The signs of Doomsday are :
1 . There will be a rain of fire .
Following this a strange thing will happen .
20 feet tall humans will appear and claim to be Kalki . ( this is in India ) .
2 . A huge comet will be born in the south ; several people will die due to this .
3. Mammary glands will be born to the males of Cow , Goat , etc. and people will get milk from them .
4. Tigers will disappear completely from the forests .
5 . The Sun will appear like a green colored human being .
6 . Moon will be seen on a new moon day .
7. Wealth will arrive from other countries to India and India will be very rich and powerful .
8. Stones will break and fly about like crows and eagles ; Stone horses and chariots will start to run .
9 . Blood and pus will flow out from stones .
10 .
It will rain blood .
Over the years , there have been many versions of these signs and you will find they differ when taken from different books , and this is one version of the signs of Doomsday in different religions .
Skeptics may find it interesting to know that even the laws of science support the fact that the world will come to an end .
The second law of thermodynamics states that everything goes from order to disorder and eventually ends .
It can be your body , house , earth ’s magnetic field , extinction of species or the shrinking sun .
Whether all this is true or not and whether we choose to believe in all this or not , will depend entirely on each one of us .
What we have reproduced here is just what has been written about in numerous books .
The Demographic Side of War in the 21st Century
It ’s always a bit disconcerting to come across an idea that hits you with a blinding flash of the obvious – a simple , important insight whose logic is clear and seemingly irrefutable .
I reacted this way to a recent article in the Times , by someone called Richard Ehrman .
He starts with a straightforward fact of demography :
In terms of numbers the West still held the upper hand compared to the Middle East until well after the Second World War .
In 1950 all the Arab countries together had a combined population of only 60 million , compared with nearly 160 million in the US and a combined total of 120 million for Britain , France , and Spain — the three European powers that then still ruled territory in the Arab world .
By 2000 the demographic balance had changed dramatically .
The Arab world had increased fourfold to just over 240 million , not far short of America ’s 284 million .
So far this sounds a bit like Mark Steyn ’s obnoxious but deeply relevant book America Alone .
But while Steyn was concerned with the effects of large numbers of Islamic immigrants on Western societies , Ehrman sees implications for the ability of the West to project power in the Middle East and elsewhere :
The problem has been that , even for a power as mighty and sophisticated as the US , occupying a Third World country with a fast - growing population means putting an uncomfortably large number of boots on the ground .
Western militaries can still win wars in “ Third World ” countries , in the traditional sense of destroying enemy forces and subduing or even overthrowing regimes .
The hard part , following Ehrman ’s logic , is dictating what happens afterwards .
Controlling a large population requires a large number of occupying troops – and particularly in the Middle East and Africa , populations are much larger relative to Western ones than was the case 50 or 100 years ago .
The picture gets even worse when you compare local populations specifically to the sizes of Western armies , and when you consider that Middle Eastern and African countries often have disproportionate numbers ( relative to the West ) of men of fighting age .
To move from the general to the specific , Canada ’s Afghan contingent of fewer than 3,000 soldiers has not been sufficient to keep a lid on Taliban activity in Kandahar Province , and deploying even this modest number has strained our resources .
Britain and especially the US are able to maintain much larger numbers of troops in the field , but whether they will be able to impose reasonable levels of security and stability remains an open question .
Demographic futures are difficult to predict .
For the moment , however , Canada and other Western countries seem to have little choice but to accept that occupying “ Third World ” countries is a more difficult proposition than it used to be .
It may become more necessary than ever to rely on friendly local forces , which of course has already become a major pattern for the Americans in Iraq and for the Western alliance in Afghanistan .

Scientists in Newcastle claim to have created human sperm in the laboratory in what they say is a world first .
The researchers believe the work could eventually help men with fertility problems to father a child .
But other experts say they are not convinced that fully developed sperm have been created .
Writing in the journal Stem Cells and Development , the Newcastle team say it will be at least five years before the technique is perfected .
They began with stem cell lines derived from human embryos donated following IVF treatment .
The stem cells had been removed when the embryo was a few days old and were stored in tanks of liquid nitrogen .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Yes , go for it .
Let 's advance our society .
James , London
The stem cells were brought to body temperature and put in a chemical mixture to encourage them to grow .
They were " tagged " with a genetic marker which enabled the scientists to identify and separate so - called " germline " stem cells from which eggs and sperm are developed .
The male , XY stem cells underwent the crucial process of " meiosis " - halving the number of chromosomes .
The process over creating and developing the sperm took four to six weeks .
Understanding sperm
The Newcastle team say the sperm were fully mature , mobile sperm and they have produced a video to back up the research .
FROM BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .

More from BBC World Service Professor Karim Nayernia at Newcastle University and the NorthEast England Stem Cell Institute says : " This is an important development as it will allow researchers to study in detail how sperm forms and lead to a better understanding of infertility in men - why it happens and what is causing it .
" This understanding could help us develop new ways to help couples suffering infertility so they can have a child which is genetically their own .
" It will also allow scientists to study how cells involved in reproduction are affected by toxins , for example , why young boys with leukaemia who undergo chemotherapy can become infertile for life - and possibly lead us to a solution . "
However , Professor Nayernia stressed the researchers had no intention of " producing human life in a dish " .
Perfectly viable human embryos have been destroyed in order to create sperm over which there will be huge questions of their healthiness and viability
Josephine Quintavalle
Comment on Reproductive Ethics But Dr Allan Pacey , a sperm biologist at the University of Sheffield , said he was not convinced the sperm were fully developed .
" The quality of the images is not of sufficiently high resolution and I would need more data .
They are early sperm , but functional tests would be needed to know exactly what has been achieved . "
The sperm cannot be used for fertility treatment as this is prohibited under UK law .
The scientists in Newcastle say it will be at least five years before the technique is perfected - when they believe it should be available to help infertile men .
This research also raises ethical issues .
Josephine Quintavalle from Comment on Reproductive Ethics ( Corethics ) said : " This is an example of immoral madness .
Perfectly viable human embryos have been destroyed in order to create sperm over which there will be huge questions of their healthiness and viability .
" It 's taking one life in order to perhaps create another .
I 'm very much in favour of curing infertility but I do n't think you can do whatever you like . "
But John Harris , Professor of Bioethics at the University of Manchester , said : " I do n't see any problems with the use of synthetic , or laboratory produced sperm .
" They will initially be used to make discoveries about the way sperm are formed and how problems arise , and that will be beneficial .
" Eventually it will be used to solve male infertility and that will be wholly beneficial .
" It seems to me this is one of those examples where people are groping around for a problem and there literally is n't one . "

Whether you enjoy outdoor adventures or surf the great beyond from your computer chair , it ’s easy for the human brain to see complexity and touches of man-made civilization in the impressive natural formations of our world .
Our brains are wired to mistake culture when nature mimics man-made structures .
From geometrical faces carved by the forces of nature to sleeping giants in the sea , here are the 18 strangest yet most amazing tricks of nature creatively mocking man ’s design .
Rainbow and Cracked Fairy Chimney
Vastly extreme landscapes exist in central Turkey .
Magical fairies are said to have created extraordinary scenes .
A thick layer of volcanic rock and ash helps to protect these beautiful stone formations .
Over eons of time , the basalt cracks and the much softer inner stone begins to erode and wash away .
This “ Fairy Chimney ” appears to have a window overlooking an enchanted land .
Nature added a rainbow in this magnificent view .
Dead Man – Sleeping Giant
Off the coast of Ireland , near the Blasket Islands , this rock formation is known as the Dead Man or The Sleeping Giant .
With foreboding dark clouds hanging low over the small island , this natural rock structure looks like a man who laid down to sleep on the water .
Minard ’s Head , the stunning mountainous countryside where The Sleeping Giant waits , has been forgotten by most guides and therefore by most tourists .
The Dead Man is surrounded by peace and tranquility with only the low crashing sound of the waves on the rocky shore , as forgotten as the ruins of the castle nearby .
Indian Head , Witch ’s Face , Building Blocks , Australian Heart
Nature has been making the most gorgeous art for countless centuries without any help from man ’s technology .
In the Colorado Rockies , this great red stone face of an Indian chief keeps a watchful eye as man tears up the Earth .
His distinct triangular face , large brow , long nose , and mouth stand out in contrast to the mountain .
( upper left )
Decorating Laguna Beach , this natural rock formation appears to the human eye as a silhouette of a witch ’s face .
If viewed from the proper angle , this series of jutting granite ledges gives man another illusion of itself .
Face - like stone formations are common around the world .
The craggy nose , pointy hair , and elongated chin are easily visible on the witch ’s face .
( upper right )
In Peru , these stone formations were once thought to be ruins from an ancient “ Lost City . ”
Archaeologists and geological analysis proved these rectangular rocks are a natural design .
Each architectural piece is made of sandstone that showed no signs of intervention by the hands of man .
Instead of ruins from the Inca people , nature once again created rock formations that look like they were made by man .
( bottom left )
Found at Ayers Rock , Australia , this indentation in the rock looks like a red heart .
Uluru is a huge sandstone rock formation that is sacred to the Aboriginal people .
Uluru National Park is considered an Australian icon .
Standing 1140 feet high , most of the red rock is burrowed beneath the ground .
The aboriginals believed a turtle - spirit changed into Ayers Rock .
The area has many caves and springs where the Aboriginal people survived .
It is as if nature carved this heart in an area well - loved by the Australians .
( bottom right )
Ancient Walls and Building Blocks
In Scotland , near the eastern coastline of the Caithness district , these magnificent rocks look like ancient building blocks and man-made walls .
Instead , ravaging winds and the turbulent sea have carved out the rocks over many centuries .
A human ’s visual perception mistakes natural forces for complex right - angled blocks and walls .
Nature , not technology , molded and carved these millions of colored stone layers .
Giant ’s Causeway , The Old Man of the Mountain , Footprint , Stone Forest
In Northern Ireland , the Giant ’s Causeway stepping stones lead into the sea .
Extremely active volcanoes spewed molten lava which solidified into a substantial plateau .
Formed at least 50 million years ago , the molten magma cracked and fractured as it quickly cooled into igneous rock .
These geometric stepping stones made by nature ’s hand have mesmerized humans for an eternity .
( top left & bottom right )
This Great Stone Face can be found in the White Mountains of New Hampshire .
Formed by glaciers millions of years ago , The Old Man in the Mountain resides 1200 feet up with stone shelves that are 25 feet wide and 40 feet tall .
A face , a jagged and craggy profile , is visible when seen at the correct angle .
The Old Man of the Mountain is made up of a series of five granite cliff ledges .
What Mother Nature created , the human eye sees as a face - like stone formation .
( top right )
Near Gujarat India , in a breathtaking land of cave temples , this rock formation was found .
Gujarat civilization is thought to date back from 3000 to 1500 BC .
This ancient natural rock formation has rested , untouched , for untold thousands of years .
Brightly colored and carefully sculpted by nature over time , the textures and patterns in this rock appear as if it were a human footprint .
( middle left )
Spotted via satellite in Varna , Bulgaria , this unique geological formation looks like a Stone Forest .
The Bulgarian name for these rocks is “ Pobitite Kamani ” which means stones beaten into the ground .
These white rock formations , a fabulous natural phenomena , may date back some 270 million years .
The stones are clustered together in some places and spread apart in others as if the forest were seeded eons ago .
Tall rocks look like trees made of stone , broken and fallen with age .
Once again , to the eyes of man it appears as if man-made , but nature created an illusion of a forest made of stone .

Moeraki Boulders
Along the coast of New Zealand , overly large and spherical boulders lie scattered on Koekohe Beach .
Exhumed by coastal erosion , these boulders were created by the cementation of Paleocene .
Nature formed these huge round rocks similar to how an oyster makes a pearl .
Instead of a grain of sand , these beautiful boulders began as a fossil shell or perhaps small pieces of wood .
Lime and minerals from the sea accumulated over time and grew up to perfect spherical shapes , some up to 9 feet in diameter .
Local legend spins a tale of how these massive gray rocks came to rest on the shore , another example of man attempting to explain away how nature could form something so spectacular .
Troll
Nature chiseled this ancient rock near Nas , located on the Greek Island of Icaria .
Alongside the spectacular beaches , ruins of an ancient temple dedicated to the Goddess Artemis remain .
People have lived in Icaria since at least 7000 BC .
Nas was a sacred spot and the Temple of Artemis was considered a last stop before sailing the treacherous seas .
Sailors made sacrifices to the Goddess Artemis , the patron of sea-farers .
Like a fierce stone creature , this natural formation looks like a hideous troll perched on the rocky outcropping over the exquisite aquamarine sea .
Fairy Chimneys
In Cappadocia , Turkey , eons of time have eroded jutting volcanic rock formations to create mystical Fairy Chimneys for as far as the human eye can see .
The outer hard layer of stone is less easily - eroded than the inner soft sedimentary rock .
Primitive people carved out homes , chapels , and tombs in the stone .
This territory in Turkey is epically strange yet enchanting .
This mystical and peculiar landscape continues below ground where the rocks have been tunneled out to create underground and otherworldly cities .
The Sleeping Ute
The Sleeping Ute Mountain is on the “ Ute Mountain Ute Reservation ” in northern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado .
The cluster of angular crests is the profile of “ The Sleeping Ute . ”
Alone in an otherwise flat land , the mountain peaks soar from 5 to 12 miles high .
The Sleeping Ute is supposed to resemble a Ute Chief lying down with his arms folded across his chest for all eternity .
The legend associated with this land is that a Great Warrior God helped to fight against the evil ones .
During the mighty battle , his feet formed into the mountains and valleys .
The Great Warrior God was wounded and fell into a deep sleep as he rested to recover .
His wounds bled , becoming the living water .
Rain clouds form out of his pockets .
He continues to care for his people .
The changing of this blankets bring the seasons : dark green , yellow and red , and white .
A 3 - day Sun Dance is held every year over Sleeping Ute ’s heart .
His head is to the right while his folded arms , hips , knees , and toes stretch to the left .
Underwater Arena
When diving in Japan , this ancient underwater treasure awaits to tickle or to trick the visual senses .
Yonajuni Monument has long been debated as either made by nature or made by man .
This popular diving location boasts stone terraces , stone circles , and perhaps even a stone arena that are buried deep underwater off the coast of Japan .
Have these massive natural structures been chiseled by strong currents or by an ancient alien civilization long gone from the land ?
Mankind sees underwater ruins , angles and walls .
It may be nature simply looking like it is man-made .
The arguments rage on of whether Yonajuni Monument was artificially or naturally formed .
Strange Natural Formations
Although this mossy rock appears to have man-made rectangular patterns on top , this phenomena is actually nature fooling the eyes of man yet again .
Patterns like a fishing net weave across the rock , making the stone appear to be man-made .
Nature coated the angular lines with layers of green and yellow moss .
The squared shapes embedded in the rock came about during the formation of a huge boulder .
These patterns formed naturally over hundreds of years , not a trick to confound , but a gift from Mother Nature .
Natural Sphinx
Located In Pakistan , Hingol National Park is both extensive and exquisite .
It ranges from a natural habitat for wildlife where a river runs through it to a dry and desolate desert .
Hingol National Park contains four ecosystems : desert , Arabian Sea , open plains , and rugged mountains .
Numerous birds , crocodiles , turtles , gazelles and marine life flourish in the diverse environment .
It is a land where nature rules .
This rock formation resembles the Great Sphinx of Giza .
This Sphinx , however , is a natural one that was sculpted by coastal semi-desert winds for millions of years .
Clinton wo n't comment on report she tried to deep - six torture evidence John Byrne
Published : Thursday July 30 , 2009
Print This Email This Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pressured the British intelligence service not to disclose evidence of alleged US torture of a British national , Britain 's foreign secretary told the UK's top court Wednesday .
Asked about the claim at a press availability by a BBC reporter Wednesday , Clinton declined to comment .
" Im not going to comment , " Clinton said when asked .
" Obviously , the issue of intelligence sharing is one that is critically important to our two countries , and we have both a stake in ensuring that it continues to the fullest extent possible . "
Reporters are seeking access to a secret seven - paragraph CIA summary which posits that the United States told the UK they 'd trim intelligence sharing if the Brits " outed " their treatment of former Guantanamo detainee Binyam Mohamed .
British judges have seen the CIA brief but have yet to release it .
The country 's top lawyer says release of the memo would undermine national security , a claim that judges seem skeptical of .
British foreign secretary David Milbrand said in a statement to the court that Clinton personally " indicated " that disclosing the CIA memo " would affect intelligence sharing . "
Milbrand 's lawyer , Karen Steyn , also told the court that such a loss of spy cooperation " would put lives at risk . "
The BBC 's question to Clinton follows .
Lord Justice
Thomas , one of the judges hearing the case , expressed reservations about heeding the US ' request to keep the CIA document out of the public eye .
He argues that the national security charge is dubious , dubbing it " the exercise of naked political power . "
A letter from the CIA asking him to deep - six the memo " merely demonstrated that the CIA would like the court to withhold from the public findings about CIA wrongdoing , " he said .
MR. KELLY : Last question , James Robbins from BBC .
QUESTION : James Robbins from the BBC .
On Afghanistan , to both of you , please , youve outlined a comprehensive political and military strategy .
Do you accept that there can be no guarantee of success ?
And to increase the chances of success , is it likely within the future , both countries  both your countries are going to have to commit further troops to Afghanistan ?
And specifically to you , Madame Secretary , this morning in London , British judges who want to publish a summary of the alleged torture of Binyam Mohamed were told in court that you personally have said that such publication would damage intelligence - sharing relations between the United Kingdom and the United States .
So may I ask you , is that correct ?
And are you at all concerned that the judges think that justice would be better served if the material was published ?
SECRETARY CLINTON :
Well , I m not going to comment on the last question .
Obviously , the issue of intelligence sharing is one that is critically important to our two countries , and we have both a stake in ensuring that it continues to the fullest extent possible .
Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
LOS ANGELES  California lawmakers , their state broke and its credit rating shot , finally sealed the deal with the governor Monday night on a plan to close a $ 26 billion budget gap .
The plan , which is certain to be viewed with trepidation among legislatures across the country also facing huge budget gaps , distributes pain through nearly every aspect of government services .
While the Legislature pushed back on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s proposal to eliminate health care programs for children and the state ’s generous welfare program , both took large cuts .
So did public education , universities and local governments .
All told , the deal contains $ 15.6 billion in cuts , about $ 2.1 billion in borrowing , $ 3.9 billion in new revenues and about $ 2.7 billion in accounting maneuvers like shifting a payday into the next fiscal year , which Mr. Schwarzenegger had claimed he would not brook .
Under the new budget , which runs through the 2010 fiscal year , localities will basically serve as unwilling lending agents to the state .
It will raid their coffers and repay them over time as the state ’s fiscal situation improves .
LG to launch wristwatch phone in US
In a move that will make most every guy ’s inner kid ’s Dick Tracy / James Bond - esque dreams come true , LG will also launch the GD910 watch phone in American soil , according to speculations arising from released FCC documents detailing the watch phone .
Much clamor was raised when Orange announced that they will be spearheading the gadget ’s release in Europe , after subsequent announcements by LG of releasing a mobile phone con watch .
The GD910 will support Bluetooth headset pairing , 3G HSDPA , video calling , multimedia playback and a touch input screen .

Update , July 24 , 2009 -- Today , Honduras has been totally paralysed by a general strike , and Honduran resistance activists and protesters are chanting .
Zelaya - get used to it .
The people are rising up
( it rhymes in Spanish ) .
Also common is the resistenCia , resistenCia , resistenCia , el pueblo unido jamas sera vencido ( people united will never be overcome ) and so on ...
This afternoon Zelaya crossed over the frontier at Las Manos north of Esteli .
He stood technically just inside Honduran territory , having crossed the chain separating the two countries in the " neutral " strip between them .
Zelaya remained there for about two hours , hoping to meet up with members of his family and others who were trying to join him .
On his walk over he received phone calls from presidents Lula of Brazil and Lugo of Paraguay , and many others .
He seemed to be glued to the phone or else responding to reporters questions , taking time to occasionally sip water and juice .
At times he was seen gazing at high points , no doubt on the lookout for snipers .
Reporters at one point sounded a sniper alert , but the suspect disappeared in seconds , it seems .
The Honduran president did not attempt to clear the immigration offices , although he spoke with the offficial in charge .
Reporters pointed out a place where they had seen a sniper , but no attempts on Zelaya 's person took place .
He was not arrested , and he said he placed phone calls to top advisors of the high command of the armed forces , the real de facto government or junta of the country that controls ``Goriletti ] '' and other " cabinet " stooges like marionettes .
Thousands of Zelaya 's supporters have been trapped at roadblocks along the roads going south from Tegucigalpa , including his wife , his daughter and his mother .
They were trying to join him at the border .
Two people at an army roadblock just north of the Las Manos border crossing were injured by trooper gunfire .
Most of the army roadblocks are in the Paraiso Department ( province ) , one of them at Danli , where Zelaya 's family were held up .
Several hundred Hondurans got to join him by entering Nicaragua at other points and then meeting him at the chain separating the Nicaraguan side of the neutral strip between the two territories .
At that point Zelaya crossed back into Nicaragua , along with members of his team .
They will stay overnight in Las Manos and re-enter their country tomorrow by the same approach .
It gets dark in Las Manos just after 6 pm .
TeleSur showed a few minutes ago video of demonstrators sleeping on the road , and a wall of soliders with their protective shields and helmuts still stationed and ready to stop any who try to move closer to the border .
The coup junta established a longer period of curfew , now running from noon to 4 am .
Hence , those who are still in the streets or roads protesting are technically in violation of the decree .
This will in all likelihood be repeated tomorrow morning , in roughly a similar drama and maneuvering , on both sides .
But tomorrow we expect greater numbers of resistance activists to hit the streets and roads , and also a greater display of military strength .
The army will feel emboldened by Hillary Clinton 's attack on Zelaya ( see below ) , but also more nervous because of the evident strength of the pro-Zelaya forces .
Leaders of the National Resistance Front Against the Coup interviewed by TeleSur said that protests grew throughout the day in most parts of the country and were much larger than the few pro-coup demonstrations .
TeleSur showed video of the pro-coup action in the industrial centre of San Pedro de Sula , where it appeared to have drawn upwards of 1500 people -- a size which the head of the resistance front said was miniscule .
Most media within Honduras have blocked any news of Zelaya 's presence .
However , Radio el Globa did carry news , and El Salvadoran and Nicaraguan radio reaches fairly deep into the country .
As well TeleSur can be seen via the internet , and cell phones are common , even among poor people .
Hence , what the Cubans call Radio Bemba is no doubt airing loud and clear across the country , as news goes by word of mouth even into remote areas .
US Secretary of States Hilliary Clinton made a last ditch attempt to dissuade Zelaya from crossing the border , saying that his plan was " reckless " .
Zelaya 's foreign minister Patricia Rodas responded to Clinton on TeleSur .
She mocked the US State Department position of treating the coup leaders as equals of the deposed president .
The ``golpistas '' ( coup makers , coupsters ) , she reminded Clinton , are the reckless party , the side who refused to even discuss the mediation document put forward by Costa Rica 's President Oscar Arias , and the cabal that resorted to arms and massive repression against the population .
All Zelaya is doing is attempting to exercise his constitutional rights , and to create the conditions for a real dialogue between the army high command and the elected government of the country , which has universal international recognition and majority support in the country .
It 's a pity that Clinton 's remarks could not have been repeated in English and made available on the major US networks because she demolished the Clinton - Obama charade , although she did not mention Obama in the same breath as the former senator from New York .
The ability of Zelaya 's team , and of the Resistance Front leaders , to sustain their determination to keep their protests peaceful and free of bloodshed is a sign of the growing maturity of the mass movement .
Over the past month the army has on too many occasions fired bullets into protest actions , as they did again today on the road to Danli .
It takes considerable and considered discipline and sophistication not to fall for the traps being set by such provocations , and not to become enraged and respond in kind .
Meanwhile , some signs of a weakening of the once solid Latin American front against the coup registered by the unanimous vote in the OAS appeared during the Mercosur summit today .
Venezuela attempted to have Zelaya invited in order to strengthen Latin America 's resolve to take more concrete measures to sanction the military regime and show the US an example of what really could be done where there is a will to do it .
But Brazil 's President Lula blocked this , at which point Chavez chose not attend .
Despite this , strong statements were made again against the coup , especially by Argentina 's Kirschner and Bolivia 's Morales , and Fernando Lugo , Paraguay 's newly elected president .
Last night William Grigsby , director of Managua 's Radio La Primerisima and of its flagship program of political analysis Sin Fronteras [ without borders ] , told his listeners that he was aware of significant signs that both Mexico and Brazil , as well as Chile , have softened their stand on the coup , in the sense that they will try to block any concrete measures against Honduras ' regime aimed at returning Zelaya to power , such as suspension of trade and economic relations .
Evo Morales made a strong intervention calling on Latin American countries to unite to expel all US bases from South America and the Caribbean .
He argued that if the coup in Honduras is allowed to stand every other Latin American government will be in danger of army - led coups , and pointed to the danger of having their high commands trained by the Pentagon .
Of course , he specifically denounced the announcement of four new US bases for Colombia , a direct threat to his own revolution , and to Venezuela , Ecuador and Nicaragua [ with whom Colombia has a historic dispute following its seizure of the San Andres islands .
The US grranted them to Colombia as compensation for ripping out the province of Panama from Colombia in order to secure the Panama Canal ] .
The hour of the grassroots approaches
By Felipe Stuart Cournoyer
July 21 , 2009 --
Three weeks after the June 28 military coup that expelled Hondura ’s President Mel Zelaya and claimed to overthrow his government , the country remains shaken by a profound and dynamic popular upsurge demanding Zelaya ’s return and the restoration of democracy .
The collapse on July 18 of the much - touted “ negotiation dialogue ” between Zelaya 's government delegation and representatives of the military coup was all but inevitable .
The talks foundered on the one issue that neither side could agree to discuss or give ground on – who is the constitutional president of Honduras ?
Mass resistance and even opinion polls show that a strong majority of Hondurans back Zelaya as their elected president and demand his immediate return .
The coup has been denounced by all the relevant international organisations : the Bolivarian Alliance for the People of Our America ( ALBA ) , the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) , the Rio Group , the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , the European Union and the United Nations .
Failure of negotiations
However , the coup junta ’s delegation at the San Jose , Costa Rica , negotiations broke off the talks , proclaiming that they could not even discuss the possibility of Zelaya continuing as president .
The Zelaya delegation then withdrew from the talks and announced that the president would quickly “ return to Honduras to help organise an insurrection against repression ” .
For Washington and the coup high command , Zelaya ’s return to Honduras may represent the only way to avoid an armed popular uprising .
But for the Honduran masses , his return , even under onerous conditions , would mean admitting the illegality and disastrous impact of the military takeover .
Zelaya ’s return could thus fuel mass resistance and further undermine the pro-coup faction .
The coup leaders and their US supporters are in a bind .
This explains why they tried to stall for time with the manoeuvre of the San Jose “ mediation dialog ” .
Lamenting the failure of his mediation , Costa Rica ’s President Oscar Arias warned of the imminence of “ civil war and bloodshed that the Honduran people do not deserve ” .
Meanwhile , OAS secretary general José Miguel Insulza exclaimed that “ it is almost impossible to avoid conflict between Hondurans and call for calm when a dictatorship seeks to stay in power in full view of everyone ” .
Washington ’s complicity in the coup
The dictatorship has imposed brutal repression against unarmed civilian protesters , including assassinations and disappearances .
Washington , for its part , has pursued a two - faced and deceitful course .
The coup was planned in the Honduran capital , Tegucigalpa , with the participation of the US embassy and US military officials at the Palmerola air force base .
The US then voted in favour of the unanimous OAS resolution in support of Zelaya .
But the sincerity of this vote was undermined by statements by both US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama .
Although they sometimes used the word “ coup ” to describe the army takeover , they waffled when it came to action .
More important than their talk was their walk : they did nothing to help force the army out of power , such as by ending military aid or imposing economic sanctions .
The Obama administration has since shown its hand .
On July 20 , Phillip Crowley , spokesperson for the US Department of State , responded to a reporter 's direct question , about whether or not the coup was illegal .
He admitted that the US does not consider the military power grab to be a coup in the “ legal ” sense .
The coup , evidently , was “ not legal ” – but by the same token it was not “ illegal . ”
The distinction means that it is not illegal to continue US military and economic aid to the coup administration and the armed forces .
( See Eva Gollinger 's report at Postcards from the Revolution , www.chavezcode.com/2009/07/dept-of-state-agrees-with-coup-regime.html.)
Obama 's duplicity should come as no surprise , despite the unusually intense hopes millions of people have for his promise of real change in an imagined “ post - Bush ” world .
US Honduran policy is in complete continuity with its long history of domination and intervention in Latin America and the Caribbean .
As Nicaragua ’s President Daniel Ortega pointed out to a rally of hundreds of thousands in Managua on July 19 , the coup in Honduras came just ahead of the announcement of the opening of five new US military bases in Colombia – a response to the forced closing of the US Manta airbase in Ecuador and the feared loss of US bases in Honduras .
ALBA ’s role
The US administration ’s tacit support for the coup leaders reflects their hatred of Zelaya ’s measures to support the poor and in bringing Honduras into the ALBA anti-imperialist alliance .
ALBA – the Bolivarian Alliance for the People of Our America – unites Cuba , Venezuela , Nicaragua , Bolivia , Ecuador , Honduras and three English - speaking Caribbean countries as a spearhead and bulwark of anti-imperialist struggle to build social and economic solidarity among the partner nations .
( See “ Honduras and the Big Stick , ” www.counterpunch.org/kozloff07202009.html.)
ALBA led the process of Latin American unity against the coup , holding a series of emergency meetings in Managua to lay the basis for the unanimous OAS and UN resolutions .
When Latin American and Caribbean unity and determination to smash the coup became loud and clear , Washington opted to try to try to camouflage its role .
But there is no hiding the fact that the coup is directed against ALBA itself – against all its members and potential members .
As Latin American leaders have pointed out , if the coup is consolidated , other countries will become coup victims again , even without Washington ’s prompting .
US tacit support of the Honduran coup is a clear signal to military plotters .
ALBA leaders understand in blood and flesh that the coup is intended as blow against them .
Bolivia ’s President Evo Morales stressed this on July 20 , explaining to a radio audience that “ this coup is a threat against the continued growth of ALBA ” .
Resistance on the streets
Despite repression , mass resistance continues to grow in Honduras .
International solidarity up and down Indo - Black - Latin America and across the Caribbean has not waned .
Insurrection is in the air .
Stay in the streets , Zelaya appeals .
“ It ’s the only place that they have not been able to take away from us . …
I have not surrendered and I am not going to .
I am going to return to the country as soon as possible ...
The right to insurrection is a constitutional right . ”
The coup regime has tried desperately to silence all critical media and has imposed a night - time curfew .
Security forces have violently attacked peaceful protesters and arrested a large number of activists .
Two protesters were killed on July 5 and two activists and members of the left - wing Democratic Unification Party ( UD ) have been assassinated by unknown gunmen .
Returning to Honduras that day , visibly exhausted UD Congress member Marvin Ponce stated : “ The people owe Honduras a revolution , and if the legitimate president , Manuel Zelaya , is not reinstated , there will be a confrontation between social classes .
What I can say is that the days of peaceful resistance , like we have had until now , are numbered . ”
On Bastille Day , July 14 , tens of thousands of workers , students , farmers and Indigenous people massed in front of the US embassy in the capital Tegucigalpa .
They came from all over the country in response to a call from the National Front to Resist the Coup d’etat ( FNRG ) .
About 1000 delegates joined the rally from a rank - and - file convention of the Liberal Party , to which both Zelaya and the illegitimate president installed by the coup , Roberto Micheletti , belong .
Zelaya ’s wife , Xiomara Castro , played a prominent role in the mobilisation .
Since the coup , more than three weeks of mass resistance has all but paralysed the country and shattered its already feeble economy .
At least two huge demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of toilers and oppressed sectors have rocked the country .
On July 16 , Central American labour unions staged solidarity protests closed Honduras ’ Nicaraguan , Guatemalan and El Salvadoran borders .
Export earnings and investments are in free fall .
Despite total press and media censorship within the country , and a near - blackout internationally , coup leaders have not been able to muffle ongoing reports and rumours of fissures in their “ united front ” and even among lower echelons of the armed forces and police .
The demonstrations and strikes are not spontaneous .
They are led by the mass organisations of campesinos ( peasants ) , Indigenous people , students , Afro-Hondurans , trade unions , teachers , journalists , professional associations , religious groups and human rights groups .
The FNRG is made up of dozens of organisations .
They are well connected internationally through active networks .
They have been influenced by previous struggles in the region , especially the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua during the 1980s .
Ongoing advances for the oppressed in Bolivia , Ecuador , Paraguay , Venezuela , Nicaragua and El Salvador have inspired and assisted the Honduran mass movements , giving inspiration and lessons for the struggle .
The reforms implemented by Zelaya since he was elected in 2005 responded to growing pressure from the grassroots , as his government faced dozens of major protests and industrial disputes .
This gave impulse to a new dynamic interplay between Zelaya and exploited and oppressed grassroots sectors .
A ‘ council ’ dynamic
The FNRG has managed to unite people across gender , ethnic , age and class lines .
Its ability to resist savage repression , and maintain street and workplace protests , has proven its political maturity .
That ’s why the “ Zelaya delegation ” to the San Jose dialogue included a rainbow of union , campesino , Indigenous and Afro-Honduran representatives .
On July 20 , a large council gathering of grassroots leaders resolved to step up the resistance .
Trade unions announced a general strike for July 24 - 25 .
They reaffirmed their support for Zelaya and their call for a constituent assembly to remake the country 's constitution .
This assembly , in my estimation , revealed that the mass protests have taken on what historians of revolution and insurrection call a “ council dynamic ” – that is , organising the participation and representation of workers , campesinos , national minorities , students and oppressed sectors through local and networked councils .
The FNRG has enabled a new , dynamic interplay between government - level leadership and the will and initiative of the grassroots .
It is still only a beginning , but a vigorous one .
Whether it can be consolidated depends on the course of the struggle and on international solidarity .
How long can the mass resistance endure the ongoing repression ?
People have to make a living , and cannot remain in the streets forever .
Campesinos will soon have to begin planting their fields .
Time is now more than ever critical to victory .
If resistance deepens , the hour of Jose Francisco Morazan , the 19th century Honduran national hero who implemented important pro-people reforms , may well have sounded .

By Giorgio Trucchi
When the Managua press conference of the constitutional president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya Rosales , ended I was able to get into the president ’s vehicle along with his minister of the presidency Enrique Flores Lanza to go to an interview with international media .
In just a few days -- or perhaps hours -- President Zelaya was to set out on his return trip to Honduras .
In the intimacy of the vehicle we began this exclusive interview for Sirel .
Giorgio Trucchi :
In the last few days you ’ve announced your intention to return to Honduras , no matter the cost .
Is this a definitive decision ?
Zelaya Rosales :
This is not a question of something that goes against the stability of the country ; rather it is a solution in the search for stability .
We hope that this will be the best way to undertake an internal dialog that solves the conflict and end the repression under which the Honduran people are suffering .
Dialogue with whom ?
With the people because the people command in a democracy .
The power - sectors who have taken up arms are repressive groups and they have to give up the exercise of command that the people have not granted them .
What has most saddened you about this coup against your person and your government cabinet ?
What pains me is that the country is being destroyed .
Society is suffering , and they are trying to destroy the progress we have achieved and the efforts of so many generation through the use of arms .
The de facto government is totally isolated on the international plain and is facing a strong and tireless internal resistance from grassroots movements .
Despite that , it is carrying on with a totally intransigent attitude .
The question arises -- is this just a matter of insensitivity , or are they placing their confidence in support from foreign actors ?
They are like wild animals from the jungle who cling to their food .
They think Honduras is their personal ranch .
They ’re a group of ten families who want to consolidate their economic wealth and privileges .
Their fear is groundless because no one is trying to get at them .
Nevertheless , they believe that democratic development will [ badly ] affect them and so do not accept democracy .
In the press conference you said that sectors of the United States extreme right supported and continue to back the coup .
Are you convinced the involvement of those sectors ?
These people have made public demonstrations of their support to the coup , including US senators and members of Congress .
Mr Otto Reich is the former Under Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere and he came out in support of the coup .
Many people in the United States have done the same .
Hence , there is proof and evidence that ex-president George W. Bush ’s hawks are behind this coup .
What importance has the grassroots , social , and union movement had in blocking the progress of the coup ?
The are protagonists in defence of democracy because the think that democracy is an instrument that enables them to make social conquests .
They are combating the coup and wo n’t give up until the effects of this attack against the Honduran people and against democracy is ended .
The coupsters are defying the world and we have to set a precedent before it is too late .
UITA [ International Union of Food , Agriculture and Hotel Workers ] has been following events from the optic of grassroots movements , before , during , and after the coup ?
For those sectors there are two elements that cannot be negotiated : rejection of amnesty for the coupsters , and going ahead with having a fourth ballot box [ in the coming elections that would consult voters about whether or not a constitutional reform process should be undertaken ] , and the installation of a constituent assembly .
What do you think about those points ?
It would be ridiculous to award a prize to the coupsters for carrying out a coup .
I think the position of the social movements is to seek a solution to the conflict , but without any prizes or pardons for committing penal and common crimes .
At the same time , I think that the seven points put forward by [ Costa Rica ’s ] President Oscar Arias speak about political amnesty but not for ordinary and penal offences .
Regarding social reforms , I think that finding a new strategy to carry on with these reforms must be part of a broad process of discussion throughout Honduran society .
Social reforms should not be ended , nor should the peoples ’ rights to participation [ in political decisions ] be blocked because they are constitutional rights .
In that sense , Oscar Arias ’s points were not discussed in their breadth because the coupsters do not accept restitution of a democratic system .
They want a de facto regime that is lawless ; they want to maintain it with violence .
We can not accept that .
It ’s been said that there are two basic elements in trying to find a solution to the conflict : the position of the United States and the role of the armed forces .
What ’s your opinion on that ?
Today we sent a letter to President Barrack Obama , respectfully asking him to stiffen measures not only against the repressive state , but also against those individuals who conspired and carried out the coup .
We hope a quick response so that the measures undertaken will really restore a system based on law and order .
If that does not happen we are all in a precarious situation , not just myself -- a victim of a coup for defending society ’s rights -- but the whole population .
I believe that President Obama not only has diplomatic mechanisms to exercise pressure , but also has other strong resources that I hope he applies ; and also other countries in Latin America [ should do the same ] .
Regarding the armed forces , if they are going to be used to carry our coups , then logically we have to evaluate their role .
However , I believe that , in this case , it was the high command that ordered the coup .
The officers and the new generation that is going to receive blood - stained armed forces do not agree with this coup .
Is it getting close to the moment of your return to Honduras ?
Are n’t you afraid of being arrested or assassinated ?
I have no fear .
But I am taking precautions and being careful .
When life demands , you have to live with a sense of effort and of its rewards .
Sometimes sacrifice is necessary to bring about social conquests , and I am ready to make the effort for people ’s liberty , democracy , and peace .
Did you ask the media to accompany in your attempt to return to the country .
Are you really proposing to go back ?
I ’ve asked them to accompany me .
I am going to risk everything and the world is taking the same risk with my return .
I ’ve said that if there is an assassination General Romeo Vásquez Velásquez will be responsible for my death .
A 39 - year - old Iowa man named Christopher Handley pleaded guilty yesterday to the possession of " obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children and mailing obscene material . "
A child pornographer , you say ?
Nope .
A collector of Japanese comics .
But no real children were involved and no sexual abuse occurred -- Handley 's crime was owning explicit cartoons , and he now faces the same punishment as someone with actual child porn .
That means he could get up to 15 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine for owning drawings .
Gross drawings , for sure , but drawings nonetheless .
Despite the fact that the Supreme Court ruled this sort of thing is unconstitutional because it outlaws " speech that records no crime and creates no victims by its production , " the PROTECT Act of 2003 -- another gift from George W. Bush -- says pretty much the opposite , and now the law can no longer tell the difference between buying videos of children getting raped and ordering a dirty book .
As Comic Book Legal Defense President Charles Brownstein said recently , " Mr. Handley now faces the loss of his freedom and his property , all for owning a handful of comic books .
It 's chilling . "
And by the way , if you 'd drawn ( or downloaded ) a slash picture of Hayden Panettiere two years ago , the government could have come for you , too .
The existence of a class of " noble poor " was theorized degraded by poverty and circumstance ( See Moira Baker 's " The Politics of They " http://books.google.com/...
These ideas and this mythological underclass largely disappeared during the Great Depression and after WWII .
A number of theories have been put forward to explain this process .
One is that the opportunities for advancement and social mobility of the War years and immediate Post - war period , with the mammoth migrations involved , undermined the disparities of locality and class that were apparent in the pre-Depression years .
Another focuses attention on the ethos of the returning G.I.s after the war , exposed to new environments , technology and peoples these former soldiers pursued the ideal of self - improvement with a passion and the new suburbs reinforced materialism , education and advancement , diminishing the ethnic identifications that had formerly seemed to define class lines .
A theory of the effect of abundance in all forms of natural resources has been put forward as well , see David M. Potter , People of Plenty 1954 , but applies more to earlier periods of social stress in America , but is less convincing .
In the past 50 years the Republican Party has embarked on a program to recreate a self - conscious underclass , beginning with the assault on intellectuals in the anti-communist hysteria of the late 50s , the portrayal of Adlai Stevenson as a member of a foreign and ruling elite , Agnew and Nixon 's attacks on intellectuals , the folksy oppositions of Ronald Reagan and the rise of Talk Radio ( or what really has been class war radio ) .
This is a movement to a culture of the lowest common denominator .
Our school systems struggle against these influences and our TV and movies idolizing dumb and dumber .
Republican denigration of knowledge and learning has replaced a culture of " can do " American know how founded on the self betterment ideology of the founding fathers , like Franklin .
America has become a place where those who display knowledge and intelligence are ridiculed .
We are becoming a nation without an intelligencia .
The great leaders of the Right bask in their claimed ignorance of literature or knowledge .
From Karl Rove to Rush Limbaugh opinion rules over fact .
Sarah Palin best epitomizes this state with soap opera family drama where the amoral behavior is emphasized with backwater homilies while South Carolina Governor Mark Stanford symbolizes the fallen everyman .
Britney Spears ' interview on CNN in 2003 was an example of know - nothing culture coddling authority when she tells America to " Trust the President " .
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIbb42a6K4I&NR=1.
The trend is brilliant in demeaning the opportunity of people of the working and middle class by negating the value of learning , knowledge and the satisfaction of mastering a skill or profession .
The creation of a self - conscious underclass has proved effective for the Republicans thus far from the entreaties of Anita Bryant to Bush 's war on Islam .
The use of religion has featured as a central motivating element and the rising unemployment and fear of homelessness can only add fuel to a kindling fire that is dangerous and potentially destructive to the future of America as a free nation based on law and democracy .
One should not forget that Hitler used law and democracy to gain power in a depression by motivating a mass of people using underclass ideology to create a self - identified " oppressed " group .
The Republicans are using this process now by calling the underclass they have been creating , " oppressed . "
The quality of discourse of the Republican " culture war " propagandists relies on know - nothing .
Consider Ann Coulter who has written a critique of health care reform without a single factual reference http://www.anncoulter.com/...
Coulter denounces government mandates on health care as the principle cause of the high cost of health care and the lack of coverage for many Americans .
However , when one looks at the facts we find otherwise .
In a study by Vanness & Wolfe ( 2002 ) http://www.pophealth.wisc.edu/phs548/fulltext.pdf.pdf we find that the mandate allows businesses to forgo taxes on health benefits to the tune of over 100 billion dollars while this mandate has not resulted in an appreciable increase in coverage in low income workers .
Thus the mandate is entirely oriented in making the businesses more profitable .
It is not the mandate that is flawed but it was the Bush administration 's failure to enforce the provisions of the mandate , but then the Republicans only passed the mandate with voluntary guidelines .
In other words , the companies got the tax break but there was no punishment for not providing the health care .
Coulter bases her argument partly on Cato Institute papers where mandates for car insurance are denigrated by comparing states with laws requiring insurance vs those that do not .
The difference in rates of uninsured are given as 18 % and 15 % by selective use of various data .
However , the issue is not the laws but the enforcement .
States with and without mandates have chosen not to enforce the laws .
But the analogy is flawed as the issue with car insurance is focused on driver responsibility and that means the damage caused by the driver on victims .
This is not comparable to access to medical care where a person needs care and goes to a provider .
America is slipping into a pool of ignorance which will not result in bliss , but rather poverty and backwardness .
We are heading to a new feudalism .
President Barack Obama was received in the Middle East with the usual grovelling Saudi plea for help in taming the Israelis and an incendiary threat from Osama bin Laden that America will pay the price for his role in displacing a million Muslim refugees in Pakistan .
It was n't difficult to see why Obama warned the world not to expect too much from his attempt to " create a better dialogue " with Muslims .
Bin Laden was probably 1,300 miles to the north of Obama when the US President landed in Riyadh yesterday for his meeting with King Abdullah but , as usual , Bin Laden 's words were a good deal more direct than those of the fawning Saudis .
By his support for the Pakistani army 's assault on the Taliban in Waziristan , Obama had " sown new seeds of hatred against America " and was " laying the foundation for long wars ahead " .
With his normal flourish , Bin Laden added that he " warned the American people ... that they will suffer the consequences of his actions " .
Could it be , perhaps , that Bin Laden is beginning to miss old George Bush and his " war on terror " , that the ever smiling Barack Obama is beginning to stick in Bin Laden 's craw , that the fractional improvement in US - Arab relations is beginning to be a little irksome – or that , by some awful mischance – Obama actually might tame the colonial ambitions of Israel ?
Ironically it was Madeleine Albright – writing with the usual pomposity but with almost bin Laden - like directness in the New York Times – who also spotted that no Obama speech , " however eloquent , can disentangle US - Muslim relations from the treacherous terrain of current events such as Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan ... "

The Saudis , of course , wanted to talk about the Iranian – i.e. Shiite – threat to the Sunni world as well as the refusal of Bibi Netanyahu to bow to Obama 's demand for an end to the Israeli colonisation of Arab land .
Indeed , there are times when the Saudis speak of Iran with almost the same hatred as Bibi .
They really should meet some time , although success for the 2002 Saudi peace plan – total Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 border in return for full Arab recognition of Israel – would probably guarantee that just such a meeting took place .
Obama 's speech writers will have tightened up the US President 's Egyptian address for today once they discover whether King Abdullah is still as keen on the Saudis ' own 2002 plan .
It will no doubt be neatly slotted into the " better understanding " speech which we are going to have to listen to in Cairo today when Obama addresses that famous entity , the " Muslim world " .
The trouble is that the Shiite - Sunni void – to be played out again this weekend in the theatricals of the Lebanese elections – is almost as important for the Arabs as resolving the tragedy of the Palestinians .
And , of course , everyone wants to be seen hugging the new American President .
Grinning over his cardamom tea with the king in Riyadh yesterday , poor Obama is going to have to endure the embrace of Hosni Mubarak in Cairo today where the government press – almost as fawning as the Saudis – have been proclaiming that Obama 's reference to the Egyptian president as a " stalwart ally " of peace proves that Egypt has yet again won its place at the centre of the Arab world .
Yes , Obama did actually call the old dictator a " stalwart ally " , much to the disgust of the opposition in Egypt , but that is what you have to do in this part of the world if you want to get invited back .
Waiting for the President 's speech is almost exquisitely painful because , like the Arabs , Washington 's policies still appear hopelessly divided .
While infuriating the Israelis – much to the Arabs ' delight – Obama continues to send his men into the graveyard of empires to beat the Taliban , shrugging off any responsibility for those one million Pakistani Muslim refugees whom Bin Laden so shrewdly spotted on the horizon .
The only real question , perhaps , is whether Obama has asked himself the most important question : does the " Muslim world " actually exist ?

Water vapor jets spewing from Saturn 's icy moon , Enceladus , are not the result of geysers from an underground ocean as envisioned by some planetary scientists but may be caused by water evaporation or ice vaporization , according to a new University of Colorado at Boulder study .

Water vapor jets that spew from the surface of Saturn 's icy moon Enceladus are not really geysers from an underground ocean as initially envisioned by planetary scientists , according to a study led by the University of Colorado at Boulder .
First observed following a close flyby by NASA 's Cassini spacecraft in July 2005 , the jets were found to consist of both water vapor and icy particles , said Professor Nicholas Schneider of CU - Boulder 's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics .
The jets inspired speculation by planetary scientists that they were geysers -- violent explosions of water out of a vent caused by expanding bubbles of water vapor emanating from an ocean beneath the icy crust of Enceladus .
Scientists hypothesized that if such an ocean did exist , it might provide a suitable environment for primitive life forms , said Schneider , who led the study .
" We wondered if there was an ocean underneath that crust and wondered if it is just spraying out through cracks like a geyser boiling away into space , " he said .
To test the theory , Schneider and his colleagues performed experiments to find the relative content of sodium in the water vapor component of the jets .
If the jets were geysers originating from an underground ocean , then the sodium content in the water vapor should be high .
Schneider said such sodium should give off the same yellow light that comes off street lights , and that the world 's best telescopes can detect even a small number of sodium atoms orbiting Saturn .
Observations by Schneider 's team using the 10 - meter Keck 1 telescope and the 4 - meter Anglo - Australian telescope , however , demonstrated that few if any sodium atoms existed in the water vapor .
" It would have been very exciting to support the geyser hypothesis .
But it is not what Mother Nature is telling us , " said Schneider .
The study was published in the June 25 issue of Nature along with a companion study by other researchers that analyzed the icy grains that also make up the expelled jets .
The companion study concluded there was at least some salt in the particles in the plume , suggesting the particles may have come from an ocean .
" Since our observing team did not find salt in the vapor , our conclusions speak to the conditions of a possible underground ocean on Enceladus , " Schneider said .
One suggested explanation for the contrasting results from the two studies is that deep caverns may exist where water evaporates slowly , said Schneider .
When the evaporation process is slow the vapor contains little sodium , just like water evaporating from the ocean .
The vapor turns into a jet because it leaks out of small cracks in the crust into the vacuum of space .
" Only if the evaporation is more explosive would it contain more salt , " said Schneider .
" This idea of slow evaporation from a deep cavernous ocean is not the dramatic idea that we imagined before , but it is possible given both our results so far . "
But Schneider also cautions that several other explanations for the jets are equally plausible .
" It could still be warm ice vaporizing away into space .
It could even be places where the crust rubs against itself from tidal motions and the friction creates liquid water that would then evaporate into space , " he said .
" These are all hypotheses but we can't verify any one with the results so far , " said Schneider .
" We have to take them all with , well , a grain of salt . "

Sewage treatment plants fail to remove artificial sweeteners completely from waste water .
What ’s more , these pollutants contaminate waters downstream and may still be present in our drinking water .
Thanks to their new robust analytical method , which simultaneously extracts and analyses seven commonly used artificial sweeteners , Marco Scheurer , Heinz - Jürgen Brauch and Frank Thomas Lange from the Water Technology Center in Karlsruhe , Germany , were able to demonstrate the presence of several artificial sweeteners in waste water .
Their findings are published online this week in Springer ’s journal Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry .
A range of artificial sweeteners are commonly used in food and drinks , as well as drugs and sanitary products .
The potential health risks of artificial sweeteners have been debated for some time .
Until now , only sucralose has been detected in aquatic environments .
Through the use of a new analytical method , the researchers were able to look for seven different artificial sweeteners ( cyclamate , acesulfame , saccharin , aspartame , neotame , neohesperidin dihydrochalcone and sucralose ) simultaneously , and show , for the first time , that a number of commonly used artificial sweeteners are present in German waste and surface water .
Scheurer and colleagues collected water samples from two sewage treatment plants in Germany – Eggenstein - Leopoldshafen and Karlsruhe – as well as from a soil aquifer treatment site located in a Mediterranean country that treats secondary effluent from a sewage treatment plant .
They tested the water samples using their new analytical method and detected four ( acesulfame , saccharin , cyclamate , and sucralose ) of seven artificial sweeteners in the waters from the two German sewage treatment plants , indicating incomplete elimination during waste water treatment .
Their analyses also showed that these pollutants contaminate rivers and streams receiving water from the sewage treatment plants .
The authors then compared the conventional waste water treatment by sewage treatment plants with advanced waste water treatment by soil aquifer treatment .
Traces of artificial sweeteners were present in both cases , proof that water purification was incomplete .
Marco Scheurer concludes : “ Due to the use of artificial sweeteners as food additives , the occurrence of artificial sweetener traces in the aquatic environment might become a primary issue for consumer acceptance . ”

Rid yard of mosquitoes
Mosquitoes bugging you ?
Stop them at their source :
Any standing water in your yard can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes to lay eggs .
Drill drainage holes on the bottom of trash cans and recycling bins .
Check birdbaths and pet bowls , and overturn unused flowerpots .
Mosquitoes need very little water to lay eggs .
Prevent exploding bottles
To keep your bottles of suntan lotion and aloe from exploding inside your suitcase , let FedEx lead the way .
Use those FedEx Tyvek packs in which your shipments arrive .
They 're watertight and will keep any spills or messes inside the bag and not all over your clothes .
Cook s'mores with coals
Barbecuing tonight ?
Here 's a quick , entertaining variation :
Once the cooking is done , recycle the hot coals in the grill for dessert .
Scoop the hot coals into fireproof bowls and bring out the marshmallows , graham crackers and chocolate bars .
Instant s'mores .
Use bandanas as napkins
Here 's an entertaining idea :
Try bandanas instead of paper napkins when having guests over for a party .
They 're colorful , reusable , inexpensive and a fun way to dress up a table .
You can find bandanas in most discount stores and Army / Navy surplus shops .
Make soap curls
If you 're having guests over , offer them a fresh piece of soap every time they wash their hands .
Just grab a bar of glycerin soap ( it 's clear ) and run a vegetable peeler across the top to make soap curls .
Place all the curls in a bowl ; each curl is just enough for one hand washing .
Try reusable containers
If you are enjoying a day at the beach , consider using non-disposable containers for packing food .
Chinese stacking tins keep sandwiches , pickles and cookies organized and separate from one another .
These are easy to carry , with a click - in handle on top .

Water lawn at sundown
If you need to water the lawn or outdoor plants , do it at sundown .
Watering plants at night is the most ecological method , since there is no sun to evaporate the water immediately .
If you have automatic sprinklers , set the timer to water the lawn at night .
Not only does this save water , but the plants and lawn will get a proper soaking , too , and will thrive .
If you kill 7 minutes on an internet video today , make it this clip of a minimal building facade transforming through illusions of 3D projection .

The structure is O. M. Ungers ' " Galerie der Gegenwart " — or it was before projection artists at Urbanscreen got involved .
Their vision of " dreaming " architecture gave the textureless , motionless facade a dynamic new look .
Some of the illusions work better than others .
For instance , the first animations of two hands pressing in the bricks actually fall short of desired surrealism — probably because you see the wrists floating over the building 's real windows .
But other moments will exploit your perspective in the most satisfying ways , as if Optimus Prime were redesigned by M.C. Escher .

Now that 's what I call a fly - past : US Navy F18 streaks past apartment block
This is the moment a a US Navy pilot gave a shocked resident a very close look at his F18 .
The fighter / bomber streaked past an apartment block on the banks of the Detroit River at the weekend .
It was part of a tactical demonstration fly - past to open a speedboat race in the North American city .
Officials waived rules to allow the Navy flyers to swoop under 100ft along the waterway .
Flypast :
The F18 streaks past an apartment block
One resident said : ' I could n't believe how low they flew and how close they came to our building - I 'm sure the pilot waved at me . '
The jets had flown in from the Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia to put on a spectacular show for thousands of spectators .
The Chrysler Jeep Superstores APBA Gold Cup race was won by speedboat ace Dave Villcock .
' We danced with the devil at every turn , ' said Villwock , 55 , who demolished the field on his way to his seventh Gold Cup win .
' We were either going to win it big or lose it big . '
In conversations with Justin , other minors with for - pay sites admitted to being scared of certain fans .
Some adults wrote things like " It wants to possess you . "
They had special wardrobe requests for the adolescents : in jeans with a belt , without a belt , with a lacy bra , showing legs , showing feet , wearing boxers with an erection , and others .
One 16 - year - old who called himself hot boyy 23 finally found the entreaties too much .
" Hey guys , " he wrote when he shut down his site , " I 'm sorry , there are just too many freaks out there for me .
I need to live a more normal life , too .
I might be back someday and I might not .
I 'm sorry I had to ruin all the fun . "
It was not only the minors operating Webcam sites for pay who faced frightening adults .
Earlier this year , a teenage girl in Alabama posed seminude on her Webcam in a sexually charged conversation with someone she thought was another teenage girl .
But her new confidant , it turned out , was an adult named Julio Bardales from Napa , Calif. , law enforcement officials said .
And when the girl stopped complying , she received an e-mail message from Mr. Bardales containing a montage of her images .
Across them was a threat in red letters that the images would be revealed unless she showed a frontal nude shot over the Webcam .
Mr. Bardales was subsequently arrested .
The police said he possessed images of more under - age girls on Webcams , including other montages with the same threat .
Justin says that he did not fully understand the dangers his fans posed , and before he turned 14 , he was first lured from the relative safety of his home .
A man he met online hosted Justin 's Web site from Ann Arbor , Mich . , and invited him there to attend a computer camp .
Justin 's mother allowed him to go , thinking the camp sounded worthwhile .
Another time , the man enticed Justin to Michigan by promising to arrange for him to have sex with a girl .
Both times , Justin said , the man molested him .
Transcripts of their subsequent conversations online support the accusations , and a video viewed by The Times shows that the man , who appears for a short time in the recording , also taped pornography of Justin .
From then on , Justin 's personality took on a harder edge , evident in the numerous instant messages he made available to The Times .
He became an aggressive negotiator of prices for his performances .
Emboldened by a growing contempt for his audience , he would sometimes leave their questions unanswered for hours , just to prove to himself that they would wait for him .
" These people had no lives , " Justin said .
" They would never get mad . "
Unnerved by menacing messages from a fan of his first site , Justin opened a new one called jfwy.com , an online acronym that loosely translates into " just messing with you . "
This time , following an idea suggested by one of his fans , he charged subscribers $ 45 a month .
In addition , he could command large individual payments for private shows , sometimes $ 300 for an hourlong performance .
Shielding my eyes from the glare of the morning sun , I look toward the horizon and the small mountain that is my destination : Herodium , site of the fortified palace of King Herod the Great .
I 'm about seven miles south of Jerusalem , not far from the birthplace of the biblical prophet Amos , who declared : " Let justice stream forth like water . "
Herod 's reign over Judea from 37 to 4 B.C. is not remembered for justice but for its indiscriminate cruelty .
His most notorious act was the murder of all male infants in Bethlehem to prevent the fulfillment of a prophecy heralding the birth of the Messiah .
There is no record of the decree other than the Gospel of Matthew , and biblical scholars debate whether it actually took place , but the story is in keeping with a man who arranged the murders of , among others , three of his own sons and a beloved wife .
Long an object of scholarly as well as popular fascination , Herodium , also called Herodion , was first positively identified in 1838 by the American scholar Edward Robinson , who had a knack for locating biblical landmarks .
After scaling the mountain and comparing his observations with those of the first century Jewish - Roman historian Flavius Josephus , Robinson concluded that " all these particulars ... leave scarcely a doubt , that this was Herodium , where the [ Judean ] tyrant sought his last repose . "
Robinson 's observation was confirmed later that century by Conrad Schick , the famous German architect and archaeologist who conducted extensive surveys of Jerusalem and its nearby sites .
But where precisely was the king entombed ?
At the summit of Herodium ?
At the base ?
Inside the mountain itself ?
Josephus did n't say .
By the late 1800s , Herod 's tomb had become one of biblical archaeology 's most sought - after prizes .
And for more than a century archaeologists scoured the site .
Finally , in 2007 , Ehud Netzer of Hebrew University announced that after 35 years of archaeological work he had found Herod 's resting place .
The news made headlines worldwide —
" A New Discovery May Solve the Mystery of the Bible 's Bloodiest Tyrant , " trumpeted the London Daily Mail .
" In terms of size , quality of decoration and prominence of its position , it 's hard to reach any other conclusion , " says Jodi Magness , an archaeologist in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has excavated at other sites where Herod oversaw construction projects .
Ken Holum , a University of Maryland archaeologist and historian who served as a curator for the traveling Smithsonian exhibition " King Herod 's Dream , " cautions that " it is always wise to be less than certain when there is no identifying inscription or other explicit identification . "
But he says he personally believes Netzer has indeed discovered Herod 's tomb .
Netzer , 75 , is one of Israel 's best - known archaeologists and a renowned authority on Herod .
Trained as an architect , he worked as an assistant to the archaeologist Yigael Yadin , who from 1963 to 1965 led an exhaustive dig at Masada , the fortified plateau near the Dead Sea where Herod built two palaces .
In 1976 , Netzer led a team that discovered the site of one of Herod 's infamous misdeeds : the murder of his young brother - in - law , Aristobulus , whom Herod ordered to be drowned in a pool at his winter palace complex near Jericho .
Yet the discovery of Herod 's tomb would be Netzer 's most celebrated find .
And as is often the case with such discoveries , Netzer found it where , for years , he least expected it .
Arriving at Herodium , which is not only an active archaeological site but also , since the late 1960s , a national park , I drive partway up the mountain to the parking lot where I will meet Netzer .
In the early 1980s , before the first intifada turned the West Bank into a conflict zone , Herodium drew some 250,000 people per year .
For the moment I 'm the sole visitor .
At a kiosk I buy a ticket that lets me ascend on foot to the summit .
At the base of the mountain the remains of a royal complex , known as Lower Herodium , sprawl across nearly 40 acres .
Gone are the homes , gardens and stables ; the most recognizable structure is an immense pool , 220 by 150 feet , which is graced with a center island .
A narrow trail hugging the hillside leads me to an opening in the slope , where I enter an enormous cistern now part of a route to the summit , more than 300 feet above the surrounding countryside .
The air inside is pleasantly cool , and the walls are smooth and dry , with patches of original plaster .
I follow a network of tunnels dug during the second Jewish revolt against the Romans in A.D. 135 and enter another , smaller cistern .
Daylight pours in .
I climb a steep staircase and emerge at the summit , in the middle of the palace courtyard .
The palace fortress once reached close to 100 feet high and was surrounded by double concentric walls accented by four cardinal point towers .
Besides living quarters , the upper palace had a triclinium ( a Greco - Roman - style formal dining room lined on three sides by a couch ) and a bathhouse that features a domed , hewn - stone ceiling with an oculus ( round opening ) .
It 's strange to find such a perfectly preserved structure amid the ancient ruins , and it leaves me with an eerie sense of standing both in the past and the present .
Gazing out from the perimeter wall , I see Arab villages and Israeli settlements in three directions .
But to the east cultivation abruptly stops as the desert exerts its authority , plummeting out of sight to the Dead Sea , then rising again as the mountains of Jordan .
Why would Herod build such a prominent fortress — the largest palace complex in the Roman world — on the edge of a desert ?
Though the site had little apparent strategic value , it held profound meaning for Herod .
Born around 73 B.C. , he was the governor of Galilee when , in 40 B.C. , the Parthian Empire conquered Judea ( then under Roman control ) and named a new king , Mattathias Antigonus .
Herod , probably more shrewd than loyal , declared allegiance to Rome and fled Jerusalem with as many as 5,000 people — his family and a contingent of fighting men— under cover of night .
Surging over rocky terrain , the wagon in which Herod 's mother was riding overturned .
Herod drew his sword and was on the verge of suicide when he saw she had survived .
He returned to the battle and fought " not like one that was in distress ... but like one that was excellently prepared for war , " Josephus wrote .
In tribute to his victory and his mother 's survival , he vowed to be buried there .
Herod sought refuge in Petra ( in today 's Jordan ) — capital of the Nabateans , his mother 's people — before heading to Rome .
Three years later , with Rome 's backing , Herod conquered Jerusalem and became king of Judea .
A decade would pass before he would begin work on the remote fortified palace that would fulfill his pledge .
Herod must have given a lot of thought to how Herodium would function , given the lack of a reliable water source and the mountain 's distance from Jerusalem ( in those days , a three - to four - hour trip by horseback ) .
He arranged for spring water to be brought three and a half miles via an aqueduct , relocated the district capital to Herodium ( with all the staff that such a move implied ) and surrounded himself with 10 to 20 trustworthy families .
" Herodium was built to solve the problem he himself created by making a commitment to be buried in the desert , " says Netzer .
" The solution was to build a large palace , a country club — a place of enjoyment and pleasure . "
The summit palace could be seen by Herod 's subjects in Jerusalem , while the tallest of the four towers offered the king pleasant breezes and a gripping view of his domain .
Ongoing excavations by Netzer reveal the impressive variety of facilities that Herod built at his desert retreat , including a royal theater that accommodated some 450 spectators .
Netzer believes it was constructed to entertain Marcus Agrippa , Rome 's second in command and a close friend of the Judean king , who visited Herodium in 15 B.C. Netzer unlocks a plywood door that has been installed on the site and invites me into the royal box , where Herod and his honored guests would have been seated .
The walls were decorated with vivid secco landscape paintings ( colors applied to dry , not wet , plaster ) .
The colors , though subdued now , still feel vibrant , and we gaze at the image of an animal , maybe a gazelle , loping along .
Around 10 B.C. , according to Netzer , Herod oversaw the construction of his mausoleum .
Upon its completion , he undertook the final stage of his self - commemoration by literally increasing the mountain 's height :
Herod 's crew carted gravelly soil and rocks from the surrounding area to Herodium , pouring it all around the summit .
Even with unlimited manpower , it must have been a Sisyphean enterprise to pile all that earth some 65 feet high and comb it over the original slopes like a child 's carefully smoothed sand hill .
" Like a pyramid , " Netzer says , " the entire mountain was turned into a monument . "
The borders of Judea were quiet during Herod 's reign , enabling him to undertake an ambitious building program that brought employment and prosperity to the region .
The major projects he completed include the incomparable Temple in Jerusalem , a stunning winter palace in Jericho , two palaces atop Masada and the harbor at Caesarea .
A palace garden in Jericho was elevated so that people strolling along the colonnades would see the foliage and flowers at eye level .
Still , Herod 's reign is remembered more for its ruthlessness and paranoia than its architectural feats .
He tortured and killed family members , servants and bodyguards , to say nothing of his real enemies .
In an Othello - like rage , Herod even ordered the execution of the woman he loved most — his second wife , Mariamne — believing that she had committed adultery .
Herod 's eldest son and heir apparent , Antipater , convinced the king that two of his other sons were plotting against him — so Herod had them executed .
And when Herod learned that Antipater was planning to poison him , he rose from his bed just five days before he died to order the murder of Antipater .
( As the Roman Emperor Augustus supposedly quipped : " It 's better to be Herod 's pig than his son . " )
In a final act of depravity , Herod imprisoned all the notables of Judea , ordering that they be executed on the day of his death so the country would be plunged into mourning .
But when Herod died , in Jericho at about age 69 — probably of kidney failure exacerbated by a genital infection , according to Aryeh Kasher 's recent biography King Herod : A Persecuted Persecutor — the prisoners were released .
Instead of mourning , rejoicing filled the land .
Josephus wrote that Herod 's body was conveyed to Herodium , " where , in accordance with the directions of the deceased , it was interred . "
The late king was " covered with purple ; and a diadem was put upon his head , and a crown of gold above it , and a scepter in his right hand . "
And so began a mystery that tantalized scholars for centuries .
In the 1860s , Felicien de Saulcy , a French explorer , searched for Herod 's tomb on the island in the center of the vast pool in Lower Herodium .
Father Virgilio Corbo led an excavation at the summit from 1963 to 1967 on behalf of the Franciscan Faculty of Biblical Sciences and Archaeology in Rome .
In 1983 , a team led by Lambert Dolphin , a Silicon Valley geophysicist , used sonar and rock - penetrating radar to identify what Dolphin thought was a burial chamber inside the base of the highest tower on the mountaintop .
Netzer , however , did not find Dolphin 's data convincing enough to redirect his efforts from other , more promising sites — notably a monumental building in the lower complex .
Moreover , Netzer and others argue that entombment in the tower would have been unthinkable , because Jewish law proscribed burial within a living space .
Barbara Burrell , a classics professor at the University of Cincinnati , wrote in 1999 that interring Herod inside the palace " would have horrified both Romans and Jews , neither of whom dined with their dead . "
Netzer smiles as he recalls that when he investigated the cisterns and tunnels within Herodium in the early 1970s , he was actually standing less than ten feet from the tomb , which he later found halfway up the eastern slope .
But Netzer instead continued to focus his attention on the foot of the mountain .
" We kept getting hotter and hotter , " says Ya'akov Kalman , one of Netzer 's longtime associates , " but nothing came of it . "
Netzer believes that Herod originally intended to be buried in the lower complex , but for unknown reasons changed his mind and chose this other location .
In 2005 , having completed his work at Lower Herodium without revealing a burial chamber , Netzer turned once again to the mountain .
In April 2007 , his team discovered hundreds of red limestone fragments buried in the mountainside .
Many bore delicate rosettes — a motif common to Jewish ossuaries and some sarcophagi of the era .
Reassembling some of the pieces , Netzer concluded they were all that remained of a sarcophagus more than eight feet long with a gabled cover .
The high quality of the craftsmanship suggested the sarcophagus was fit for a king .
Plus , the extent of the fragmentation suggested that people had deliberately smashed it — a plausible outcome for the hated monarch 's resting place .
Based on coins and other items found nearby , Netzer surmises that the desecration occurred during the first Jewish revolt against the Romans , from A.D. 66 to 73 .
( As Kasher notes in his biography , " Herod the Great " was , for the Jews , an ironic title , designating an arrogant monarch who scorned the religious laws of his own people . )
Within two weeks of finding the rosette fragments , workers unearthed the remains of two white limestone sarcophagi strewn about the tomb .
Netzer believes one could have held Herod 's fourth wife , Malthace , mother of his son Archelaus .
The third sarcophagus might be that of Archelaus ' second wife , who , based on the accounts of Josephus , was likely named Glaphyra .
Workers also found a few bone fragments at the tomb site , though Netzer is skeptical that an analysis of the scant remains will yield any meaningful information about the identities of those buried at Herodium .
Netzer acknowledges that absent further evidence , the rosette - decorated sarcophagus cannot be definitively assigned to Herod .
Duane Roller , professor emeritus of Greek and Latin at Ohio State University and author of the 1998 book The Building Program of Herod the Great , concedes that the tomb belonged to someone of noble lineage , but is convinced that Herod 's burial site is at the base of the summit tower .
For one thing , Roller notes its similarity to other tombs built in Italy at that time .
The lack of an inscription particularly troubles some scholars .
David Jacobson , a researcher affiliated with University College London and the Palestine Exploration Fund , suggests that a sarcophagus of a very important personage would have been inscribed , and he points to that of Queen Helena of Adiabene , which was recovered from her royal mausoleum in Jerusalem .
But others , including Netzer , point out that it was not common for Jews of that era to inscribe sarcophagi .
Besides , it 's plausible that Herodium itself was the inscription ; the entire edifice declares , " Behold me ! "
Clad in work shorts , hiking shoes and a well - worn leather Australian bush hat , Netzer scampers up the path to the tomb site .
The septuagenarian offers me a hand as I seek a toehold .
He greets the crew in Hebrew and Arabic as we pass from one section , where workers wield pickaxes , to another , where a young architect sketches decorative elements .
The tomb site is nearly barren , but the podium that bore the royal sarcophagus hints at magnificence .
It is set into the stony earth , partially exposed and unmarred , the joints between the smooth white ashlars ( slabs of square stone ) so fine as to suggest they were cut by a machine .
Netzer has also found the corner pilasters ( columns partially built into the walls ) , enabling him to estimate that the mausoleum , nestled against the side of the mountain , stood on a base 30 by 30 feet and was some 80 feet high — as tall as a seven - story building .
It was built of a whitish limestone called meleke ( Arabic for " royal " ) that was also used in Jerusalem and in the nearby Tomb of Absalom — named after the rebellious son of King David , but likely the tomb of the Judean King Alexander Jannaeus .
The mausoleum 's design is similar to the Tomb of Absalom , which dates to the first century B.C. and is notable for its conical roof , a motif also seen at Petra .
The remnants of the mausoleum 's facade are composed of the three elements of classical entablature : architraves ( ornamental beams that sit atop columns ) , friezes ( horizontal bands above the architraves ) and cornices ( crown molding found on the top of buildings ) .
Netzer has also found pieces of five decorative urns .
The urn was a funerary motif , used notably at Petra .
Despite the work still to be done — excavating , assembling , publishing the data — Netzer is clearly gratified by what he has learned , which is , he says , the " secret " of Herodium : how Herod found a way to keep his vow and be buried in the desert .
" In my field , ancient archaeology , you could say that once circumstances give me the opportunity to be quite certain , it 's not in my character to have further doubts . "

A farmer works on his paddy field against the backdrop of monsoon clouds at Shanmura on the outskirts of Agartala , capital of India 's northeastern state of Tripura , July 19 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jayanta Dey
PATNA , India ( Reuters ) - Farmers in an eastern Indian state have asked their unmarried daughters to plow parched fields naked in a bid to embarrass the weather gods to bring some badly needed monsoon rain , officials said on Thursday .
Witnesses said the naked girls in Bihar state plowed the fields and chanted ancient hymns after sunset to invoke the gods .
They said elderly village women helped the girls drag the plows .
“ They ( villagers ) believe their acts would get the weather gods badly embarrassed , who in turn would ensure bumper crops by sending rains , ” Upendra Kumar , a village council official , said from Bihar ’s remote Banke Bazaar town .
“ This is the most trusted social custom in the area and the villagers have vowed to continue this practice until it rains very heavily . ”
India this year suffered its worst start to the vital monsoon rains in eight decades , causing drought in some states .

SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) 
Apple has shut down one of the most compelling features on Palm 's rival Pre smart phone .
Apple has crippled the Pre 's ability to act like an iPod .
Users of the recently released Pre had been able to put music on the device by using Apple 's free iTunes software — a unique twist for a device not made by Apple .
But Apple updated iTunes to block this feature Wednesday .
Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr said the update " disables devices falsely pretending to be iPods , including the Palm Pre . " Copyright 2009 The Associated Press .

Photographer Feng Jiang holds a Ph.D from the University of York .
These are the absolute best pictures of China we ’ve ever seen .
Travel photography in China reaches new heights .
The splendor of the land complemented by growing skills and technology makes for a fascinating viewing .
Here are a few samples :
At 5 pm , last Friday .
America was winding down for the Bank Holiday weekend : blowing the tops off Budweisers , barbecuing hotdogs , driving SUVs into sun-drenched ball - parks , and enjoying the myriad benefits of daily existence in the most prosperous nation on God 's green Earth .
It 's a " slow news day " , when the treadmill of current affairs grinds to a halt , and average Joes everywhere feel happy just to be alive .
Everywhere , that is , except in the New York TV studios of Fox News .
Here , a man called Glenn Beck is 10 seconds into his daily talkshow , and already he 's reached a rolling boil .
" What are the mainstream media missing ? " he wonders , bounding onstage like the Duracell Bunny .
" I mean , besides EVERYTHING ?
You are not going to BELIEVE some of the crap that 's going on in the world today ! "
And so it begins : a fresh dose of outrage from the latest " hot " voice in US conservatism .
In a live TV career spanning just four months , Beck , a 45 - year - old radio jock , author , and occasional stand - up comedian has turned what was previously Fox 's " graveyard shift " – between 5 - 6 pm each weekday , when offices are emptying , but punters are n't yet home – into something close to required viewing .

Since launching in mid-January , Beck has increased the audience for his time slot by more than 150 percent , to 2.3 million regular viewers .
This makes him the third most - watched person on US cable news .
To quote a recent New York Times profile , the chubby , grey - haired impresario , who first appeared on America 's TV screens in a pre-recorded CNN programme in 2006 : is " suddenly one of the most powerful media voices for the nation 's conservative populist anger . "
Today , Beck is talking economics .
He huffs and puffs about public finances , scrawling figures on a chalk - board which suggest that President Obama 's fiscal regime has set the United States on a path to Third World status .
Then he interviews some Reaganite pundits , who mostly agree with him .
Finally , he introduces his daily " hot list " – news stories the " mainstream " news media has been wilfully ignoring .
This is Beck - land , where things tend to be black and white .
Taxes are bad ; guns are good .
Abortion is bad ;
God is good .
Gays are " faggots , " torture is " enhanced interrogation " , public healthcare should actually be called " socialised medicine , " and so on .
Global warming , of course , is a myth cooked up by left - wing scientists in a conspiracy to prevent Americans fulfilling their patriotic duty to guzzle gas .
He is , of course , the consummate showman : like a heterosexual Graham Norton , albeit with a mildly psychotic demeanour and a talent for speaking to the frustrations and prejudices of the disaffected .
The show 's opening credits consist of a dramatic countdown ( " 3 - 2 - 1... Beck ! " ) , announce " the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment " , and are often evangelical .
" If you believe this country is great and the Government is trying to make us slaves , break open the shackles and stand up ! " viewers were told last week .
" Come on !
Follow me ! "
Anywhere else in the world , this kind of schtick might seem overblown ; verging on the comic , even .
But , in Barack Obama 's America , it strikes a noisy chord .
With an alleged socialist in the White House , and amid a financial collapse that has thrown much the traditional media into crisis , Beck and a small breed of TV and radio commentators just like him , working in supposedly outdated mediums , are at the centre of a vibrant growth industry .
It 's an influential one , too .
In January , Barack Obama 's incoming Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel , told CBS that the nation 's heavyweight champion of right - wing radio controversialists , Rush Limbaugh , had now become firmly established in one of the most important political roles in the land : as " the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party . "
His point , which inspired a welter of debate , was simple : with conservatism apparently on the ropes , and many voters unable to name a single truly inspiring Republican figure , the so - called " shock jocks " have taken the place of politicians .
A group of talented , opinionated commentators – all of them conforming to the stereotype : white , angry and male – are driving Republican politics .

It 's a valid argument , if the ratings are anything to go by .
On TV , Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity , both proud conservatives , are the nation 's two most - watched cable anchormen .
On Radio , Limbaugh pulls in up to 20 million weekly listeners , only marginally less than the audience American Idol .
Hannity manages another 15 million .
Meanwhile , there 's barely a single committed left - wing voice at the top table of radio talk hosts .
On TV , Fox News has achieved an almost unprecedented dominance of the cable news marketplace .
Rupert Murdoch 's right - leaning network ( with the provocative motto : " fair and balanced " ) boasts more than twice as many viewers as any of its rivals , giving it a status much like the Daily Mail during the Blair era : the leading voice of opposition in a nation bereft of any coherent political leadership on the centre - right .
The rise of the talking class is also noisily evident in the headlines that it constantly attracts in the " mainstream media " ( the phrase almost every conservative pundit uses to describe supposedly liberal US newspapers and TV networks ) .
Beck and his peers do not just discuss the news : they have also now become the news .
Last week , Glenn rocked - up on The View , a popular daytime TV chatshow along the lines of Loose Women , and was promptly called " a lying sack of dog mess " , to his face , by co-host Whoopi Goldberg .
His crime : telling a very minor fib about a recent meeting they'd had to listeners of the radio show he broadcasts each morning .
In a somewhat grovelling manner , he admitted to having " mis-spoken " .
But his ratings soared .
Hannity , meanwhile , is at the centre of controversy after welshing on an agreement to undergo waterboarding , to prove his thesis that the practise does n't amount to torture .
Then there 's Michael Savage , the country 's third most - popular radio talk host , who Jacqui Smith recently stuck on a list of 22 undesirables and extremists banned from Britain for having allegedly " fallen into the category of fomenting hatred . "
Savage , whose dog - whistle right - wingery does n't actually extend to advocating violence , responded by launching a defamation lawsuit against the Home Secretary .
Its success ( or otherwise ) remains to be seen .
But his 10 million listeners ( no doubt more , now he 's been properly name - checked ) enjoyed the poetic pleasure of hearing him describe Smith as a " lunatic , " " witch " , " monster " , " lowlife " , " tin-pot dictator " and " beer swilling mutt " .
Here , in three kerfuffles , is right wing shock - jockery at its best .
Its advocates are loud and provocative .
They intersperse bar - room insult with occasional wit , and extraordinary rhetorical flourishes .
They also speak directly to the heart of an alienated sector of Middle America , of currently indeterminate size .
Beck and his colleagues are alternately noble sages , over - opinionated rabble - rousers , and extraordinarily talented entertainers .
On the attack , they are formidable .
In large doses they can be overbearing .
And at present , their importance revolves around a billion - dollar question : will they shape the shattered Republican Party 's route back to power , or condemn it to a generation of obscurity ?
There is an old showbusiness saying , beloved by agents , box - office managers , and the sort of populist stars critics hate but middlebrow punters adore , which dictates that to find out exactly what 's going on in the rich and endlessly varied world of entertainment , all you ever need to do is to follow the money .
By that token , the biggest and most important pay deal struck by any star , in any medium – from sports , to pop music , to Hollywood films , to broadcasting – in the last 12 months was the eight - year , $ 400 m ( £ 251 m ) contract that committed Rush Limbaugh to the syndication firm Clear Channel and was signed in July 2008 .
The deal saw Limbaugh , a notorious , cigar - chomping 57 - year - old , whose daily talkshow is syndicated to 600 US radio stations , garner a pay rise of $ 10 m annually and a signing bonus of around $ 100 m .
As he inked the agreement , he announced : " I am not retiring until every American agrees with me . "
One thing the nation does agree on is the scale of Limbaugh 's success .
He boasts perhaps the most committed , and certainly the most lucrative following of any news commentator in the history of humanity .
Though his reach is limited by his reluctance to appear on television , he is the big beast to whom all other conservative pundits aspire .
And the cornerstone of his success is simple economics .
Talk radio's business model has its roots in two developments that arrived in the US in the late Eighties .
The first was political .
In 1987 , the Reagan administration scrapped the Fairness Doctrine , a government policy requiring broadcasters to report political issues in a manner that was deemed " honest , equitable and balanced . "
So began Limbaugh 's rise .
The second change was technical .
During the Sixties and Seventies , music stations began shifting en masse to FM broadcasting , with its superior sound quality .
By 1987 , the AM airwaves were remarkably uncluttered .
In a vast country , full of major conurbations , new talk stations were able to buy up local broadcasting licences for a song .
Operators like Limbaugh started being syndicated to local networks across America .
Suddenly talkshows made by one , noisy man in a small room , with a couple of producers manning the telephones , began to reach audiences of millions .
It was a lucrative model : low costs , but high income , since advertisers loved the fact that talk radio's listeners were fiercely loyal , with a high disposable income ( they were , after all , conservatives ) .
Today , the result is a vast meritocracy of talent : thousands of pundits , working for hundreds of stations , compete for share in one of the biggest marketplaces in global broadcasting .
It 's a cut - throat medium , in which the strong thrive and the weak are killed off .
To make it , above all , you must be blessed with singular abilities to keep viewers and listeners from switching over .
" There 's really only one rule in talk radio , and that is that , whether you 're on the left or the right , you can never be uninteresting , " says Dennis Prager , a syndicated conservative host based in Los Angeles .
" You can be an idiot .
You can be a moral fool .
You can be primitive .
But you can not be boring .
Every sentence must hold the attention . "
This led to the rise of the Nineties " shock jock " – men ( it was always men ) who would push at extremes , or maintain a constant wattage of outrage , to keep their followings .
The Christian right , traditionally obsessed with tribal social issues , like abortion and gun control , and latterly gay marriage , made an ideal audience for their fodder .
In Prager 's eyes , there are further reasons why the most popular talk pundits have always been drawn from Republican ranks .
" Firstly , there 's much less need for left - wing hosts , because everything else is left wing .
You 've already got liberal commentary in the mainstream media , in TV news , newspapers , movies , so the thirst for yet another left - wing voice does not go all that deep . "
" Secondly , and this is my own opinion , I think that left - wing voices tend to be emotive rather than thought through .
Left - wing radio is far more emotion driven , calling opponents by names for example , than conservative radio ...
They 're always calling people bastards and bitches , and it just gets boring after a while . "
The icing on the cake , for any controversialist , is someone to rail against .
The most successful right - wing voices of the modern era emerged during the presidency of Bill Clinton , which also spawned The Drudge Report , the right - leaning website that 's still one of the world 's most influential news aggregation mediums .
Little surprise , then , that the fortunes of conservative talk radio are again buoyant .
" For me , this is the best of times , and the worst of times , " says Hugh Hewitt , a conservative radio host from Orange County , whose afternoon show is syndicated on 120 US radio stations .
" The Republicans are out of power , and I wish I did n't have so much to talk about , but our audiences are snowballing .
The TSL [ time spent listening ] figures are through the roof .
People who used to tune in for five to 10 minutes are now staying for an hour . "
Hewitt , a relatively - moderate voice , is confident that the ebb and flow of politics mean that he and his colleagues , with their uncanny ability to tell viewers how to think and why to think it , will inevitably shape the Republican Party 's future success :
" We were part of the cycle that led to the ascendancy of the red majority from 1994 until 2008 , " he says .
" And we will have our time again . "
There is , however , a very large potential spanner in the works .
It revolves around demographics .
Put bluntly , right - leaning talk 's audience is dying off .
A recent profile of Limbaugh by Vanity Fair claimed that the average age of his listeners is 67 and rising .
Fox 's average viewer is said to be in their seventh decade .
In a changing world , against a President catapulted to power with a staggering majority of the youth , they may ( in the long term ) turn out to be onto a losing bet .
.........
•••
A telling demonstration of the lie of the Republican party occurred in February this year , when Michael Steele , chairman of the Republican National Committee , and supposedly one of the party 's most powerful elected figures , attempted on CNN to distance himself from Rush Limbaugh , describing him as an " incendiary " figure who should not be taken seriously , since : " his whole thing is entertainment . "
It took 48 hours for Steele to be hauled back onto the airwaves , issuing a fulsome apology to Limbaugh , whose listeners had bombarded his office , and those of Republican donors , with angry complaints .
The incident quite naturally raises serious questions about who , exactly , is running the show .
Steele is elected .
Limbaugh is not .
Some Republicans believe the party needs a strong conservative hand on the tiller , now more than ever , arguing that no political organisation can capture the middle ground from which elections are won until they are in touch with their ideological soul .
People such as Christopher Ruddy , the chief executive of the conservative news organisation Newsmax , touts Glenn Beck , and others , as part of the solution to the party 's woes .
" There 's an old saying that Democrats fall in love but Republicans fall in line , " he says .
" The party will fall in line eventually , but there 's no particular hurry for them to do that now , " he says .
" Reagan had this saying that ' you 've got to preach to the choir first ' . "
It 's difficult not to wonder , however , if Barack Obama 's Democrats are n't also cheering the rise of conservative talk .
Rahm Emanuel was , after all , hardly subtle in talking up Limbaugh on the airwaves .
So long as their opponents are perceived as shouty ideologues – rather than say the moderate , Colin Powell Republicans of this world – they pose no serious threat .
" One of the reasons you keep seeing Rush touted at the moment is because the folks who support the current administration want to keep him out there , " says Jason Linkins , who writes on media affairs for the liberal Huffington Post website .
" If you look at polling , his ideas are n't that popular , and he does n't have a strong personal approval rating .
His show gets huge ratings because it 's great entertainment , not because people necessarily agree with him . "
In other words , the angry white men are part of the problem .
Their greatest gifts – their communication , showmanship , and fabulous lines of attack may be exaggerating a potential built on shaky foundations .
They could be convincing the Republicans ' remaining believers that an ideology made for a different era may one day win back power , without any need for a makeover .
This problem was perfectly captured a month ago , by none other than Glenn Beck .
Broadcasting a special edition of his brilliantly Barnumesque programme from an anti-tax " tea party " , he finished another hour - long broadcast by breaking down in tears at the size of the middle - class crowd who had turned out .
" I 'm sorry ... I just love my country , " he explained , apparently overcome by emotion .
" And I fear for it ...
It seems like the voices of our leaders , and the special interests , and the media ... like they 're just surrounding us .
And it 's intimidating .
But you know what ?
Pull away the curtain and you 'll realise there ain't anyone there .
There 's just a few people pressing the buttons , and their voices are really weak .
The truth is .
They do n't surround us .
We ... surround ... them . "
Fighting talk :
In their own words
On Obama : " We are being told that we have to hope he succeeds ... because his father was black . "
Rush Limbaugh
On the Presidency : " Can we pray for the re-election of George Bush ? " Sean Hannity
On religion : " It does n't say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state . "
Sean Hannity
On climate change : " If you believe the mainstream media hype , you 'd think that every time you drive your SUV , the Earth 's temperature rises six degrees . "
Glenn Beck
On waterboarding : " I am for enhanced interrogation .
I do n't believe waterboarding is torture ...
I 'll do it .
I 'll do it for charity . "
Sean Hannity
On the UN : " I just wish [ Hurricane ] Katrina had only hit the United Nations building , nothing else , just had flooded them out , and I would n't have rescued them . "
Bill O'Reilly
On weapons of mass destruction : " If the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it 's clean , he has nothing , I will apologise to the nation , and I will not trust the Bush Administration again , all right ? "
Bill O'Reilly
On race : " I could n't get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia 's restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City .
I mean , it was exactly the same , even though it 's run by blacks , primarily black patronship . "
Bill O'Reilly
On Islam : " I have a number of things that I am gonna demand and one of them is that no more Muslim immigrants come into this country .
No more mosques be permitted to be built in this country ... and yes we need racial profiling immediately ... "
Michael Savage
On immigration : " You do n't have the right to protest .
You 're allowed no demonstrations , no foreign flag waving , no political organising ... you 're a foreigner , shut your mouth or get out . "
Rush Limbaugh
On politics : " Good for you , you have a heart , you can be a liberal .
Now , couple your heart with your brain , and you can be a conservative . "
Glenn Beck
On homosexuality : " The gay and lesbian mafia wants our children .
If it can win their souls and their minds , it knows their bodies will follow .
Of course , it wants to homosexualise the whole country , not just the children " Michael Savage
On feminism : " Feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society . "
Rush Limbaugh

Kristol does TDS again .
I 'm not thrilled that this conservative hatchet man gets valuable air time on CC as much as he has , but Stewart does kick him around .
Jon gets Bill Kristol to admit that the government run health care for the military is the best care on earth and then tells us that ordinary Americans are n't deserving of the best health care available .
See , Bloody Bill does believe in rationing health care after all .
So Kristolthat admits that government run health care is the best , but Americans should only have shitty health care plans with insurance companies making huge profits .
( It starts around the eleven minute mark ) rough transcript .
Stewart :
Why no health care ,
Why no health care reform for Americans because the military fighting for us , gave it up .
Why do you hate America ?
Stewart :
Why not ?
Why should n't the government provide some sort of care to the 50 million that are uninsured ?
Kristol : No , well the military has a different health system than the rest of Americans .
Stewart :
It 's a public system , no ?
Kristol : Yea , they do n't have an option they 're all in the military .
Stewart :
Why do n't we go with that ?
Kristol : ( Stupid look comes across his face . )
I do n't know .
Is military health care what you really ... first of all it's really expensive , they deserve it , the military ...
Stewart :
But people in public do not ?
Kristol : No , the American public do not deserve the same ...
Stewart :
Are you saying Americans should n't have access to the same plan health care that we give the soldiers ?
Kristol : Yes , to our soldiers ?
Absolutely .
Stewart : Really ?
Kristol : I think the one thing if you become a soldier ...
Stewart :
So you just said , Bill Kristol just said that the government can run a first class health care system .
Kristol : Sure it can .
Stewart : A government run health care system is better than the private health care system .
You just said that ...
Kristol : I do n't know if it 's better .
Stewart : No , you just said it was better .
Kristol : I did n't say it was better all around .
Stewart : No , you said it was better .
You said it 's the best , it 's a little more expensive , but it 's better .
I just want to write this down .
The government runs the best health care ...
Stewart : I understand that so what you are suggesting is that the government could run the best health care system for Americans , but it 's a little too costly so we should have the shitty insurance companies health care .
Kristol : I 'm suggesting our soldiers deserve better health care ...
Stewart :
They deserve the best .
They have the best government run health care money can buy .
This is a good moment to be a Liberal Democrat .
Constitutional reform grips Westminster .
The bigger parties are being discredited by expenses - the double departure yesterday of Labour 's Margaret Moran and the Tories ' Julie Kirkbride symbolising shared disgrace .
Lib Dems have been tainted , too , but not on the same scale , and the party can claim to have championed reform when it was unfashionable .
Nick Clegg 's proposal yesterday for a 100 - day revolution was eye - catching , but most of the ideas in it have been backed by his party for years .
The difference is that other parties are now competing to match them .
All this ought to put a spring in Lib Dem steps .
The party has had an unhappy last few years , dumping two leaders while searching for a cause to equal opposition to the Iraq war .
And Mr Clegg 's first year in charge did not go down well with voters .
David Cameron took the market for fresh - faced public schoolboy leaders ; Gordon Brown looked like the heavyweight progressive .
No one seemed quite sure what Mr Clegg wanted to be .
Vince Cable cut through the economic crisis with an intelligent mix of diagnosis and cure .
But that did not help Mr Clegg build a public personality of his own .
He seemed nice , but a bit anonymous .
This is changing .
The Lib Dem leader pushed for Gurkha rights , and was rewarded when MPs passed a Lib Dem motion in the Commons for the first time in decades .
He has run a bold pro-European campaign in the current elections ( though no one has noticed ) .
Labour 's woes allow him to pitch for progressive votes .
He is putting his energies into building a base in urban Labour heartlands in northern cities , in the hope of ending his party 's dependence on winning Tory votes in remote rural seats .
The Lib Dems might almost claim to be Britain 's only national party : able to compete in Sheffield or Liverpool as easily as they do in Truro .
So there is plenty of scope for self - congratulation .
The Lib Dems have been ahead of the curve on the three great contemporary crises : climate change , the constitution and the economy .
That is quite an achievement for a small party which struggles most of the time to get reported .
But it brings two linked problems .
The first is that voters may not reward the party just for being sensible .
Next week 's elections could go badly .
The Lib Dems , who face losing their two county councils - and some MEPs , thanks to a cut in British representation .
But more than that the party needs to define its strategy .
Mr Clegg does not want to lead an insurgent thinktank .
He talks of replacing Labour as a progressive force .
It could happen .
But the search for the elusive breakthrough is the ancient curse of third - party politics .

As i suck at baking ( so no way in hell i will attempt this , as ive only made one really really good cake ever ) would
It be possible to help you guys judge ?
More for other peoples sake .
I know cakes can take well , infuriating long time to do , and I know if I was doing this , I would most likely opt to record the process via some form of camcorder or webcam or the like , as well , its more useful than pictures to me .
Could contestents opt for this route , and send in snippits of video of states to show what they were doing ?
or do you guys not want video ?

Many boys hone their skills and learn a trade whilst still teenagers
As one of the world 's leading suppliers of ready made garments , Bangladesh frequently encounters hostile criticism over the use of child labour in its textile industry .
Western retailers have rushed to assure conscience - stricken consumers that steps are taken to eradicate the practice , and in 2006 the Bangladeshi government passed a new labour law .
It enshrines the rights of young workers to receive a fixed salary , compensation in case of accident , proper holidays and to have access to education .
But that law is only designed to help children in the textile sector , so it does nothing to ease the problem of child labour in one of the poorest countries in the world .
Missed opportunities
The Bangladesh constitution provides basic education free of charge to all children aged between six and 10 - although some figures suggest that only 50 % are currently attending school .
If I do n't take home 60 taka ( $ 1 ) a day , someone in my family will go hungry
Mijan , a 13 - year - old labourer
Of those , only one in five continues with secondary education while just one in 25 will eventually proceed to higher education .
The reason for such low attendance is the poor financial circumstances of the most families .
Some reports indicate that in Bangladesh , one in 10 children has a job which takes up most of their waking hours .
Many suffer poor health as a result of hazardous conditions .
Child labour is not illegal in Bangladesh , although the law discourages children under the age of 14 from working in factories .
It is not uncommon to walk past a building site and see youths as young as 11 carrying baskets of bricks or cement on their heads .
Mijan has yet to reach his 14th birthday , but he is proud to be doing heavy labour for 12 hours a day , six days a week .
Many households employ domestic help to do the cleaning and cooking " If I do n't take home 60 taka ( $ 1 ) a day , someone in my family will go hungry , " he says .
Widespread abuse
For girls , the work tends to be based in the home - an estimated two million domestic workers are employed in the cities of Dhaka and Chittagong alone .
These girls often begin working when they are eight years old and can be subjected to violence and sexual abuse without any formal jurisdiction to protect their wellbeing .
Over 300 deaths of young domestic workers were reported in the press between 2001 and 2008 .
Officially , child labour is forbidden in factories which make garments for export - but many children are still drawn into the home - working garment business .
Thirteen - year - old Mitu Akhtar says she started working with a sewing machine when she was seven years old , and had to give all the money that she earned to her parents .
These children are so poor that many of them have not had any food when they arrive in the morning
Headmistress Afroza Khan
She quit school when she was nine .
" I 've never had any time to play with my friends , " she explains .
Mitu is now being trained in a centre for former child labourers run by the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies ( BILS ) .
She is learning to read and write and is picking up the basics of how to use a sewing machine safely and efficiently .
She says her ambition is to be a tailor .
Nazrul Khan , the president of BILS , say the focus is on finding children from industrial regions of the country whose parents have lost their jobs .
Poor parents need their children to earn money rather than go to school " We come to an agreement with the family that , if we educate and train one of their children , and support them to find employment , there will be no child labour in that family , " he says .
Difficult choices
In a primary school near a huge slum in Dhaka , pupils aged between six and 10 include the children of rickshaw drivers and women who break bricks for a living .
" These children are so poor that many of them have not had any food when they arrive in the morning and their clothes are in terrible condition , like rags , " says headmistress Afroza Khanan .
Most of the pupils have to go to work as soon as they have finished their lessons , in order to help their parents by selling cups of tea or other odd jobs .
She is also deeply concerned about the children who do not go to school because they are working .
Sometimes she virtually drags them into the classroom where they face books and blackboards for the first time - and experience the discipline of lessons .
" The sad reality is that these families depend on the children financially , " she laments .
" What I would like to see is a programme to motivate parents to send their children to school .
The government could offer a small sum of money to each student who attends , " she says .
" Mothers tell me that would make all the difference when it comes to deciding whether to send their kids to school , " she adds .
Bleak future Some politicians support Afroza Khanan 's proposal but so far the government maintains it cannot afford it .
Reports say 350,000 youngsters live and work on the streets of Dhaka Even if such a scheme was introduced , it would be difficult to determine how many families should receive the money and how it would be paid .
The last time the government examined the issue , it concluded about four million children have full or part - time jobs .
The Bangladeshi Labour Institute believes the number is closer to eight million and is rising as the population grows .
" When society has such a large population who are not educated , who are aggrieved , not skilled , unhealthy and unhappy , it is a threat to social stability and economic growth , " BILS president Nazrul Khan believes .
The fear is that the next generation of Bangladeshis will be forced into work at an early age unless something breaks the cycle of poverty .
In a country where at least 40 % of the population lives in poverty , child labour is often regarded as a necessity .
Despite the economic progress of the past 20 years , there is little to suggest that society 's attitude is changing .
However , if more children can receive an education it might provide future generations with an alternative .

They say music is the food of love , and who does n’t love food – especially a free lunch ?
Ever since Napster blazed its way onto the Internet in 1999 , people all over the world have been enjoying the easy availability of free downloads of copyrighted music .
The record industry threw a fit and they have n’t stopped since .
They argue that they are losing too much money to piracy and besides that , why should these criminals be getting their product for nothing ?
They say that quality will suffer as labels are forced to downsize and be more selective with the bands they sign .
The music industry will die because of this !
Then there ’s the other side of the argument , that CDs cost far too much and that most music promoted by the record industry is vapid and soul - less .
When this is the case , why should the consumer fork out for their product only to discover they ’ve been sold the sonic equivalent of snake oil ?
Whichever side of the argument you hold as your own personal opinion ( and who wants to stand side by side with the industry that gave Fred Durst a recording contract ? ) we at AMOG thought it was time to have a quick look back through history at the various formats music has been sold on and pose the question : if the dollar was worth then what it is now , how much would I be paying ?
The Phonographic Cylinder
This is the big grand - daddy of consumer music media .
Invented in 1877 by Thomas Edison ( based on somebody else ’s idea ) , they enjoyed their heyday between 1888 and 1915 before being replaced by the Gramaphone record , the earliest form of what we consider Vinyl .
A machine to play one of these cylinders on would set you back $ 125 dollars back in the day , with the cylinders themselves retailing for $ 4 .
Taking into account inflation that ’s $ 2,685.72 for the machine and $ 85.94 per cylinder !
The Phonographic Disk
The cylinder is dead , long live the disk !
The phonograph is where that mainstay of DJs started out its life , all the way back in the 1870s .
In those early days records were made of all kinds of wacky materials like metal , hard rubber and bug resin ( shellac ) .
Shellac was the big thing until vinyl became the standard material in 1948 .
Shellac records are still collected today in the form of 78s ( referring to the Rotations Per Minute the record was to be played at ) as a lot of the early jazz and blues artists we ’re recorded onto them before promptly dying of heroin overdoses , being stabbed in bar - room brawls or drinking themselves to death .
Information regarding how much these used to retail for is somewhat sketchy , at least online .
Shellac records were very brittle and shattered easily which explains all those loony tunes cartoons in which we saw records being smashed over Elmer Fudd ’s head .
Vinyl would just bounce off , see ?
Vinyl
When we think of phonograph records these days , vinyl is what we envision .
Made from more resilient material than shellac , and producing a much better sound , vinyl was the main man for playing music at home right up until the 80s when cassette tape sales eclipsed it .
In the 1960s a single ( or a 45 in vinyl parlance ) would of set you back 69 cents , which works out at about $ 5 in today ’s money .
During the 70s , albums ( LPs ) retailed for between $ 2.97 - $ 5.99 which comes out at $ 11.74-$23.68 .
By 1984 an album was going for between $ 6 - $ 7 which in 2009 cash - money is a scale of $ 12.28 -$ 14.33 – not much change from the 70s !
These days vinyl is virtually the exclusive domain of dance music aficionados , DJs and indie snobs .
On the Tower Records website Radiohead ’s “ OK Computer ” will set you back 21 bucks !
A hip hop single ?
Still logging in at about $ 5 .
8 - Track
This ill - fated format did n’t last very long .
Invented in 1964 , they did n’t really take off until the Ford motor company started offering them as an extra in 1966 .
That made them a massive overnight success , with 65,000 8 - track decks being installed in that year alone .
An 8 - track copy of your favorite album would cost you about the same as a vinyl copy in the 70s , which accounting for the passage of time would be between $ 11 and $ 24 .
By 1983 , the major record labels had – thankfully – forgotten all about them in favor of cassette tapes .
Cassette Tape
Despite being invented in the 60s , tape did n’t really become popular until the 80s .
The sound quality was somewhat lacking in comparison to vinyl .
An album on tape in the 80s would cost you $ 7 , about 14 bucks these days .
What was truly revolutionary about cassette tapes was that you could buy them blank and use them to record your record collection onto , providing you with a handy and portable copy of your music , or even a compilation of your favorite tracks .
These could then be swapped between your friends – and thus music piracy was born .
The mix - tape was the analogue precursor to the playlist !
In the UK the British Phonograph Institute ran an advertising campaign that declared that home - taping was killing music , echoing the ravings of the RIAA today .
Strangely enough , music survived .
I ’m sure it will find a way to continue today .
A leading credit rating agency has revised down its outlook for the UK economy due to concerns about its significant debt burden .
Standard and Poor 's downgraded its view of the UK to " negative " from " stable " for the first time since it started analysing its public finances in 1978 .
It said the UK 's finances were deteriorating faster than expected .
The change came as data confirmed that new government borrowing has soared , to a record of almost £ 8.5 bn in April .
WHY IT MATTERS
A credit downgrade could make it more expensive for the UK to borrow money
The higher cost of borrowing increases government spending , and could mean higher taxes Bringing down the total level of debt may be politically difficult as it will require tough spending curbs and tax rises
Markets fall worldwide on outlook The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) said public sector net borrowing rose to £ 8.46 bn this April compared to £ 1.84bn in the same month last year .
Government coffers have been hit by higher social benefits payments and lower tax receipts as unemployment has risen and businesses have closed or reduced output .
S&P said the outlook for the UK economy had deteriorated because of massive borrowing to deal with the recession and the banking crisis .
The revision sent the pound lower , reversing recent gains .
One pound fell back three cents against the dollar after the S&P statement , to $ 1.5514 from $ 1.5817 .
Blow to UK Standard and Poor 's did not change the UK 's triple - A rating , but said it was at risk without a credible plan to put its debts on a " secure downward trajectory " by the next government .
If the credit rating was downgraded , it could lead to higher borrowing costs if it makes international investors less likely to buy Treasury bonds .
In the past , revised outlooks have lead to downgrades in around 37 % of cases .
S&P said that government debt could reach 100 % of GDP by 2013 - a level it said was incompatible , if sustained , with the top credit rating .
Currently , public debt is 53 % of GDP , according to the latest ONS figures .
The new outlook for the UK could lead to higher borrowing costs if it makes international investors less likely to buy UK Treasury bonds .
Putting British sovereign debt on negative outlook is not as bad as being assessed for possible downgrade , which almost always leads to a downgrade

One reason it has been changed is the belief by the ratings agency that the government will eventually be liable for costs of between £ 100bn to £ 145bn ( between 7 % and 10 % of GDP ) for bailing out the banking system - more than double the cost estimated by the Treasury .
Treasury minister Stephen Timms told the BBC that the department had " set out plans in the Budget to halve the deficit over the next four years and to bring the public finances back into balance in the medium term " .
He added : " That is the discipline that is needed at the moment and that is the discipline that we are delivering . "
And Mr Timms pointed out that other ratings agencies had not changed their view , " so Standard and Poor 's is on its own on this " .
For the Conservatives , shadow chancellor George Osborne said that " Labour are putting our economic stability at risk by refusing to face up to the debt crisis they have created . "
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable called on the government to " come clean about how it intends to pay back its debt " or risk " a further deterioration in Britain 's rating " .
Forecast at risk Mr Darling 's borrowing forecast may be too optimistic
The new figures suggest that the government may miss its forecast of public borrowing of £ 175bn for this financial year 2009 - 10 - itself a massive increase on last year 's public borrowing of £ 90bn .
" It is obviously very early days , but the dreadful April public finance data and ongoing sharply deteriorating trend suggest that the chancellor is straight away on the back foot in his expectations [ for public borrowing ] , " said Howard Archer of IHT Global Insight .
We are not about to lose our triple - A rating yet .
And none of the other big ratings agencies has changed its view

The narrow measure of public sector borrowing , the current budget deficit , also increased sharply in April , rising to £ 7bn compared to just £ 728 m in the same month one year earlier .
The recession has sharply reduced government tax receipts , especially from the corporate sector and bonus payments in the financial sector .
Meanwhile , the government is having to pay out more in benefits as unemployment continues to rise .
Income tax and VAT receipts were both around £ 2bn lower in the month compared to one year ago , while social benefit payments were £ 1bn higher .
Gemma Tetlow of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the figures " suggest cash tax receipts have fallen compared to the same month last year while spending - particularly on social benefits - have grown strongly " but she said it was too early to tell whether government borrowing was on target .

If you still use Microsoft ’s Internet Explorer , then you should be aware there ’s a bug in the browser which leaks the URL ( or anything else ) you type into the address bar .
The problem affects the latest version of Internet Explorer and was discovered by security researcher Manuel Caballero .
As Ars Technica reports , the flaw allows the website the user is currently visiting to view any text they type into the browser ’s address bar , with that text becoming readable as soon as they leave ( i.e. as they hit the enter key ) .
This means that a maliciously - controlled website can exploit the bug to grab the URL of the next website that you ’re visiting , or if you ’ve typed text into the address bar , it will also snaffle that – because Internet Explorer will automatically convert that to a search ( on Bing by default ) .
And the victim wo n’t be aware that this has happened , because they ’ll simply be whisked off to whatever website or search they entered .
Upgrade to the Surface Pro 4 for a modern web browsing experience
Time to move on ?
Given the news yesterday that Windows 8.1 has been hit by a nasty bug which prevents users from logging onto their PC with a Microsoft account – and with no apparent ETA on a fix – maybe it ’s time folks started seriously thinking about moving away from ageing Microsoft software .
Of course , if you are on Windows 10 , it has the Edge browser as well as Internet Explorer , and the former is obviously where the software giant ’s focus lies – particularly when it comes to security aspects .
As Caballero himself observes : “ [ Microsoft is ] really moving forward regarding Edge , design bugs , and they even extended its bug bounty , which seems to be permanent now … but I still believe it is not acceptable to leave IE wide open . ”
“ In my opinion , Microsoft is trying to get rid of IE without saying it .
It would be easier , [ and ] more honest to simply tell users that their older browser is not being serviced like Edge . ”
Naturally some users are forced to go with Internet Explorer due to legacy issues with services or sites , but if you have a choice , it seems like an increasingly good idea to step up to a contemporary piece of software – whether that ’s Edge , Chrome or Firefox , or indeed another alternative .
WHAT IS KARMA ?
KARMA AND VIPAKA
WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF KARMA ?
CLASSIFICATION OF KARMA
QUESTIONS ON THE THEORY OF KARMA
NATURE OF KARMA Karma is the law of moral causation .
The theory of Karma is a fundamental doctrine in Buddhism .
This belief was prevalent in India before the advent of the Buddha .
Nevertheless , it was the Buddha who explained and formulated this doctrine in the complete form in which we have it today .
What is the cause of the inequality that exists among mankind ?
Why should one person be brought up in the lap of luxury , endowed with fine mental , moral and physical qualities , and another in absolute poverty , steeped in misery ?
Why should one person be a mental prodigy , and another an idiot ?
Why should one person be born with saintly characteristics and another with criminal tendencies ?
Why should some be linguistic , artistic , mathematically inclined , or musical from the very cradle ?
Why should others be congenitally blind , deaf , or deformed ? |
Why should some be blessed , and others cursed from their births ?
Either this inequality of mankind has a cause , or it is purely accidental .
No sensible person would think of attributing this unevenness , this inequality , and this diversity to blind chance or pure accident .
In this world nothing happens to a person that he does not for some reason or other deserve .
Usually , men of ordinary intellect cannot comprehend the actual reason or reasons .
The definite invisible cause or causes of the visible effect is not necessarily confined to the present life , they may be traced to a proximate or remote past birth .
According to Buddhism , this inequality is due not only to heredity , environment , " nature and nurture " , but also to Karma .
In other words , it is the result of our own past actions and our own present doings .
We ourselves are responsible for our own happiness and misery .
We create our own Heaven .
We create our own Hell .
We are the architects of our own fate .
Perplexed by the seemingly inexplicable , apparent disparity that existed among humanity , a young truth - seeker approached the Buddha and questioned him regarding this intricate problem of inequality : " What is the cause , what is the reason , O Lord , " questioned he , " that we find amongst mankind the short - lived and long - lived , the healthy and the diseased , the ugly and beautiful , those lacking influence and the powerful , the poor and the rich , the low - born and the high - born , and the ignorant and the wise ? "
The Buddhas reply was : " All living beings have actions ( Karma ) as their own , their inheritance , their congenital cause , their kinsman , their refuge .
It is Karma that differentiates beings into low and high states . "
He then explained the cause of such differences in accordance with the law of cause and effect .
Certainly we are born with hereditary characteristics .
At the same time we possess certain innate abilities that science cannot adequately account for .
To our parents we are indebted for the gross sperm and ovum that form the nucleus of this so - called being .
They remain dormant within each parent until this potential germinal compound is vitalised by the karmic energy needed for the production of the foetus .
Karma is therefore the indispensable conceptive cause of this being .
The accumulated karmic tendencies , inherited in the course of previous lives , at times play a far greater role than the hereditary parental cells and genes in the formation of both physical and mental characteristics .
The Buddha , for instance , inherited , like every other person , the reproductive cells and genes from his parents .
But physically , morally and intellectually there was none comparable to him in his long line of Royal ancestors .
In the Buddhas own words , he belonged not to the Royal lineage , but to that of the Aryan Buddhas .
He was certainly a superman , an extraordinary creation of his own Karma .
According to the Lakkhana Sutta of Digha Nikaya , the Buddha inherited exceptional features , such as the 32 major marks , as the result of his past meritorious deeds .
The ethical reason for acquiring each physical feature is clearly explained in the Sutta .
It is obvious from this unique case that karmic tendencies could not only influence our physical organism , but also nullify the potentiality of the parental cells and genes  hence the significance of the Buddhas enigmatic statement , - " We are the heirs of our own actions . "
Dealing with this problem of variation , the Atthasalini , being a commentary on the Abhidharma , states : " Depending on this difference in Karma appears the differences in the birth of beings , high and low , base and exalted , happy and miserable .
Depending on the difference in Karma appears the difference in the individual features of beings as beautiful and ugly , high - born or low born , well - built or deformed .
Depending on the difference in Karma appears the difference in worldly conditions of beings , such as gain and loss , and disgrace , blame and praise , happiness and misery . "
Thus , from a Buddhist point of view , our present mental , moral intellectual and temperamental differences are , for the most part , due to our own actions and tendencies , both past and present .
Although Buddhism attributes this variation to Karma , as being the chief cause among a variety , it does not , however , assert that everything is due to Karma .
The law of Karma , important as it is , is only one of the twenty - four conditions described in Buddhist Philosophy .
Refuting the erroneous view that " whatsoever fortune or misfortune experienced is all due to some previous action " , the Buddha said : " So , then , according to this view , owing to previous action men will become murderers , thieves , unchaste , liars , slanderers , covetous , malicious and perverts .
Thus , for those who fall back on the former deeds as the essential reason , there is neither the desire to do , nor effort to do , nor necessity to do this deed , or abstain from this deed . "
It was this important text , which states the belief that all physical circumstances and mental attitudes spring solely from past Karma that Buddha contradicted .
If the present life is totally conditioned or wholly controlled by our past actions , then certainly Karma is tantamount to fatalism or determinism or predestination .
If this were true , free will would be an absurdity .
Life would be purely mechanistic , not much different from a machine .
Being created by an Almighty God who controls our destinies and predetermines our future , or being produced by an irresistible Karma that completely determines our fate and controls our lifes course , independent of any free action on our part , is essentially the same .
The only difference lies in the two words God and Karma .
One could easily be substituted for the other , because the ultimate operation of both forces would be identical .
Such a fatalistic doctrine is not the Buddhist law of Karma .
According to Buddhism , there are five orders or processes ( niyama ) which operate in the physical and mental realms .
They are : Utu Niyama - physical inorganic order , e.g. seasonal phenomena of winds and rains .
The unerring order of seasons , characteristic seasonal changes and events , causes of winds and rains , nature of heat , etc. , all belong to this group .
Bija Niyama - order of germs and seeds ( physical organic order ) , e.g. rice produced from rice - seed , sugary taste from sugar - cane or honey , peculiar characteristics of certain fruits , etc .
The scientific theory of cells and genes and the physical similarity of twins may be ascribed to this order .
Karma Niyama - order of act and result , e.g. , desirable and undesirable acts produce corresponding good and bad results .
As surely as water seeks its own level so does Karma , given opportunity , produce its inevitable result , not in the form of a reward or punishment but as an innate sequence .
This sequence of deed and effect is as natural and necessary as the way of the sun and the moon .
Dhamma Niyama - order of the norm , e.g. , the natural phenomena occurring at the advent of a Bodhisattva in his last birth .
Gravitation and other similar laws of nature .
The natural reason for being good and so forth , may be included in this group .
Citta Niyama - order or mind or psychic law , e.g. , processes of consciousness , arising and perishing of consciousness , constituents of consciousness , power of mind , etc. , including telepathy , telaesthesia , retro-cognition , premonition , clairvoyance , clairaudience , thought - reading and such other psychic phenomena which are inexplicable to modern science .
Every mental or physical phenomenon could be explained by these all - embracing five orders or processes which are laws in themselves .
Karma as such is only one of these five orders .
Like all other natural laws they demand no lawgiver .
Of these five , the physical inorganic order and the order of the norm are more or less mechanistic , though they can be controlled to some extent by human ingenuity and the power of mind .
For example , fire normally burns , and extreme cold freezes , but man has walked scatheless over fire and meditated naked on Himalayan snows ; horticulturists have worked marvels with flowers and fruits ; Yogis have performed levitation .
Psychic law is equally mechanistic , but Buddhist training aims at control of mind , which is possible by right understanding and skilful volition .
Karma law operates quite automatically and , when the Karma is powerful , man cannot interfere with its inexorable result though he may desire to do so ; but here also right understanding and skilful volition can accomplish much and mould the future .
Good Karma , persisted in , can thwart the reaping of bad Karma , or as some Western scholars prefer to say action influence , is certainly an intricate law whose working is fully comprehended only by a Buddha .
The Buddhist aims at the final destruction of all Karma .
What is Karma ?
The Pali term Karma literally means action or doing .
Any kind of intentional action whether mental , verbal , or physical , is regarded as Karma .
It covers all that is included in the phrase " thought , word and deed " .
Generally speaking , all good and bad action constitutes Karma .
In its ultimate sense Karma means all moral and immoral volition .
Involuntary , unintentional or unconscious actions , though technically deeds , do not constitute Karma , because volition , the most important factor in determining Karma , is absent .
The Buddha says : " I declare , O Bhikkhus , that volition is Karma .
Having willed one acts by body , speech , and thought . "
( Anguttara Nikaya )
Every volitional action of individuals , save those of Buddhas and Arahants , is called Karma .
The exception made in their case is because they are delivered from both good and evil ; they have eradicated ignorance and craving , the roots of Karma .
" Destroyed are their germinal seeds ( Khina bija ) ; selfish desires no longer grow , " states the Ratana Sutta of Sutta nipata .
This does not mean that the Buddha and Arahantas are passive .
They are tirelessly active in working for the real well being and happiness of all .
Their deeds ordinarily accepted as good or moral , lack creative power as regards themselves .
Understanding things as they truly are , they have finally shattered their cosmic fetters  the chain of cause and effect .
Karma does not necessarily mean past actions .
It embraces both past and present deeds .
Hence in one sense , we are the result of what we were ; we will be the result of what we are .
In another sense , it should be added , we are not totally the result of what we were ; we will not absolutely be the result of what we are .
The present is no doubt the offspring of the past and is the present of the future , but the present is not always a true index of either the past or the future ; so complex is the working of Karma .
It is this doctrine of Karma that the mother teaches her child when she says " Be good and you will be happy and we will love you ; but if you are bad , you will be unhappy and we will not love you . "
In short , Karma is the law of cause and effect in the ethical realm .
Karma and Vipaka Karma is action , and Vipaka , fruit or result , is its reaction .
Just as every object is accompanied by a shadow , even so every volitional activity is inevitably accompanied by its due effect .
Karma is like potential seed : Vipaka could be likened to the fruit arising from the tree  the effect or result .
Anisamsa and Adinaya are the leaves , flowers and so forth that correspond to external differences such as health , sickness and poverty  these are inevitable consequences , which happen at the same time .
Strictly speaking , both Karma and Vipaka pertain to the mind .
As Karma may be good or bad , so may Vipaka , - the fruit  is good or bad .
As Karma is mental so Vipaka is mental ( of the mind ) .
It is experienced as happiness , bliss , unhappiness or misery , according to the nature of the Karma seed .
Anisamsa are the concomitant advantages  material things such as prosperity , health and longevity .
When Vipakas concomitant material things are disadvantageous , they are known as Adinaya , full of wretchedness , and appear as poverty , ugliness , disease , short life - span and so forth .
As we sow , we reap somewhere and sometime , in his life or in a future birth .
What we reap today is what we have sown either in the present or in the past .
The Samyutta Nikaya states : " According to the seed that s sown ,
So is the fruit you reap there from ,
Doer of good will gather good ,
Doer of evil , evil reaps ,
Down is the seed and thou shalt taste
The fruit thereof . "
Karma is a law in itself , which operates in its own field without the intervention of any external , independent ruling agency .
Happiness and misery , which are the common lot of humanity , are the inevitable effects of causes .
From a Buddhist point of view , they are not rewards and punishments , assigned by a supernatural , omniscient ruling power to a soul that has done good or evil .
Theists , who attempt to explain everything in this and temporal life and in the eternal future life , ignoring a past , believe in a postmortem  justice , and may regard present happiness and misery as blessings and curses conferred on His creation by an omniscient and omnipotent Divine Ruler who sits in heaven above controlling the destinies of the human race .
Buddhism , which emphatically denies such an Almighty , All merciful God-Creator and an arbitrarily created immortal soul , believes in natural law and justice which cannot be suspended by either an Almighty God or an All - compassionate Buddha .
According to this natural law , acts bear their own rewards and punishments to the individual doer whether human justice finds out or not .
There are some who criticise thus : " So , you Buddhists , too , administer capitalistic opium to the people , saying : " You are born poor in this life on account of your past evil karma .
He is born rich on account of his good Karma .
So , be satisfied with your humble lot ; but do good to be rich in your next life .
You are being oppressed now because of your past evil Karma .
There is your destiny .
Be humble and bear your sufferings patiently .
Do good now .
You can be certain of a better and happier life after death . "
The Buddhist doctrine of Karma does not expound such ridiculous fatalistic views .
Nor does it vindicate a postmortem justice .
The All - Merciful Buddha , who had no ulterior selfish motives , did not teach this law of Karma to protect the rich and comfort the poor by promising illusory happiness in an after - life .
While we are born to a state created by ourselves , yet by our own self - directed efforts there is every possibility for us to create new , favourable environments even here and now .
Not only individually , but also , collectively , we are at liberty to create fresh Karma that leads either towards our progress or downfall in this very life .
According to the Buddhist doctrine of Karma , one is not always compelled by an iron necessity , for Karma is neither fate , nor predestination imposed upon us by some mysterious unknown power to which we must helplessly submit ourselves .
It is ones own doing reacting on oneself , and so one has the possibility to divert the course of ones Karma to some extent .
How far one diverts it depends on oneself .
Is one bound to reap all that one has sown in just proportion ?
The Buddha provides an answer : " If anyone says that a man or woman must reap in this life according to his present deeds , in that case there is no religious life , nor is an opportunity afforded for the entire extinction of sorrow .
But if anyone says that what a man or woman reaps in this and future lives accords with his or her deeds present and past , in that case there is a religious life , and an opportunity is afforded for the entire extinction of a sorrow . "
( Anguttara Nikaya )
Although it is stated in the Dhammapada that " not in the sky , nor in mid-ocean , or entering a mountain cave is found that place on earth where one may escape from ( the consequences of ) an evil deed " , yet one is not bound to pay all the past arrears of ones Karma .
If such were the case emancipation would be impossibility .
Eternal recurrence would be the unfortunate result .
What is the cause of Karma ?
Ignorance ( avijja ) , or not knowing things as they truly are , is the chief cause of Karma .
Dependent on ignorance arise activities ( avijja paccaya samkhara ) states the Buddha in the Paticca Samuppada ( Dependent Origination ) .
Associated with ignorance is the ally craving ( tanha ) , the other root of Karma .
Evil actions are conditioned by these two causes .
All good deeds of a worldling ( putthujana ) , though associated with the three wholesome roots of generosity ( alobha ) , goodwill ( adosa ) and knowledge ( amoha ) , are nevertheless regarded as Karma because the two roots of ignorance and craving are dormant in him .
The moral types of Supramundane Path Consciousness ( magga citta ) are not regarded as Karma because they tend to eradicate the two root causes .
Who is the doer of Karma ?
Who reaps the fruit of Karma ?
Does Karma mould a soul ?
In answering these subtle questions , the Venerable Buddhaghosa writes in the Visuddhi Magga : " No doer is there who does the deed ;
Nor is there one who feels the fruit ;
Constituent parts alone roll on ;
This indeed !
Is right discernment . "
For instance , the table we see is apparent reality .
In an ultimate sense the so - called table consists of forces and qualities .
For ordinary purposes a scientist would use the term water , but in the laboratory he would say H 2 0 .
In this same way , for conventional purposes , such terms as man , woman , being , self , and so forth are used .
The so - called fleeting forms consist of psychophysical phenomena , which are constantly changing not remaining the same for two consecutive moments .
Buddhists , therefore , do not believe in an unchanging entity , in an actor apart from action , in a perceiver apart from perception , in a conscious subject behind consciousness .
Who then , is the doer of Karma ?
Who experiences the effect ?
Volition , or Will ( tetana ) , is itself the doer , Feeling ( vedana ) is itself the reaper of the fruits of actions .
Apart from these pure mental states ( suddhadhamma ) there is no - one to sow and no - one to reap .
Classification of Karma ( A ) With respect to different functions , Karma is classified into four kinds : 1 . REPRODUCTIVE KARMA
Every birth is conditioned by a past good or bad karma , which predominated at the moment of death .
Karma that conditions the future birth is called Reproductive Karma .
The death of a person is merely a temporary end of a temporary phenomenon .
Though the present form perishes , another form which is neither the same nor absolutely different takes its place , according to the potential thought - vibration generated at the death moment , because the Karmic force which propels the life - flux still survives .
It is this last thought , which is technically called Reproductive ( janaka ) Karma , that determines the state of a person in his subsequent birth .
This may be either a good or bad Karma .
According to the Commentary , Reproductive Karma is that which produces mental aggregates and material aggregates at the moment of conception .
The initial consciousness , which is termed the patisandhi rebirth consciousness , is conditioned by this Reproductive ( janaka ) Karma .
Simultaneous with the arising of the rebirth - consciousness , there arise the body - decad , sex - decad and base - decad ( kaya - bhavavatthu dasakas ) .
( decad = 10 factors ) .
( a) The body - decad is composed of :
The element of extension ( pathavi ) .
The element of cohesion ( apo ) .
The element of heat ( tajo ) .
The element of motion ( vayo ) .
( b) The four derivatives ( upadana rupa ) : Colour ( vanna ) .
Odour ( gandha ) .
Taste ( rasa ) .
Nutritive Essence ( oja )
These eight ( mahabhuta 4 + upadana 4 = 8 ) are collectively called Avinibhoga Rupa ( indivisable form or indivisable matter ) .
( c ) Vitality ( jivitindriya ) and Body ( kaya ) These ( avinibhoga 8 + jivitindriya 1 + Kaya 1 = 10 ) ten are collectively called " Body - decad " = ( Kaya dasaka ) .
Sex - decad and Base - decad also consist of the first nine , sex ( bhava ) and seat of consciousness ( vathu ) respectively ( i.e. eye , ear , nose , tongue , and body ) .
From this , it is evident that the sex of a person is determined at the very conception of a being .
It is conditioned by Karma and is not a fortuitous combination of sperm and ovum cells .
The Pain and Happiness one experiences in the course of ones lifetime are the inevitable consequence of Reproductive Kamma .
2 . SUPPORTIVE KARMA
That which comes near the Reproductive ( janaka ) Kamma and supports it .
It is neither good nor bad and it assists or maintains the action of the Reproductive ( janaka ) Karma in the course of ones lifetime .
Immediately after conception till the death moment this Karma steps forward to support the Reproductive Karma .
A moral supportive ( kusala upathambhaka ) Karma assists in giving health , wealth , happiness etc. to the being born with a moral Reproductive Karma .
An immoral supportive Karma , on the other hand , assists in giving pain , sorrow , etc. to the being born with an immoral reproductive ( akusala janaka ) Karma , as for instance to a beast of burden .
3 . OBSTRUCTIVE KARMA OR COUNTERACTIVE KARMA
Which , unlike the former , tends to weaken , interrupt and retard the fruition of the Reproductive Karma .
For instance , a person born with a good Reproductive Karma may be subject to various ailments etc. , thus preventing him from enjoying the blissful results of his good actions .
An animal , on the other hand , who is born with a bad Reproductive Karma may lead a comfortable life by getting good food , lodging , etc. , as a result of his good counteractive or obstructive ( upabidaka ) Karma preventing the fruition of the evil Reproductive Karma .
4 . DESTRUCTIVE ( UPAGHATAKA ) KARMA
According to the law of Karma the potential energy of the Reproductive Karma could be nullified by a mere powerful opposing Karma of the past , which , seeking an opportunity , may quite unexpectedly operate , just as a powerful counteractive force can obstruct the path of a flying arrow and bring it down to the ground .
Such an action is called Destructive ( upaghataka ) Karma , which is more effective than the previous two in that it is not only obstructive but also destroys the whole force .
This Destructive Karma also may be either good or bad .
As an instance of operation of all the four , the case of Devadatta , who attempted to kill the Buddha and who caused a schism in the Sangha ( disciples of the Buddha ) may be cited .
His good Reproductive Karma brought him birth in a royal family .
His continued comfort and prosperity were due to the action of the Supportive Karma .
The Counteractive or Obstructive Karma came into operation when he was subject to much humiliation as a result of his being excommunicated from the Sangha .
Finally the Destructive Karma brought his life to a miserable end .
( B ) There is another classification of Karma , according to the priority of effect : WEIGHTY ( GARUKA ) KARMA .
This is either weighty or serious  may be either good or bad .
It produces its results in this life or in the next for certain .
If good , it is purely mental as in the case of Jhana ( ecstasy or absorption ) .
Otherwise it is verbal or bodily .
On the Immoral side , there are five immediate effective heinous crimes ( pancanantariya karma ) : Matricide , Patricide , and the murder of an Arahant , the wounding of a Buddha and the creation of a schism in the Sangha .
Permanent Scepticism ( Niyata Micchaditthi ) is also termed one of the Weighty ( garuka ) Karmas .
If , for instance , any person were to develop the jhana ( ecstasy or absorption ) and later were to commit one of these heinous crimes , his good Karma would be obliterated by the powerful evil Karma .
His subsequent birth would be conditioned by the evil Karma in spite of his having gained the jhana earlier .
Devadatta lost his psychic power and was born in an evil state , because he wounded the Buddha and caused a schism in the Sangha .
King Ajatasattu would have attained the first stage of Sainthood ( Sotapanna ) if he had not committed patricide .
In this case the powerful evil Karma acted as an obstacle to his gaining Sainthood .
PROXIMATE ( ASANNA ) KARMA OR DEATH - PROXIMATE KARMA
This is that which one does or remembers immediately before the moment of dying .
Owing to the great part it plays in determining the future birth , much importance is attained to this deathbed ( asanna ) Karma in almost all Buddhist countries .
The customs of reminding the dying man of good deeds and making him do good acts on his deathbed still prevails in Buddhist countries .
Sometimes a bad person may die happily and receive a good birth if he remembers or does a good act at the last moment .
A story runs that a certain executioner who casually happened to give some alms to the Venerable Sariputta remembered this good act at the dying moment and was born in a state of bliss .
This does not mean that although he enjoys a good birth he will be exempt from the effects of the evil deeds which he accumulated during his lifetime .
They will have there due effect as occasions arise .
At times a good person may die unhappy by suddenly remembering an evil act of his or by harbouring some unpleasant thought , perchance compelled by unfavourable circumstances .
In the scriptures , Queen Mallika , the consort of King Kosala , remembering a lie she had uttered , suffered for about seven days in a state of misery when she lied to her husband to cover some misbehaviour .
These are exceptional cases .
Such reverse changes of birth account for the birth of virtuous children to vicious parents and of vicious children to virtuous parents .
As a result of the last thought moment being conditioned by the general conduct of the person .
HABITUAL ( ACCINA ) KARMA
It is that which on habitually performs and recollects and for which one has a great liking .
Habits whether good or bad becomes ones second nature , tending to form the character of a person .
At unguarded moments one often lapses into ones habitual mental mindset .
In the same way , at the death - moment , unless influenced by other circumstances , one usually recalls to mind ones habitual deeds .
Cunda , a butcher , who was living in the vicinity of the Buddhas monastery , died yelling like an animal because he was earning his living by slaughtering pigs .
King Dutthagamini of Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ) was in the habit of giving alms to the Bhikkhus ( monks ) before he took his own meals .
It was his habitual Karma that gladdened him at the dying moment and gave him birth in the Tusita heaven .
RESERVE OR CUMULATIVE ( KATATTA ) KARMA
This literally means because done .
All actions that are not included in the aforementioned and those actions soon forgotten belong to this category .
This is , as it were the reserve fund of a particular being .
( C ) There is another classification of Karma according to the time in which effects are worked out : Immediately Effective ( ditthadhammavedaniya ) Karma .
Subsequently Effective ( uppapajjavedaniya ) Karma .
Indefinitely Effective ( aparapariyavedaniya ) Karma .
Defunct or Ineffective ( ahosi ) Karma .
Immediately Effective Karma is that which is experienced in this present life .
According to the Abhidhamma one does both good and evil during the javana process ( thought - impulsion ) , which usually lasts for seven thought - moments .
The effect of the first thought - moment , being the weakest , one may reap in this life itself .
This is called the Immediately Effective Karma .
If it does not operate in this life , it is called  Defunct or Ineffective  Karma .
The next weakest is the seventh thought - moment .
Its effect one may reap in the subsequence birth .
This is called  Subsequently Effective  Karma .
This , too , is called Defunct or Ineffective Karma if it does not operate in the second birth .
The effect of the intermediate thought - moments may take place at any time until one attains Nibbana .
This type of Karma is known as  Indefinitely Effective Karma .
No one , not even the Buddhas and Arahantas , is exempt from this class of Karma which one may experience in the course of ones wandering in Samsara .
There is no special class of Karma known as Defunct or Ineffective , but when such actions that should produce their effects in this life or in a subsequent life do not operate , they are termed Defunct or Ineffective Karma .
( D ) The last classification of Karma is according to the plane in which the effect takes place , namely : Evil Actions ( akusala kamma ) which may ripen in the sentient planes ( kammaloka ) .
( Six celestial planes plus one human plane plus four woeful planes = eleven kamaloka planes . )
Here are only four woeful kamalokas .
Good Actions ( kusala kamma ) which may ripen in the sentient planes except for the four woeful planes .
Good Actions ( kusala kamma ) which may ripen in the Realm of Form ( rupa brahamalokas ) .
There are four Arupa Brahma Lokas .
Questions on the Theory of Karma Question :
Do the Karmas of parents determine or affect the Karmas of their children ?
Answer : Physically , the Karma of children is generally determined by the Karma of their parents .
Thus , healthy parents usually have healthy offspring , and unhealthy parents have unhealthy children .
On the effect or how the Karma of their children is determined : the childs Karma is a thing apart of itself  it forms the childs individuality , the sum - total of its merits and demerits accumulated in innumerable past existences .
For example , the Karma of the Buddha - to - be , Prince Siddhartha was certainly not influenced by the joint Karma of his parents , King Suddhodana and Queen Maya .
The glorious and powerful Karma of our Buddha - to - be transcended the Karma of his parents which jointly were more potent than his own .
Question :
If the Karma of parents do not influence those of their children , how would the fact be explained that parents who suffer from certain virulent diseases are apt to transmit these evils to their offsprings ?
Answer :
Where a child inherit such a disease it is due to the force of the parents  characteristics because of the force of the latters Utu ( conditions favourable to germination ) .
Take , for example , two seeds from a sapling ; plant one in inferior , dry soil ; and the other in rich , moist soil .
The result is that the first seed will sprout into a sickly sapling and soon show symptoms of disease and decay ; while the other seed will thrive and flourish and grow up to be a tall and healthy tree .
It will be observed that the pair of seeds taken from the same stock grows up differently according to the soil into which they are put .
A childs past Karma may be compared to the seed : the physical disposition of the mother to the soil ; and that of the father to the moisture , which fertilised the soil .
Roughly speaking , to illustrate our subject , we will say that , representing the saplings germination , growth , and existence as a unit , the seed is responsible for one - tenth of them , the soil for six - tenths , and the moisture for the remainder , three - tenths .
Thus , although the power of germination exists potentially in the seed ( the child ) , its growth is powerfully determined and quickened by the soil ( the mother ) and the moisture ( the father ) .
Therefore , even as the conditions of the soil and moisture must be taken as largely responsible factors in the growth and condition of the tree .
So must the influences of the parents ( or progenitors , as in the case of the animal world ) be taken into account in respect to the conception and growth of their offspring .
The parents  share in the Karma determining the physical factors of their issue is as follows :
If they are human beings , then their offspring will be a human being .
If they are cattle then their issue must be of their species .
If the human being is Chinese , then their offspring must be of their race .
Thus , the offspring are invariably of the same genera and species , etc. , as those of the progenitors .
It will be seen from the above that , although a childs Karma is very powerful in itself , if cannot remain wholly uninfluenced by those of it parents .
It is apt to inherit the physical characteristic of its parents .
Yet , it may occur that the childs Karma , being superlatively powerful , the influence of the parents joint Karma cannot overshadow it .
Of course , it need hardly be pointed out that the evil influences of parents can also be counteracted by the application of medical science .
All beings born of sexual cohabitation are the resultant effects of three forces :
The old Karma of past existence ;
The seminal fluid of the mother , and The seminal fluid of the father .
The physical dispositions of the parents may , or may not , be equal in force .
One may counteract the other to a lesser or greater extent .
The childs Karma and physical characteristics , such as race , colour , etc. , will be the produce of the three forces .
Question :
On the death of a sentient being , is there a soul that wanders about at will ?
Answer :
When a sentient being leaves one existence , it is reborn either as a human being , a celestial being , ( Deva or Brahama ) , and inferior animal , or a denizen of one of the regions of hell .
The sceptics and the ignorant people held that there are intermediate stages  antrabhava  between these ; and that there are being who are neither of the human , the celestial , the Deva or the Brahma worlds nor of any one of the stages of exist recognised in the scriptures  but are in an intermediate stage .
Some assert that these transitional stages are possessed of the Five Khandhas ( Five Aggregates : they are Matter ( rupa ) ; Feeling ( vedana ) ; Perception ( sanna ) ; 4 . Mental - activities ( sankhara ) ; and Consciousness ( vinnana ) .
Some assert that these beings are detached souls  or spirits with no material encasement , and some again , that they are possessed of the faculty of seeing like Devas , and further , that they have power of changing at will , at short intervals , from one to any of the existence mentioned above .
Others again hold the fantastic and erroneous theory that these beings can , and so , fancy themselves to be in other than the existence they are actually in .
Thus , to take for example one such of these suppositious beings .
He is a poor person  and yet he fancies himself to be rich .
He may be in hell  and yet he fancies himself to be in the land of the Devas , and so on .
This belief in intermediate stages between existences is false , and is condemned in the Buddhist teachings .
A human being in this life who , by his Karma is destined to be a human being in the next , will be reborn as such ; one who by his Karma is destined to be a Deva in the next will be appear in the land of the Devas ; and one whose future life is to be in Hell , will be found in one of the regions of hell in the next existence .
The idea of an entity or soul or spirit going , coming , changing  or transmigrating  from one existence to another is an idea entertained by the ignorance and materialistic , and is certainly not justified by the Dhammas that there is no such thing as going , ' coming , changing , etc. , as between existences .
The conception , which is in accordance with the Dhamma , may perhaps be illustrated by the picture thrown out by a cinema projector , or the sound of emitted by the gramophone , and their relation to the film or the sound - box and records respectively .
For example , a human being dies and is reborn in the land of Devas .
Though these two existences are different , yet the link or continuity between the two at death is unbroken in point of time .
The same is true in the case of a man whose further existence is to be in hell .
The distance between Hell and the abode of man appears to be great .
Yet , in point of time , the continuity of passage from the one existence to the other is unbroken , and no intervening matter or space can interrupt the trend of a mans Karma from the world of human beings to the regions of Hell .
The passage from one existence to another is instantaneous , and the transition is infinitely quicker than the blink of an eyelid or a lightening - flash .
Karma determines the realm of rebirth and the state of existence in that realm of all transient being ( in the cycle of existences , which have to be traversed till the attainment , at last , of Nibbana ) .
The results of Karma are manifold , and may be effected in many ways .
Religious offerings ( dana ) may obtain for a man the privilege of rebirth as a human being , or as a deva , in one of the six deva worlds according to the degree of the merit of the deeds performed , and so with the observance of religious duties ( sila ) .
The jhanas or states of absorption , are found in the Brahma world or Brahmalokas up to the summit , the twentieth Brahma world :
And so with bad deeds , the perpetrators of which are to be found , grade by grade , down to the lowest depths of Hell .
Thus are Karma , past , present and future were , are , and will ever be the sum total of our deeds , good , indifferent or bad .
As was seen from the foregoing , our Karma determines the changes of our existences .
" Evil spirits " are , therefore , not beings in an intermediate or transitional stages of existence , but are really very inferior beings , and they belong to one of the following five realms of existence : 1 . World of Men : 2 . The Lowest plane of deva-world ; 3 . The region of hell ; 4 . Animals below men , and 5 . Petas ( ghosts ) .
Number 2 and 5 are very near the world of human beings .
As their condition is unhappy , and they are popularly considered evil spirits .
It is not true that all who die in this world are reborn as evil spirits ; nor is it true that beings who die sudden or violent deaths are apt to be reborn in the lowest plane of the world of devas .
Question :
Is there such a thing as a human being who is reborn and who is able to speak accurately of his or her past existence ?
Answer : Certainly , this is not an uncommon occurrence , and is in accordance with the tenets of Buddhism in respect to Karma .
The following ( who form , an overwhelming majority of human beings ) are generally unable to remember there past existences when reborn as human beings : Children who die young .
Those who die old and senile .
Those who are addicted to the drug or drink habit .
Those whose mothers , during their conception , have been sickly or have had to toil laboriously , or have been reckless or imprudent during pregnancy .
The children in the womb , being stunned and started , lose all knowledge of their past existence .
The following are possessed of a knowledge of their past existences , viz :
Those who are not reborn ( in the human world ) but proceed to the world of the devas , of Brahmas , or to the regions of Hell , remember their past existences .
Those who die suddenly deaths from accidents , while in sound health , may also be possessed of this faculty in the next existence , provided that their mothers , in whose womb they are conceived , are healthy .
Again , those who live steady , meritorious lives and who in their past existences have striven to attain , often attain it .
Lastly the Buddha , the Arahantas and Ariyas attain this gift which is known as pubbenivasa abhnna ( Supernatural Power remembering previous existences ) .
Question : Which are the five Abhinna ?
Are they attainable only by the Buddha ?
Answer :
The five Abhinna ( Supernatural Powers ) : Pali - abhi , excellent , nana , wisdom ) are : Iddhividha = Creative power ;
Dibbasola = Divine Ear ;
Cetopariya nana = Knowledge of others thoughts ;
Pubbenivasanussati = Knowledge of ones past existence ;
Dibbacakkhu = The Divine eye .
The Abhinna are attainable not only by the Buddha , but also by Arantas and Ariyas , by ordinary mortals who practise according to the Scriptures ( as was the case with hermits etc , who flourished before the time of the Buddha and who were able to fly through the air and traverse different worlds ) .
In the Buddhist Scriptures , we find , clearly shown , the means of attaining the five Abhinna .
And even nowadays , if these means are carefully and perseveringly pursued , it would be possible to attain these .
That we do not see any person endowed with the five Abhinna today is due to the lack of strenuous physical and mental exertion towards their attainment .
Nature of Karma
In the working of Karma there are maleficent and beneficent forces and conditions to counteract and support this self - operating law .
Birth ( gati ) time or condition ( kala ) substratum of rebirth or showing attachment to rebirth ( upadhi ) and effort ( payoga ) act as such powerful aids and hindrances to the fruition of Karma .
Though we are neither the absolutely the servants nor the masters of our Karma , it is evident from these counteractive and supportive factors that the fruition of Karma is influenced to some extent by external circumstances , surroundings , personality , individual striving , and so forth .
It is this doctrine of Karma that gives consolation , hope , reliance and moral courage to a Buddhist .
When the unexpected happens , and he meets with difficulties , failures , and misfortune , the Buddhist realises that he is reaping what he has sown , and he is wiping off a past debt .
Instead of resigning himself , leaving everything to Karma , he makes a strenuous effort to pull the weeds and sow useful seeds in their place , for the future is in his own hands .
He who believes in Karma does not condemn even the most corrupt , for they , too , have their chance to reform themselves at any moment .
Though bound to suffer in woeful states , they have hope of attaining eternal Peace .
By their own doings they have created their own Hells , and by their own doings they can create their own Heavens , too .
A Buddhist who is fully convinced of the law of Karma does not pray to another to be saved but confidently relies on him for his own emancipation .
Instead of making any self - surrender , or calling on any supernatural agency , he relies on his own will power , and works incessantly for the well - being and happiness of all .
This belief in Karma validates his effort and kindles his enthusiasm , because it teaches individual responsibility .
To the ordinary Buddhist , Karma serves as a deterrent , while to an intellectual , it serves as in incentive to do good .
He or she becomes kind , tolerant , and considerate .
This law of Karma explains the problem of suffering , the mastery of so - called fate and predestination of other religions and about all the inequality of mankind .
