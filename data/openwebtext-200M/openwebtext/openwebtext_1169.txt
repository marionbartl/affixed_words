Asa King 's six - year - old daughter is facing the rest of her life in a wig after a neighbour 's pet dog tore off most of her scalp in a frenzied attack in north Queensland this month .
But the Cape York father of four says he feels no malice towards the animal , a Great Dane cross breed , or its horrified owners , who were " like grandparents " to his badly injured daughter Isabella .
Isabella is in a Brisbane hospital awaiting several rounds of painful skin graft surgery after a marathon eight - hour operation to reattach 70 per cent of her scalp - ripped off from the crown of her head to behind her ears - failed .
The result means Isabella 's long , shiny locks will never grow back .
" Look , it was a dog the kids had played with many times before .
I think it had been playing with her to begin with but something 's happened and it has just pulled her to the ground and attacked , " Mr King told brisbanetimes.com .au yesterday .

The first urban train network in the Gulf is due to open on Wednesday in Dubai .
The Dubai Metro will eventually become the world 's longest driverless train system with more than 70 km ( 43 miles ) of track .
It cost almost twice the original estimate and opens at a time when Dubai is suffering from economic troubles due to the global recession .
The metro's challenge will be to persuade car drivers to get on board .
The train system was conceived when traffic on the eight - lane Sheikh Zayed Highway , along which much of its track now runs , was bumper to bumper , morning and evening .
It was planned when the economy was booming and the population burgeoning .
But , the opening of the first stations along 52 km ( 32 miles ) of the track comes when many of Dubai 's congestion problems have already been solved - by the global economic crisis .
With fewer tourists visiting and more migrant workers leaving , there is already less traffic on the roads .
Futuristic stations
One of the main challenges is to persuade motorists , who are used to subsidised fuel and the privacy of air conditioned comfort , to swap their cars for a mass transit system .
With daytime summer temperatures regularly exceeding 40 C , this is not straightforward .
The authorities have built futuristic stations - and introduced reasonable fares , women - only carriages and luxury leather seats for those who would like to pay for them .
They say they anticipate 200 million passenger journeys on the metro each year .
Many residents believe the metro is a positive social and environmental addition in a city which wants to be recognised for modern thinking .
Just when the authorities will see the economic payback on their $ 7.6 bn investment is more difficult to predict .
Media reports
Thursday that one in five kids had the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus during the first 11 days of October were a misinterpretation , Dr. Thomas Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said at a news conference this morning .
What researchers actually found was that one in five kids had an influenza - like illness during that period , but only a minority of those cases were likely to be swine flu .
The results came from a telephone survey of 14,000 randomly selected households , who were asked if they had suffered influenza - like symptoms from Oct. 1 to Oct. 11 .
The responses indicated that one in five kids had suffered such symptoms and about 7 % of adults .
No effort was made to confirm that the illnesses were , in fact , swine flu .
Frieden said that at the peak of the epidemic , in some localities , as many as one in five kids were indeed infected by the virus .
In this survey , however , it is more likely that most of the the children simply had colds or sniffles .
" The data simply show that kids get a lot of infections , " he said .

Patients with chronic hepatitis C and advanced liver disease who drink three or more cups of coffee per day have a 53 % lower risk of liver disease progression than non -coffee drinkers according to a new study led by Neal Freedman , Ph.D. , MPH , from the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) .
The study found that patients with hepatitis C- related bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis who did not respond to standard disease treatment benefited from increased coffee intake .
An effect on liver disease was not observed in patients who drank black or green tea .
Findings of the study appear in the November issue of Hepatology , a journal published by Wiley - Blackwell on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases .
Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infects approximately 2.2 % of the world 's population with more than 3 million Americans infected .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) cites HCV as the leading cause of liver transplantation in the U.S. and accounts for 8,000 to 10,000 deaths in the country annually .
Globally , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimates 3 to 4 million persons contract HCV each year with 70 % becoming chronic cases that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer .
This study included 766 participants enrolled in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long - Term Treatment against Cirrhosis ( HALT-C ) trial who had hepatitis C- related bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis and failed to respond to standard treatment of the anti-viral drugs peginterferon and ribavirin .
At the onset of the study , HALT - C patients were asked to report their typical frequency of coffee intake and portion size over the past year , using 9 frequency categories ranging from ' never ' to ' every day ' and 4 categories of portion size ( 1 cup , 2 cups , 3 - 4 cups , and 5 + cups ) .
A similar question was asked for black and green tea intake .
" This study is the first to address the association between liver disease progression related to hepatitis C and coffee intake , " stated Dr. Freedman .
Participants were seen every 3 months during the 3.8 - year study period to assess clinical outcomes which included : ascites ( abnormal accumulation of fluid in the abdomen ) , prognosis of chronic liver disease , death related to liver disease , hepatic encephalopathy ( brain and nervous system damage ) , hepatocellular carcinoma ( liver cancer ) , spontaneous bacterial peritonitis , variceal hemorrhage , or increase in fibrosis .
Liver biopsies were also taken at 1.5 and 3.5 five years to determine the progression of liver disease .
Results showed that participants who drank 3 or more cups of coffee per day had a relative risk of .47 for reaching one of the clinical outcomes .
Researchers did not observe any association between tea intake and liver disease progression , though tea consumption was low in the study .
" Given the large number of people affected by HCV it is important to identify modifiable risk factors associated with the progression of liver disease , " said Dr. Freedman .
" Although we cannot rule out a possible role for other factors that go along with drinking coffee , results from our study suggest that patients with high coffee intake had a lower risk of disease progression . "
Results from this study should not be generalized to healthier populations cautioned the authors .
Paul Krugman is known for his thoughtful , liberal - leaning columns on economic policy .
On Monday , however , he went for the jugular .
“ The modern conservative movement , ” Krugman declared , “ which dominates the modern Republican Party , has the emotional maturity of a bratty 13 - year - old . ”
Krugman penned the line in response to what he called “ puerile ” tactics of GOP partisans who cheered the failure of Chicago to win the 2016 Summer Olympic games .

“ ‘ Cheers erupted ’ at the headquarters of the conservative Weekly Standard , according to a blog post by a member of the magazine ’s staff , with the headline ‘ Obama loses !
Obama loses !' ” Krugman wrote .
“ Rush Limbaugh declared himself “ gleeful . ” “ World Rejects Obama , ” gloated the Drudge Report . ”
The columnist injected the comparison into a more general argument about political pragmatics governing the healthcare reform debate in Washington .
When it comes to reforming US healthcare , Krugman says the Republican Party has been more focused on defeating any Democratic plan on political grounds rather than on ideological ones .
It ’s understandable that many Republicans oppose Democratic plans to extend insurance coverage — just as most Democrats opposed President Bush ’s attempt to convert Social Security into a sort of giant 401 ( k ) .
The two parties do , after all , have different philosophies about the appropriate role of government .
But the tactics of the two parties have been different .
In 2005 , when Democrats campaigned against Social Security privatization , their arguments were consistent with their underlying ideology : they argued that replacing guaranteed benefits with private accounts would expose retirees to too much risk .
The Republican campaign against health care reform , by contrast , has shown no such consistency .
For the main G.O.P. line of attack is the claim — based mainly on lies about death panels and so on — that reform will undermine Medicare .
And this line of attack is utterly at odds both with the party ’s traditions and with what conservatives claim to believe .
“ The key point is that ever since the Reagan years , ” Krugman opines , “ the Republican Party has been dominated by radicals — ideologues and / or apparatchiks who , at a fundamental level , do not accept anyone else ’s right to govern . ”
Krugman ’s full column is available here .
DALLAS ( Reuters ) - A state hearing into a scathing report about evidence used to convict a Texas man executed in 2004 has been canceled after Governor Rick Perry removed three members of the panel , raising concerns among activists who believe an innocent man was put to death .
Cameron Todd Willingham was executed under Perry ’s watch for the 1991 murders of his three children who died in a fire in their home in the northeast Texas town of Corsicana .
Willingham insisted he was innocent .
The case has gained national prominence as leading experts have concluded the techniques used to determine the fire was set deliberately were based on flawed science .
The report was to be reviewed on Friday by the Texas Forensic Science Commission .
The report was released in August and had been requested by the commission .
The hearing was abruptly canceled after Perry removed three of the commission ’s members , including its chairman .
Two have been replaced .
No reason was given in the statement from the governor ’s office , although it noted that the terms of two of the members expired a month ago .
On its website , the commission said simply the Friday “ meeting has been canceled ” and no new date was given .
“ We hope the governor ’s dismissals ... do not signal a change in course from the honest reckoning with the allegations of forensic negligence or misconduct in this case , ” said Stephen Saloom , policy director with the Innocence Project , which works to overturn wrongful convictions and filed the case with the commission .
“ Should the commission conclude that the arson analysis that led to Mr. Willingham ’s conviction and execution was baseless then it would be patently clear that Texas officials could choose to posthumously exonerate Mr. Willingham , ” he told Reuters in a telephone interview .
Since the United States resumed executions in 1977 after the Supreme Court lifted a temporary ban on the practice , 1,175 convicted criminals have been executed in America .
Over 440 of those have been in Texas , which leads all states .
No court has ever ruled that any of the executions was wrongful , but a cloud of doubt has been cast over the evidence used to convict Willingham , especially the August report from Baltimore - based expert Craig Beyler who said the forensic evidence used in the investigation was highly dubious .
An expert report commissioned by the Innocence Project in 2006 reached the same conclusion .
WESTFIELD , NJ -
The owner of a New York City printing business was sentenced today to one year and one day in federal prison for failing to report approximately $ 189,520 in additional income he received from the printing business and rental properties he owned in Brooklyn , New York .

NEW YORK / KETCHUM , Idaho ( Reuters ) - “ You do n’t have a gun ; that ’s good . ”
That was how Richard Fuld greeted a Reuters reporter who had tracked him down to his country house in a bucolic setting beside a river and amid tree - covered slopes in Ketchum , Idaho last Friday .
The man vilified for the collapse of Lehman Brothers LEHMQ .
PK almost a year ago , a failure that triggered the global economic crisis , seemed burdened but not crushed by the pressure of the upcoming anniversary .
Standing on his gravelly driveway wearing a black fleece vest , dark gray shorts and sandals , Fuld indicated he was torn about speaking out in his own defense , partly because of ongoing litigation but also because he felt the world was not ready to listen .
“ You know what ?
The anniversary ’s coming up , ” he said .
“ I ’ve been pummeled , I ’ve been dumped on , and it ’s all going to happen again .
I can handle it .
You know what , let them line up . ”
Fuld again emphasized his concern about what will be said and written about him in the days leading up to the September 15 anniversary of the Lehman collapse but also stressed his ability to see it through .
“ They ’re looking for someone to dump on right now , and that ’s me , ” Fuld lamented and later added : “ You know what they say ?
‘ This too shall pass . ’ ”
Fuld , 63 , took Lehman 's reins in 1994 when it was troubled and rebuilt it into the fourth - largest U.S. investment bank , a Wall Street powerhouse whose massively profitable mortgage banking machine inspired rivals ' envy .
Even Goldman Sachs GS.N was nervous .
But it was forced to file the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history after it choked under the weight of souring assets and lost investor confidence , and as the U.S. government and Federal Reserve failed to find a buyer and decided not to come up with a rescue package .
Fuld was then humiliated before a Congressional panel last October as stock markets spiraled downwards .
He was told by one politician that he was the designated “ villain ” of the day and screamed at by protesters who called for him to be jailed .
Since then , he has mostly ducked the spotlight , allowing an image of greed , arrogance and failure to cling unchallenged to his name .
In Ketchum on Friday , Fuld said he wanted to speak but did n’t see the point .
“ Nobody wants to hear it .
The facts are out there .
Nobody wants to hear it , especially not from me . ”
The former CEO , who embraced the “ gorilla ” nickname that characterized his fierce and intimidating business style , looked and sounded sad as he lingered with the surprise visitor outside the house , which is beside a river in the Rocky Mountains .
Fuld , who said he had hiked up a nearby mountain earlier in the day , declined to speak about his current work .
But friends and acquaintances say he has started his own consulting firm named Matrix Advisors LLC , based out of an office on Third Avenue in New York .
He is also doing some work for restructuring firm Alvarez and Marsal , helping to unwind Lehman free of charge , according to sources .
He commutes from his Greenwich , Connecticut estate into Manhattan about three to four times a week , and has been seen at breakfasts and lunches with former colleagues at top - class restaurants in New York and Greenwich .
“ He ’s keeping a low profile but doing a lot of power - lunches , ” a top executive at a big investment bank said .
“ He ’s keeping in touch with friends on Wall Street . ”
But behind those power lunches is a man clearly worried about being slammed all over again .
He used to insist on facing the restaurant door ; lately , he ’s been seen facing the wall .
“ He got such negative press -- they made him out to be this devil , ” said one past associate .
“ So I think he ’s embarrassed to be seen in public , afraid someone is going to throw a pie in his face . ”
The former CEO has been named in nearly 40 different legal actions since Lehman went bankrupt , most of which were filed by cities and pension funds that claim he and other Lehman executives led them into making bad investments .
More than a dozen suits were filed by former employees of the firm who claim that Lehman ’s executives allowed imprudent investments in the firm ’s stock for employee savings plans .
Fuld is also one of a dozen Lehman executives subpoenaed for three different grand jury probes charged with investigating Lehman ’s collapse .
He declined to comment on the state of those investigations .
SCALING BACK
Fuld was far from immune to the financial impact of the collapse .
He is estimated to have lost more than $ 1 billion as Lehman ’s shares sank , and in the months following the bankruptcy , Fuld and his wife , Kathy , began selling luxurious property and expensive art .
The Fulds own at least four properties -- an estate in Greenwich ; a mansion on Jupiter Island , Florida ; a home in Middlebury ; Vermont and the house in Ketchum .
They sold their apartment on New York ’s Park Avenue for $ 25.87 million in August , having bought it for $ 21 million in January 2007 and done a multimillion dollar renovation .
A source close to the couple said Kathy , who was often seen shopping at places like Hermes , buying items such as bags and shawls that cost a few thousand dollars each , has not been seen at such stores in the past few months .
“ It could be that they ’re pulling back the spending or it could be that she does n’t want to be seen spending , so she could be having someone else do the shopping for her , ” the person said .

Kathy , who sits on the board of trustees for the Museum of Modern Art and is known for her love of drawings , has sold at least 16 drawings by artists such as Arshile Gorky and Barnett Newman for around $ 13.5 million .
“ I know it ’s been hard .
From what I saw he was a wonderful father and a great husband , ” said Paul Assaiante , who through the years played squash with Richard Fuld and tennis with Kathy .
But they have n’t played a single squash game since Lehman ’s demise , said Assaiante , who coaches teams at Trinity College .
Over the same period , Fuld , who has two daughters and a son , has dropped off the boards of the Robin Hood Foundation , which supports New York City anti-poverty groups ; the Partnership for NYC , an economic development network ; and the Blind Brook Country Club in Purchase , New York .
Meanwhile , he has not been chartering private jets for his trips to Idaho -- instead flying Delta Air , according to residents of Ketchum , a little town also known for residents such as actor Tom Hanks , and the place where Ernest Hemingway is buried .
Indeed , Fuld flew back to New York early Saturday morning on a Delta flight .
He had connected through a SkyWest flight from Hailey , Idaho , to Salt Lake City , Utah that was also taken by the Reuters reporter .
On the twin turbo - prop jet , he was reading David Wessel ’s book , “ In Fed We Trust , ” which looks at the Federal Reserve ’s role in the financial crisis , and could be seen underlining various passages .

The book examines , among other things , why the U.S. authorities did not rescue Lehman while being prepared to bailout floundering insurance giant AIG .
When asked about his views of the key figures in that decision , former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and current Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , he said the reporter should read that book and “ go back to my testimony ” before lawmakers .
Fuld had told the Congressional panel that he would wonder “ until they put me in the ground ” why the U.S. government did not rescue his firm , as it helped others .
In the testimony , he blamed a series of developments for Lehman ’s downfall , including abusive short selling , false rumors , credit agency downgrades and loss of confidence by clients and counterparties .
DEVASTATED
Almost to a person , Lehman employees said in interviews they were still devastated by the demise of the 158 - year - old firm .
They were stunned , and now they are bitter , about a federal government that arranged shotgun weddings for Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch , propped up AIG and bailed out Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley MS.N -- but let Lehman die .
“ They should never have let us go bankrupt .
It was just a big , huge mistake , ” said one executive who worked closely with Fuld .
While Fuld has his defenders , Lawrence McDonald , a former Lehman vice president of distressed debt and convertible securities trading , who wrote a book about the Lehman collapse -- “ A Colossal Failure of Common Sense ” -- called him arrogant and irresponsible .
“ Fuld has a bunker mentality .
He blamed the markets , blamed the short - sellers .
The truth is , qualified people warned him several times and he would n’t listen , ” McDonald told Reuters in an interview .
McDonald said there was still “ a lot of anger in the community out there ” toward Fuld .
Others said that Lehman under Fuld certainly helped to create the conditions for its own demise .
“ It was a series of small steps -- rising leverage , retention of risky positions , delay of raising capital and reliance on ‘ hot money ’ for financing -- that one by one took Lehman to the end of the plank , ” said Brad Hintz , analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and the CFO of Lehman in the late 1990s .
Lawrence McCarthy , who was head of distressed bond trading at Lehman and works for Rafferty Capital now , told Reuters he quit after warning , several times , that the real estate market was living on borrowed time and that Lehman was becoming too leveraged .
“ Other than six or seven people , no one really knew him .
It was like he was in his own world on the 31st floor , ” McCarthy said of Fuld .
“ He was never in touch with the troops .
In my four years there , he never came down to the trading floor .
Not once . ”
When Lehman ’s risk committee said “ hit the brake pedal , he was hitting the accelerator , ” said McCarthy , who was quoted in McDonald ’s book .
At his house in Ketchum , Fuld bristled at the perception .
“ What , do people think I ’m an idiot , that suddenly I woke up two months before and suddenly things were a problem ?
No .
No , the signs were there , ” he said .
Speaking with the Reuters reporter the next day at the Salt Lake City airport , Fuld called McDonald ’s book “ absolutely slanderous , ” adding : “ You know , ‘ Dick never left his office . ’
Well , I left my office , I left my office plenty . ”
“ I ’m not a defeatist , ” he said .
“ I do believe at the end of the day that the good guys do win .
I do believe that . ”
Need a good family law attorney , call Stephanie Squires !
She responded right away to my inquiry and gave me some very sound advice .
When my situation turned to where I actually needed representation , I immediately called her .
She quickly came up with a sound approach , patiently explained all of the legalese to me and really made me feel much more at ease .
I cannot tell you what a relief it was having , Ms. Squires in the court room with me .
She fought hard for my case and was able to negotiate an agreement with the opposing attorney ( which was very much in my favor ) and avoid going to possible trial .
Thank you so much Stephanie Squires I could n’t have found a better attorney .

THE faces over at the Wine Spectator are redder than a bottle of fine Bordeaux this week , after the highly respected magazine gave a prestigious award to a restaurant that never existed .
Wine connoisseur and watchdog Robin Goldstein , curious as to how the mag selected the world ’s best wine restaurants , submitted an application for an “ Award of Excellence ” for a phony eatery he called “ Osteria L’Intrepido ” with a Milan address .
He set up a fake Web site , created a menu of “ somewhat bumbling nouvelle - Italian recipes , ” and invented a high - priced wine list that included “ some of the lowest - scoring Italian wines in Wine Spectator over the past few decades ” – among them , a 1982 Brunello di Montalcino that “ smells barnyardy and tastes decayed . ”
Still , the imaginary eatery was honored in this month ’s issue .
It was a shock to top local restaurateurs .
“ We make an assumption that it ’s an excellent magazine , ” Gramercy Tavern beverage director Juliette Pope told Page Six .
“ Hopefully , it was just a fluke . ”
Goldstein , author of “ The Wine Trials , ” wrote on his blog : “ While Osteria L’Intrepido may be the first to win an Award of Excellence for an imaginary restaurant , it ’s unlikely that it was the first submission that did n’t accurately reflect the contents of a restaurant ’s wine cellar . ”
Wine Spectator Executive Editor Thomas
Matthews told us the magazine was the victim of a clever hoaxer , fuming , “ This was a mugging .
Why would he do this ? ”
Asked whether heads would roll , he said , “ Do you punish the victim of a mugging ? ” Matthews called Goldstein “ a malicious person ” who pulled “ an act of malicious duplicity , ” and he insisted the magazine never claimed to have visited all of the nearly 4,500 restaurants that paid a $ 250 fee to apply for the award .
But , he said , “ Wine Spectator will clearly have to be more vigilant in the future . ”
‘ God hates Diet Pepsi ’
A group that advocates “ traditional family values ” claims it has the signatures of 500,000 people who have pledged to boycott Pepsi over what it says are the company ’s activities promoting gay rights .
The American Family Association , which boasts “ 2.5 million online supporters , ” “ asked PepsiCo to be neutral in the culture war and not support the homosexual agenda , ” it said in a press release Tuesday .
“ PepsiCo refused .
The company continues to give financial support to homosexual organizations . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The AFA launched its boycott campaign in January over PepsiCo ’s “ continued support of same - sex marriage and homosexual advocacy . ”
The group said it had received a “ condescending letter ” from Pepsi that “ refused to address Pepsi ’s support of the homosexual agenda . ”
In particular , the AFA decried PepsiCo ’s donations to groups that funded the effort against California ’s Proposition 8 last year .
The AFA said PepsiCo gave $ 500,000 to the Human Rights Campaign , which had worked to defeat Proposition 8 .
The proposition , which barred same - sex marriage in the state and passed by a narrow margin last November , was supported by numerous conservative groups , as well as the Mormon church .
By some reports , the Mormon church raised around $ 19 million for the Proposition 8 effort , amounting to 75 percent of all donations .
The Pepsi boycott seems to be having some effect within the Christian conservative community .
Last month , the Westboro Baptist Church , of “ God hates fags ” fame , protested in downtown Atlanta with signs that read “ God hates Diet Pepsi . ”
Last month , Bell Shoals Baptist , a mega- church in Brandon , Florida , removed its Pepsi vending machines and replaced them with Coke machines .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ We fight this battle one skirmish at a time , ” said Terry Kemple , the Bell Shoals member who organized the vending machine change , in an interview with the Brandon News & Tribune .
“ Our forefathers came here for religious liberty , not sexual liberty . ”
But the church ’s switch from Pepsi to Coke — which other Florida churches joined — may have been a strategic mistake .
As Bridgette LaVictoire reported on the LezGetReal blog , “ Coca Cola has consistently scored higher on the Human Rights Campaign ’s list of LGBT friendly businesses ” than Pepsi .
“ The AFA [ is ] furious with PepsiCo over their diversity training , which is actually not quite as good as Coca Cola ’s , and their work place support of LGBT individuals , which is not quite the same level of support as seen in Coca Cola Corp. , ” she wrote .

Earlier this year , the AFA slammed Pepsi and the Fox animated comedy Family Guy for “ condon[ing ] bestiality , gay orgies and babies eating sperm . ”
The group was offended by an episode in which main character Peter Griffin was “ turned gay ” after taking an experimental shot of the “ gay gene . ”
Evidently the group was upset that the show portrayed homosexuality as something that is not a choice .
“ Pepsi and FOX network joined hands to bring a perverted and sickening episode of TV’s Family Guy into the homes of millions of Americans , ” the group said in a statement .

“ Interestingly … there ’s no mention of the word ‘ Pepsi ’ anywhere in the show , ” Frederick Reinhardt wrote at Examiner.com .
“ I wonder if Pepsi just happened to be one of the 24 other advertisers of the show when it aired . ”
Question
What should I do if I get frustrated when I do n't understand homework ?
Some people have said that I 'm stupid and I feel that this means they are right .
Also , how can I deal with not having anyone around to support me ?
Community Answer
It was smart to ask for help , and that attitude shows how much you care about your own development .
I encourage you to see yourself as someone who is struggling , not stupid .
I , too , struggled with various subjects when I was a student .
If you have access to a teacher or a student who excels at this subject , why not ask them to spend some time helping you understand the assignments ?
Even if you do not have people physically around you , you can find support through various online communities .
And if you cannot find an online community that feels like a perfect fit , you can still join it to learn from other people .
Life is often like that , not perfect but a work in progress .
Accused of murder , council official 's son who knifed two burglars raiding his mother 's home
A man who stabbed a burglar to death after catching him in the act was charged with murder yesterday .
Omari Roberts , 23 , was remanded in custody .
Roberts had found two teenage burglars in his mother 's house when he arrived to visit her .
After chasing one of the youths , aged 14 , from the property , he returned to find 17 - year - old Tyler Juett still there .
Tyler Juett , 17 , died after he was allegedly stabbed by Omari Roberts
There was a struggle and Juett was fatally stabbed in the chest , Nottingham Magistrates Court was told .
The Crown Prosecution Service said the decision to charge Roberts months after the incident in March had been taken after ' careful consideration ' .
Its lawyers believed he had used ' excessive and gratuitous force ' .
The case echoes that of Norfolk farmer Tony Martin , who became a cause celebre when he was jailed for life for murder in 2000 after shooting dead a teenage intruder at his dilapidated Norfolk home .
His conviction was reduced to manslaughter on appeal and he was released in 2003 .
Yesterday the court heard that Roberts 's mother Jacqueline McKenzie - Johnson , 46 , a senior official at Nottingham City Council , was not at home when her son arrived on the afternoon of March 13 .
Lee Shepherd , prosecuting , said Roberts first discovered the 14 - year - old , who was also stabbed during a confrontation .
Roberts chased him down the street before returning to the semi- detached house in Old Basford , Nottingham , to be confronted by Juett .
Applying for bail for Roberts , who is also charged with wounding the younger raider with intent to cause grievous bodily harm , Raj Chand , defending , said : ' This must have been a dreadful situation for any law - abiding member of the public .
' Someone said to me earlier that he was in the wrong place at the wrong time , but I said that he was in the right place at the right time .
An Englishman 's home is his castle .
' He says he was in the right .
He regrets what happened , but he was defending himself and his property . '
District Judge John Stobart initially said he would take the ' rare decision ' to grant bail because of Roberts 's flawless record of reporting to police .
But he agreed to remand him in custody at least until today after the prosecution said it wanted to appeal against the decision .
Roberts , who did not enter any pleas , is scheduled to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on November 10 .
His address was listed in court as his mother 's house , although it is understood he did not live there at the time of the incident .
Before the hearing , CPS lawyer Ian Cunningham said : ' I have decided that when Omari Roberts disturbed two burglars and caused injuries to them - in one case fatally - his actions were not reasonable .
' I have looked very carefully at the public interest in this case , and I am satisfied that it requires a prosecution .
' I also discussed the case with the CPS principal legal adviser and have decided there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction . '
Mr Cunningham said legal guidelines made clear that anyone using ' reasonable force ' to defend themselves would enjoy the full protection of the law .
He added : ' The law also makes clear that people could be prosecuted if they act with excessive and gratuitous force . '
• Nottinghamshire Police said the 14 - year - old admitted burglary at youth court in May and was sentenced to two years ' detention .
By now almost everyone has heard of so - called zero - copy functionality under Linux , but I often run into people who do n't have a full understanding of the subject .
Because of this , I decided to write a few articles that dig into the matter a bit deeper , in the hope of unraveling this useful feature .
In this article , we take a look at zero copy from a user - mode application point of view , so gory kernel - level details are omitted intentionally .
What Is Zero-Copy ?
To better understand the solution to a problem , we first need to understand the problem itself .
Let 's look at what is involved in the simple procedure of a network server dæmon serving data stored in a file to a client over the network .
Here 's some sample code : read ( file , tmp_buf , len ) ; write ( socket , tmp_buf , len ) ;
Looks simple enough ; you would think there is not much overhead with only those two system calls .
In reality , this could n't be further from the truth .
Behind those two calls , the data has been copied at least four times , and almost as many user / kernel context switches have been performed .
( Actually this process is much more complicated , but I wanted to keep it simple ) .
To get a better idea of the process involved , take a look at Figure 1 .
The top side shows context switches , and the bottom side shows copy operations .
Figure 1 . Copying in Two Sample System Calls
Step one : the read system call causes a context switch from user mode to kernel mode .
The first copy is performed by the DMA engine , which reads file contents from the disk and stores them into a kernel address space buffer .
Step two : data is copied from the kernel buffer into the user buffer , and the read system call returns .
The return from the call caused a context switch from kernel back to user mode .
Now the data is stored in the user address space buffer , and it can begin its way down again .
Step three : the write system call causes a context switch from user mode to kernel mode .
A third copy is performed to put the data into a kernel address space buffer again .
This time , though , the data is put into a different buffer , a buffer that is associated with sockets specifically .
Step four : the write system call returns , creating our fourth context switch .
Independently and asynchronously , a fourth copy happens as the DMA engine passes the data from the kernel buffer to the protocol engine .
You are probably asking yourself , “ What do you mean independently and asynchronously ?
Was n't the data transmitted before the call returned ? ”
Call return , in fact , does n't guarantee transmission ; it does n't even guarantee the start of the transmission .
It simply means the Ethernet driver had free descriptors in its queue and has accepted our data for transmission .
There could be numerous packets queued before ours .
Unless the driver / hardware implements priority rings or queues , data is transmitted on a first - in - first - out basis .
( The forked DMA copy in Figure 1 illustrates the fact that the last copy can be delayed ) .
As you can see , a lot of data duplication is not really necessary to hold things up .
Some of the duplication could be eliminated to decrease overhead and increase performance .
As a driver developer , I work with hardware that has some pretty advanced features .
Some hardware can bypass the main memory altogether and transmit data directly to another device .
This feature eliminates a copy in the system memory and is a nice thing to have , but not all hardware supports it .
There is also the issue of the data from the disk having to be repackaged for the network , which introduces some complications .
To eliminate overhead , we could start by eliminating some of the copying between the kernel and user buffers .
One way to eliminate a copy is to skip calling read and instead call mmap .
For example : tmp_buf = mmap( file , len ) ; write ( socket , tmp_buf , len ) ;
To get a better idea of the process involved , take a look at Figure 2 .
Context switches remain the same .
Figure 2 . Calling mmap
Step one : the mmap system call causes the file contents to be copied into a kernel buffer by the DMA engine .
The buffer is shared then with the user process , without any copy being performed between the kernel and user memory spaces .
Step two : the write system call causes the kernel to copy the data from the original kernel buffers into the kernel buffers associated with sockets .
Step three : the third copy happens as the DMA engine passes the data from the kernel socket buffers to the protocol engine .
By using mmap instead of read , we 've cut in half the amount of data the kernel has to copy .
This yields reasonably good results when a lot of data is being transmitted .
However , this improvement does n't come without a price ; there are hidden pitfalls when using the mmap + write method .
You will fall into one of them when you memory map a file and then call write while another process truncates the same file .
Your write system call will be interrupted by the bus error signal SIGBUS , because you performed a bad memory access .
The default behavior for that signal is to kill the process and dump core — not the most desirable operation for a network server .
There are two ways to get around this problem .
The first way is to install a signal handler for the SIGBUS signal , and then simply call return in the handler .
By doing this the write system call returns with the number of bytes it wrote before it got interrupted and the errno set to success .
Let me point out that this would be a bad solution , one that treats the symptoms and not the cause of the problem .
Because SIGBUS signals that something has gone seriously wrong with the process , I would discourage using this as a solution .
The second solution involves file leasing ( which is called “ opportunistic locking ” in Microsoft Windows ) from the kernel .
This is the correct way to fix this problem .
By using leasing on the file descriptor , you take a lease with the kernel on a particular file .
You then can request a read / write lease from the kernel .
When another process tries to truncate the file you are transmitting , the kernel sends you a real - time signal , the RT_SIGNAL_LEASE signal .
It tells you the kernel is breaking your write or read lease on that file .
Your write call is interrupted before your program accesses an invalid address and gets killed by the SIGBUS signal .
The return value of the write call is the number of bytes written before the interruption , and the errno will be set to success .
Here is some sample code that shows how to get a lease from the kernel : if ( fcntl ( fd , F_SETSIG , RT_SIGNAL_LEASE ) == - 1 ) { perror ( " kernel lease set signal " ) ; return - 1 ; } /* l_type can be F_RDLCK F_WRLCK */ if ( fcntl ( fd , F_SETLEASE , l_type ) ) { perror ( " kernel lease set type " ) ; return - 1 ; } You should get your lease before mmaping the file , and break your lease after you are done .
This is achieved by calling fcntl F_SETLEASE with the lease type of F_UNLCK .
Sendfile
In kernel version 2.1 , the sendfile system call was introduced to simplify the transmission of data over the network and between two local files .
Introduction of sendfile not only reduces data copying , it also reduces context switches .
Use it like this : sendfile ( socket , file , len ) ;
To get a better idea of the process involved , take a look at Figure 3 .
Figure 3 . Replacing Read and Write with Sendfile Step one : the sendfile system call causes the file contents to be copied into a kernel buffer by the DMA engine .
Then the data is copied by the kernel into the kernel buffer associated with sockets .
Step two : the third copy happens as the DMA engine passes the data from the kernel socket buffers to the protocol engine .
You are probably wondering what happens if another process truncates the file we are transmitting with the sendfile system call .
If we do n't register any signal handlers , the sendfile call simply returns with the number of bytes it transferred before it got interrupted , and the errno will be set to success .
If we get a lease from the kernel on the file before we call sendfile , however , the behavior and the return status are exactly the same .
We also get the RT_SIGNAL_LEASE signal before the sendfile call returns .
So far , we have been able to avoid having the kernel make several copies , but we are still left with one copy .
Can that be avoided too ?
Absolutely , with a little help from the hardware .
To eliminate all the data duplication done by the kernel , we need a network interface that supports gather operations .
This simply means that data awaiting transmission does n't need to be in consecutive memory ; it can be scattered through various memory locations .
In kernel version 2.4 , the socket buffer descriptor was modified to accommodate those requirements — what is known as zero copy under Linux .
This approach not only reduces multiple context switches , it also eliminates data duplication done by the processor .
For user - level applications nothing has changed , so the code still looks like this : sendfile ( socket , file , len ) ;
To get a better idea of the process involved , take a look at Figure 4 .
Figure 4 .
Hardware that supports gather can assemble data from multiple memory locations , eliminating another copy .
Step one : the sendfile system call causes the file contents to be copied into a kernel buffer by the DMA engine .
Step two : no data is copied into the socket buffer .
Instead , only descriptors with information about the whereabouts and length of the data are appended to the socket buffer .
The DMA engine passes data directly from the kernel buffer to the protocol engine , thus eliminating the remaining final copy .
Because data still is actually copied from the disk to the memory and from the memory to the wire , some might argue this is not a true zero copy .
This is zero copy from the operating system standpoint , though , because the data is not duplicated between kernel buffers .
When using zero copy , other performance benefits can be had besides copy avoidance , such as fewer context switches , less CPU data cache pollution and no CPU checksum calculations .
Now that we know what zero copy is , let 's put theory into practice and write some code .
You can download the full source code from www.xalien.org/articles/source/sfl-src.tgz.
To unpack the source code , type tar - zxvf sfl - src.tgz at the prompt .
To compile the code and create the random data file data .bin , run make .
Looking at the code starting with header files : /* sfl . c sendfile example program Dragan Stancevic < header name function / variable

/* inet_addr */ #define BUFF_SIZE ( 10 * 1024 ) /* size of the tmp buffer */ Besides the regular < sys / socket.h > and < netinet / in.h > required for basic socket operation , we need a prototype definition of the sendfile system call .
This can be found in the < sys/ sendfile .h > server flag : /* are we sending or receiving */ if ( argv [ 1 ] [ 0 ] == 's ' ) is_server ++ ; /* open descriptors */ sd = socket ( PF_INET , SOCK_STREAM , 0 ) ; if ( is_server ) fd = open ( " data.bin " , O_RDONLY ) ;
The same program can act as either a server / sender or a client / receiver .
We have to check one of the command - prompt parameters , and then set the flag is_server to run in sender mode .
We also open a stream socket of the INET protocol family .
As part of running in server mode we need some type of data to transmit to a client , so we open our data file .
We are using the system call sendfile to transmit data , so we do n't have to read the actual contents of the file and store it in our program memory buffer .
Here 's the server address : /* clear the memory */ memset ( &sa , 0 , sizeof ( struct sockaddr_in ) ) ; /* initialize structure */ sa.sin_family = PF_INET ; sa.sin_port = htons ( 1033 ) ; sa.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(argv [ 2 ] ) ;
We clear the server address structure and assign the protocol family , port and IP address of the server .
The address of the server is passed as a command - line parameter .
The port number is hard coded to unassigned port 1033 .
This port number was chosen because it is above the port range requiring root access to the system .

" , argv [ 2 ] ) ; if ( bind ( sd , ( struct sockaddr *) &sa , sizeof ( sa ) ) < 0 ) { perror ( " bind " ) ; exit ( errno ) ; } As a server , we need to assign an address to our socket descriptor .
This is achieved by the system call bind , which assigns the socket descriptor ( sd ) a server address ( sa ) : if ( listen ( sd , 1 ) < 0 ) { perror ( " listen " ) ; exit ( errno ) ; } Because we are using a stream socket , we have to advertise our willingness to accept incoming connections and set the connection queue size .
I 've set the backlog queue to 1 , but it is common to set the backlog a bit higher for established connections waiting to be accepted .
In older versions of the kernel , the backlog queue was used to prevent syn flood attacks .
Because the system call listen changed to set parameters for only established connections , the backlog queue feature has been deprecated for this call .
The kernel parameter tcp_max_syn_backlog has taken over the role of protecting the system from syn flood attacks : if (( client = accept ( sd , NULL , NULL ) ) < 0 ) { perror ( " accept " ) ; exit ( errno ) ; }
The system call accept creates a new connected socket from the first connection request on the pending connections queue .
The return value from the call is a descriptor for a newly created connection ; the socket is now ready for read , write or poll / select system calls : if ( ( cnt = sendfile ( client , fd , &off , BUFF_SIZE ) ) < 0 ) { perror ( " sendfile " ) ; exit ( errno ) ; } printf ( " Server sent %d bytes .
" , cnt ) ; close ( client ) ;
A connection is established on the client socket descriptor , so we can start transmitting data to the remote system .
We do this by calling the sendfile system call , which is prototyped under Linux in the following manner : extern ssize_t sendfile ( int __out_fd , int __in_fd , off_t * offset , size_t __count ) __THROW ;
The first two parameters are file descriptors .
The third parameter points to an offset from which sendfile should start sending data .
The fourth parameter is the number of bytes we want to transmit .
In order for the sendfile transmit to use zero - copy functionality , you need memory gather operation support from your networking card .
You also need checksum capabilities for protocols that implement checksums , such as TCP or UDP .
If your NIC is outdated and does n't support those features , you still can use sendfile to transmit files .
The difference is the kernel will merge the buffers before transmitting them .

Portability Issues
One of the problems with the sendfile system call , in general , is the lack of a standard implementation , as there is for the open system call .
Sendfile implementations in Linux , Solaris or HP - UX are quite different .
This poses a problem for developers who wish to use zero copy in their network data transmission code .
One of the implementation differences is Linux provides a sendfile that defines an interface for transmitting data between two file descriptors ( file - to - file ) and ( file - to - socket ) .
HP - UX and Solaris , on the other hand , can be used only for file - to - socket submissions .
The second difference is Linux does n't implement vectored transfers .
Solaris sendfile and HP - UX sendfile have extra parameters that eliminate overhead associated with prepending headers to the data being transmitted .
Looking Ahead
The implementation of zero copy under Linux is far from finished and is likely to change in the near future .
More functionality should be added .
For example , the sendfile call does n't support vectored transfers , and servers such as Samba and Apache have to use multiple sendfile calls with the TCP_CORK flag set .
This flag tells the system more data is coming through in the next sendfile calls .
TCP_CORK also is incompatible with TCP_NODELAY and is used when we want to prepend or append headers to the data .
This is a perfect example of where a vectored call would eliminate the need for multiple sendfile calls and delays mandated by the current implementation .
One rather unpleasant limitation in the current sendfile is it cannot be used when transferring files greater than 2GB .
Files of such size are not all that uncommon today , and it 's rather disappointing having to duplicate all that data on its way out .
Because both sendfile and mmap methods are unusable in this case , a sendfile64 would be really handy in a future kernel version .
I ’m assuming that you ’ve already seen code which looks like this :
function doSomething ( isTrue ) { if (!!isTrue ) { // some code here } }
And I ’m sure you ’re wondering what ’s going on there .
This is sometimes called boolean normalization and its main advantage is that you end up getting a true boolean value instead of relying on the use of truthly and falsy values in JavaScript .
Lets walk this step by step , shall we ?
When you have something like this :
var aux = !isTrue ;
you ’re using the ! operator to “ negate ” the current expression .
As you know by now , JavaScript has several falsy values ( ie , values which represent false –ex. : 0 is always converted into false ) .
When we apply the !
operator for the first time , we end up converting the isTrue variable to a boolean and negating it .
The second !
ends up negating that intermediate expression and we end up with the correct boolean value for the initial expression .
Many consider this a bad practice and prefer to use other approaches .
For instance , you could get the same result by using the Boolean function :
function doSomething ( isTrue ) { if ( Boolean ( isTrue ) ) { alert ( " YES ! " ) ; } }
Btw , do n’t fall to the temptation of using a Boolean object , ie , do n’t call new Boolean ( isTrue ) for converting the value to a boolean .
If you do that , you ’ll end up creating a new * object * which wraps a boolean value .
Since we ’re talking about a non null value , you ’ll always end with a true expression and this is not what we want here !
Even though the code is somewhat cryptic and consider by many as a “ poor man ’s boolean conversion operator ” , it ’s code that most savvy JS programmers use because it ’s compact and simple .
I ’ve been using this technique whenever I need to ensure the use of a proper boolean value .
And that ’s all for today .
Stay tuned for more on JavaScript .

UCLA 's Lee Ohanian has a new paper out ( gated ) [ UPDATE : ungated version here ] that argues that Hoover 's high wage policies were a substantial cause of the severity of the Great Depression :
I develop a theory of labor market failure for the Great Depression based on Hoover 's industrial labor program that provided industry with protection from unions in return for keeping nominal wages fixed .
I find that the theory accounts for much of the depth of the Depression and for the asymmetry of the depression across sectors .
The theory also can reconcile why deflation and low levels of nominal spending apparently had such large real effects during the 1930s , but not during other periods of significant deflation .
Not surprisingly , he 's taking a beating in the left - oriented press ( see an example from Salon here ) from those who simply cannot imagine that Hoover was anything but Rush Limbaugh 's spiritual ancestor .
The fact that Hoover might have been a significant interventionist , many of whose policies foreshadowed the New Deal , is one their brains simply cannot accept , no matter how much evidence there is .
Of course , the fact that Rothbard and Vedder / Gallaway have hammered this point before is not discussed at all .
I have a piece in the next issue of Econ Journal Watch that provides a detailed critique of this AER piece on Hoover and Roosevelt , as well more generally offering a counter - narrative of whole 1929 - 45 period integrating a bunch of different research .
I 'll certainly post a link here when it 's out , but I did want to include this bit of it as a counter to the Myth of Hoover the Laissez - Fairist :
Eggertsson ’s portrayal of Hoover as dogmatically committed to a balanced budget and small government is utterly at odds with Hoover ’s personal history and stated beliefs , as well as the actual policies he put into place while president .
Hoover ’s first major role in government was as head of the Food Administration upon the US entry into World War I in 1917 .
He leapt into that job with great energy , having long believed that government can and should play a large role in the economy .
In 1912 , he had supported Teddy Roosevelt and the Progressives for the presidency , and was touted by many , including Franklin Roosevelt , as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in the 1920s .
He was a registered Republican , however , and in 1921 accepted a position as Secretary of Commerce under President Harding , a job that he retained through most of the 1920s .
Hoover vowed to turn what was one of the lowest - profile departments of the federal government into a more visible one , specifically by increased interaction with businesses and involvement in economic policy .
Donald Stabile ( 1986 ) has characterized his views as a desire to “ transform the structure of the US economy from one of laissez - faire to one of voluntary cooperation ” ( 819 ) .
In her book Herbert Hoover : Forgotten Progressive , Joan Hoff Wilson ( 1975 , 68 ) summarizes Hoover ’s economic views this way :
Where the classical economists like Adam Smith had argued for uncontrolled competition between independent economic units guided only by the invisible hand of supply and demand , he talked about voluntary national economic planning arising from cooperation between business interests and the government …
Instead of negative government action in times of depression , he advocated the expansion of public works , avoidance of wage cuts , increased rather than decreased production — measures that would expand rather than contract purchasing power .
When paired with his long - standing antipathy to free trade ( 65 - 66 ) , this was hardly the program of a “ limited government ” or “ laissez - faire ” dogmatist .
Other ideas he championed around this time included “ increased inheritance taxes , public dams , and , significantly , government regulation of the stock market ” ( Rothbard 2008 [ 1963 ] , 188 ) .
As early as the 1920 - 21 recession , Hoover was becoming famous for convening conferences with business leaders as a way to use the power of government to generate what he saw as desirable “ cooperation ” as opposed to individualistic competition .
In contrast to Harding ’s much more genuine commitment to laissez - faire during that recession , Hoover quickly got busy organizing conferences and relief efforts and exhorting businessmen and the public to bring that spirit of “ mobilization ” and “ spontaneous cooperation ” experienced during the war to peacetime economic reconstruction .
At one conference on unemployment in September of 1921 , Harding opened with remarks committing him to keeping the federal government out of such issues , and yet Hoover followed by expounding the need to “ do something . ”
The conference leaders , with Hoover ’s approval , coalesced around a call for more “ government planning to combat depressions and to bolster the idea of public works as a depression remedy ” ( Rothbard 2008 [ 1963 ] , 192 ) .
Historian David Kennedy ( 1999 , 48 ) describes
Hoover ’s activism this way : “ No previous administration had moved so purposefully and so creatively in the face of an economic downturn .
Hoover had definitively made the point that government should not stand by idly when confronted with economic difficulty ” ( see also Vedder and Gallaway 1993 , 67-68 ) .
It remains a fascinating question why the proponents of the New Deal can't see in Hoover the precursor of so much of what the New Deal gave us .
His call for maintaining nominal wages in the face of price deflation was a belief he'd held for at least a decade prior to the onset of the Great Depression .
That is the Hoover that Americans voted for in 1928 !
Of course , what the Hoover - Roosevelt policies gave us was mostly disastrous , but to deny the fairly straightforward facts of what Hoover believed and what he did seems to me to be the worst sort of dogmatic " head in the sand " ism .
Note that the citations here are not just to free market types .
David Kennedy is a liberal and that book won a Pulitzer .
Stablile and Wilson are , again , just historians doing their job .
Wilson 's book and its title are particularly telling here as she lays out the case for her title very clearly .
It 's not " free market " ideology to argue Hoover was an interventionist ; it 's good history .
What 's even funnier is how the commenters at the Salon piece linked above accuse Ohanian of being a lousy historian and of New Deal critics of ignoring the facts , etc. , while stubbornly clinging to an utterly false view of Hoover .

Managing a download - only console may prove harder than Sony first imagined .
If you are a European customer who purchased a PSP Go , you were given a voucher for your choice of three games .
The problem is that many gamers use their PlayStation 3 to download PSP content , and Sony locked the downloads down to whatever system customers use to grab the content .
That means that if you used your PlayStation 3 to download the games , you 're out of luck .
This is n't the only issue to hinder the PSP Go 's momentum .
Gamers are complaining about this issue on the official PlayStation boards , and Sony released a statement about the problem .
The solution ?
There is n't one .
A community team member had this to say , " If you download your games to your PS3 first and then attempt to copy the game across to your PSPgo via USB cable you will receive [ an ] error .
We 're still investigating this error , so for the moment if you have not yet redeemed your voucher , please redeem and download your games via your PSPgo only .
We 're still coming up with a solution for those who have redeemed the voucher and are now receiving the error message , and we 'll update you as soon as we have a solution for you . "
What 's amazing about this is the problem only effects
Sony 's most valuable customers : early PSP
Go adopters who already own a PS3 .
Instead of rewarding the behavior the company has tried to encourage — sharing content between the systems — gamers are left with free games they can't play , and no timeline for a solution .
Unfortunately , this is not the only problem plaguing the PSP Go .
The phantom UMD trade - in program
Back at E3 , when we first played with the PSP
Go , we were assured that there would be a program where gamers could get some use out of their existing UMDs if they upgraded into the PSP Go .
" It does n't make sense to leave [ PSP owners ] behind .
We 're going to have a program put into place that will allow that person to become part of the digital lifestyle .
We 'll have details closer to launch , " Sony 's director of hardware marketing John Koller assured us .
Now the system has launched , and Sony has admitted there is no plan to allow customers to trade in their existing games for downloads .
Although we were told that by launch we'd know what we could do with our UMDs , everyone was hoping the answer was n't going to be " sell them to GameStop . "
So what happened ?
" There were n't digital rights secured for all of this stuff , at no cost , " SCEA director of PlayStation network operations Eric Lempel told Joystiq .
" So , [ there are ] lots of legal issues we'd have to get through to get a lot of content cleared .
And also , we'd have to protect that content .
So , with a good technical process so you can't pass around the UMD or do something else with it . "
The problems could n't have been new as Sony explored distribution as they developed the PSP
Go , nor are they surprising , so why did the talk of a trade - in program ever begin ?
" On the loyalty side , we do lots of things for our loyal users , " Lempel claimed .
But that claim does n't really hold water .
Sony promised a UMD program that never surfaced .
It reworked the cabling and power system for the PSP
Go to make sure none of your existing peripherals would be able to work on the system .
The Pro Duo memory sticks used in the PSP , which is a Sony standard , have been ditched .
Players will need to buy an M2 Micro card for the PSP
Go if they would like to expand their storage .
The M2 is , of course , another Sony standard .
Looks like it 's time to rebuy your memory sticks as well .
In terms of taking care of their loyal customers , Sony has locked down the PSP
Go with all new media and standards ; every customer , no matter what other Sony products they own in the PSP line , will start from zero .
The system is receiving an icy reception
Destructoid 's Jim Sterling posted a long , expletive - filled rant describing his frustration in the first few hours of PSP Go ownership .
" I have been in my house for an hour ... an hour ... and I have done nothing but download , rip , copy , install , update , install , rip , copy , install , install and install , " he complained .
" I just want to play some videogames !
Sony , why wo n't you let me play some videogames ?
I promise I 'll try to be a good person from now on .
Do you want me to go to church ? "
To his horror , after the Media Go disc installed both Quicktime and an update to Adobe before allowing him to install the actual software , the program needed to be updated before he could use it to manage his content .
Complaints have also been heard about the PSP Mini program .
At the moment , the selection of games consists of many ports from the iPhone , although the PSP versions are significantly more expensive .
Sony also does not allow Minis to use any online features , which means no updates .
If a game is launched with bugs , the bugs will remain .
The guys at Penny Arcade likewise did n't mince words .
" With the DS , there was confusion about the purpose of the device — the functionality was so broad that it was difficult to discern their motive , " a recent update read .
" With the PSP Go , the purpose is clear , and in review after review one sees the case built : the system is a campaign of aggression against both retailers and consumers . "
LISBON — A row broke out in Portugal on Monday after a Nobel Prize - winning author denounced the Bible as a “ handbook of bad morals ” .
Speaking at the launch of his new book “ Cain ” , Jose Saramago , who won the 1998 Nobel Prize for Literature , said society would probably be better off without the Bible .
Roman Catholic Church leaders accused the 86 - year - old of a publicity stunt .

The book is an ironic retelling of the Biblical story of Cain , Adam and Eve ’s son who killed his younger brother Abel .
At the launch event in the northern Portuguese town of Penafiel on Sunday , Saramago said he did not think the book would offend Catholics “ because they do not read the Bible ” .
“ The Bible is a manual of bad morals ( which ) has a powerful influence on our culture and even our way of life .
Without the Bible , we would be different , and probably better people , ” he was quoted as saying by the news agency Lusa .
Saramago attacked “ a cruel , jealous and unbearable God ( who ) exists only in our heads ” and said he did not think his book would cause problems for the Catholic Church “ because Catholics do not read the Bible .
“ It might offend Jews , but that does n’t really matter to me , ” he added .

Father Manuel Marujao , the spokesman for the Portuguese conference of bishops , said he thought the remarks were a publicity stunt .
“ A writer of Jose Saramago ’s standing can criticise , ( but ) insults do no - one any good , particularly a Nobel Prize winner , ” the priest said .
Rabbi Elieze Martino , spokesman for the Jewish community in Lisbon , said the Jewish world would not be shocked by the writings of Saramago or anyone else .

“ Saramago does not know the Bible , ” the rabbi said , “ he has only superficial understanding of it . ”
The author caused a scandal in Portugal in 1992 with “ The Gospel According to Jesus Christ . ”

The book depicted Jesus losing his virginity to Mary Magdalene and being used by God to control the world .
Saramago quit Portugal at the time and moved to Lanzarote , in the Spanish Canary Islands .

Hi Blog .
Here ’s a campaign by one of the world ’s largest multinational corporations , McDonald ’s , promoting stereotypes in a way quite untoward in this day and age ( and no doubt would raise hackles with anti-defamation leagues if McD ’s tried it in , say , its country of origin ) .
The new NIPPON ALL STARS campaign ( which seems to have kicked off a few days ago , on August 10 , with its Tamago Double Mac ) , features a bespectacled , somewhat nerdy , gaijin speaking in broken katakana ( i.e. accented ) Japanese .
“ Mr James ” is his name ( following the convention of forcing all Western foreigners to be called by their first names , as opposed to last name plus - san , proper etiquette ) .
And boy is he happy with Japan , with life , with the taste of Japanese - variety burgers at McDonalds .
Hell , they ’re so good that even this nerdy - looking gaijin ( full - body cardboard cutouts available at every McD’s ) approves of them through his poor accented broken Japanese .
You even get a “ James Tamaran Desu ( “ it ’s so good I ca n’t stand it ! ” )
Card ” and a chance to win from a million dollar pool if you succumb to his sales pitch .
It ’s more than a little creepy .
Here are some scans , taken of materials photographed and collected at McDonald ’s Yodobashi Camera Sapporo August 13 , 2009 ( click on image to expand in browser ) :
From the food tray inserts :
From stickers on every table :
At every restaurant , a full - size cutout of “ Mr James ” :

As Submitter AP put it :
================================
Subject : mcdonalds ads feature gaijin “ MR. JAMES ”
Hey , Debito , I often read your blog and bought your handguide as well .
I really think living in Japan can be trying as a foreigner , and your efforts toward bringing overlooked issues to light and making things easier for all of us do n’t go unnoticed !
I wanted to send you a picture I took …
I got hungry while wandering in BicCamera ’s Osaka store , fell victim to a craving , and ended up eating at the McDonald ’s there .
On my tray I found this gem :
http://www.facebook.com/l/;www.flickr.com/photos/forkies/3813267914/
They were able to find some sucker to gaijin himself up ( who ends up to , of course , be American ) , and the captions show so well how Japanese people often see foreigners .
First , his Japanese is all katakana , as if he ’s not speaking properly .
His sentences are all short and simply - constructed .
and last , he is practically in love with Japan .
Convenient they found such a fellow !
Not sure if you ’ve seen this anywhere , as I first noticed it yesterday because I ’ve been abroad on holiday until last Friday .
On the subway ride home , I saw another small window sticker with the same MR .
JAMES caricature .
I ’m just shocked how the ad group at a giant corporation such as McDonald ’s thinks this is okay !
What do you make this campaign ?
Thanks for your time , and thanks again for the time you put into these kinds of issues , AP
=============================
I think a strongly - worded letter from registered NPO FRANCA to McDonald ’s USA HQ regarding the issues of stereotyping here would be warranted .
Hell , you think McD USA would start putting up a full - body “ ching - chong - chinaman ” with funny glasses and protruding teeth , saying “ Me likee McFlied Lice ” .
You think that would fly over there ?
If not , it should n’t be allowed over here .
And I think you should make your displeasure known if you are so inclined at every McDonald ’s you patronize ( or not ) .

Obama Overload ?
President to Do ' Full Ginsburg ' Sunday Obama will take to every TV outlet available to him this weekend -- too much ?
Sept. 16 , 2009  --
Fans of President Obama are in for a treat this weekend .
The president is going on a massive publicity blitz as he steps up his push for health care overhaul .
Obama will be interviewed Sunday on five shows -- ABC News ' " This Week With George Stephanopoulos , " CNN's " State of the Nation , " CBS 's " Face the Nation " , NBC's " Meet the Press " and Univision 's " Al Punto with Jorge Ramos " -- in what is called a " full Ginsburg . "
In modern media lore , the first time someone pulled the five - show feat was 11 years ago , in 1998 , when Monica Lewinsky 's attorney , William Ginsburg , made the rounds to defend his client .
Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , did a full Ginsburg in 2007 after launching her presidential bid .
For both Ginsburg and Clinton , Fox News Sunday made the cut , and Univision did n't .
Such is not the case for Obama : Democrats said the Fox News Sunday audience is largely entrenched in its opposition to the president , essentially beyond persuasion , and so submitting to an interview might not be the best use of Obama 's time .
Polls indicate that Americans said the more they hear about the president 's proposed overhaul the less they like it .
An ABC News / Washington Poll last week showed 54 percent of Americans feel that way .
White House officials said that 's because Americans are hearing false attacks on Obama 's plan , not reality -- hence the PR blitz .
Critics snipe that the president risks overexposure .
In addition to this weekend 's shows , he granted interviews last week to ABC News ' " Good Morning America " and this week to CBS 's " 60 Minutes , " CNBC and Bloomberg News .
Republican strategist Kevin Madden said it 's too much .
" I think the worry is it 's gone beyond overexposure and now we have what I would call the ' Obama omnipresence . '
You almost can't escape this president , " Madden said on ABC News ' " Top Line . "
" It goes beyond just cable news and it goes into whether or not you 're flipping on ESPN and you 're seeing him talk about basketball or you turn on the Lifetime channel and you hear what Michelle Obama is wearing this week .
And I think that begins to wear on a lot of people . "
President Obama 's Publicity Campaign
The president 's pitch goes well beyond news shows .
He is also omnipresent on magazine racks and , next week , he will take his message to late night with an appearance on the " Late Show With David Letterman " -- the first appearance since he was elected president .
And that 's not Obama 's only comedy show appearance .
He is even showing up in promotions for the new George Lopez comedy show on TBS .
Madden said the barrage of TV appearances may have the opposite effect of what he 's trying to achieve .
" The president keeps -- he tries to hit reset with a big speech or an appearance on , you know , a major media outlet and that becomes one of these things where it starts to dilute the message , " Madden said .
" And the message is that he just keeps carrying another message and that begins to hurt him , in my book . "
But there are others who believe the president could step it up even more to avail himself of the opportunity to get his message across to the American people .
" I do n't think he 's overexposed at all , " said public strategist Mark McKinnon , media consultant to former President Bush and presidential candidate Sen.
John McCain , R - Ariz .
" In fact , I think , in some ways , he 's underexposed .
I think he's one of the most gifted presidential communicators that we 've seen in political history and telling President Obama to stay off the media is like telling Frank Sinatra to stay away from the microphone . "
White House Deputy Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said the idea of overexposure is " an anachronistic view of how people consume news in this day and age . "
With the audience splitting across hundreds of channels , the president could appear on all the Sunday shows , morning shows , evening news programs and late night , and not even reach half of the country .
McKinnon said the administration needs to make up for time it lost in August , when the president 's critics filled the airwaves to rally Americans .
" In politics , there 's really no such thing as overcommunicating , because if you are not communicating , your opponents will be , " McKinnon said .
" If the president stops talking , that means his opponents will start talking .
We live in 24 - hour news cycles now and if the president is n't filling the vacuum , his opponents will be . "
This is not the first time that the idea of whether Obama is overexposing himself has been floated around .
Media critics were carping about this back in March , then again in June .
As for the White House , when asked for comment , officials jokingly offered to turn down all of ABC News ' interview requests for the rest of the year .
ABC News ' Huma Khan contributed to this report .
Obama ’s Limo
Obama ’s secret service limo ?!?!
Even the dead deer head on the roof looks like it ’s embarrassed to be seen with this thing .

MOSUL , Iraq ( Reuters ) -
An unmanned U.S. reconnaissance drone crashed in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul early on Saturday , hitting the offices of one of Iraq ’s biggest political parties , the U.S. military said .
No injuries were reported , and there was no indication the aircraft was shot down , said Major Derrick Cheng , a military spokesman in northern Iraq .
Cheng said it was a coincidence that the drone struck the local offices of the Iraqi Islamic Party , Iraq ’s biggest Sunni Arab political group , the military said .
The U.S. military frequently deploys drones in Iraq as part of measures to counter roadside bombs .
The cause of the crash is under investigation .
Even one cigarette has serious adverse effects on young adults , according to research presented by Dr. Stella Daskalopoulou at the Canadian Cardiovascular Congress 2009 , co-hosted by the Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society .
Her study found that smoking one cigarette increases the stiffness of the arteries in 18 to 30 year olds by a whopping 25 per cent .
Arteries that are stiff or rigid increase resistance in the blood vessels , making the heart work harder .
The stiffer the artery , the greater the risk for heart disease or stroke .
" Young adults aged 20 - 24 years have the highest smoking rate of all age groups in Canada , " says Dr. Daskalopoulou , an internal medicine and vascular medicine specialist at McGill University Health Centre .
" Our results are significant because they suggest that smoking just a few cigarettes a day impacts the health of the arteries .
This was revealed very clearly when these young people were placed under physical stress , such as exercise . "
The study compared the arterial stiffness of young smokers ( five to six cigarettes a day ) to non-smokers .
The median age was 21 years .
Arterial measurements were taken in the radial artery ( in the wrist ) , the carotid artery ( in the neck ) , and in the femoral artery ( in the groin ) , at rest and after exercise .
Arterial stiffness in both smokers and non-smokers was measured using a new but well established method called applanation tonometry .
Dr. Daskalopoulou introduced the ' arterial stress test ' which measures the arteries ' response to the stress of exercise .
The test is comparable to a cardiac stress test , which measures the heart 's response to the stress of exercise .

" In effect we were measuring the elasticity of arteries under challenge from tobacco , " explains Dr. Daskalopoulou .
An initial arterial stress test was carried out to establish a baseline measurement for both the non-smokers and the smokers , who were asked not to smoke for 12 hours prior to the test .
After the first meeting , smokers returned and smoked one cigarette each and then repeated the stress test .
During the final meeting , smokers were asked to chew a piece of nicotine gum prior to the stress test .
Dr. Daskalopoulou found that after exercise the arterial stiffness levels in non-smokers dropped by 3.6 per cent .
Smokers , however , showed the reverse : after exercise their arterial stiffness increased by 2.2 per cent .
After nicotine gum , it increased by 12.6 per cent .
After one cigarette , it increased by 24.5 per cent .
Interestingly , there was no difference in the arterial stiffness measurements between smokers and non-smokers at rest .
" In effect , this means that even light smoking in otherwise young healthy people can damage the arteries , compromising the ability of their bodies to cope with physical stress , such as climbing a set of stairs or running to catch a bus , " says Dr. Daskalopoulou .
" It seems that this compromise to respond to physical stress occurs first , before the damage of the arteries becomes evident at rest . "
" More than 47,000 Canadians will die prematurely each year due to tobacco use , which often starts in the teen years , " warns Heart and Stroke Foundation spokesperson Dr. Beth Abramson .
" We know that over 90 per cent of teenagers who smoke as few as three to four cigarettes a day may be trapped into a lifelong habit of regular smoking , which typically lasts 35 to 40 years . "
Smoking contributes to the build up of plaque in the arteries , increases the risk of blood clots , reduces the oxygen in the blood , increases blood pressure , and makes the heart work harder .
Smoking also nearly doubles the risk of ischemic stroke .
Dr. Abramson says this study reinforces the importance of education , prevention programs , and legislation such as the recently passed Bill C - 32 , Cracking Down on Tobacco Marketing Aimed at Youth Act .
POLITICO ( Washington ) - Despite a torrent of criticism from the media , Democrats and even some in her own party , Sarah Palin remains the hottest brand name in politics .
Politico logo
Her recent resignation was perplexing .
It ’s raised doubts about her viability as a potential presidential candidate .
Still , she remains extremely popular with the GOP grass roots , and most Republican Party leaders would jump at the chance to have her headline one of their events .
That ’s the picture that emerges from interviews with dozens of GOP state and local leaders from across the country .
As part of an effort to gauge Palin ’s popularity with the rank and file beyond the Beltway , where the GOP establishment is lukewarm toward the charismatic former governor , POLITICO surveyed nearly 50 prominent Republican Party officials and politicians , representing every region of the country and ranging from statewide - elected officeholders to state legislators to state and county party chairs .
Some refused to talk about her at all .
Others , mostly her critics , would do so only off the record .
But taken as a whole , the body of interviews revealed that despite Palin ’s high negative ratings in recent national polls , Republicans at the grass - roots level and their leaders still hold a very favorable impression of the former Alaska governor .
Westerners have a particular affinity for Palin , with many noting that she embodied the values of freedom and self - reliance .
Scott Sales , the minority leader of the Montana House , referred to her “ curb appeal ” among the party ’s rank and file .
In Colorado , a state where Palin campaigned hard last year on behalf of the Republican ticket but which Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) eventually lost to Barack Obama , Arapahoe County Republican Party Chairman David Kerber said that Palin was a good fit with Western sensibilities .
“ She comes across as someone who ’s going to say what she says and if you do n’t like it , that ’s just too bad , ” Kerber said .
“ She ’s not going to lie , she ’s not going to sugarcoat it — she ’s just going to let it rip .
I think that ’s what Westerners want . ”
“ People saw her as one of them — someone who could relate to an everyday person .
She ’s not one of the political class , ” said Heidi Gansert , the Nevada House minority leader .
“ I also believe that women appreciated her message and what she ’d accomplished in her political career and family life .
A woman who has a young family , who is able to become the governor of Alaska — a lot of people , women who worked the everyday jobs with their families — they know that she ’s experiencing the same things they are . ”
Evangelical Christians and rural and small - town Republicans also hold Palin in high esteem .
“ The ones who are most supportive of her are what I would term the very conservative , libertarian - leaning voters of southern Nevada — of which there is a very large contingent , ” said Bernie Zadrowski , the chairman of Las Vegas ’s Clark County Republican Party .
“ You might also classify them as the constitutional wing of the party . ”
Charles M. Webster , the state GOP chairman in Maine , said Republicans there are very enthusiastic about Palin largely because they can see themselves in her .
“ I see her as being somebody who the average , what I call ‘ working class guy , ’ relates to , ” Webster said .
“ Somebody who ’s plain - spoken , somebody who hunts and fishes .
And this is Maine — we ’re in the country up here . ”
In Florida , Pasco County Republican Party Chairman Randy Maggard agreed that Palin ’s down - to - earth style also connected with many Gulf Coast Republicans .
“ The people I talk to that like her say she relates to them because they do n’t really look at her as a politician in Washington , ” Maggard said .
“ They look at her as a mom who was in business who happened to get into politics .
They feel like they can relate to her . ”
At the same time , many GOP leaders conceded that her prospects as a presidential contender took a significant hit when she abruptly resigned as governor in July , a decision that was viewed as perplexing and part of a worrisome pattern of uneven behavior .
Former New Hampshire Republican Party Chairman Fergus Cullen referred to it as the “ Palin Paradox . ”
“ If you were a candidate , you ’d still want her to be campaigning with you because she would attract the crowds , ” Cullen said , before posing the question that numerous other Republicans asked : “ How can you quit without finishing your first term and then ask us to entrust the presidency to you ? ”
A USA Today / Gallup Poll conducted after she announced her plans in early July found that 70 percent of voters did not change their opinion of her after she decided not to finish her first term .
Seventeen percent said they viewed Palin less favorably and 9 percent said their opinion of her improved .
But many party insiders expressed concern about the timing and political wisdom of the decision , noting that it complicated whatever plans she might have for higher office .
Jim Roddey , the chairman of the Allegheny County Republican Committee in western Pennsylvania , said that Palin ’s exit would leave her vulnerable to additional criticism that her résumé is n’t long enough to be president .
“ I think she will be a national player at some level , but whether or not it ’s as a nominee for the presidency , I do n’t know , ” Roddey said .
“ My gut tells me it ’s not likely , but anything ’s possible . ”
In Montana , Max Hunsaker , the executive director of the state GOP , said that Palin ’s resignation did little to convince him that after an inconsistent performance as a vice presidential candidate , she was now ready for prime time .
“ Now she ’s damaged goods and for the good of the party , we need to rethink .
She ’s not going to be our solution for a leader , ” Hunsaker said .
“ She should n’t be our standard - bearer in four years .
That ’s pragmatic , and that ’s being merciful toward her . ”
Christine Toretti , a Republican national committeewoman from Indiana , Pa. , had a similar reaction .
“ I do n’t see Sarah Palin as the leader of the Republican Party going forward from the conversations that I ’m having with women in Pennsylvania , ” said Toretti .
“ There are those who are absolutely crazy about her — they say she ’s the Jennifer Aniston of the Republican Party .
And then there are other people that say , ‘ What ’s this all about ?
She ’s airing all of her family dirty laundry . ”
Others were not so quick to write Palin off .
Claude Pope , the GOP chairman of Wake County , N.C. , said that while some people he spoke with had an “ initial knee - jerk reaction ” to her resignation , eventually “ they seemed to come around to the thought that maybe this is the right thing to do . ”
Party leaders said that ultimately Palin ’s political future hinges on how she uses her time away from public office .
Debbie Cox -Roush , the GOP chairwoman in Florida ’s Hillsborough County , put it this way : “ 2012 depends on what Sarah Palin does between now and 2012 . ”
Cox -Roush and other Republicans offered a range of advice for Palin , including traveling the country to help other Republican candidates get elected , broadening her supporter base to reach beyond social conservatives and raising money .
Arizona House Majority Leader John McComish said Palin should hit the books in an effort to dispel fears that she is unfit for the presidency .
McComish called them the “ Katie Couric issues , ” a reference to Palin ’s widely viewed and often - panned interview with the CBS News anchor last September .
The danger for Palin , said Morgan Griffith , the Republican House majority leader in Virginia , is that “ she just hangs out , makes a few speeches but does n’t have a real clear - cut agenda of what she ’s trying to do . ”
In assessing the prospective 2012 GOP presidential candidates , Griffith ranked former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as a cut above Palin — a frequently made assessment .
“ It ’s Romney , Huckabee and — a step behind — Palin , ” said Griffith .
An Iowa state senator explained : “ While people may still like her , I ’m not sure that they think she has the skills necessary to pull us out of the political funk we find ourselves in .
The edge might go to Romney , who has been more tried and tested . ”
While Palin has sought to burnish her credentials on economic issues — earlier this summer , she penned an op - ed piece for The Washington Post in which she called President Obama ’s cap - and - trade energy plan “ an enormous threat to our economy ” —
Romney has the clear edge on fiscal policy issues with Republican leaders .
David Balmer , the Colorado House assistant minority leader , said he hears talk about Romney as “ the type of leader that we would need in this type of recession . ”
“ Both his background and his proven ability to turn companies around is what we need in America right now , ” Balmer added .
In North Carolina , Rob Bryan , the GOP chairman in Charlotte ’s Mecklenburg County , said that while he admires Palin , the party would be better off pinning their hopes on Romney .
“ I still think , with economics being such a key issue these days , I find candidacy to be a much more viable one than hers , ” Bryan said .
“ I understand that she ’s popular with the base , but if you ask me , ‘ Do I hope she ’s our nominee in 2012 ? ’
My answer would be no . ”
Still , nearly everyone expressed awe at Palin ’s knack for generating enthusiasm among the party faithful and , in particular , her remarkable ability to draw a big crowd .
“ I was at a forum recently in northwest Ohio .
We talked about Sarah Palin , ” said Ohio State Auditor Mary Taylor .
“ Everybody ’s interested and waiting to see what she is going to do next , and I did feel a sense of energy , support and enthusiasm for her . ”
A New Hampshire state senator predicted : “ If she showed up tomorrow in New Hampshire , they ’d be lined up across the state . ”
Since Palin ’s talents are easily translated into fundraising , like many other party chairs , Palm Beach County , Fla . ’s Sid Dinerstein said he ’s ready to roll out the red carpet for her .
“ She ’s the most popular politician in America today , ” Dinerstein said .
“ We would beg her to come to Palm Beach .
There ’s nobody who can raise money like Sarah . ”
Another Palm Beach County Republican , state committeeman Pete Feaman , argued that Palin has been misunderstood and that , at least among Republican voters , her support is durable .
“ Republicans love Sarah Palin whether she ’s a presidential candidate , a governor or an ordinary citizen , ” he said .
“ It ’s interesting that inside - the - Beltway people have no clue how much she is really loved . ”
" In addition to the judgment , he now faces possible jail time , " a spokesman said .
" This is another important victory in our fight against spam .
We will continue to pursue damages against other spammers . "
A personal time management approach known as The Pomodoro Technique is becoming quite popular with agile practitioners .
Pomodoro includes a number of practices similar to those used by an agile team : time - boxing , frequent opportunities to inspect - and - adapt , estimation , a preference for low - tech tools , and an emphasis on maintaining a sustainable pace .
Francesco Cirillo began developing the technique in the 80's , while he was a student .
He was looking for a way to improve the quality of his study time and cut down on the distractions and interruptions that kept him from focusing .
So I made a bet with myself , as helpful as it was humiliating : “ Can you study – really study - for 10 minutes ? ” I needed objective validation , a Time Tutor , and I found one in a kitchen timer shaped like a pomodoro ( the Italian for tomato ) .
Over the next few years the technique evolved until about 1992 , when it took the basic form that it still holds today .
In Pomodoro , work is accomplished in uninterrupted 25 - minute sessions called Pomodoros .
At the end of each Pomodoro , there is a short break .
After every set of 3 or 4 Pomodoros , there is a longer break .
The technique includes some lightweight planning and tracking as well .
At the beginning of the day , a list of the day 's objectives is created and then estimated in terms of how many Pomodoros it will take to accomplish .
Tasks that will take more than seven Pomodoros should be broken down .
Tasks that will take less than one Pomodoro should be grouped together until there is a full Pomodoro 's worth .
Interruptions and distractions are dealt with by quickly recording them in a way that they can be handled after the current Pomodoro is over .
On the rare occasions when an interruption can't be handled in this manner , the current Pomodoro is stopped and considered void .
As Francesco says , the next Pomodoro will go better .
Over the last couple of years , the Pomodoro Technique has caught the attention of the agile community .
Staffan Noteberg 's session on the technique was so popular at Agile2008 that it was selected to be re-run at the end of the conference .
At Agile2009 Staffan again presented on the technique , as did Renzo Borgatti with a session called :
You say tomato , I say Pomodoro .
For those wanting to learn more about the Pomodoro Technique , Francesco has a 45 - page book and a one - page cheat sheet available for download from The Pomodoro Technique website .

Knock has become a popular destination for pilgrims
A crowd of about 7,000 people turned up at a County Mayo pilgrimage shrine on Saturday after being told that the Virgin Mary was to appear .
Dublin man Joe Coleman , who claims to be a visionary , predicted that the apparition would take place at Knock at 1500 GMT .
Mr Coleman left the shrine claiming he had just witnessed an apparition but said he could not yet reveal details .
He told the Irish Times on Friday that up to 50,000 people would turn up .
Mr Coleman said the vision would only be visible to people who came " with an open heart " .
Earlier this month , about 5,000 people arrived at Knock Shrine after a similar prediction by him .
The Archbishop of Tuam , Dr Michael Neary issued a statement earlier this week clarifying the church 's view of Mr Coleman 's predictions .
" It is not healthy , does not give glory to God and . . . is not good witness to the faith to be looking for extraordinary phenomena , " Dr Neary said .
Israel attributed civilian casualties to collateral damage in legitimate action A United Nations investigation into Israel 's campaign in the Gaza Strip earlier this year has concluded that there is evidence both sides committed war crimes .
Below are extracts from a UN statement accompanying the report : [ The report ] concluded there is evidence indicating serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were committed by Israel during the Gaza conflict , and that Israel committed actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly crimes against humanity .
The report also concludes there is also evidence that Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes , as well as possibly crimes against humanity , in their repeated launching of rockets and mortars into Southern Israel The Mission found that , in the lead up to the Israeli military assault on Gaza , Israel imposed a blockade amounting to collective punishment and carried out a systematic policy of progressive isolation and deprivation of the Gaza Strip .
During the Israeli military operation , code - named " Operation Cast Lead , " houses , factories , wells , schools , hospitals , police stations and other public buildings were destroyed More than 1,400 people were killed during the military operation
The report concludes that the Israeli military operation was directed at the people of Gaza as a whole , in furtherance of an overall and continuing policy aimed at punishing the Gaza population , and in a deliberate policy of disproportionate force aimed at the civilian population .
The destruction of food supply installations , water sanitation systems , concrete factories and residential houses was the result of a deliberate and systematic policy which has made the daily process of living , and dignified living , more difficult for the civilian population
The report underlines that in most of the incidents investigated by it , and described in the report , loss of life and destruction caused by Israeli forces during the military operation was a result of disrespect for the fundamental principle of " distinction " in international humanitarian law that requires military forces to distinguish between military targets and civilians and civilian objects at all times [ The ] report describes a number of specific incidents in which Israeli forces launched " direct attacks against civilians with lethal outcome . "
These are , it says , cases in which the facts indicate no justifiable military objective pursued by the attack and concludes they amount to war crimes A number of other incidents the Report concludes may constitute war crimes include a direct and intentional attack on the Al Quds Hospital and an adjacent ambulance depot in Gaza City .
The Report also covers violations arising from Israeli treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank , including excessive force against Palestinian demonstrators , sometimes resulting in deaths , increased closures , restriction of movement and house demolitions .
The detention of Palestinian Legislative Council members , the Report says , effectively paralyzed political life in the Occupied Palestinian Territories The Fact - Finding Mission also found that the repeated acts of firing rockets and mortars into Southern Israel by Palestinian armed groups " constitute war crimes and may amount to crimes against humanity , " by failing to distinguish between military targets and the civilian population .
" The launching of rockets and mortars which cannot be aimed with sufficient precisions at military targets breaches the fundamental principle of distinction , " the report says .
" Where there is no intended military target and the rockets and mortars are launched into civilian areas , they constitute a deliberate attack against the civilian population . "
The Mission concludes that the rocket and mortars attacks " have caused terror in the affected communities of southern Israel , " as well as " loss of life and physical and mental injury to civilians and damage to private houses , religious buildings and property , thereby eroding the economic and cultural life of the affected communities and severely affecting the economic and social rights of the population . "
The Mission urges the Palestinian armed groups holding the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit to release him on humanitarian grounds , and , pending his release , give him the full rights accorded to a prisoner of war under the Geneva Conventions including visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross .
The Report also notes serious human rights violations , including arbitrary arrests and extra-judicial executions of Palestinians , by the authorities in Gaza and by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank .
The prolonged situation of impunity has created a justice crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory that warrants action , the Report says .
The Mission found the Government of Israel had not carried out any credible investigations into alleged violations .
It recommended that the UN Security Council require Israel to report to it , within six months , on investigations and prosecutions it should carry out with regard to the violations identified in its Report .
The Mission further recommends that the Security Council set up a body of independent experts to report to it on the progress of the Israeli investigations and prosecutions .
If the experts ' reports do not indicate within six months that good faith , independent proceedings are taking place , the Security Council should refer the situation in Gaza to the ICC Prosecutor .
The Mission recommends that the same independent expert body also report to the Security Council on proceedings undertaken by the relevant Gaza authorities with regard to crimes committed by the Palestinian side .
As in the case of Israel , if within six months there are no good faith independent proceedings conforming to international standards in place , the Council should refer the situation to the ICC Prosecutor .

Low doses of melatonin may help children with autism get a better night 's rest , researchers report .
Eleven youngsters with autism ages 4 to 10 fell asleep more quickly and slept longer when given low - dose supplements of melatonin , says Beth Malow , MD , director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tenn .
The supplements did n't appear to cause any side effects , suggesting parents can continue to give them to their kids as long as needed , she tells WebMD .
Studies have shown that as many as 70 % of children with autism suffer from sleep problems , according to Andrew Zimmerman , MD , of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore , who specializes in treating autism .
Other research points to a deficiency of melatonin -- the body 's natural sleep hormone -- as the culprit , Malow says .
Secreted at night by the pineal gland in the brain , melatonin is thought to control sleep cycles , which are frequently disturbed in the elderly -- and kids with autism , she says .
And the Matthew Shepard case , there ’s been a fair amount of information that came out that that really was n’t the motivation of the people who killed him , but they did receive the maximum penalty under the law .
( Emphasis Mine )
As I said when Virginia Foxx repeated this lie in April ,
Since when do robbers target their victims for kidnapping , transport them to the middle of nowhere , and beat them to death ?
On what planet is this considered a logical sequence of events ?
In what dimension ?!
Teh Wacky ™ is a species of irrationalism spawned at the fringe .
After metastasizing in the wingnut blogosphere for years , this particular ( and particularly nasty ) falsehood has finally met daylight thanks to Representative Foxx ’s inept research .
She , or an assistant , combed the echo chamber for a talking point and came up with an entirely fictional account of how Matthew Shepard died .
Never mind the evidence , or the killers ’ confessions …
It was n’t a hate crime because we say so .
And as always , the invention gets used in pursuit of Cultural Warfare .

After dark , the first snake we found was a MONSTER Black - Tailed Rattlesnake , Crotalus molossus .
This is my favorite species of rattlesnake , and to see one this size was incredible .
We did not measure it , but it was at least 4.5 ′ long .
My snake tongs , for instance , are 46 ″ long , and the snake was longer even not entirely stretched out .

… and then another huge snake .
This one was not quite as large as the first , but still much larger than the average rattlesnake encountered in Arizona .
The hardest part of working with these snakes was getting them to sit still long enough to photograph them .
They did not seem to be bothered by us , even when picked up , and were content just going on their way .

SARAJEVO ( Reuters ) - Bosnia ’s war crimes court jailed a former Serb officer for 30 years Friday on a charge of genocide for killing dozens of people during the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of Muslims .
The court acquitted former army captain Milorad Trbic , 51 , of three other counts of genocide due to lack of evidence , the head of the judicial council Davorin Jukic said , in a decision that angered relatives of the victims .
Trbic was found guilty of taking part in the persecution of Bosnian Muslims from the Srebrenica enclave and their detention , summary executions , burial and covering traces of crime .
Some 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in the Srebrenica massacre after Bosnian Serb forces captured the eastern enclave on July 11 , 1995 , in what is regarded as Europe ’s worst atrocity since World War Two .
Trbic took part in a “ joint criminal enterprise ” with other Serb army officers and organized the forcible transfer of Muslims from Srebrenica between July 10 and November 30 , 1995 , judge Jukic said .
He supervised the detention of thousands of Muslims in several schools around Srebrenica , where they were kept in inhuman conditions , as well as transportation to the killing fields where they were executed en masse , Jukic said .
Trbic himself shot dead a group of “ at least 20 Muslims ” in the Grbavci school on one occasion , and a group of “ at least 5 Muslims ” in the Rocevici school on another occasion .
He was involved in the exhumation of victims from original mass graves and their later transfer to “ secondary mass graves ” to hide the traces of the crime .
Remains of more than 6,000 Srebrenica victims have been found in mass graves across the eastern Bosnia but only about 3,800 bodies have been identified so far .
In the courtroom Jukic did not refer to the charge on which Trbic was convicted as genocide , leading relatives to believe that he had been acquitted on all such charges .
“ The sentence was a reward for him .
The court might as well have set him free , ” Hatidza Mehmedovic told Reuters .
She lost her husband and two sons in the massacre .
The court later issued a statement clarifying the verdict , but relatives remained upset about the outcome .
After the Bosnian 1992 - 95 war , Trbic escaped to the United States but was found guilty of breaking immigration laws .
In 2005 he was handed over to the Hague - based International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) .
The ICTY , which indicted Trbic on charges of genocide , crimes against humanity and violations of laws or customs of war , transferred Trbic to Bosnia for trial in June 2007 .
The Bosnian war crimes court opened in 1995 to help ease the burden from the ICTY , which plans to wind down by end of 2010 , taking over low - or mid-ranking cases .
What 's Michael Moore Talking About ?
Government power is the problem , not capitalism .
Michael Moore is confused .
His new movie , Capitalism : A Love Story , begins by suggesting that all was well until Ronald Reagan became president and cut the top 90 percent income tax rate .
Everything was downhill from there .
But by the end of the movie , he says the problems really began in 1945 , when Franklin Roosevelt died without enacting his proposed Second Bill of Rights , which would have " guaranteed ' everything from a " remunerative job " and a " decent home " to " adequate medical care , " a " good education , " and " adequate protection from the economic fears of old age , sickness , accident and unemployment . "
Adding to the confusion , he lavishes praise on Barack Obama and his " spread the wealth around " rhetoric .
But Moore also demonizes as symbols of capitalism Clinton Treasury secretaries Robert Rubin ( formerly of Goldman Sachs ) and Lawrence Summers , and former New York Fed President Timothy Geithner without mentioning that Rubin has been Obama 's adviser and that Summers and Geithner are , respectively , his chief economic guru and treasury secretary .
Nor does he acknowledge that Obama continued the bailout policies of George W. Bush .
Moore declares capitalism evil , but he 's never clear about what " capitalism " means .
Considering how much time he spends documenting the cozy relationship between business and government , I thought he might mean " state capitalism . "
But then he uses the term " free market " as a synonym for what he does n't like .
What does the free market have to do with businesses manipulating government and strong - arming Congress for bailouts ?
Moore properly condemns both .
What does he want instead of " capitalism " ?
He 's coy about that .
Claiming that the public became increasingly curious about socialism once Obama was accused of favoring it , he goes to the only self - described socialist in Congress , Sen. Bernie Sanders , to ask for a definition .
Socialism , Sanders tells Moore , means " the government represents the middle class and working class , not the wealth . "
Huh ?
That 's socialism ?
It 's not government ownership of the means of production and the abolition of private property and free exchange ?
Sanders reads Marx and Lenin very broadly .
By his definition , I 'm a socialist .
I want government to represent the middle and working classes .
Of course , Congress does that best by leaving them free , economically and otherwise .
Moore visits the National Archives to see if the Constitution establishes capitalism as the country 's economic system .
Seeing the words " people , " " union , " and " welfare " in the document , he says , " Sounds like that other ism . "
That 's just silly .
The Constitution limits government 's power to interfere with the people and their property .
The Constitution is on the side of the free market .
Toward the end of the movie , Moore says capitalism is irredeemably evil and " has to be replaced . "
With what ?
I assumed he'd say socialism , but instead his answer is " democracy . "
This apparently means expanding " hundreds of worker - owned businesses " in the United States .
But since workers are already free to start businesses , what 's his point ?
A more astute observer would show how government intervention — licenses , taxes , regulations — inhibits such businesses .
Thankfully , I will soon have my own show on Fox Business Network to make such points .
I 'll invite Moore to come on as a guest .
For two hours , Moore rails against reckless banks and government bailouts , but never once mentions the government - business partnership that created the conditions for the turmoil .
The fact that America no longer has a genuinely free market is the unnoticed 10,000 - pound elephant in Moore 's room .
Watching Capitalism , you 'd never know that the federal government colluded for decades with the financial , real estate , and construction industries to divert resources into housing in the name of promoting home ownership — even for people who could n't afford it .
You 'd never know that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were , and are , privileged government - sponsored enterprises that encouraged shaky loans .
At least Moore has an inkling of what 's wrong : cozy ties between Wall Street and government .
Moore thinks the answer is better regulators or nationalization of banks .
But his own evidence suggests that the real answer is a separation of state and economy — stripping away Wall Street 's privileges .
In other words : Limit government 's power .
Let the free market work .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The dollar gained against the euro on Thursday after central banks said they will scale back some emergency programs that have injected trillions of dollars into banks as financial markets stabilize .

Sterling also neared a six - month low and racked up its worst one - day percentage loss since late April at current prices against the euro after Bank of England Governor Mervyn King told a regional British newspaper a weak pound was helping UK exporters and the economy cope with a sharp downturn .
The vast amounts of money pumped into the global economy as well as low interest rates have put pressure on the U.S. dollar and increased its appeal for use in carry trades .
In a carry trade , an investor borrows in a low interest rate currency and uses the funds to invest in higher - yielding assets in other countries .
“ Any news that has to do not with the economy per se but with the dollar not being the primary funding currency for the carry trade is going to be reacted to very violently ” to the upside , said John Kicklighter , currency strategist at DailyFX.com in New York .
The steps taken by several major central banks , as well as weaker - than - expected U.S. housing data reversed the dollar ’s earlier softness as traders said it sparked investors to sell currencies and assets seen as higher risk in favor of the perceived safety of the U.S. dollar .
The Federal Reserve , Bank of England , European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank simultaneously announced plans to scale back their emergency lending programs on Thursday .
That comes a day after the Fed kept interest rates at a record low and signaled they would stay there for a long time .
At the same time , the Fed said it would slow purchases of mortgage debt to extend the life of that program .
Richard Franulovich , senior currency strategist at Westpac in New York , said the central banks appear to be “ turning less accommodative , ” and that coupled with weaker - than - expected U.S. housing data was “ giving the dollar a bid tone . ”
The euro was down 0.5 percent at $ 1.4650 , off a session high of $ 1.4803 and a one - year peak of $ 1.4842 hit a day ago .
Sterling fell 1.8 percent to $ 1.6049 , dropping below $ 1.61 for the first time since July , and the euro was up 1.3 percent at 91.24 pence , a near six - month high .
King ’s comments were “ a clear signal for traders to start shorting the pound , ” said Gareth Sylvester , senior currency strategist at HiFX in San Francisco .
More than 1,700 euro / sterling trades went through Reuters Matching in the hour after King ’s comments , the most in a single hour for at least three months , Reuters data showed .
The dollar was little changed at 91.23 yen , though that was well off a 90.36 session low .
G20 and FX
Analysts expected currencies to be a part of discussions among the Group of 20 leaders meeting in Pittsburgh .
Traders noted the contrast in King ’s comments with those from euro zone capitals suggesting some discomfort with the euro ’s recent strength and the need for the G20 to address global imbalances , notably Asian currency weakness .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said currencies should be part of the discussion in Pittsburgh , and Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck mentioned China ’s yuan as a focus for discussion .
The U.S. delegation was expected to push G20 leaders to address a lopsided global growth model by encouraging debtor nations such as the United States to save more and exporters like China , Japan and Germany to spend more .
But that would likely require a weaker dollar , and a French government source told Reuters this week that France is worried about euro strength against the dollar .
The euro was risen 5 percent against the dollar this year .
Reverberation is a subtle but crucial part of any mix .
The wrong choice can make everything sound harsh , messy , muddy or distant .
The right choice can bind a mix together , add depth , space , and air , and enhance detail .
The trick is knowing the difference .
Once upon a time , things were simple .
You either had an SPX - 90 or a Lexicon , and you got on with the job .
Now , the range of choice is bewildering .
In the 21st century there are hardware and plugin reverbs , modelling reverbs , sampling reverbs , convolution reverbs , emulating reverbs … the list goes on .
This post will completely ignore all that confusion , and attempt to cut right to the chase .
Later I ’ll offer some ideas , hints and tips for getting the best results with reverb , but first we ’ll look at :
How to choose the right reverb .
Broadly speaking , there are two types of reverb – ones that try to sound “ natural ” – meaning , like a real acoustic space – and ones that do n’t .
Stage one is to decide which you are looking for .
Natural –
These make instruments sound as if they are in a real space .
They tend to be more subtle , and add more depth to a mix .
If you use too much you ’ll end up swamping the original character of the recording , but used well , they can help give character to a close - miced recording , and make things sound more three - dimensional and “ real ” .
It ’s important to choose one that complements the sound of the space you recorded in – if the reverb is too different from what is already there , the two will “ fight ” and the result will sound artificial .
The Rest – Notice I have n’t called these un-natural – we are so used to artificial reverbs today that even the least realistic reverb can sound completely normal .
Rather than emulate a real room or hall sound , this type of reverb is more of a pure “ effect ” – they allow you to add life or “ sheen ” to dry recorded sounds without making them “ sit back ” in the mix in the same way as a natural verb .
If it ’s not immediately obvious which of these two you need , do n’t worry – just experiment !
If it sounds good , it is good .
Even when I already have a clear idea in my head about what I want , my first step in choosing a reverb is always to simply to flick through a load of presets , and make a note of the ones that I like .
Keep an open mind – it ’s easy to settle on a small pool of favourites , but it ’s always worth listening with fresh ears every so often .
Once I have a shortlist , I then listen to each in turn and use the ideas from the list below to tweak the best , before doing final comparisons to make the final choice .
Finally – do n’t be afraid to use both types in the same mix .
Maybe adding a realistic room - ey reverb to the guitars and drum overheads helps pull everything together in the mix , but the vocal just needs a shimmery plate and the snare a little more life .
Ideas for using and abusing reverb
Now to the nitty - gritty .
Here are some of the rules of thumb , ideas and techniques I ’ve come across for using reverb effectively .
Take time to make a good choice early on
It ’s amazing how much influence reverb can have on how we perceive a mix – and it ’s important to get the right one early on .
If you pick something too bright and harsh early on , you may struggle to get the warm sound you ’re aiming for , for example .
On the other hand a dull , muddy reverb could drag down what ’s otherwise supposed to be a spiky , punky mix .
Balance level and time
The most common reverb question is – “ how much ? ”
One simple answer is :
Turn it up until you notice it , then turn it down slightly .
But this only works if the decay time is right first .
If the reverb tail is too short then turning it up wo n’t help , if it ’s too long you wo n’t be able to get it loud enough before it starts to swamp things .
The length of the reverb and it ’s amount need to be balanced against each other , and may be different for separate elements in a mix – do n’t be afraid to patch in two sets of the same reverb with slightly different decay times – or other parameters , for that matter .
Learn about early reflections
Most reverbs include two elements – the familiar longer reverb tail , but also much shorter elements known as “ first reflections ” – the idea being that most instruments in a real space are reflected from a nearby wall first .
Our ears pick up on this , and it has a big effect on our perception of the size of the “ room ” .
Experiment with the reverbs you have access to to learn how their settings affect the sound .
Always EQ the return
I always bring the reverb return up on a stereo channel ( rather than routing it straight to stereo ) and then EQ it .
Most reverbs include settings for tweaking how much high frequency there is in the sound , but I think it ’s faster ( and gives more control ) to just EQ the return .
It ’s amazing how many cheap and nasty reverbs can be made to sound ten times more natural by slapping on a low - pass filter , for example .
Sometimes EQ the send
Depending how the reverb works , this may give a different result than EQ - ing the return .
It also allows you to use the same reverb for different instruments – say you have a bright horn section which really “ catches ” the reverb and emphasises it ’s unnatural qualities , but you want to use the same rev on the piano to help blend the mix , and it need the brightness – try routing the auxiliary send from the horns through an EQ first , to take the harshness out on it ’s way into the rev .
Consider compressing the send as well !
A common problem with reverbs is that they sound fine most of the time , but certain louder notes “ catch ” them and the huge reverb tail sticks out a mile as a result .
In the same way that EQ cans sometimes help , compressing the signal you send to a compressor can solve this problem – it holds back the loud notes in the send to the reverb only , and gives a much smoother result .
Automate reverb levels for complete control
It ’s not uncommon for a reverb that sounds great when everything is going full - tilt to sound completely over - the - top in quiet sections , or vice - versa .
Using automation to “ ride ” the return level – or the levels you ’re sending – can keep a reverb sounding great in both loud and quiet sections .
Or , if you have “ sticking out notes ” and the suggestion about using a compressor does n’t work for you , automation can sometimes get a better result – custom tweaking the reverb send by hand .
I once made seventeen separate reverb automation changes in a single 40 - second sax solo !
Watch out for spill
Unless you have 100 % isolation in your mix , always be aware that spill may be influencing things .
The dull , muffled sound of drums in the booth next door may be getting out of hand once it bleeds into the vocal reverb send – again , EQ - ing the send may be a solution to this – or perhaps using a gate .
Tweak tweak tweak
If you ’re using a preset reverb sound , you probably are n’t getting the best out of it .
Presets are invaluable for quickly auditioning and choosing which reverbs have the right “ flavour ” for a given mix , but at the very least you need to optimise the decay time and amount of early reflection .
Most reverbs offer far more elements wo tweak and fine - tune , though .
Just like playing an instrument , time spent experimenting with all the possibilities will always be a worthwhile investment .
Do n’t use any
Maybe you do n’t need any artificial reverb at all !
If the space you ’re recording in sounds great , sling some extra mics and try to capture it , then mix it in instead of ( or as well as ) artificial reverb .
And be aware that sometimes things sound great dry – or , much more commonly , that an effect other than reverb can give you what you ’re looking for – delay on vocals instead of reverb is a classic example .
Whichever of these suggestions you decide to make use of , the most important message is simply – never underestimate the power of reverb .
All too often it ’s just the case that a tried and trusty favourite is applied for the rough mix , and never gets improved or optimised .
It may take longer , but time spent choosing the right reverbs for a mix can reap dividends and actually end up saving time , in the long run .

Dear Dawnniversaries ,
Dawn is celebrating the second anniversary of leaving its home planet by engaging in the same function it has performed most of its time in space : with the utmost patience , it is using its ion propulsion system to gradually modify its orbit around the Sun .
In its interplanetary travels , the spacecraft has thrust for a total of about 389 days , or 53 % of the time ( and about 0.000000008 % of the time since the Big Bang ) .
While for most spacecraft , firing a thruster to change course is a special event , it is Dawn ’s wont .
All this thrusting has cost the craft only 103 kilograms ( 228 pounds ) of its supply of xenon propellant , which was 425 kilograms ( 937 pounds ) on September 27 , 2007 .
The thrusting so far in the mission has achieved the equivalent of accelerating the probe by 2.62 kilometers per second ( 5870 miles per hour ) .
As previous logs have described , because of the principles of motion for orbital flight , whether around the Sun or any other gravitating body , Dawn is not actually traveling this much faster than when it launched .
But the effective change in speed remains a useful measure of the effect of any spacecraft ’s propulsive work .
Having accomplished only one - fifth of the thrust time planned for its entire mission , Dawn has already far exceeded the velocity change achieved by most spacecraft .
( For a comparison with probes that enter orbit around Mars , refer to a previous log . )
Since launch , our readers who have remained on or near Earth have completed 2 revolutions around the Sun , covering about 1.88 billion kilometers ( 1.17 billion miles ) .
Orbiting farther from the Sun , and moving at a more leisurely pace , Dawn has traveled 1.57 billion kilometers ( 980 million miles ) .
As it climbs away from the Sun to match its orbit to that of Vesta , it will continue to slow down to Vesta ’s speed .
Since Dawn ’s launch , Vesta has traveled only 1.18 billion kilometers ( 730 million miles ) .
Readers with nothing better to do have already discovered that much of the text in the 3 preceding paragraphs is taken verbatim from the log that commemorated Dawn ’s first anniversary of being in space , with the principal changes being that the numbers are updated here .
( In addition , most of the humor was removed to comply with a request from the Glum Legion of Ardent Dawnniversaries ) .
This is not a result of any more otiosity than normally displayed by your correspondent ; rather , comparing the beginning of this log with last year ’s may be helpful for measuring the progress in the intervening time .
Of course , most of the last 12 months was devoted to coasting , and the gravitational boost from Mars is not reflected in the effect of the ion thrusting , but the comparison may be illuminating for some readers .
This also provides a handy preview of the beginning of the September 27 , 2010 log .
[ Note to self : Perhaps there really is an option here for greater lassitude .
Think about that after taking a nap . ]
Another way to investigate the progress of the mission is to chart how Dawn ’s orbit around the Sun has changed .
This discussion will culminate with a few more numbers than we usually include , and readers who prefer not to indulge may skip this material , leaving that much more for the grateful Numerivores .
Orbits are ellipses ( like flattened circles , or ovals in which the ends are of equal size ) .
So as members of the solar system family follow their paths around the Sun , they sometimes move closer and sometimes move farther from it .
For thinking about these distances , we may remind ourselves once again of the convenient unit of measure in the solar system , the astronomical unit ( AU ) .
In addition to orbits being characterized by shape , or equivalently by the amount of flattening ( that is , the deviation from being a perfect circle ) , and by size , they may be described in part by how they are oriented in space .
Using the bias of terrestrial astronomers , the plane of Earth ’s orbit around the Sun is a good reference .
Other planets and interplanetary spacecraft travel in orbits that are tipped at some angle to that .
Vesta and Ceres do not orbit the Sun in the same plane that Earth does , and Dawn must match its orbit to that of its targets .
( The major planets orbit closer to the plane of Earth ’s orbit , and no spacecraft has had to venture as far out of that plane to orbit another body as Dawn will . )
Now we can see how Dawn has been doing by considering the size and shape ( together expressed by the minimum and maximum distances from the Sun ) and the angle of its orbit on its anniversaries .
( Experts readily recognize that there is more to describing an orbit than these parameters .
Our policy is to link to the experts ’ sites when their readership extends to 1 more elliptical galaxy than ours does . )
The table below shows what the orbit would be if the spacecraft terminated thrusting on its anniversaries ; the orbits of its destinations , Vesta and Ceres , are included for comparison .
Of course , when Dawn was on the launch pad on September 27 , 2007 , its orbit around the Sun was exactly Earth ’s orbit .
After launch , it had its own orbit .
Minimum distance from the Sun ( AU ) Maximum distance from the Sun ( AU ) Angle from Earth ’s orbit Dawn ’s orbit on Sept. 27 , 2007 ( before launch ) 0.98 1.02 0.0° Dawn ’s orbit on Sept. 27 , 2007 ( after launch ) 1.00 1.62 0.6° Dawn ’s orbit on Sept. 27 , 2008 1.21 1.68 1.4° Dawn ’s orbit on Sept. 27 , 2009 1.42 1.87 6.2° Vesta ’s orbit 2.15 2.57 7.1° Ceres ’s orbit 2.54 2.99 10.6°
Readers may disregard the table or gaze into it for insight or inspiration for as long as they like .
The point of it , however , is to illustrate both that Dawn has come a long way since the launch pad , and it has a long journey ahead before it begins its exploration of Vesta .
But the trek will be a little shorter than mission planners had anticipated until quite recently .
As we have seen in a previous log , the plan for thrusting depends on how much electrical power will be available to the ion propulsion system , which converts electrical power into thrusting power .
Greater electrical power translates into higher ( but still exceptionally gentle ) thrust .
Last year Dawn ’s engineers , who remain on distant Earth , devised a method to calibrate the solar arrays , and the spacecraft dutifully carried it out .
The resulting data , combined with an extensive refinement of the mathematical model that predicts solar array power , allowed the team to be confident in increasing the prediction of the future availability of power by up to 10 % .
Equipped with this crucial information , they could update the plan for thrusting .
Many other factors affect the design of the thrust profile as well .
As one example , how effective the thrust is depends on how massive the spacecraft is .
Although weightless , Dawn still has mass ( the resistance to a change in its velocity ) , and the greater the mass , the lower the acceleration provided by the ion thruster .
This phenomenon is no different from what readers experience frequently even in the gravity of their home planet .
The heavier the load you carry , the more gradually you will accelerate , whether the effort is exerted by the muscles in your legs ( or wings or tentacles , depending on your species ) or the engine in your car ( or spaceship ) .
Dawn ’s mass decreases as the mission progresses because the ion propulsion system expends xenon and the reaction control system expends hydrazine .
By refining predictions for how much of these propellants will be onboard at all times for the rest of the mission , engineers could predict how long it will take Dawn to propel itself into the same orbit around the Sun as Vesta and then later into the same orbit as Ceres .
After an extended set of analyses late in 2008 and the first half of 2009 , all the elements needed to update the thrust plan were in place .
The seemingly modest improvement in solar array power is by far the dominant one .
When all were combined , the result revealed that Dawn ’s remarkable maneuvering capability over the course of the mission will be even better than engineers had been counting on .
The probe will be able to reach Vesta about 6 weeks earlier than had previously been planned .
Moreover , the newfound capability will enable the craft to travel from Vesta to Ceres more quickly , so the deadline for leaving the first world to reach the second on schedule in 2015 is about 6 weeks later .
Together , these changes allow the explorer to increase its planned 9 - month stay at Vesta to 12 months .
This is of extraordinary benefit to the project .
Vesta promises to be a fascinating place to visit , and we know quite well from other solar system adventures that no matter how much data we collect , there is always still more to learn .
Mission planners had been working hard to squeeze as much as possible into the precious time they expected Dawn could spend at Vesta , so being able to increase the duration of its residency there by a third makes a tremendous difference .
As details continue to be formulated for all the activities necessary to operate at and study this alien world , the additional time will prove extremely valuable in allowing the team to accommodate the glitches that are inevitable in such a complex expedition and to uncover as much of Vesta ’s intriguing story as possible .
Dawn is already following the new flight plan , targeting where Vesta will be in July 2011 .
It is not enough , though , just for them to be in ( nearly ) the same place at the same time .
That would result in a flyby , but our probe will enter orbit around the protoplanet , accompanying it on its orbit around the Sun , just as satellites of Earth remain close by throughout the planet ’s solar orbit .
The craft will remain with Vesta until July 2012 , when it will begin thrusting to Ceres .
We have discussed before why flying by ( providing only a glimpse of each body ) is significantly less challenging than matching orbits ( enabling more extensive explorations ) , a capability that would be essentially impossible without the ion propulsion system .
A subsequent log will delve further into this issue , as it is a fundamental feature of this ambitious mission .
As Dawn begins its third year in space , now on its new and better course , much work remains before it can return the scientific bounty it seeks .
We hope readers will continue to follow the progress of this bold adventure in the exciting years to come .
Dawn is 1.50 AU ( 225 million kilometers or 140 million miles ) from Earth , or 555 times as far as the moon and 1.50 times as far as the Sun.
Radio signals , traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light , take 25 minutes to make the round trip .

P.S. The astronomical unit has been mentioned in these logs frequently enough that we will include that convenient unit of measurement from now on in the famously unimaginative concluding paragraph .
It might appear redundant to present the distance from Earth both in astronomical units and in terms of how many times as far as the Sun it is .
Is n’t that simply 2 different ways to describe exactly the same quantity ?
Well , no it is not ; they are different , although they are close .
An astronomical unit is the average distance between Earth and the Sun and hence does not change .
The actual distance varies slightly throughout the year , so Earth ’s distance from the Sun at any given time may not be precisely the average value of 1.00000000 AU ( 149,597,871 kilometers or 92,955,629 miles ) .
This would be more apparent if your correspondent did not round off the numbers as dramatically .
The details on that closing text are that Dawn is 1.50456971 AU ( 225,080,425 kilometers or 139,858,224 miles ) from Earth .
At the same time , Earth is 1.00222102 AU ( 149,928,510 kilometers or 93,161,078 miles ) from the Sun , very close to the average , but not exactly equal to it .
So Dawn is 1.50123544 times as far from Earth as the Sun is , given the distance to the Sun now .
When rounded off , the distance in astronomical units and the distance in terms of how far the Sun is both come out to 1.50 , but we see they are not really equal .
Other times of the year , when the actual distance to the Sun is farther from the average , the difference will be apparent .
As long as these secrets of the final paragraph are being revealed , here are the rest : the distance relative to the moon is rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 , and the travel time for radio signals to the nearest minute .
But just for this special occasion : Dawn is 556.865373 times as far as the moon right now , and radio signals take 25 minutes 1.574966 seconds .
Approximately .
Best regards to the Numerivores .

grow your own food !
Nothing beats it !
Put a seed in the ground , get your hands dirty , pick and cook the most delicious , fresh food .
Get to know the seasons and the local snails .
Best of all , you 'll never run out of things to learn , the garden is full of surprises .
One of the main areas of research at our farm is in what has been dubbed " Paradise Gardening . " *
We want to turn our little five acres into an edible paradise .
Fortunately nature has already done most of this for us , and if we were knowledgeable enough , we should be able to live off of the land just as it is .
We would probably have to fish and gather shellfish as well in order to survive , and some of us are already doing that ; but the idea of paradise gardening is that it is a kind of step between hunting and gathering and agriculture , although it 's aim is to loose the agriculture part completely .
It 's kind of like extreme permaculture .
Many hunting and gathering cultures practiced this kind of " gardening " simply by taking care of and tending the plants they were gathering from , ensuring that nothing was never depleted .
One way to move in this direction is to plant a lot of perennials .
Annuals require an amazing amount of work and must be replanted every year .
We still have a large garden space dedicated to annuals , and with permaculture methods and seed saving , we hope to reduce the work and the cost of this part of our garden .
Another problem with a garden of annuals is the nutrient depletion of the soil , but we are taking care of that problem with our handy automatic humanure factory .
Perennials are the backbone of the paradise garden .
Fruit and nut trees , berry bushes , bamboos , artichokes and many other plants can provide .
an incredible amount of food with just about zero work involved .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama ’s spokesman publicly disagreed with former President Jimmy Carter on Wednesday over Carter ’s contention that some conservative opposition to Obama is based on race .
President Obama listens to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper as they meet in the Oval Office , September 16 , 2009 .

“ The president does not think it is based on the color of his skin , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters .
Carter injected race into Obama ’s struggle for a healthcare overhaul after South Carolina Republican Representative Joe Wilson shouted “ You lie ” at Obama during a healthcare speech in Congress last week and thousands of conservatives rallied opposition to Obama at demonstrations in Washington .
“ I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man , ” Carter told NBC News .
He said this “ racism inclination still exists .
And I think it ’s bubbled up to the surface because of the belief among many white people , not just in the South but around the country , that African - Americans are not qualified to lead this great country .
It ’s an abominable circumstance , and it grieves me and concerns me very deeply . ”
Carter ’s remark drew the condemnation of Michael Steele , the first African - American to become chairman of the Republican National Committee .
“ President Carter is flat out wrong .
This is n’t about race .
It is about policy , ” he said in a statement .
“ This is a pathetic distraction by Democrats to shift attention away from the president ’s wildly unpopular government - run healthcare plan that the American people simply oppose . ”
Obama , America ’s first black president , was steering clear of the issue , weeks after he injected himself into a debate about race in Massachusetts after black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates was arrested at his own home on suspicion of breaking into it .
After Obama created an uproar by saying that Cambridge , Massachusetts , police had acted stupidly in the case , he later expressed regret for the tone of his remarks and had the professor and police officer to the White House for a beer in what was dubbed a “ beer summit . ”
Gibbs said the uproar among Obama ’s opponents was more likely a reaction to some of the decisions Obama had made to help the U.S. economy , such as bank and auto bailouts .
“ We understand that people have disagreements with some of the decisions that we ’ve made , ” he said .

Italian philosopher , b. at Nola in Campania , in the Kingdom of Naples , in 1548 ; d. at Rome , 1600 .
At the age of eleven he went to Naples , to study " humanity , logic , and dialectic " , and , four years later , he entered the Order of St. Dominic , giving up his worldly name of Filippo and taking that of Giordano .
He made his novitiate at Naples and continued to study there .
In 1572 he was ordained priest .
It seems , however , that , even as a novice , he attracted attention by the originality of his views and by his outspoken criticism of accepted theological doctrines .
After his ordination things reached such a pass that , in 1576 , formal accusation of heresy was brought against him .
Thereupon he went to Rome , but , apparently , did not mend his manner of speaking of the mysteries of faith ; for the accusations were renewed against him at the convent of the Minerva .
Within a few months of his arrival he fled the city and cast off all allegiance to his order .
From this point on , his life - story is the tale of his wanderings from one country to another and of his failure to find peace anywhere .
He tarried awhile in several Italian cities , and in 1579 went to Geneva , where he seems to have adopted the Calvinist faith , although afterwards , before the ecclesiastical tribunal at Venice , he steadfastly denied that he had ever joined the Reformed Church .
This much at least is certain ; he was excommunicated by the Calvinist Council on account of his disrespectful attitude towards the heads of that Church and was obliged to leave the city .
Thence he went to Toulouse , Lyons , and ( in 1581 ) to Paris .
At Lyons he completed his " Clavis Magna " , or " Great Key " to the art of remembering .
In Paris he published several works which further developed his art of memory - training and revealed the two - fold influence of Raymond Lully and the neo-Platonists .
In 1582 he published a characteristic work , " Il candelaio " , or " The Torchbearer " , a satire in which he exhibits in a marked degree the false taste then in vogue among the humanists , many of whom mistook obscenity for humour .
While at Paris he lectured publicly on philosophy , under the auspices , as it seems , of the College of Cambrai , the forerunner of the College of France .
In 1583 he crossed over to England , and , for a time at least , enjoyed the favour of Queen Elizabeth and the friendship of Sir Philip Sidney .
To the latter he dedicated the most bitter of his attacks on the Catholic Church , " Il spaccio della bestia trionfante " , " The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast " , published in 1584 .
He visited Oxford , and , on being refused the privilege of lecturing there , he published ( 1584 ) his " Cena delle ceneri " , or " Ash - Wednesday Supper " , in which he attacked the Oxford professors , saying that they knew more about beer than about Greek .
In 1585 he returned to France , and during the year which he spent in Paris at this time made several attempts to become reconciled to the Catholic Church , all of which failed because of his refusal to accept the condition imposed , namely , that he should return to his order .
In Germany , whither he went in 1587 , he showed the same spirit of insolent self - assertion as at Oxford .
In Helmstadt he was excommunicated by the Lutherans .
After some time spent in literary activity at Frankfort , he went , in 1591 , to Venice at the invitation of Mocenigo , who professed to be interested in his system of memory - training .
Failing to obtain from Bruno the secret of his " natural magic " , Mocenigo denounced him to the Inquisition .
Bruno was arrested , and in his trial before the Venetian inquisitors first took refuge in the principle of " two - fold truth " , saying that the errors imputed to him were held by him " as a philosopher , and not as an honest Christian " ; later , however , he solemnly abjured all his errors and doubts in the matter of Catholic doctrine and practice ( Berti , Docum . , XII , 22 and XIII , 45 ) .
At this point the Roman Inquisition intervened and requested his extradition .
After some hesitation the Venetian authorities agreed , and in February , 1593 , Bruno was sent to Rome , and for six years was kept in the prison of the Inquisition .
Historians have striven in vain to discover the explanation of this long delay on the part of the Roman authorities .
In the spring of 1599 , the trial was begun before a commission of the Roman Inquisition , and , after the accused had been granted several terms of respite in which to retract his errors , he was finally condemned ( January , 1600 ) , handed over to the secular power ( 8 February ) , and burned at the stake in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome ( 17 February ) .
Bruno was not condemned for his defence of the Copernican system of astronomy , nor for his doctrine of the plurality of inhabited worlds , but for his theological errors , among which were the following : that Christ was not God but merely an unusually skilful magician , that the Holy Ghost is the soul of the world , that the Devil will be saved , etc .
To the works of Bruno already mentioned the following are to be added : " Della causa , principio ed uno " ; " Dell ' infinito universo e dei mondi " ; " De Compendiosâ Architecturâ " ; " De Triplici Minimo " ; " De Monade , Numero et Figurâ . "
In these " the Nolan " expounds a system of philosophy in which the principal elements are neo-Platonism , materialistic monism , rational mysticism ( after the manner of Raymond Lully ) , and the naturalistic concept of the unity of the material world ( inspired by the Copernican astronomy ) .
His attitude towards Aristotle is best illustrated by his reiterated assertion that the natural philosophy of the Stagirite is vitiated by the predominance of the dialectical over the mathematical mode of conceiving natural phenomena .
Towards the Scholastics in general his feeling was one of undisguised contempt ; he excepted , however , Albert the Great and St. Thomas , for whom he always maintained a high degree of respect .
He wished to reform the Aristotelean philosophy , and yet he was bitterly opposed to his contemporaries , Ramus and Patrizzi , whose efforts were directed towards the same object .
He was acquainted , though only in a superficial way , with the writings of the pre-Socratic philosophers of Greece , and with the works of the neo-Platonists , especially with the books falsely attributed to Iamblichus and Plotinus .
From the neo-Platonists he derived the tendency of his thought towards monism .
From the pre-Socratic philosophers he borrowed the materialistic interpretation of the One .
From the Copernican doctrine , which was attracting so much attention in the century in which he lived , he learned to identify the material One with the visible , infinite , heliocentric universe .
Thus , his system of thought is an incoherent materialistic pantheism .
God and the world are one ; matter and spirit , body and soul , are two phases of the same substance ; the universe is infinite ; beyond the visible world there is an infinity of other worlds , each of which is inhabited ; this terrestrial globe has a soul ; in fact , each and every part of it , mineral as well as plant and animal , is animated ; all matter is made up of the same elements ( no distinction between terrestrial and celestial matter ) ; all souls are akin ( transmigration is , therefore , not impossible ) .
This unitary point of view is Bruno 's justification of " natural magic . "
No doubt , the attempt to establish a scientific continuity among all the phenomena of nature is an important manifestation of the modern spirit , and interesting , especially on account of its appearance at the moment when the medieval point of view was being abandoned .
And one can readily understand how Bruno 's effort to establish a unitary concept of nature commanded the admiration of such men as Spinoza , Jacobi , and Hegel .
On the other hand , the exaggerations , the limitations , and the positive errors of his scientific system ; his intolerance of even those who were working for the reforms to which he was devoted ; the false analogies , fantastic allegories , and sophistical reasonings into which his emotional fervour often betrayed him have justified , in the eyes of many , Bayle 's characterization of him as " the knight - errant of philosophy . "
His attitude of mind towards religious truth was that of a rationalist .
Personally , he failed to feel any of the vital significance of Christianity as a religious system .
It was not a Roman Inquisitor , but a Protestant divine , who said of him that he was " a man of great capacity , with infinite knowledge , but not a trace of religion . "

CALCULATED RISK notes that Federal Reserve governors are n't exactly singing the same tune in public comments on the likely path of monetary policy .
Nemo points out that the public disagreements have become remarkably common and overt — and , he says , pointed :
John Jansen has an explanation :
RBS Securities ( the firm formerly known as Greenwich Capital ) mentioned an interesting article by well respected research firm Wrightson in which Wrightson posits that some of the recent hawkish comments by Federal Reserve officials are a shot across the bow of leveraged speculators .
Wrightson makes the salient point that if the trajectory of rates is unclear then leveraged positions are not such safe bets .
That is I think a key and under appreciated point with the new world of Federal Reserve transparency regarding policy .
The last Federal Reserve tightening cycle was completely transparent and consisted of 17 consecutive 25 basis point rate hikes which took the funds rate target to 5.25 percent from 1 percent .
But Mr Greenspan diminished the effect of the tightening and never thoroughly damped down speculative excess as he made it manifestly clear that he would not raise rates in anything other than discrete 25 basis point intervals .
In so doing he allowed the junk which led to the current financial debacle to flourish .
There is an interesting similarity in this to an argument Larry Summers made several years ago , which was highlighted in the recent Ryan Lizza profile :
In 2007 , Summers started looking at the looming economic crisis .
Back in 2003 , he had attended a Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , in which economists were celebrating the fact that central bankers seemed to have mastered the use of monetary policy to tame inflation without causing the economy to slip into a recession , as had happened in the past .
Summers warned that perhaps the victory over inflation meant only that the next recession would be caused by some new phenomenon ...
In the fall of 2007 , his Financial Times columns took on a more urgent tone , starting with a piece on November 25th , titled “ Wake Up to the Dangers of a Deepening Crisis . ”
There had been at least six major financial crises that affected the United States over the past twenty years : the 1987 stock - market crash , the 1990 savings - and - loan crisis , the Mexican - peso crisis , the East Asian economic crisis , the failure of Long Term Capital Management , and the tech - bubble crash .
Summers had a theory that tied them together : whereas for many decades most recessions were caused by the Federal Reserve ’s attempts to curb inflation , the Fed ’s recent mastery of keeping inflation in check had given rise to the financial crisis .
Summers explained that , just as the success in curing infectious disease will allow some people to live longer only to die of cancer , the success in battling inflation will prolong an economic expansion only to lead to overconfidence and a financial crisis ...
Perhaps the Fed is beginning to think that having control over the business cycle is more important than producing long expansions and frequent bubbles .
( CNN ) -- Three U.S. researchers have won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for solving " a major problem in biology , " the Nobel Committee announced Monday .
Jack Szostak , from left , Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn will share the $ 1.4 million prize .
Elizabeth H. Blackburn , Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak are credited with discovering how chromosomes are protected against degradation -- a field that could shed light on human aging and diseases , including cancer .
" The award of the Nobel Prize recognizes the discovery of a fundamental mechanism in the cell , a discovery that has stimulated the development of new therapeutic strategies , " the committee said in a news release .
The three will share the $ 1.4 million prize .
It is the 100th year the prize will be awarded , and the first time that any Nobel in the sciences has gone to more than one woman .
The work that won them the prize took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
It centers on structures at the end of chromosomes called telomeres and an enzyme that forms them , called telomerase .
As cells divide , chromosomes need to be replicated perfectly .
Work by the researchers determined that telomeres protect DNA from degradation in the process , and that telomerase maintains the telomeres .
Though there had been some speculation that the three scientists were being considered for the Nobel , the committee keeps its work top secret -- and all three researchers said they were surprised .
Szostak told CNN he got the news in " that classic early morning phone call from Stockholm . "
He described it as " surprising and exciting " -- perhaps particularly for him because he has not worked on the subject for the past 20 years .
" I 've been working on other things , " he said .
" It started off as a collaboration with me and Liz [ Blackburn ] -- Carol [ Greider ] was a student of hers . "
The work began as " a long - standing puzzle that we were interested in solving , " he said .
" It was only over later years that it emerged , through the work of many people , that this was probably important for aging and cancer . "
How it might help fight such diseases is not yet known , Szostak said .
" It will take a while yet for that to be figured out . "
Blackburn and Greider did not immediately return calls from CNN .
In a telephone conversation with the editor - in - chief of the Nobel Prize Web site nobelprize.org , Greider said she had been attracted to the field of research because " it seemed like the unanswered question . "
She also said telomere research has a higher proportion of women than other fields because in its early days , the lead researchers brought women into the field .
She called it a situation in which " you have someone that trains a lot of women and then there 's a slight gravitation of women to work in the labs with other women . "
She added , " I think actively promoting women in science is very important because the data has certainly shown that there has been an underrepresentation .
And I think that the things that contribute to that are very many ... subtle , social kinds of things . "
Blackburn , in a separate conversation posted on the Web site , said the proportion of women in telomere research is " fairly close to the biological ratio of men and women . "
" It 's all the other fields that are aberrant , " she added , laughing .
The field of study intrigued her because " it 's so intricate and complicated , and you want to know how it works , " she said .
Blackburn was Greider 's supervisor at the University of California , Berkeley .
Now Blackburn is at the University of California , San Francisco .
Greider is a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore , Maryland .
Szostak was previously at Harvard Medical School and is currently professor of genetics at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , Massachusetts .
Married with two children , he told CNN he has " no idea " what he 'll do with his portion of the monetary prize -- about $ 467,000 .
CNN asked whether he thinks his children , ages 9 and 12 , will suddenly think dad 's work is " really cool . "
" Well , " Szostak said , laughing , " maybe . "
CNN 's Josh Levs contributed to this report .

Exercise of the Month : Stability ball knee tucks
Exercise of the Month : Stability ball knee tucks
You must understand that getting a great set of abs means little or no downtime .
Losing body fat , gaining muscle or just looking better must be a lifestyle .
If you do n't make changes in your lifestyle , no single exercise , or workout for that matter , is going to give you washboard abs .
If you 're not living on another planet you 've seen the ads and the magazine articles spewing their bullshit .
" Great abs in five minutes a day , three days a week ! "
" Get a trim waistline without dieting ! "
" Get leaner and more muscular in 10 days using our thingamajig ! "
The only thing worse than these catchphrases is the cesspool of information that usually follows .
The most alarming thing about these types of ads is that they work .
Millions of people are preyed on every year because of their ignorance and insecurities .
One thing I want to make perfectly clear is I am not highlighting this exercise because of the miraculous effects it has at giving anyone who tries it a set of washboard abs .
I am highlighting the stability ball knee tuck because it's an excellent exercise that many people have not heard of .
This exercise is also a great choice for building strong abs .
The main reason I train abs is for functional strength and injury prevention .
My workouts consist of a variety of exercises that target the entire core .
In short the core is the abdominal wall , oblique , hips and low back .
Use the following exercise along with one or two more performing 2 - 3 working sets for each .
Use a repetition range between 8 - 12 .
If you are a beginner start with sets of 15 until your strength and form are up to par .
Abs , despite what most people think , are mainly phasic muscles , meaning they are primarily made of fast twitch muscle fibers and respond best to lower repetitions .
If endurance is what you want , perform 15 - 20 reps .
If a strong washboard set of abs is what you want , perform 8 - 12 reps .
The stability ball knee tuck is torture .
Make sure not to let your back sway when your legs are fully extended .
Your core should remain tight .
Changing the way we communicate ( Image : Google )
Innovation is our regular column that highlights emerging technological ideas and where they may lead
Over the past week Google has been rolling out the first invitations to its latest service , a complex “ real - time communication and collaboration ” system dubbed Google Wave .
Instead of sending messages back and forth , users create web - page - like documents called waves that others can modify or comment on , using a combination of features more usually seen separately in email , wikis , instant messaging and social networking ( see a video introducing Wave ) .
Advertisement
Early reviews have been positive , and demand for invitations outstrips supply ( Google says ours is still on the way ) .
But even for those who have tried and liked it , Wave ’s potential is still hard to assess .
The problem is that most talk about it is focussed on technology , not people .
Human factors
“ We need to ask what opportunity Wave allows people to express themselves and to understand what other people mean when they contribute a message to a conversation , ” explains psychologist Leon Watts , who researches communication via computer at the University of Bath , UK .
The creators of Wave pitch it as “ what email would look like if it were invented today ” , not several decades ago .
But what email “ looks like ” is as much down to social protocols as to anything else , says Watts .
“ It started out as very informal memos ; now it ’s used for absolutely everything and has become much more formal , ” says Watts .
Organisations in particular have , intentionally and otherwise , encouraged people to adopt certain ways of using email that are by now second nature to us .
The cultural norms that will shape Wave ’s future are yet to be established .
But informed crystal - ball gazing is possible , based on what we know about how people use existing technology .
Time tricks
Two of the features of Wave that are likely to alter how people communicate are related to time : it allows users to see others typing live , even if they later delete that text ; and a “ replay ” function plays back the complex tangle of interactions that produced a wave .
Past research has shown that the real - time , synchronous , nature of instant messaging ( IM ) encourages an informal tone , says Susan Herring , who researches the convergence of computer communication platforms at Indiana University in Bloomington .
“ It invokes face - to - face communication and encourages people to use conversational strategies , ” she explains .
Seeing live typing may accentuate that effect , but Wave can also be asynchronous , like email .
“ We wo n’t see the difference between the two types of communication disappear , ” says Herring .
“ More elaborate messages are still possible , but when the other person is online you will be drawn to a more informal style . ”
The pace and style of communicating with Wave will be more varied than with email .
Held to account
Meanwhile , the novel replay feature may have multiple consequences , says Watts .
One is to add significance to Wave messages – just as the fact that people can store emails they have received means writers tend to rein in emotional emphasis they might let rip in spoken or IM chat .
“ Replaying a Wave gives an even more tangible and reliable feeling for the history of a relationship , ” Herring explains , compared to the way email threading and sorting quickly breaks down , hiding chronology .
Replays may also improve our ability to know the intentions of others – a capacity called theory of mind that is central to the way we communicate .
Different communication methods provide different types of evidence that is used to create such models .
Because
Wave provides multiple ways to transmit that evidence , it may make it easier to model others ’ minds .
“ Watching a Wave replay could help people to imagine what was in the minds of others , ” says Watts .
User control
That may also help reduce the misunderstandings that can blight email communication , says Herring : when people do n’t pick up that a comment is meant as a joke , for instance .
“ You have a multiplicity of channels to repair the conversation . ”
Watts points out that being able to control what others infer about you is important too , though .
By hiding the editing process , emails make it possible to try to control all the evidence others can use to gauge your thoughts .
Only once
Wave has enough users for people to use it for real communication will we know how they will react , though .
“ The designers have some control , but will also have to wait to see what usage patterns develop and respond to that ” says Herring .
Watts agrees : “ It ’s people and organisations that will ultimately determine how Wave is used . ”

Mouth Cage
It is easy to see why this weight - loss contraption did not gain popularity after it was patented in 1982 .
This cage , which is strapped over the mouth and padlocked , is quite intimidating and would probably frighten small children .
The problems , however , are more than cosmetic .
While the design prevents its wearer from eating junk food , which is good , it also prevents its wearer from eating anything at all , which is not healthy .

第 33 回 Rubyを支え るYuguiの自信 「 最後にはわたしがいる 」

■ 「 誰かがやらなければ 」 「 ならばわたしが 」
Rubyを使い始めてから、今年で9年目になります。「
Perlよりもすっきりしていて使いやすい」という噂を聞いたのが、Rubyとの出合いでした。実際、当時はあまりPerlを使いこなせていませんでした。C++で学んだオブジェクト指向をスクリプティングに適用する上で、Rubyは非常に分かりやすかったんですね。
コミッタになったのと、リリースマネージャになったのはほぼ同時でした。2007年まで、わたしはいちユーザーとして、仕様の改善書やパッチをメーリングリストに送っていました。でも、コミッタとしては参加していなかったのです。リリースマネージャになったきっかけは、2008年のRuby会議です。
「 1.9系統のリリースマネジメントには改善の余地がある」という提案を、
ずっとしていたんですね。そうしたら、Ruby会議の会場で「じゃあ、自分でやってみる気はない？」とまつもとゆきひろさんに誘われました。「はい、やります」と、その場でお受けしました。
もともと 、Rubyにはあまりマネジメントをする人がいませんでした。まつもとさんはマネジメントをするタイプではないし、笹田さんも細かな作業をこなすタイプではない。「リリースマネジメントは誰かがやらなければならない」という共通認識が、皆の間で強くありました。
「 誰かがやらなければならない、だったらわたしがやろう」と思ったのです。Ruby会議の後、すぐにリリースマネージャとしての仕事を始めるようになりました。
■ 「 誰が何をしているか」全体像を把握する
現在 、Rubyのコミッタは63人います。コアメンバーは10名ほどで、全員が日本人です。
リリースマネージャは 「リリースをきちんと行う」ことが使命です。そのためには、「スケジュール管理」が特に重要です。誰が何を実装しているのか、何をやろうとしているのかという「全体像」を把握しておくようにしています。
全体像を把握するため、メーリングリストやカンファレンスはくまなくチェックするようにしています。個人ブログ上の発言にも注意を払います。コミッタではない人が「こうした方がいい」という発言をしている場合は、発言者に声をかける場合もありますよ。また最近では、Ruby言語の他の実装であるJRubyやRubiniusのチームとも歩調を合わせるようにしています。
皆の行動や発言を俯瞰した上で、次のリリースまでにどの仕様を取り入れて、どれを取り入れないのか、取捨選択をします。「誰が、いつ、どんな提案をしてくるか」ということについては、わたしがコントロールできるものではありませんので、わたしはリリース期日までに仕様を収束させることを第一に考えています。
■ 提案を取り入れる判断基準は 「 ユーザーの利便性 」 「 言語の一貫性 」
コミッタによる提案を取り入れるかどうかは、「重要度」に鑑みて判断します。「重要度」の判断基準は2つあります。「ユーザーにとって必要かどうか」、そして「言語の一貫性」です。
ユーザーにとって必要かどうかについては、まずわたし自身がRubyユーザーとして「この仕様は必要であると思えるかどうか」と考えます。わたしはやや古めのユーザーでもあるため、10年前の文化も分かりますし、Ruby on Rails以降のユーザーのニーズも把握しています。言語の一貫性については、それぞれの個所に詳しいコミッタに、取り入れる必要があるかどうかを相談します。
■ 企業とオープンソースコミュニティ、マネジメントの違い
コアメンバーとは、よく話し合いをしますね。「何が必要で何が必要ではないのか」などの議論が活発に行われます。もし、話がなかなか収束しそうにない場合は、わたしが意見を述べて収束させる場合もあります。言語仕様の最終決定は、まつもとさんに委ねます。ユーザーの利便性については、わたしが最終的な判断を行います。リリースマネージャとしての仕事は、他にドキュメント制作やバグ報告の処理などがありますね。Ruby付属の埋め込みドキュメンテーションに関しては、わたしが中心となって行っています。Rubyは全体的にドキュメントが不足しています。ドキュメント不足は、リリースの品質としてはあまり良くないことだと思っています。でも、コミッタはあまりドキュメントを作ろうとしないため、わたしがやることにしています。
企業におけるプロジェクトマネジメントと、オープンソースのリリースマネジメントの大きな違いは、やはり「リソース配分」ではないでしょうか。
Rubyなどのオープンソースは、あくまでボランティアベースで回しています。もし作業が終わっていないところがあっても、リソースを割り振る権限がありません。Rubyの各部分について大まかな担当者はいますし、遅れている個所についてはメールやチャットで確認します。けれども声を掛けたところでその人に作業する義務があるわけではありません。
リリースする数日前に、本来なら誰かがやっているはずの仕事が終わっていなかったということがありました。「誰かやってくれませんか」と声をかけて実装しましたが、間に合わなかったために見送ったものもあります。
不確定要素は、企業内のプロジェクトとは比べ物にならないほど多いですね。
基本的には、リリースのスケジュールに間に合わせるようにマネジメントをしますが、本当に必要なものだと判断すれば、スケジュールの変更を行います。
実は、1.9.1のリリースは1カ月遅れたんですね。まつもとさんによる、大きな言語仕様の変更がありました。
「もしここを変更するなら、リリースを1カ月遅らせなければならないですが、遅らせるだけの価値がありますか」と、まつもとさんに確認したところ、「Yes」という答えが返ってきました。その一声で、実装を決定しました。
急な変更だったので多くのコミッタが驚きましたね。言語仕様の変更に、ライブラリのあちこちが追随しなくてはいけませんでした。間に合わないと思った分は、わたしが自分でコードを書きました。リリースは遅れましたが、「1カ月遅れるだろう」という予測どおりにちゃんと収束できたのは良かったと思います。
■ 「 最終的にはわたしがどうにかする」
お話してきたように、オープンソースのリリースマネジメントは、いろいろな不確定要素があります。でも、あまり不安はありません。それは、「最終的にはわたしがどうにかする」という自信があるからだと思います。
わたしは、いろいろな人に頼んで仕事をやってもらいます。でも、誰もやらないのであれば、わたしがやります。コミッタの皆は「良いものを作りたい」というモチベーションが高いので、わたしはあまり手を出しませんが、もし最終段階に来たら、わたしが動けばいいのです。
もし、わたしがひっくり返っても真似できないような凄腕の技術者をマネージしなければならなくなったら、状況は変わるかもしれません。でも幸いいまのところは、ほとんどのことは自分で勉強すればどうにかすることができるものです。また、開発メンバーがもっと増えてくれば、おそらくマネジメント方法も変わってくるでしょう。人数が増えれば、おそらくLinuxのように、ゆるい階層構造になるのかもしれません。それまでは、こうした形でマネジメントを行っていく予定です。
2年前のわたしのように「わたしがやります」という人がいたら、マネジメント業務は喜んでお譲りいたしますよ。わたしは「こうした方がいい」という改善点を提案し続けますので。
「 Rubyを、皆が安心して使える言語にする」。そのためにわたしは仕事をしています。
This weekend 's England football international will be broadcast exclusively live over the internet for the first time , it emerged today .
Media group Perform is to stream Saturday 's away clash against Ukraine on a pay - per- view basis on newspaper websites , including The Independent , which will screen the game at www.ukrainevengland.com/independent
The move follows the collapse of pay - TV platform Setanta earlier this year , which had been due to broadcast the World Cup qualifier .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
International football agency Kentaro had sold the broadcast rights of the fixture to Setanta , and after the collapse failed to agree rights offers with any of the more traditional broadcasters such as BBC , ITV and Five .
Perform 's executive chairman , Andrew Croker told the BBC : " The world is changing ... this is a classic example of it .
" It 's exciting .
Anyone who wants to come on a journey with us should sign up - they will enjoy it . "
The cost of watching the game was being advertised today on one national newspaper as £ 4.99 , if viewers " signed up early " .
Peter Silverstone , managing director of Kentaro , told the BBC that a maximum of one million subscribers would be taken for the match .
This is the " safe number to stop at to ensure the optimal broadcast " , he said .
Former England coach Sven -Goran Eriksson will be part of the studio line - up , he added , with a " top commentary team " .
Mr Silverstone said : " You will watch as you would any other streaming on the internet , like YouTube or the BBC iPlayer - there will be a pop-up player that will show the match in a very good quality stream .
" We have a huge marketing effort behind us with the various newspaper groups that will promote the match on their websites .
" Commercially this will work and genuinely offers an exciting opportunity for us .
We would n't embark on this project if we did n't feel it had strategic long - term value , this is n't a one - off shot . "
Perform said it streams more than 15,000 events a year , with millions of site users a month .
England have already qualified for the 2010 World Cup , winning all eight of their group matches .
Football Association spokesman Adrian Bevington told the broadcaster that his organisation " would obviously like to see the game broadcast to as many people as possible " .
" These are the rights of the Ukrainian FA and the agents they 've appointed to sell them , " he said .
" A traditional TV platform would be ideal to broadcast the game but it's not the case .
It 's not in our control . "
The best league in the world is back .

Palin called it , kind of
Sarah Palin is right .
There are " death panels . "
These death panels exist in reality , rather than in her imagination .
There is the panel at Cigna that cancelled a woman 's coverage after she developed brain cancer .
And there is that panel in Colorado that decided to deny coverage to a 4 - month - old because he was overweight .
There are also panels of insurance executives in eight states that are allowed to cancel coverage to victims of domestic violence -- a so - called " preexisting condition . "
Most health insurance corporations have panels that exist to increase profits by denying coverage .
However , the most deadly panel of all is the one that weighs the needs of young against the needs of the elderly and the cost of health care against the costs of war .
It 's the one that decides corporate profits are more important than public health .
That panel is the U.S. Congress .

In need of new petition
You are wrong on this issue of petition signing .
You make the false assumption that all petition signers are in favor of whatever they are signing [ " Signing on for scrutiny , not for secrecy , " Oct. 22 ] .
However , I sign many petitions because I believe the people should have a voice in the issue and I believe that our legislators only pretend to listen while nodding their heads .
If they were really listening and working the issues , there would be few petitions .
Yes , my name needs to be validated on a petition , but not made public .
To make the names public exposes me for executing my constitutional right .
I did not give that right to my public officials .
Just as politicians use voting data to punish , this kind of data in politicians ' hands is too dangerous .
Where is the petition to keep petitioners ' names and addresses secret except to the attorney general to validate ?
I want to sign first .

Recoup the idea losses
I would like to address the Gresham City Council and urge them to reconsider their vote on chicken - keeping regulations [ " Gresham sticks to rules on chickens , " Oct. 21 ] .
Councilor Josh Fuhrer should note that many people who choose to keep chickens are actively seeking to improve their own sustainability and livability .
The two are not mutually exclusive , as he seems to imply .
In fact , many of us would argue that sustainability and livability are quite complementary .
Dr. John Killian might consult the many hundreds of U.S. cities that allow chicken keeping within city limits and ask how their avian flu risk is affecting them .
I think I 'll defer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on that one .
There are several households with chickens in my neighborhood , but I 'm far more concerned by the dogs that occasionally charge out of their enclosures at me than the occasional loud cluck .
Rethink your position , council members .
Your logic does n't really hold up .

Mortality is bigger issue
On Oct. 17 , Robert Mutch and Steve Pedery wrote an opinion piece asking for protection of the Crater Lake area from timber harvest [ " Oregon 's ' best idea ' needs protection " ] .
I am curious if they are aware of the mortality problem facing stands of U.S. Forest Service timber surrounding the lake .
Salvage of dead and dying timber is necessary to avoid wildfires from damaging the beauty of the park and the subsequent CO2 emissions which may add to global warming .
Many years ago , the National Park Service allowed Yellowstone to burn .
For a long time , visitors viewed a desolate moonscape before stands of young lodgepole pine became established .
Timber logging projects , like D - Bug , will duplicate a fire without the environmental damage .
Young stands of timber will develop in five years instead of 20 - plus years if management is allowed .
In many cases , timber harvest is needed to preserve the aesthetics of natural wonders like Crater Lake .

Legislation should do more
Global warming poses a serious threat to wildlife .
Scientists warn that without prompt action , 18 percent of the world 's plant and animal species will be at risk of extinction by 2050 .
Such a massive loss of biodiversity , occurring in a very short time frame , will leave our planet impoverished .
Fortunately , we can pass legislation to reduce carbon emissions .
The House has passed legislation aimed at doing that and Senators Barbara Boxer , D - Calif. , and John Kerry , D - Mass . , have introduced similar legislation in the Senate .
However , the current climate change legislation should do more than aggressively reduce carbon dioxide emissions .
It should also dedicate 5 percent of the funds generated to safeguarding fish and wildlife from the climate change .
For the sake of future generations , we need to act now to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and reverse the damage already inflicted on many ecosystems .

Health care for fools
The Democrats ' health care proposals warp the words " option " and " insurance . "
Option means choice among several .
Because of federal subsidies and regulations , private plans will fade , leaving President Obama 's goal -- a single - payer plan .
Insurance involves payment in case of an uncertain event .
Inclusion of all health conditions , preexisting or current , means sure cost for carriers .
Obama continues to play Americans for fools and dreamers .

Time for overthrow
President Obama was recently awarded the Nobel peace prize for promoting world peace .
Obama has made some significant changes in domestic affairs , like fixing the endangered species act or working to reform health care .
However , all these changes are still not good enough to fix most of the problems that are currently plaguing the world .
In order to effectively combat these problems , we need to change our system of government drastically .
Karl Marx believed that a communist government would benefit all who live by it .
In Marx 's communism , we would not have to worry about homelessness , health care problems , or economic failures .
John Locke , one of the key philosophers whose ideas helped create our government , also said that all citizens have the natural right to overthrow the government if it was not working and start a new one .
It is time to do that .

Fascism is no farce
College students must not know anything of history or the meaning of the words parody , irony and sarcasm , which the dictionary describes as concerning vices and follies .
Adolf Hitler 's death camps , and gas houses were not vices and follies , but vicious mass murders .
It is appalling to learn there are people who link anything of World War II horror to writing satire .
I am 82 years old and vividly recall listening to our battery - operated radio and hearing Hitler 's insane screaming .
My mother could understand him and tears were streaming down her face .
We feared for relatives in Germany .
They were never heard from again and no trace was found .
How dare any one write parodies of the miseries and horrors of that time in history ?
College - age adults should know the meaning of integrity .
Or are they so ignorant they believe Anne Frank 's story is a comedy ?

Discounted cost of living
Did other seniors have a good laugh at last Saturday 's Oct. 17 editorial about the proposed $ 250 Social Security payment ?
[ " Obama 's $ 250 Social Security gambit " ] .
The Oregonian editorial board states that because of negative inflation , " the purchasing power of seniors ... has already increased over last year . "
I am delighted to know that .
The Oregonian raised rates this year , my water rates are going to go up , Comcast is announcing an increase and the media also announced that even though there will be no cost of living increase for us , that the insurance ( Part B , Part D or both ? ) will increase .
These increases will continue next year and the following two years when we will not be receiving a cost of living increase .
I am delighted to know about my increased purchasing power .
These writers are obviously not seniors .

Limit official holidays
On Monday , Oct. 12 , Leonard Pitts Jr. said one right thing -- Christmas should not be an official national holiday [ " Principle at odds with common sense " ] .
It should be what it is , an annual Christian holy day of celebration , remembrance and thanksgiving .
There are too many national holidays already .
We only need six :
First , the last Friday in February equals " Great Americans Day . "
Second , the last Friday in April should be " Great Family Day . "
Third , July 4th can remain Independence day ( stress on the " in " ) .
Fourth , the first Monday in September should be " Labor and Student Day . "
Fifth , the last Friday in October can be " Harvest and Thanksgiving Day . "
Sixth , the last Friday in December can be " Winter Day , " " Gift Day " or " Whatever Day . "
There is no special reason to celebrate Jan. 1 or Dec. 31 as a holiday .
The calendar changes make the dates moot .

Capt Robert Mansell ( Pic courtesy of St Maarten Island Time.com )
A British pilot has been hailed a hero after he died while saving his nine passengers by ditching his plane into the Caribbean sea .
Robert Mansell , 32 , originally from Knowle , West Midlands , had used his skills as a " good pilot " to save lives , said his employers Divi Divi Air .
He was flying between the south Caribbean islands of Curacao and Bonaire on Wednesday when he crashed .
All nine passengers escaped the sinking plane , but the pilot 's body is missing .
Captain Mansell was five minutes short of the destination when he was forced to ditch the twin- engine Britten - Norman Islander .
The passengers escaped the sinking aircraft , but he was still strapped into his seat as it disappeared into waters reported to be 150 metres deep .
Other pilots would n't have known what to do but he landed the aircraft so that everyone could get out safely
Simon Janzen , Divi Divi Air Colleagues at Divi Divi
Air are said to be devastated by his death , describing him as a highly respected and qualified flyer .
Simon Janzen , from the company , said : " He 's a hero .
All the passengers survived and he is the only one missing .
If he was n't a good pilot , he could n't have ditched it so everyone could be saved .
" Other pilots would n't have known what to do but he landed the aircraft so that everyone could get out safely . "
The crash happened after the right engine of the plane failed , and Capt Mansell made a mayday call before ditching , he added .
Divi Divi Air Managing Director Germaine Ritchie said the local civil aviation authority were conducting a " thorough investigation " into the accident .
She said passengers had informed her that the pilot was " performing beyond what is expected of a person " , had been " calm throughout the entire flight " and was " doing his utmost to save those on board " .
She added that Capt Mansell was a meticulous pilot who had an " excellent track record " and was " very much respected " among his peers .
Tributes on a local news website , the St Maarten Island Time , have described Capt Mansell as a " true hero " for saving the passengers .
Capt Mansell worked for Winair before moving to work for Avion di Divi Divi .
Divi Divi Air , established in 2001 on the island of Curacao , operates up to nine flights a day between Caribbean islands .
Bonaire , which along with Curacao is part of the Netherlands Antilles , lies about 50 miles off the coast of Venezuela .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Like the alchemists who once tried to turn lead into gold , a green entrepreneur says he has found a cost - effective method for turning plastic trash into oil .
The Envion plant turns plastic garbage into oil by isolating petroleum from the plastic 's other ingredients .
During a recent visit to his new demonstration plant in Maryland , Envion CEO Michael Han describes his process : Waste plastic is shredded and melted and then processed in a way that separates the petroleum from the rest of the ingredients .
At one end of the machinery , shredded plastic trash is dumped in a hopper and goes up a conveyor belt into a " reactor . "
At the other end is a spaghetti of pipes and valves and tanks .
Han turns open a spigot on one of the pipes and produces a liquid the color of apple juice .
It smells kind of like diesel , and Han claims it 's ready to be processed for any number of uses : fueling cars , diesel generators or even jets .
But not all of the ingredients in plastic can be refined into petroleum .
All the chemicals that were added when the plastic was produced must be separated out and collected in a sediment tank .
That could be a problem , says Kert Davies , a researcher with the environmental group Greenpeace .
He has not visited the plant , but after reading Envion 's literature , he asked , " what happens to the additives and the metals and the other things ? "
Envion is hoping to find asphalt makers who can use the sludge as an ingredient for paving after the metals are filtered out .
Otherwise , it can be dried by microwaving and the dust sent to a landfill .
" Then you end up with a different problem , " Davies said .
" Is that going to a hazardous waste landfill ? "
The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer is the command center for breaking news , politics and extraordinary reports from around the world .
Today 4 pm ET see full schedule »
But Han says that it's not hazardous , and most important , that the process releases no gas into the air .
" You do n't smell anything burning , " he said .
" We do n't incinerate .
We simply melt . "
Han set up his demonstration at the Montgomery County dump in Maryland .
Amid bales of crushed yogurt containers and plastic bottles , there seems to be little risk that he will run out of trash to feed into his machine .
Envion is pitching the technology to sanitation departments , promising it will cut down on their trash volume by consuming up to 10,000 tons of plastic per year while producing some revenue as well .
The plant could produce up to 60,000 barrels of oil a year , Han says , and although some of that oil is used to keep the machinery running , the rest can be sold to an oil company for profit .
The plant cost $ 4 million to build , but Han says it can produce oil for as little as $ 10 a barrel at a time when oil is selling for more than $ 70 a barrel .
Davies said that " finding new oil to burn is not the goal .
The goal should be to burn less oil . "
But Han said , " if there 's a way that we can solve the problem of accumulation of waste plastic in our country and at the same time turn it into a byproduct that is cost effective , then I think it 's a win-win situation . "

Selected vaccine authorities from CDC , FDA , and manufacturers discuss , in a closed meeting , the possibility of neurodevelopment disorders resulting from vaccine components .
Emphasis and comments in square brackets added by K.P. Stoller , M.D. [ The CDC published a study in late 2003 , repudiating any possible link between thimerosal and developmental problems such as autism , but the CDC did have data supporting such a link which it secretively kept from the public .
Documents released through the Freedom of Information
Act detail the transcript of a meeting held in June of 2000 between members of the CDC , the FDA , and representatives from the vaccine industry .
This top secret meeting was held to discuss a study done by Dr. Thomas Verstraeten and his co-workers using Vaccine Safety Datalink data as a project collaboration between the CDC's National Immunization Program ( NIP ) and four HMOs .
The study examined the records of 110,000 children .
The transcript is titled “ Scientific Review of Vaccine Safety Datalink Information , ” June 7 - 8 , 2000 , Simpsonwood Retreat Center , Norcross , Georgia , but it was also the first official meeting of the ACIP ( Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices which sets CDC policy ) work group on thimerosal and immunization .
In attendance were Walter Orenstein , Director of the National Immunization Program ( NIP ) at the CDC ; John Modlin , Chair of the ACIP and on the faculty at Dartmouth Medical School ; and 50 other distinguished members of the government ( 11 consultants from the CDC ) , academia and the pharmaceutical industry .
Vaccine industry representatives were : Harry Guess , M.D. , Merck , Chief of Epidemiology ; Jo White , M.D. , North American Vaccine , Clinical Dev. & Research ; Barbara Howe , M.D. , Smith , Kline - Beecham , Clinical Research Group ; Mike Blum , M.D. , Wyeth , Safety and Surveillance for Vaccine Development .
Although this conference is apparently concerned with the effects of mercury in the form of thimerosal on infant brain development , participants seemed to have limited knowledge about mercury .
None of the well known experts were invited , such as Dr. Ascher from Bowman Grey School of Medicine or Dr. Boyd Haley , who has done extensive work on the toxic effects of low concentrations on the CNS .
The conference followed a study that showed that mercury in vaccines may have caused neurodevelopment problems .
The following are in context excerpts of this 260 page transcript : ]
Dr. Orenstein pg 1 - 2 “ ( For ) those who do n’t know , initial concerns were raised last summer that mercury , as methylmercury ( thimerosal ) in vaccines , might exceed safe levels .
As a result of these concerns , CDC undertook , in collaboration with investigators in the Vaccine safety Datalink , an effort to evaluate whether there were any health risks from mercury on any of these vaccines .
Analysis to date raise some concerns of possible dose - response effect of increasing levels of mehylmercury in vaccines and certain neurologic diagnosis .
Therefore , the purpose of this meeting is to have a careful scientific review of the data . ”
Dr. Bernier pg 8 : ( Associate Director for Science in the NIP )
“ There was a Congressional Action in 1997 requiring the FDA to review Mercury in drugs and biologics … in October of 1999 the ACIP looked this situation over again and … said the vaccines could be continued to be used . ”
Dr. Johnston , pg. 14-15 & 19 - 20 : ( Chair of the meeting and a pediatrician - immunologist at the University of Colorado ) : “ Thimerosal is cleaved ( in the body ) into ethylmercury and thiosalicylate which is inactive …
The data on its toxicity ( shows ) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity , including death . ”
“ It is particularly a concern in multi - dose vials because of the issue of re-entry multiple times in the vials , and it is also important in the manufacturing process for a number of vaccine including inactivated influenza and some of the earlier DPT vaccine , and is a constituent of all DPT vaccines , but not all DTAP vaccines . ”
“ There are three licensed preservative in the United States , Thimerosal , ethyl and phenol .
We wo n't talk about the other two today , but I thought I should mention them .
Thimerosal is the most active and it has been utilized in vaccines since the 1930's . ”
“ Acutely , it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity , including death , from overdose … ” “ Dr. Halsey made a very impassioned plea that we do carefully controlled studies to in fact address the issues specifically , and that such studies be conducted by neurodevelopmentalists and environmental scientists employing specific endpoints of their study … ”
“ We just recently had another meeting that some of you were able to attend dealing with aluminum in vaccines .
I would like to just say one or two words about that before I conclude . ”
“ We learned at that meeting a number of important things about aluminum , and I think they also are important in our considerations today .
“ Aluminum salts are important in the formulating process of vaccines , both in antigen stabilization and absorption of endotoxin . ”
“ Aluminum and mercury are often simultaneously administered to infants , both at the same site and at different sites . ”
“ However , we also learned that there is absolutely no data , including animal data , about the potential for synergy , additively or antagonism , all of which can occur in binary metal mixtures that relate and allow us to draw any conclusions from the simultaneous exposure to these two salts in vaccines … ”
Dr. Weil , pg. 24 : “ I think it ’s clear to me anyway that we are talking about a problem that is probably more related to bolus acute exposures , and we also need to know that the migration problems and some of the other developmental problems in the central nervous system go on for quite a period after birth .
But from all of the other studies of toxic substances , the earlier you work with the central nervous system , the more likely you are to run into a sensitive period for one of these effects , so that moving from one month or one day of birth to six months of birth changes enormously the potential for toxicity .
There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we ’ve got a serious problem .
The earlier we go , the more serious the problem . ”
“ The second point I could make is that in relationship to aluminum , being a nephrologist for a long time , the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data .
To think there is n’t some possible problem here is unreal . ”
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 31 : “ It is sort of interesting that when I first came to the CDC as a NIS officer a year ago only , I did n’t really know what I wanted to do , but one of the things I knew I did n’t want to do was studies that had to do with toxicology or environmental health .
Now it turns out that other people also thought that this study was not the right thing to do , so what I will present to you is the study that nobody thought we should do . ”
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 40 : “ … we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes .
First , for two months of age , an unspecified developmental delay , which has its own specific ICD9 code .
Exposure at three months of age , Tics .
Exposure at six months of age , an attention deficit disorder .
Exposure at one , three and six months of age , language and speech delays which are two separate ICD9 codes .
Exposures at one , three and six months of age , the entire category of neurodevelopmental delays , which includes all of these plus a number of other disorders . ”
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 42 : “ But for one thing that is for sure , there is certainly an under - ascertainment of all of these because some of the children are just not old enough to be diagnosed .
So the crude incidence rates are probably much lower that what you would expect because the cohort is still very young . ”
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 44 : “ Now for speech delays , which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays .
The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip .
The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one . ”
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 45 : " What this represents is the overall category of developmental delays , of which I have excluded speech delays because of the impression we had was some of the calculations were driven by this speech group , which was making up about half of this category .
After excluding this speech group , the trend is also apparent in this group and the test for trend is also significant for this category excluding speech . ”
Dr. Weil , pg. 75 : “ I think that what you are saying is in term of chronic exposure .
I think that the alternative scenario is that this repeated acute exposures , and like many repeated acute exposures , if you consider a dose of 25 micrograms on one day , then you are above threshold .
At least we think you are , and then you do that over and over to a series of neurons where the toxic effect may be the same set of neurons or the same set of neurologic processes ; it is conceivable that the more mercury you get , the more effect you are going to get . ”
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 76 : “ What I have done here , I am putting into the model instead of mercury , a number of antigens that the children received , and what do we get ?
Not surprisingly , we get very similar estimates as what we got for Thimerosal because every vaccine put in the equation has Thimerosal .
So for speech and the other ones maybe it ’s not so significant , but for the overall group it is also significant … .
Here we have the same thing , but instead of number of antigens , number of shots .
Just the number of vaccinations given to a child , which is also for nearly all of them significantly related . ”
Dr. Guess , pg. 77 : " So this essentially is a 7 % risk per antigen , an antigen is like in DPT you 've got three antigens . "
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 77 : " Correct . "
Dr. Egan , pg. 77 : " Could you do this calculation for aluminum ? "
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 77 : " I did it for aluminum … Actually the results were almost identical to ethylmercury because the amount of aluminum goes along almost exactly with the mercury one . "
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 78-79 : " Then the last slide I wanted to show , there was a question of it there was any way from this data that we could estimate what would happen in the future if there is Thimerosal - free Hep B and Thimerosal - free haemophilus influenza vaccine and only DTP has Thimerosal " " The second column would be the same scenario but now at six months .
Assuming they have received two additional DPTs , so between three and six months of age they have increased their ethylmercury amounts by 50 micrograms .
If I do in this current cohort with all its limitations , because there is also the Hep B that exists in the cohort * , I can't really take it out .
It is significant for this one disorder which is language delay and is a combination of these two disorders , also becomes significant . "
* Dr. Verstraeten could not determine which children got Hep B at birth in some cases so it was difficult to back the birth dose of Hep B out of the data .
Dr. Bernier , pg. 113 : " We have asked you to keep this information confidential .
We do have a plan for discussing these data at the upcoming meeting of the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices on June 21 and June 22 .
At that time CDC plans to make a public release of this information * , so I think it would serve all of our interests best if we could continue to consider these data .
The ACIP work group will be considering also .
If we could consider these data in a certain protected environment .
So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now , to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting .
So to basically consider this embargoed information .
That would help all of us to use the machinery that we have in place for considering these data and for arriving at policy recommendations . "

Dr. Keller , pgs. 116 & 118 : " …we know the developing neurologic system is more sensitive than one that is fully developed … " Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 142 : " But if I can have the next slide , here instead of the proportional hazard model , we did a logistic regression model .
I did n't use person time here and it's a bit tough to define exactly the control group .
However , if I do it for all ages and not looking at different years , and this is for speech , the outcome is almost identical to the proportional hazard model , which suggests to me that it is not a question of bringing the diagnosis forward , but it is really the overall number that drives this estimate . "
Dr. Rapin , pg. 143 : " I would like to make a comment .
We have been focusing on all these acquired causes including mercury and prematurity , and you had a list of confounding variables that should be considered in future studies .
What we know today about all of the developmental disorders is that environmental factors are in fact rather unimportant in the case of these deficits and the major cause is genetic …
I find it a little difficult knowing this and putting in autism .
The major cause is not environmental , it is genetic and that we are focusing just on these environment events or adventitious events when we have n't considered , and you told us that you do n't have data for example on siblings , your study does not lend itself to considering the major variable . "
Dr. Johnson , pg 144 : " Well , I think the assumption is that those genetic predispositions would be randomly distributed . "
Dr. Rapin , pg. 144 : " But you do n't know that . "
Dr. Johnson , pg. 144 : " No , that 's an interesting assumption . "
Dr. Rapin , pg. 144 : " I understand that , but you do n't know that . "
Dr. Johnson , pg. 144 : " just on principle , Dr. Rapin , it seems to me that the more we learn about genetics or the more we learn about let 's say autism , the more we shift towards focusing on genetic causes , but would you rule out the possibility , and let 's move away from autism , that some of these are genetic predisposition and then the second hit ? "
Dr. Rapin , pg. 144 : " Not at all .
I think that it is in fact an attractive hypothesis . "
Dr. Johnson , pg. 145 : " Right , thank you . "
Dr. Chen , pg. 151 : " One of the reasons that led me personally to not be so quick to dismiss the findings was that on his own Tom independently picked three different outcomes that he did not think could be associated with mercury and three out of three had a different pattern across different exposure levels as compared to the ones that again on a priority basis we picked as biologically plausible to be due to mercury exposure . "
Dr. Brent , pg. 161 : " Was n't it true that if you looked at the population that had 25 micrograms you had a certain risk and when you got to 75 micrograms you had a higher risk . "
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 161 : " Yes , absolutely , but these are all at the same time .
Measured at the same age at least . "
Dr. Brent , pg. 161 : I understand that , but they are different exposures . "
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 161 : " Yes . " Dr. Brent , pg. 161 : " What is your explanation ?
What explanations would you give for that ? "
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 161 : " Personally , I have three hypotheses .
My first hypothesis is it is parental bias .
The children that are more likely to be vaccinated are more likely to be picked and diagnosed .
Second hypothesis , I do n't know .
There is a bias that I have not recognized , and nobody has yet told me about it .
Third hypothesis .
It 's true , it 's Thimerosal .
Those are my hypotheses . "
Dr. Brent , pg. 161 : " If it 's true , which or what mechanisms would you explain the finding with ? "
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 162 : " You are asking for biological plausibility ? "
Dr. Brent , pg. 162 : " Well , yes . "
Dr. Verstraeten , pg. 162 : " When I saw this , and I went back through the literature , I was actually stunned by what I saw because I thought it is plausible .
First of all there is the Faeroe study , which I think people have dismissed too easily , and there is a new article in the same Journal that was presented here , the Journal of Pediatrics , where they have looked at PCB .
They have looked at other contaminants in seafood and they have adjusted for that , and still mercury comes out .
That is one point .
Another point is that in many of the studies with animals , it turned out that there is quite a different result depending on the dose of mercury .
Depending on the route of exposure and depending on the age at which the animals , it turned out that there is quite a different result depending on the dose of mercury .
Depending on the route of exposure and depending on the age at which the animals were exposed .
Now , I do n't know how much you can extrapolate that from animals to humans , but that tells me mercury at one month of age is not the same as mercury at three months , at 12 months , prenatal mercury , later mercury .
There is a whole range of plausible outcomes from mercury .
On top of that , I think that we can not so easily compare the U.S. population to Faeroe or Seychelles populations .
We have different mean levels of exposure .
We are comparing high to high in the Seychelles , high to high in the Faeroe and low to low in the U.S. , so I am not sure how easily you can transpose one finding to another one .
So basically to me that leaves all the options open , and that means I can not exclude such a possible effect . "
Dr. Orenstein , pg. 184 : " Well , the second issue is we do n't know causality .
We do n't know about causality , but is this something that really warrants some urgent attention ? "
Dr. Clover , pg. 187 : " … no one around here is going to say that mercury per say is not a concern . "
Dr. Weil , pg. 187 & 188 : " Although the data presents a number of uncertainties , there is adequate consistency , biological plausibility , a lack of relationship with phenomenon not expected to be related , and a potential causal role that is as good as any other hypothesized etiology of explanation of the noted associations .
In addition , the possibility that the associations could be causal has major significance for public and professional acceptance of Thimerosal containing vaccines .
I think that is a critical issue .
Finally , lack of further study would be horrendous grist for the anti-vaccination bill .
That 's why we need to go on , and urgently I would add . *
Dr. Brent , pg. 188-191 : " I am impressed with the fact that some people here have information and believe that like the incidence of learning difficulties , behavior disorders and attention deficit is increasing in our population .
I do n't know whether it is or it is n't , but that kind of information you just can't throw around and say it 's true or is n't true without data .
And it is such an important area in our society .
I mean it is the thing that makes a human being different from the other species , so it is such an important area of research … " " … ( thimerosal ) Causing learning disabilities and behavioral disorders .
ADD is a tremendous problem in our society and I think it is one that we should be very concerned about . "
" Finally , the thing that concerns me the most , those who know me , I have been a pin stick in the litigation community because of the nonsense of our litigious society .
This will be a resource to our very busy plaintiff attorneys in this country when this information becomes available .
They want business and this could potentially be a lot of business . "
Dr. Koller , pg. 192 : " … As you increase the vaccination , you increase effects , but you do n't know .
You have modified live viruses .
You have different antigens .
There is a lot of things in those vaccinations other than mercury , and we do n't know whether this is a vaccination effect or a mercury effect .
But I am almost sure it is not a mercury effect .
Positive as a matter of fact , and there are several experts particularly that have reviewed this , the methylmercury aspect who would agree with that due to dose response . "
Dr. Johnson , pg. 193 : " Are you really comfortable with the way the neurologic function was tested in the Seychelles ? "
Dr. Koller , pg. 193 : " I have to admit that there were many other tests that could have been conducted …
We are talking about very subjective , very sensitive assays and yes , there could have been others done and there should be more done … "
Dr. Johnson , pg. 198 : " This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available . ”
“ My gut feeling ?
It worries me enough .
Forgive this personal comment , but I got called out at eight o'clock for an emergency call and my daughter - in - law delivered a son by C- section .
Our first male in the line of the next generation , and I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on .
It will probably take a long time .
In the meantime , and I know there are probably implications for this internationally , but in the meantime I think I want that grandson to only be given Thimerosal - free vaccines . "
Dr. Bernier , pg 198 : " the negative findings need to be pinned down and published . "
Dr. Weil , pg. 207 : " The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant .
You can play with this all you want .
They are linear .
They are statistically significant .
The positive relationships are those that one might expect from the Faroe Islands studies .
They are also related to those data we do have on experimental animal data and similar to the neurodevelopmental tox data on other substances , so that I think you can't accept that this is out of the ordinary .
It is n't out of the ordinary . "
Dr. Weil , pg. 208 : " The rise in the frequency of neurobehavioral disorders whether it is ascertainment or real , is not too bad .
It is much too graphic .
We do n't see that kind of genetic change in 30 years . "
Dr. Brent , pg. 229 : " The medical / legal findings in this study , causal or not , are horrendous and therefore , it is important that the suggested epidemiological , pharmacokinetic , and animal studies be performed .
If an allegation was made that a child 's neurobehavioral findings were caused by Thimerosal containing vaccines , you could readily find junk scientist who would support the claim with " a reasonable degree of certainty " .
But you will not find a scientist with any integrity who would say the reverse with the data that is available .
And that is true .
So we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits if they were initiated and I am concerned . "
Dr. Meyers , pg. 231 : " Can I go back to the core issue about the research ?
My own concern , and a couple of you said it , there is an association between vaccines and outcome that worries both parents and pediatricians .
We do n’t really know what that outcome is , but it is one that worries us and there is an association with vaccines .
We keep jumping back to Thimerosal , but a number of us are concerned that Thimerosal may be less likely than some of the potential associations that have been made .
Some of the potential associations are number of injections , number of antigens , other additives .
We mentioned aluminum and I mentioned yesterday aluminum and mercury .
Antipyretics and analgesics are better utilized when vaccines are given .
And then every body mentioned all of the ones that we can't think about in this quick time period that are a part of this association , and yet all of the questions I hear we are asking have to do with Thimerosal .
My concern is we need to ask the questions about the other potential associations , because we are going to the Thimerosal - free vaccine .
I f many of us do n't think that this is a plausible association because of the levels and so on , then we are missing looking for the association that may be the important one . "
Dr. Caserta , pg. 234 : " One of the things I learned at the Aluminum Conference in Puerto Rico that was tied into the metal lines in biology and medicine that I never really understood before , is the interactive effect of different metals when they are together in the same organism .
It is not the same as when they are alone , and I think it would be foolish for us not to include aluminum as part of our thinking with this . "
Dr. Clements , pg 247- 249 : " I am really concerned that we have taken off like a boat going down one arm of the mangrove swamp at high speed , when in fact there was not enough discussion really early on about which was the boat should go at all .
And I really want to risk offending everyone in the room by saying that perhaps this study should not have been done at all , because the outcome of it could have , to some extent , been predicted , and we have all reached this point now where we are left hanging , even though I hear the majority of consultants say to the Board that they are not convinced there is a causality direct link between Thimerosal and various neurological outcomes . "
“ I know how we handle it from here is extremely problematic .
The ACIP is going to depend on comments from this group in order to move forward into policy , and I have been advised that whatever I say should not move into the policy area because that is not the point of this meeting .
But nonetheless , we know from many experiences in history that the pure scientist has done research because of pure science .
But that pure science has resulted in splitting the atom or some other process which is completely beyond the power of the scientists who did the research to control it .
And what we have here is people who have , for every best reason in the world , pursued a direction of research .
But there is not the point at which the research results have to be handled , and even if this committee decides that there is no association and that information gets out , the work that has been done and through the freedom of information that will be taken by others and will be used in ways beyond the control of this group .
And I am very concerned about that as I suspect it already too late to do anything regardless of any professional body and what they say . "
" My mandate as I sit here in this group is to make sure at the end of the day the 100,000,000 are immunized with DTP , Hepatitis B and if possible Hib , this year , next year and for many years to come , and that will have to be with Thimerosal containing vaccines unless a miracle occurs and an alternative is found quickly and is tried and found to be safe . "
" So I leave you with the challenge that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far , and that having got this far , how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed to the traps which are out there in public relations .
My message would be that any other study , and I like the study that has just been described here very much .
I think it makes a lot of sense , but it has to be thought through .
What are the potential outcomes and how will you handle it ?
How will it be presented to a public and media that is hungry for selecting the information they want to use for whatever means they in store for them ? " " … but I wonder how on earth you are going to handle it from here . "
Dr. Bernier , pg. 256 : " … As difficult as science is , there are two other equally tricky , complex challenges .
The policy crafting has to take into consideration some very diverse and complex issues .
There is another group that will deal with that , and then we have the communication and how we handle this , which I think I am no expert at , but seems equally daunting to me as the scientific and the policy issue . "
" I do n’t think we can set a rule here because some people have gotten these documents .
For example , some of the manufacturers were privileged to receive this information .
It has been important for them to share it within the company with the experts there , so they can review it .
Some of you may have questions .
You may have given a copy , but I think if we will all just consider this embargoed information , if I can use that term , and very highly protected information , I think that was the best I can offer .

We 've moved this topic over to the blog
Version 0.92.1 of the ultrasn0w unlock is meant for those with baseband 04.26.08 running on 4.0GM .
It does not use any new exploits , it merely fixes a logfile permission problem .
A new ultrasn0w capable of unlocking 4.0's baseband is n't yet released because both the final 4.0 and iPhone 4 are coming out next week .
Please be patient .
If you 're running baseband 04.26.08 on 4.0GM , you can install ultrasn0w by adding http://ios4.ultrasn0w.org to your Cydia source list ( do not use the repo666.ultrasn0w.com repo because that still has the older version 0.92 ) .
Note : ultrasn0w is spelled with a zero , not the letter “ o ” .
Once the hack is applied , it allows you to install cellphone Carrier Bundles that are n't officially signed by Apple .
This lets you , for instance , install a Carrier Bundle that allows you to use your iPhone as a way to connect your PC to the internet ( through your 3G cell connection ) .
Note that carriers may not like you tethering behind their back so you do so at your own risk .
For some excellent info on Carrier Bundles vs. mobileconfigs , along with a great generator , see http://www.volkspost.info/ipcc_fw3
( and talk about it here ) .
Another generator is available at http://www.benm.at/help/help.php .
If you 're in the USA and use AT&T , you can also just go to http://is.gd/8QYHa on your iPhone , install the mobileconfig , reboot , then turn on tethering in Settings →General →Network .
( You must apply the hack first , of course . )
Note :
If you 're not comfortable with the command line , it 's better to just wait for a friendlier ( hopefully free ) form of this hack Follow the instructions in the next section , but you 'll need different bsdiff files than for 3.1.2 .
For 3.1.3 , they 're here for the 3GS and here for the 3G
The correct SHA1 of the hacked file will be : 048df0ec4d672224cd1263fffb8095c2d55c30e3 # 3GS de67fc7b866890cb3e3d5ff520f21a3e7f6682ef # 3G
Do n't forget to make the new CommCenter executable !!
chmod +x / System / Library / PrivateFrameworks/CoreTelephony.framework/Support/CommCenter
Failure to do this will probably require a full restore to fix !
You can apply the IPPC tethering hack mentioned above .
A bsdiff patch to apply to CommCenter in 3.1.2 to re-enable tethering is available here for the 3GS and here for the 3G .
It 's just a 2 - byte patch as shown below ( and an appropriate readjusting of the mach - o's codesign hash ) : USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK !
Your carrier may end up charging you for unauthorized tethering access .
Update # 1
It looks like a lot of people have been looking at CommCenter lately because IRC user CleanAir had a similar tethering patch .
Meanwhile over in the 2G CommCenter , WhiteRat and geniusan have patched in native MMS support for that platform .
Kudos to CleanAir , WhiteRat , and geniusan for digging into CommCenter and coming up with patches !
Update # 2
A few tutorials have started to pop up .
Eventually this will be made a part of the normal PwnageTool flow but for now this is best left for the adventurous users out there !

sub_17538+8C 7E F0 FA EC BLX _syslog sub_17538+8C bsdiff patches are the normal way that PwnageTool modifies Apple software .
To apply one manually , you must first get the “ bspatch ” program .
Then do : bspatch CommCenter CommCenter - hacked CommCenter.patch
If you do n't have bsdiff but know how to use a hex editor , the differences are available here in text format .
The correct SHA1 of the hacked file will be : 1b19712035f33654cf72838ebe1a2033931b56b2 # 3GS 063165c3fa3e21d30eb4b486fab924ba3ef0ea5e # 3G
You would then remove the original program and replace it .
Do n't forget to ensure it has execute permission !
chmod +x / System / Library / PrivateFrameworks/CoreTelephony.framework/Support/CommCenter
After you 've started using the hacked CommCenter , visit http://www.benm.at/help/help.php from your iPhone and install a new mobileconfig .
If you 've restored to a custom IPSW created by PwnageTool and you no longer see your AT&T signal even though you 're a legit subscriber , you most likely answered the “ activation ” question incorrectly .
iPhone users who would normally activate through iTunes should not enable the “ Activate the phone ” setting in Expert mode ( General Settings ) .
You do n't want or need PwnageTool to activate your iPhone , since you 're a legitimate subscriber .
( In Simple mode , you would just tell PwnageTool that yes , you do have a contract that would activate normally through iTunes . )
If you answered the question wrong , just go back and create another custom IPSW .
Restore to that new IPSW with iTunes using Option - Restore ( or Shift - Restore in Windows ) and you 'll be good to go !
i Tunes 9 is a little more aggressive about firmware downgrades .
People have noticed that the moment you connect a device , iTunes 9 will remove all but the most recent firmware IPSWs from its cache of firmwares .
It will do this even if you are n't planning to update or restore .
Previously , it had let them remain and you could Option - Restore ( Mac ) or Shift - Restore ( Windows ) to them .
This is currently only a minor inconvenience though because iTunes wo n't go outside of its Library to hunt down and remove these IPSWs ( it could easily do this using Apple 's Spotlight technology ) .
But now is a good time to copy all your previous IPSWs out of the iTunes Library over to somewhere a bit more permanent .
On a Mac , the caches are at ~/ Library / iTunes / iPhone Software Updates and ~/ Library / iTunes / iPod Software Updates .
You 'll still be able to Option - and Shift - Restore to them in their new locations .
If you 've already connected a device to iTunes 9 , your older IPSWs may still be in your Trash , so copy them from there .
Updates : Right now this is looking like a Mac - only behavior
The auto - removal may also depend on whether you 've downloaded ( even if you have n't installed ) the 3.1 update

You 're at an open wireless hotspot , but you do n't want to send your web browsing data over it in plain text .
Or you want to visit a non -work - approved web page from the office computer without the IT team finding out .
Using a simple SSH command , you can encrypt all your web browsing traffic and redirect it through a trusted computer when you 're on someone else 's network .
Today we 'll set up a local proxy server that encrypts your online activity from your Mac , PC or Linux desktop .
Here 's how .
SS - wha ?
you ask .
Proxy server ?
Huh ?
Do n't let the intimidating words and acronyms scare you off .
This IS an advanced technique , but I 've got my pom-poms out , because you can totally do it .
Advertisement
Let 's get crackin' .
What you 'll need
An SSH server to act as your proxy .
" SSH server " sounds frightening , but it 's just another computer off - site that allows you to login into it via SSH .
Most web hosts allow SSH access to the server ; or you can set one up at home

How proxies work
In a nutshell , what you 're doing with a proxy is setting up a middle - person between you and the internet .
Using the proxy , your browser hands off web page requests to the proxy server , which handles the request and fetches the page for you from the internet .
The web site actually thinks the request is coming from the proxy server , not your computer , which is a good way to obscure your originating IP address .
Advertisement
Additionally , the connection between your computer and the proxy happens over SSH , an encrypted protocol .
This prevents wifi sniffers at the coffee shop from seeing what you 're doing online .
For the more visual readers in the house , a ( quick and dirty ) diagram :

Now let 's get down to the nitty - gritty .
Start your SSH tunnel
You 've got access to an SSH server and you want to start using it as your proxy .
To do so , you 're going to set up a " tunnel " which passes web traffic from your local machine to the proxy over SSH .
The command to do so is :
ssh -ND 9999 you@example.com
Of course , you 're going to replace the you with your username and example .com with your server domain name or IP address .
What that command does is hand off requests to localhost , port 9999 , to your server at example .com to handle .
Advertisement
When you execute that command , UPDATE : you 'll get prompted to enter your password .
Once you authenticate , nothing will happen .
The - N tells ssh not to open an interactive prompt , so it will just hang there , waiting .
That 's exactly what you want .
Set Firefox to use SOCKS proxy
Once your proxy 's up and running , configure Firefox to use it .
From Firefox 's Tools menu , choose Options , and from the Advanced section choose the Network tab .
Next to " Configure how Firefox connects to the Internet " hit the " Settings " button and enter the SOCKS information , which is the server name ( localhost ) and the port you used ( in the example above , 9999 . )
Advertisement
Save those settings and hit up a web page .
When it loads , it 's actually coming from the proxy server over an encrypted connection .
You 're golden !

More tips on using a secure proxy
To quickly start your proxy , set up a shortcut to a batch script that launches the SSH connection in a click .
If there are only certain ( NSFW ) web sites you 'd like to use your proxy for , the Foxy Proxy Firefox extension lets you switch between your proxy and direction connection on a per-site basis .
[ via Ubuntu blog ]
Alternately , you can set up a separate Firefox profile that uses your proxy for all web requests .
Set your proxy server to resolve DNS requests instead of your computer ; in Firefox 's about : config area , set network.proxy.socks_remote_dns = true. [ via codeblog ]
Will at Security . engine says :
For those with slower connections , you can use the - C command line option to use SSH 's compression ( gzip ) .

This technique is as old as the hills and there are dozens of different ways and tools to get it set up .
In fact , tons of Lifehacker readers have mentioned it in the comments of past posts already .
What 's your preferred method ?

Ten days ago , in a post titled Why I ’m Opting Out , I wrote this :
Today when I hear a publisher complaining about how books are sacred and how we need to protect the publishing industry , I ’m reminded of the same talk from news executives about how critical hard news and investigative journalism are to the health of our democracy .
Yet in both instances these are often the same people who are putting crap on the front page or front shelf , making crap physical products , and marketing the most sensationalistic crap they can get their hands on in the desperate hope that it can compete favorably with the crap on TV and the crap on the internet .
In the middle of writing that rant , however , I had a nagging feeling there was something else I did n’t respect about publishing .
Yesterday , after running across this story , I remembered what it was :
Less than three months after resigning as governor of Alaska , Sarah Palin , the onetime vice presidential candidate , has completed her memoir .
HarperCollins Publishers , which signed a multi-million dollar deal with Ms. Palin in May , said in a statement on Tuesday that it had moved up the publication date from the spring of 2010 to Nov. 17 of this year .
The book will be titled “ Going Rogue : An American Life ” ; the publisher has announced a first - print run of 1.5 million copies .
Ms. Palin worked with a collaborator , Lynn Vincent , the editor of World , an evangelical magazine .
To the publishing industry ’s determined self - abuses please add : lying about authorship , devaluing authorship and generally treating authorship like a rented mule .
Because I can think of no other industry where the practice of lying about authorship is so completely codified and accepted as it is in the publishing world — which , you might think , would be the last place that would tolerate such a thing .
And you might be right , except the publishing world is not genuinely concerned with ideas and authors , it ’s concerned with selling objects ( books , magazines , etc. ) .
To the extent that hyping specific authors is done at all , it ’s done to create bankable stars in the same way that Hollywood wants , needs and hates bankable stars because they attract customers .
In the publishing biz these stars might be literary stars ( proving the industry cares about artistic authors ) , or genre stars ( proving the publishing industry cares about entertainment authors ) , but in all cases the caring is ultimately sales - based , not author - based .
Proof of this , if it ’s needed , is found in the simple fact that when it makes sense to lie about authorship in order to increase sales , the entire publishing industry eagerly turns a blind eye .
Despite all the lip service about supporting writers and their careers , the meaning of authorship is routinely hacked off at the knees by publishers happy to put a fast buck ahead of integrity .
Again , the very people who insist that publishing is sacred are the same people who are now trying to create the impression that Sarah Palin wrote a 400 page book in four months .
But why would n’t they , when the publishing industry routinely gets a free pass on this sort of thing from both the press and the gossip - guzzling public .
Here ’s a typical bit of water - carrying from ABC News :
“ Gov. Palin has been unbelievably conscientious and hands - on at every stage , investing herself deeply and passionately in this project , ” Jonathan Burnham of HarperCollins told the Associated Press .
“ It ’s her words , her life and it ’s all there in full and fascinating detail . ”
The Christian Science Monitor , perhaps a bit more uncomfortable with promoting lies to its readers , presents their version of the same wire - service report this way :
“ Governor Palin has been unbelievably conscientious and hands - on at every stage , investing herself deeply and passionately in this project , ” says Jonathan Burnham , publisher of Harper .
“ It ’s her words , her life , and it ’s all there in full and fascinating detail . ”
Palin has also had the help of ghostwriter Lynn Vincent .
To be fair to ABC News they do note later :
While in San Diego , according to AP , Palin collaborated with Lynn Vincent , an author and features editor for World magazine , a conservative Christian publication .
Vincent ’s titles include “ Same Kind of Different as Me , ” “ The Blood of Lambs ” and “ Donkey Cons : Sex , Crime and Corruption in the Democratic Party . ”
So it ’s her book , all in her own words , but she collaborated with someone else .
Wink wink .
Apparently unnerved by this bit of candor , the ABC story rushes back to the Palin - as - author narrative ( irony intended ) in the next paragraph , reminding readers that this collaboration does not mean she did not exert herself mightily :
Once the manuscript was complete , Palin then reportedly spent several intense days in New York working with her editors at HarperCollins .
Powerful stuff .
And also double - duty fraud .
First , the intent of that graph is to get readers to believe that Palin was ‘ intensely working on the manuscript ’ , when what she was probably intensely working on was a double - secret plan to combine PR - driven hype with a juicy talk - show - circuit revelation just as the book is getting ready to hit store shelves .
Second , note the inclusion of the word ‘ editors ’ in the quote : as if an actual editor was working on the manuscript with Palin herself in the room .
Because I ’m betting nothing like that actually happened , or came close to happening .
In fact , if Palin , anyone with content - editing experience , and a copy of her manuscript were all in the same room at any one time I would be shocked .
And note that no one at HarperCollins , publisher of Palin ’s book and subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch ’s global media empire News Corp. , needs to call anyone at ABC News , which is owned by CapCities ABC , or online tabloids like The Huffington Post , and ask them to minimize the question of authorship .
( If you ’re wondering why the press — by which I do not mean the hard - news press but rather the celebrity - sells press — is interested in perpetuating this kind of fraud on behalf of fake authors , it ’s because the celebrity - sells press knows that good clean non-fishy celebrities sell best .
Pointing out that a celebrity is also a liar tends to diminish a celebrity ’s status , so the celebrity - selling press tends to avoid such things .
At least until it ’s time to tear the person down brick by brick because the iconic stuff stopped selling . )
This kind of fraud has become so institutionalized in our pop-culture brains that everyone knows the one thing they are not supposed to say is the obvious : that Sarah Palin did not write the book that will be coming out with her name on it .
( Will Palin ’s book include shared credit with her collaborator ?
I do n’t know , but I hope so .
What I do know is that HarperCollins does n’t think anyone but Sarah Palin wrote the book . )
But I digress .
And you know all this anyway , do n’t you ?
My point is not that the publishing industry would change even if it was asked to change .
It ’s actually that the publishing industry is never going to change .
Which is why the nascent online / independent / self - publishing industry needs to take a clear stand against ghostwriting .
Let me stress that this is not a moral argument , but rather a practical one .
Independent authors need to establish credibility .
It ’s the key component that will allow consumers to move away from chain - driven , brand - driven points of purchase to less centralized forms of distribution .
And yes , I recognize the paradox : the bookstores are already happy to sell this kind of fraud , so why ca n’t online authors engage in the same sort of duplicity ?
The answer is that online authors need to err on the side of honesty and integrity in order to support not only their own work , but the internet as both a medium and distribution platform .
If it only takes one James Frey to blow up an entire budding literary genre , it will only take one fraudulent online success story to taint all online / independent authors with fraud .
I think many of the early fraudulent fiction blogs and character blogs — written either by people pretending to be someone else or by corporations looking to exploit intellectual property and brands — undermined that medium before it could become established .
It ’s a literary form that I ’m particularly interested in , but it ’s also clear that the promise of the form was cut short in part by uncertainty about who was writing what , and whether or not the content was ‘ real ’ .
Speaking of frauds , do you remember Milli Vanilli ?
They ’re a Grammy - winning singing duo who had to give their Grammy back when it was revealed that the people singing the Grammy - winning song were n’t the stage - act duo who accepted the award .
C+C Music
Factory got into the same kind of hot water when they replaced a full - figured singer on one of their hit songs with a shapely non-singer for that song ’s music video .
If this kind of fraud is not okay in the music biz — the music biz ! — why is it okay in the culturally - sacred publishing industry ?
Celebrities ( and everyone else ) should write their own books or acknowledge that someone else wrote or helped write their books .
It ’s the height of absurdity and hypocrisy that ghostwriting is still happening , and I think it ’s something the online / independent - author community should publicly repudiate .
To be clear , I have nothing against ghostwriters per se .
I even understand the value in a non-commercial environment — say , when a speech is ghostwritten by staff for a politician who simply does n’t have enough hours in the day .
But in that instance ghostwriting does n’t devalue politicians or speechwriters because nobody ’s claiming or denying authorship in exchange for cash .
( Wait for it : I come back to the politicians . )
I also want to say here that I seem to be seeing more celebrity books these days which include an “ As told to ” or “ With ” credit naming the person who did the heavy literary lifting .
Given that most people assume celebrity authors ( including politicians ) are using ghostwriters , why not do away with the practice entirely ?
There ’s no downside to anyone , except the celebrity who really is trying to profit by passing themselves off as the author of the work .
Are n’t those the people we most want to stop ?
Back to Sarah Palin , is taking credit for something you did n’t do what we want from people who aspire to leadership positions in our society ?
Are n’t politicians the last people we want lying about what they wrote ?
In the 1988 presidential race Joe Biden rightly got into serious trouble for plagiarism and serial exaggeration about his academic accomplishments , driving him from that contest .
And what is ghostwriting to a politician if not custom plagiarism before the fact ?
Note , too , that we all get something in return for abolishing ghostwriting .
All writers will be respected more because the craft will be respected more .
And any celebrity ( including politicians ) who does not use a ghostwriter will attain more respect for having written the text on their own .
During the last presidential election cycle I can still remember pundits and reporters saying , almost incredulously , that Barack Obama was known to have actually authored the books that had his name on them .
Apart from his politics , did n’t that say something meaningful about the man ?
( And does n’t the incredulity of the press say something about how commonly ghostwriting is used to deceive the voting public , and how willing the press is to participate in that fraud because it helps sell politicians as celebrities ? )
Back to practicalities .
To what extent could the online community outlaw ghostwriting ?
How effective could it be at preventing this sort of lying from becoming accepted on the web ?
I actually think this could be done with only a few committed opinion leaders , provided those opinion leaders do n’t also have a vested interest in the economics of the various new publishing models .
The more likely leaders will be found among writers themselves , as well as in the online reviewing class which will grow over time .
If the response to ghostwriting from these people is a flat assertion that the person claiming ownership is a fraud , I think that might carry some weight — in the same way that independent online voices have attained influence in arenas such as politics and business .
In any case , the goal remains simple .
We need to grow consumer confidence in independent authors by treating authorship as something meaningful rather than economically expedient .
The best way to do that is to protect the online / self - publishing / indy - author brand by self - policing and calling out ghostwriting when it rears its ugly head .
Ghostwriting is lying , and it ’s the kind of lying that devalues every author .
It ’s time to give up the ghost .

I was surprised by one line in Walt Mossberg 's otherwise predictable review of Mac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard :
" But here 's a tip : Apple concedes that the $ 29 Snow Leopard upgrade will work properly on these Tiger - equipped Macs , so you can save the extra $ 140 . "

I know Apple 's PR people are having a heart attack right now reading that .
They do n't like it when influential journalists suggest violations of the EULA .
In fact , they generally label that stuff as " illegal , " and I am sure many lawyers would agree that it is .
So , is this Mossberg ripping open his shirt , tying a bandana around his head and saying , " Ahoy mateys , the rules were meant to be keel - hauled ! "
Or is this a slip - up he 's going to have to apologize for — or at least qualify with an explanation — in the morning ?
Is it a great tip , or is he telling every Tiger user to steal $ 140 out of the mouth of Steve Jobs ?
We 'll keep an eye out for the answer .

Grayson DEMOLISHED this tactic .
And he did so by continuing to tell the truth and never backing down .
And by the end of the week , many were joining him .
Yes , they said : why does the GOP have no plan for health care ?
Why have they allowed thousands to die for a lack of coverage for years without articulating any strategy to deal with the crisis ?
Why would Republicans try to make an example of Grayson when their members have been using vile language for months , slandering the health care legislation with lies about " death panels " and rationing and people " being put to death by their government , " in the words of Virginia Foxx ?
How could Republicans think there is no crisis in health care when so many are dying ?
In a second , this has become the narrative of the week on health care .
And Alan Grayson led the way .
He just might lead the Congress to a better bill .
The other positive from Grayson 's splash on the national scene this week is that he just moved to the top of every rollodex in the traditional media .
He has a higher profile for the issues he has been working on in Congress , mostly the great story of our time , the destruction of the economic system by financial and corporate elites .
Grayson has been a leader in the movement to audit the Federal Reserve and bring accountability to Wall Street .
He has also seized on the right 's phony ACORN gambit by extending their bill to defund companies who have committed fraud and applying it to government contractors like weapons producers , who have consistently defrauded the government for decades .
When the House of Representatives went after federal funding for the community - organizing group ACORN last week , the bill as written also affected " any organization " that had been involved in a wide range of fraudulent activity and other bad behavior .
On Friday , Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) inserted into the " legislative history " language spelling out that including all fraudulent organizations was , in fact , the intent of the Congress .
Meanwhile , he has been asking citizens to suggest specific companies which would be targeted by the anti-fraud language and provide evidence for the claim .
The list has grown several pages long .
The names of those organizations will be submitted into the congressional record next week .
" The purpose of this bill is to cleanse federal contracting and grant - making , completely and permanently .
The purpose is to put an end to the invidious practice of rewarding those who steal taxpayer money by giving them more taxpayer money , " writes Grayson .
" The bill imposes , and is intended to impose , a corporate death penalty on contractors who fall within the scope of its prohibitions . "
Brave New Films celebrates Alan Grayson 's contribution to the debate , and for showing the Democratic Party how to fight , with this video .
Let Rep. Grayson know you have his back .
And join the I heart Grayson Facebook group .
He really deserves the attention he 's getting .
In today 's world of instant global communication , disagreements happen more quickly and resentments get established in real time .
Just as the British and Americans have been called two nations divided by a common language , today we all share the Internet , yet we are divided by the instant communicating that digital technology makes possible .

Why did he offer the British peace , twice , after Poland fell , and again after France fell ?
Why , when Paris fell , did Hitler not demand the French fleet , as the Allies demanded and got the Kaiser 's fleet ?
Why did he not demand bases in French - controlled Syria to attack Suez ?
Why did he beg Benito Mussolini not to attack Greece ?

( CNN ) --
At least one member of the jury that sentenced Cameron Todd Willingham to death in the arson homicides of his three children says she is struggling with the idea that she might have convicted an innocent man .
A family photo shows Cameron Todd Willingham with his wife , Stacy , and daughters Kameron , Amber and Karmon .
It has been 17 years since Willingham was convicted in Texas of setting a house fire that killed his children , a crime Willingham vehemently denied right up until his execution in 2004 .
Since that time , three investigations have concluded arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire , including one that arrived in Texas Gov. Rick Perry 's office 88 minutes before the scheduled execution .
Perry replaced four of nine members of the Texas Forensics Sciences Commission in recent weeks , just before the commission was to receive a report from the latest of the three investigations .
The controversy has led juror Dorenda Brokofsky to think twice about the decision she made in a jury room in 1992 .
" I do n't sleep at night because of a lot of this , " Brokofsky said .
" I have gone back and forth in my mind trying to think of anything that we missed .
I do n't like the fact that years later someone is saying maybe we made a mistake , that the facts are n't what they could 've been . "
Brokofsky spoke with CNN by phone from her Midwest home .
She has long since moved away from tiny Corsicana , Texas , where the fire took place .
" I do have doubts now , " she said .
" I mean , we can only go with what we knew at the time , but I do n't like the fact now that maybe this man was executed by our word because of evidence that is not true .
It may not be true now .
And I do n't like the fact that I may have to face my God and explain what I did . "
" When you 're sitting there with all those facts , there was nothing else we could see , " she said .
" Now I do n't know .
I can't tell you he 's innocent , I can't say 100 percent he 's guilty . "
Brokofsky had another revelation .
She said she thought she would be excluded from the jury because of her family 's close relationship with key witness and then - Corsicana Assistant Fire Chief Douglas Fogg .
Her father was also a fire marshal for eight years before the Willingham fire .
" I was raised with my father being a fire marshal , " she said .
" He went around proving that stuff , so he was n't here at that time .
But I knew Doug Fogg , who was one of the witnesses .
It was no secret , but I did n't think they would pick me as a juror because of it . "
Critics say Perry 's recent actions to shake up the commission were politically motivated , a charge he denies .
Perry 's office said it received a five - page fax on the day of the execution that contained an arson expert 's findings that the fire was not deliberately set .
It is unclear whether Perry read the fax .
" Given the brevity of the report and the general counsel 's familiarity with all the other facts in the case , there was ample time for the general counsel to read and analyze the report and to brief the governor on its contents , " Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle said .
Willingham was executed less than two hours later .
Death - penalty opponents say an impartial review of Willingham 's case could lead to an unprecedented admission -- that the state executed an innocent man .
The latest report concluded that the arson ruling at the heart of Willingham 's conviction " could not be sustained " by modern science or the standards of the time .
Perry said he remains confident Willingham was guilty , as do authorities in Corsicana , south of Dallas , who prosecuted Willingham .
Willingham 's wife 's brother , Ronnie Kuykendall , said in a signed affidavit that Stacy Willingham told her family that Todd Willingham confessed to killing the children during her visit to him on death row a few days before the execution .
But Stacy Willingham testified for her husband during his trial , while her family argued he was guilty .
CNN could not reach her for comment .
Even Willingham 's defense attorney , David Martin , remains confident his client committed the crime .
" There was no question whatsoever that he was guilty , " Martin said on CNN's " AC360 " Thursday night .
Watch defense attorney say client was guilty »
Martin slammed the most recent report on the Willing ham case , by Maryland arson expert Craig Beyler , as " one of the least objective reports I 've ever read . "
On Thursday , Perry also lambasted the Beyler report as having " a very politically driven agenda " and being propaganda for the anti-death penalty movement .
Beyler , asked about Perry 's statements , said they were " strange and clueless . "

The study by the Waste and Resources Acton Programme ( WRAP ) found half of the good food thrown out for council collection was whole and uneaten , with one in seven items still in their packaging .
At least £ 18 million worth of the latter was still within its ‘use by ’ or ‘ best before ’ date .
Based on a survey of 1,169 homes across Scotland , the most common items thrown away were milk ( 31,000 tonnes ) , sliced bread ( 25,000 tonnes ) , fizzy drinks ( 23,000 tonnes ) , potatoes ( 19,000 tonnes ) and ready meals or snacks ( 14,000 tonnes ) , said the body .
In addition , 96,000 tonnes of fresh fruit and vegetables were binned .
Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said : “ I 'm sure most people would agree that it 's shocking to think that society needlessly wastes £ 1 billion of food each year in Scotland .
As well as the financial strain on households , the equivalent of £ 8 to £ 10 a week , food and packaging add considerably to our waste stream .
“ Food waste is one of many issues currently being addressed in the Government ’s draft Zero Waste Plan , which I would urge people to have their say on .
The Plan is about everyone making smarter day - to - day choices that will take us further down the road towards becoming a zero waste society . ”
Look up from your phone to give your back and neck the attention they deserve .

Talk about the pot calling the kettle black but is seems that George Bush does n’t have that much regard for President Obama .
In an interview in GQ the ex-president ’s former speechwriter , Matt Latimer , talks about his book – Speech Less : Tales of a White House Survivor – and some of the more interesting tidbits to do with George Bush .
Among them was this one about Barack Obama
Bush Did n’t Have Much Regard for Barack Obama : Continuing his assessment of Obama , Bush remarked , “ This guy has no clue , I promise you . ” [….]
Another time , talking about candidate Barack Obama , Bush said , “ This is a dangerous world , and this cat is n’t remotely qualified to handle it . ”
Source : Daily Intel – Ten Things We Learned About George W. Bush From His Ex-Speechwriter
As well he seem to think that Hillary Clinton was fat
Latimer writes : “ ‘ Wait till her fat keister is sitting at this desk , ’ [ Bush ] once said ( except he did n’t say ‘ keister ’ ) . ”
I ’m betting that keister was n’t the actual word to describe Hillary ’s derrière .
Barack Obama 's opponents view defeating healthcare reform as their ticket to recapturing power , with one Republican Senator infamously declaring that it would be the president 's " Waterloo " .
Efforts by Republicans to feign interest in real reform by seeking to slow the progress of the bill or start over are nothing more than thinly veiled efforts to undermine the scope of reform and preserve the status quo .
As a result of this increasingly polarised political landscape , Democrats are now signalling that they may pass part of the healthcare bill without Republican support by splitting the bill into two more manageable pieces .
The first part would include insurance reform and could be passed with broader approval .
The second , more controversial bill would involve substantive reform and may include a government - run " public option " or nonprofit cooperative that would compete with private insurers .
Passing the more contentious part of reform would require using a budget device called " reconciliation " that would enable the bill to pass by simple majority rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster .
Talk of using reconciliation has Republicans crying foul , calling it the " nuclear option " , as well as an " end run " around the democratic process .
It 's difficult to take seriously protests that are so clearly hypocritical in the face of years of strong - arm Republican legislative tactics that used this same same tool on at least four occasions involving tax cuts and oil drilling .
Moreover , George Bush 's Senate allies once denounced the filibuster as the " formula for tyranny by the minority " and downplayed reconciliation as simply the " constitutional option " .
If ever there was a time in our history important enough to consider using such a tool , it is fighting to ease the suffering of our fellow citizens .
The healthcare town hall meetings where angry Republicans compare Obama to Hitler represent why this is a difficult issue .
The larger problem is that it 's difficult to make all the important players in the process happy when many of them have mutually exclusive positions .
The American Medical Association , pharmaceutical companies , insurance companies and hospital groups are not all on the same page .
Consensus - building will not only water down any final bill but it will benefit the few at the expense of many .
The fact that reconciliation lowers the threshold for passing legislation does not mean it's an undemocratic tool , particularly in a situation where the process is the enemy .
There 's nothing democratic about requiring a supermajority of 60 votes to pass a bill .
Moreover , it may even be somewhat generous to say reconciliation permits an up or down vote .
Passing a bill by simple majority would still require that legislation survive numerous committees in both the Senate and the House , conference committees to reconcile different versions of the bill in each chamber and a final conference committee between both chambers .
At each chokepoint in the legislative process , legislation can be killed before it 's ever given an up or down vote on the floor .
The filibuster is nothing more than an informal rule which is often used to stand in the way of progress , such as in 1957 when Strom Thurmond attempted to block the Civil Rights Act .
Reconciliation , while procedurally nothing more than a form of sleight of hand , is substantively a democratic idea .
Obama and his democratic allies won the election in no small measure because he ran on healthcare reform with a public option .
He was unsuccessfully attacked many times for being a " socialist " , so to label the current healthcare proposal as such is nothing more than a second bite at the electoral apple .
Healthcare reform is n't about bringing the country together .
It 's about making good on a promise to change this country for the better .
The president 's opponents do not fight for the sake of their ideals , but for political advantage and a handful of powerful corporations fighting to keep profits made on the backs of the sick and dying .
This debate is full of passion , but now is the time to assert the political influence the American people gave Democrats in 2008 .
When the dust settles and the talk of " death panels " has subsided , Democrats and Republicans will be judged on election day by a simple majority of their constituents , nothing more and nothing less .
Using reconciliation in the healthcare debate simply provides that same fairness for members of Congress representing the American people .

Spend an afternoon as a meat puppet , fucking for money in a rotating meth - brothel !
Eat Japanese take - out !
" " The Authentic World of Peter Matthiessen " " Inspired by Peter Matthiessen 's National Book Award winning novel " Shadow Country , " Universal Studios has taken a beautiful Florida island and done absolutely nothing to it .
See nothing but an authentic Florida island , complete with the bones of the tourists who were here the week before .
Walk around in the goddamn wilderness getting bit by mosquitoes and attacked by snakes .
Try not to go crazy as you are pistol - whipped , verbally abused , and forced to cut sugar cane in order to buy your passage OFF the island .
Get drunk .
Make some illegitimate children .
Whatever .
You ai n't leaving .
" " The Tedious World of Marcel Proust " " Inspired by Marcel Proust 's " Remembrance of Things Past , " each one of these seven islands has been lovingly recreated to showcase your favorite events from his epic work of painstaking modernism .
This completely immersive environment will transcend generations and bring the wonder and magic of Marcel Proust 's amazingly detailed books to life .
Take lots of candid pictures of your chauffer , because you 'll want to " remember " your vacation again and again and again ... " " DickensWorld "
... actually exists !
But it will probably close down soon due to lack of interest .
Also , " The Wizarding World of Harry Potter " most likely poached all the furniture and actors from DickensWorld over the summer and is bribing officials to get them work visas for opening day right this very second .
So what I am saying is ... Guantanamo Bay + DickensWorld + Hell / Humanity = " The Wizarding World of Harry Potter ! " Spring 2010 !

Words can hardly convey how vicious , how over the top , Mexico ’s drug war has become .
So they invented some .
The Mexican media now have a special expression for being lined up and shot , and another for being dumped in the trunk of a car ( we ’ll get to these ) .
There are also terms for mafia kidnappings , for drug - gang spies and for the hand - scrawled notes hit men leave with the bodies of their victims .
The lingo is grim , but how else to portray such savagery as beheadings and bodies cut up and cooked in acid ?
Herewith a partial , and macabre , narco - glossary :
Levanton : the kidnapping of one or more members of a rival gang , or other enemy .
Unlike traditional kidnappings , the point is not ransom , but to torture and kill a foe .
Victims of a multiple levanton may end up fusilados .
Fusilados : from the Spanish word for rifle , to be executed in the style of a firing squad , or with a shot to the head , known as a tiro de gracia .
This occurred in an attack at a Ciudad Juarez drug - treatment clinic in early September .
Encajuelado : Based on the word for “ trunk , ” a body dumped in the trunk of a car .
This is a common method for disposing of victims of a drug hit .
Often , the bodies are bound and gagged with packing tape or are encobijados , wrapped in blankets .
Sometimes they are accompanied by a handwritten narcomensaje .
Narcomensaje : A scrawled drug message , often rambling or peppered with misspellings .
Such missives are typically meant to threaten rival drug cartels or government security forces .
Messages sometimes take the form of banners , known as narcomantas , and are hung from bridges or in other public places to demonstrate a gang ’s audacity .
Plaza :
Not the quaint public square you see in nearly every Mexican town , but rather any defined drug marketplace , such as a smuggling point .
Much of the violence since December 2006 , when President Felipe Calderon declared war on drug cartels , is due to fighting among gangs over coveted plazas , or turf , including street - level sales taking place in tienditas .
Tiendita :
Any place where drugs are sold in small quantities on the street -- a house , apartment building or even a little store .
Tienditas , or “ little stores , ” play a big role in what Mexican officials say is a worrisome increase in domestic drug use and addiction in Mexico , which once served mainly as a pipeline to the United States with little local consumption .
Halcones :
To guard strongholds , trafficking groups rely on a network of street - level informants -- taxi drivers , fruit vendors , teen boys -- known as halcones , or falcons .
Halcones provide early warning of the arrival of federal police or soldiers that have been dispatched around Mexico as part of Calderon ’s drug war .
Cuerno de chivo : “ Goat horn , ” nickname for the AK - 47 assault rifle , a favorite of cartel gunmen .
The name refers to the curved shape of the magazine .
Hit men are increasingly making use of even more powerful weapons , including .50 - caliber machine guns and 40 - millimeter grenade launchers .
Authorities also report a rise in the use of potent pistols , able to fire through body armor , that are known here as matapolicias , or cop killers .
Narco - ( anything ) :
It ’s handy for headline writers and coiners of terms that narco combines with almost any noun .
Alone , narco can refer to a trafficker or the entire illegal drug trade , as in , “ The government ’s war against el narco . ”
A little creativity yields narco - fiestas ( opulent , drug - laden parties featuring foreign dancers or big- name musical groups ) , narco - zoologicos ( narco-zoos , collections of exotic animals that , for some reason , are collectors ’ items for traffickers ) and narco - candidatos ( politicians reputed to be in cahoots with drug gangs ) .
Attorneys who defend suspected capos are narco - abogados , or narco - lawyers .
Narco - policias are cops on the take .
And representing the drug war ’s next generation : Narcojuniors , the well - heeled children of traffickers accused of helping run the criminal enterprises .

Trees are everywhere .
I do n’t mean the green , woody variety .
I mean the peculiar ones invented by programmers that have their root somewhere in the clouds and branch downwards .
As inevitably as apples fall from trees on the heads of meditating physicists , so coders find themselves writing code to traverse tree structures .
In an earlier post we explored the tree created by the UI Automation API representing all the widgets on the Windows desktop .
One very common tree - traversal operation is finding a particular child several nodes down from a root starting point .
I gave the example of locating the Paint .
Net drawing canvas within the main window of the application :
// find the Paint . Net drawing Canvas var canvas = mainWindow.FindDescendentByIdPath( new [ ]
{ " appWorkspace " , " workspacePanel " , " DocumentView " , " panel " , " surfaceBox " } ) ;
What we have here is an extension method , FindDescendentByIdPath , that starts from a parent element and works its way down through the tree , at each level picking out the child with the given Automation Id .
In my last post , I skipped over my implementation of this method , but it deserves a closer look because of the way it uses Functional techniques and LINQ to traverse the hierarchy .
So here it is :
public static AutomationElement FindDescendentByIdPath ( this AutomationElement element , IEnumerable < string > idPath ) { var conditionPath = CreateConditionPathForPropertyValues( AutomationElement.AutomationIdProperty , idPath. Cast < object >( ) ) ; return FindDescendentByConditionPath ( element , conditionPath ) ; } public static IEnumerable < Condition > CreateConditionPathForPropertyValues( AutomationProperty property , IEnumerable < object > values ) { var conditions = values .
Select ( value => new PropertyCondition ( property , value ) ) ; return conditions .
Cast < Condition >( ) ; } public static AutomationElement FindDescendentByConditionPath ( this AutomationElement element , IEnumerable < Condition > conditionPath ) { if ( !conditionPath .Any ( ) ) { return element ; } var result = conditionPath .
Aggregate ( element , ( parentElement , nextCondition ) => parentElement == null ? null : parentElement.FindChildByCondition(nextCondition ) ) ; return result ; }
The first thing we do is convert the sequence of Automation
Id strings into a sequence of Conditions ( actually PropertyConditions ) that the UI Automation API can use to pick out children of parent elements .
This is handled for us by the CreateConditionPathForProperty Values method in line 8 .
The actual method of interest is FindDescendentByConditionPath , starting in line 15 .
Here we put the Enumerable .
Aggregate method to a slightly unconventional use .
Considered in the abstract , the Aggregate method takes elements from a sequence one by one and performs an function ( of your choice ) to combine the element with the previous result ; the very first element is combined with a seed value .
In this case the seed value is the parent element at the top of tree , the sequence of elements is the list of conditions that we use to pick out the child at each level of the tree .
And we provide a lambda function that , each time it is called , takes the element it found in the previous iteration , together with the next condition from the list and uses an extension method that I demonstrated in the earlier blog post , FindChildByCondition , to find the appropriate child .
I ’ve found this method a great help when monkeying around in UI Automation trees .
If you think you might , look for it in the the source code from last time .
Puzzles can help develop your intuition -- figuring how to navigate a grid helped me understand combinations and permutations .
Suppose you 're on a 4 × 6 grid , and want to go from the bottom left to the top right .
How many different paths can you take ?
Avoid backtracking -- you can only move right or up .
Spend a few seconds thinking about how you 'd figure it out .
Insight : Convert Pictures To Text
When considering the possible paths ( tracing them out with your finger ) , you might whisper " Up , right , up , right ... " .
Why not write those thoughts down ?
Using " u " and " r " we can write out a path :
r r r r r r r u u u u
That is , go all the way right ( 6 r's ) , then all the way up ( 4 u's ) .
The path in the diagram would be :
r r r r u u u u r r
Using the text interpretation , the question becomes " How many ways can we re-arrange the letters rrrrrruuuu ? "
Ah , the ubiquitous combination / permutation problem -- never thought it'd be useful , eh ?
Understanding Combinations And Permutations
There 's several ways to see combination and permutation problems .
Once the first explanation clicks , we can go back and see it a different way .
When trying to build math intuition for a problem , I imagine several mental models circling a core idea .
Starting with one insight , I work around to the others .
Approach 1 : Start The Same
Instead of having 6 rights at 4 ups , imagine we start with 10 rights ( r r r r r r r r r r ) .
Clearly this wo n't do : we need to change 4 of those rights into ups .
How many ways can we pick 4 rights to change ?
Well , we have 10 choices for the first ' right ' to convert ( see the combinations article ) .
And 9 for the second , 8 for the third , and 7 choices for the final right - to - up conversion .
There are 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 = 10 !/6 ! = 5040 possibilities .
But , wait !
We need to remove the redundancies : after all , converting moves # 1 # 2 # 3 and # 4 ( in that order ) is the same as converting # 4 # 3 # 2 # 1 . We have 4 ! ( 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 ) ways to rearrange the ups we picked , so we finally get :
We 're just picking the items to convert ( 10 ! /6 ! ) and dividing out the redundancies ( 4 ! ) .
Approach 2 : Just Use the Combination Formula
Halfway through that explanation , you might have realized we were recreating the combination formula :
That 's the shortcut when you know order does n't matter .
However , sometimes I 'm not sure whether I need a permutation or combination from the outset .
While saying " Just use C( 10,4 ) " may be accurate , it 's not helpful as a teaching tool .
Sometimes it helps to re-create the situation on your own .
Approach 3 : Start Different
Here 's another approach : instead of letting each r and u be interchangeable , label the ' right ' moves r1 to r6 , and the ' up ' moves u1 to u4 .
How many ways can we re-arrange these 10 items ?
This question is easy : 10 ! = 3,628,800 ( wow , big number ) .
We have 10 choices for the 1st move , 9 for the second , and so on , until we have 2 choices for the 9th and only 1 for the last .
Cool .
Of course , we know that " r1 r2 u1 u2 " is the same path as " r2 r1 u2 u1 " .
We can shuffle the r's and u's in their own subgroups and the path will stay the same .
How many ways can we shuffle all 10 ?
10 ! = 3,628,800
How many ways can we shuffle 6 r's ?
6 ! = 720
How many ways can we shuffle 4 u's ?
4 ! = 24
So , we start with the total number of possibilities ( 10 ! = 3,628,800 ) and divide out the cases where we shuffle the r's ( 6 ! = 720 ) and the u's ( 4 ! = 24 ) :
Neat !
It 's cool seeing the same set of multiplications and divisions in different ways , just by regrouping them .
Why is this useful ?
One goal is to learn how problems can be transformed .
Remember that painting of the old lady & young woman ?
Do you see both ?
Can you switch between them ?
Is n't that cool ?
Part of the fun of the grid - path puzzle is seeing how to look at a problem using a visual or text metaphor .
The more math you learn , the more models you have available , and you can turn problems into each other .
This does n't have to be " practical " -- it 's fun to see how listing out paths can be be done simply using letters on paper .
In math lingo , problems which can be converted to each other are " isomorphic " .
Mathematically , they may be the same -- but from a human perspective , one may be easier than the other ( like seeing the old woman or young woman first ) .
For the grid puzzle , we used each perspective where comfortable :
Visualizing the grid to understand the general problem and see a single path .
to understand the general problem and see a single path .
Write the paths as text to see the general format of all paths & an easy method to enumerate them
And that 's the key lesson :
It 's completely fine to use one model to understand the idea , and another to work out the details .
Math becomes difficult when we think there 's only one way to approach it .
Variations and Extensions
Now that we 've been building our mental models , let 's tackle some harder problems .
Imagine your " grid " is actually in 3 dimensions .
This is harder to draw , but the text representation keeps on working .
Let 's say we have a cube ( x , y and z dimensions ) that is 5 units long on each side .
How many paths are there from one corner to its opposite ?
Hrm .
In this case , I might try the second approach , where we listed out all the possibilities .
Assume we label each move differently : we have 5 uniquely - labeled moves of each type ( x1 - x5 , y1 - y5 , z1 - z5 ) .
We can arrange these in 15 !
ways ( it 's huge : 1.3 trillion ) .
But , we need to remember to divide out the redundancies for each dimension .
There are 5 ! ways to rearrange the 5 identical motions in each direction , and we divide them out :
Wow , that 's huge number of paths on a small cube !
Earlier today you 'd have trouble with the question -- I know I would have .
But starting with the grid example and converting it to text , we 've beefed up our model to handle 3 dimensions .
Paths in four , five or 10-d should be no problem .
Redefining The Problem
Here 's the fun part : instead of changing how we see the solution , why not change the problem ?
What else could " Find paths on a grid " represent ?
Trap platform :
Let 's say you 're making a set of trapdoors 4 × 6 , with only 1 real path through ( the others drop you into a volcano ) .
What are the chances someone randomly walks through ?
With a 4×6 it 's 210 , as before .
With a 12 ×12 grid it 's 24!/12!12 ! = 2.7 million paths , with only 1 correct one .
Order of operations :
Suppose you have 10 sets of exercises to do : 4 identical leg exercises , and 6 identical arm exercises .
How many different routines can you pick ?
This is the same as navigating the path , except the axis labels are " legs " and " arms " instead of " right " and " up " .
Random walk .
Suppose we know an object moves randomly up or right .
What 's the chance it hits our desired endpoint after 10 steps ?
Well , there are 2^10 = 1024 ways to move up or right ( pick " u " or " r " 10 times ) , and 210 ways to get to our exact destination .
Therefore , you can expect to hit our spot 210 / 1024 = 20.5 % of the time !
Here 's a calculator to play with a few variations :
Onward and Upward
Puzzles are a fun way to learn new mental models , and deepen your understanding for the ones you 're familiar with .
While I might " know " combinations and permutations , it 's not until I recognize them in the wild do I feel really comfortable .
Ideas do no good sitting inside your head like artifacts in a museum -- they need to be taken out and played with .
Happy math .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Citigroup Inc C.N is expected to be fined $ 600,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority over derivatives transactions that helped foreign clients avoid taxes on dividends , a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday .
The fine is expected to be announced on Monday , the source said , declining to be identified because it is not yet public .
The development comes as governments around the world crack down on tax evasion as they look to close widening budget gaps fueled by economic weakness .
The centerpiece of the U.S. tax recovery effort has been its legal case against Swiss banking giant UBS AG UBSN .

About Mi Islita
Mi Islita ( my little island ) started in 2001 as an informational site focused on information retrieval , search engine , and seo technologies .
In 2014 , the site transitioned to a bilingual search engine focused on products and services from Puerto Rico , and its legacy content and core technology were transferred to Minerazzi.com .
About Puerto Rico
Known as The Island of Enchantment ( La Isla del Encanto ) , Puerto Rico ( Borikén , Borinquen ) is a beautiful archipelago of small paradisiac islands and cays .
Located in the Caribbean , the main island is less than three flight hours from Florida .
Puerto Rico is the home of reggaeton ( Daddy Yankee ) , trap ( Bad Bunny ) , and salsa music ( Hector LaVoe , r.i.p. ) pioneers , as well as the home of world - class artists , athletes , and scientists .
Puerto Rico's Statehood
After the 1898 Spanish - American War , Puerto Rico became an unincorporated U.S. territory , and a de facto U.S. colony .
In 1900 , a civilian government was established by means of the Foraker Law .
In March 2 , 1917 , the U.S. Congress passed the Jones - Shafroth Act , also known as the Jones Act of 1917 , and the Puerto Rican Federal Relations
Act of 1917 , which extended American citizenship to all Puerto Rican citizens , but no federal voting rights .
A different kind of Jones Act was passed in June 5 , 1920 , the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 , also known as the Cabotage Law and the Jones Act of 1920 , which since then has increased the living costs in Puerto Rico , by requiring that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried on U.S. - flag ships , constructed in the United States , owned by U.S. citizens , and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents .
The 1917 and 1920 Jones Acts were signed by racist President Woodrow Wilson , with both negatively impacting Puerto Rico and its residents .
Puerto Rico : The Ultimate Colony of the USA
As a result of the Jones Act of 1917 , puertorricans as well as americans living in Puerto Rico are treated as second - class US citizens , and excluded from many federal benefits and programs .
Second , as a result of the Jones Act of 1920 , the economy and living costs in Puerto Rico are by all means artificially inflated .
Thus , comparing the economic indicators and demographics of Puerto Rico with those of other nations is a deceiving exercise .
More than 100 years later , after the US " great " congressional experiments administered through federal and local corrupt politicians , and after so many natural disasters ( hurricanes , earthquakes , & outbreaks ) more puertorricans are living in the U.S. than in Puerto Rico .
At the present time , Puerto Rico is in bankruptcy , under H.R. 5278 : Puerto Rico Oversight , Management , and Economic Stability Act , better known as PROMESA , and slaved to an unfair status .
Puerto Rico is , indeed , the Ultimate Colony of the United States of America .
A portrait of Dominick Dunne that accompanied his November 2006 Vanity Fair article , “ Who Did n’t Kill JonBenet ? ” Photograph by Mark Seliger .
Dominick Dunne , a best - selling author and special correspondent for Vanity Fair , died today at his home in Manhattan .
He was 83 .
The cause of death was bladder cancer , said his son Griffin Dunne .
Dunne — who joined Vanity Fair in 1984 as a contributing editor and was named special correspondent in 1993 — famously covered the trials of O. J. Simpson , the Menendez brothers , Michael Skakel , William Kennedy Smith , and Phil Spector , as well as the impeachment of President Bill Clinton .
He wrote memorable profiles on numerous personalities , among them Imelda Marcos , Robert Mapplethorpe , Elizabeth Taylor , Claus von Bülow , Adnan Khashoggi , and Warren Beatty and Annette Bening .
His monthly column provided a glimpse inside high society , and captivated readers .
His first article for the magazine appeared in March 1984 — an account of the trial of the man who killed his daughter Dominique .
Throughout his life , Dunne was a vocal advocate for victims ’ rights .
Born in Hartford , Connecticut , on October 29 , 1925 , Dunne was awarded the Bronze Star , at age 19 , for his service in World War II .
In 1949 , he graduated from Williams College with a B.A .
In April 1954 , Dunne married Ellen Beatriz Griffin , who went by Lenny .
The marriage ended in divorce in 1965 .
Dunne began his career in New York City as the stage manager of The Howdy Doody Show , and in 1957 he moved to Hollywood , where he became the executive producer of the television series Adventures in Paradise .
Later , Dunne was made a vice president of Four Star Productions , a television company owned by David Niven , Dick Powell , and Charles Boyer .
He then moved on to producing feature films , including The Boys in the Band , Panic in Needle Park , Play It as It Lays , and Ash Wednesday .
But by this time drugs and alcohol had become an unmanageable part of his life , and in 1975 he drove himself up to the woods in Oregon .
Living alone in a cabin , he became sober and began , at age 50 , to write .
In 1980 , Dunne moved back to New York and saw eight of his books become bestsellers .
His books include The Two Mrs. Grenvilles ( Crown , 1985 ) , Fatal Charms ( Crown , 1987 ) , People Like Us ( Crown , 1988 ) , An Inconvenient Woman ( Crown , 1990 ) , A Season in Purgatory ( Crown , 1993 ) — which was adapted for television as a four - hour CBS mini-series — and Another City , Not My Own ( Crown , 1997 ) .
A collection of essays , Fatal Charms ( Crown ) , was published in 1987 , and his memoir , The Way We Lived Then : Recollections of a Well - Known Name Dropper ( Crown ) , was published in 1999 .
Justice ( Crown ) , a collection of articles that had appeared in Vanity Fair , was published in 2001 .
And his last book , Too Much Money : A Novel , is scheduled for publication in December 2009 by Random House .
The documentary series Dominick Dunne ’s Power , Privilege and Justice premiered on Court TV in June 2002 .
Dominick Dunne : After the Party , a documentary about his life , premiered in 2008 .
In addition to his son Griffin , of Manhattan , Dunne is survived by another son , Alex , of Portland , Oregon , and a granddaughter , Hannah .

US and French scientists say the term ’ nanoparticle ’ needs to be redefined to provide a focus for environmental , health and safety studies , and future regulation .
According to the researchers , nanomaterials should be categorised based on novel properties that are related to their small size - not , crucially , their size alone .
In most countries , few or no specific regulations exist to govern the safe use of nanoparticles , despite their wide use in cosmetics , sun screens and some drug products .
Until a decision can be reached on what exactly constitutes a nanoparticle , however , there can be no clear path forward .
Although traditionally thought of as any particle smaller than 100nm , the researchers argue in a review published in Nature Nanotechnology that for the purposes of health and safety , a more rigorous approach to classification is needed1 .
Lead researcher Mark Wiesner of Duke University , US , says it is too easy to tar all nanoparticles with the same brush .
’ All that is small is not necessarily nano , ’ he says .
’ You need to have that novel property .
The question then becomes : what ’s the taxonomy of these nanomaterials ? ’
The review highlights various novel physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles that might help form the basis for Wiesner ’s new taxonomy .
Size - dependent changes in the crystal structure of particles , for example , can influence their reactivity - importantly , changing how they interact with their environment .
Despite stressing ’ novel properties ’ , however , the study points towards particles at the lower end of the nano spectrum as being the most likely to bear characteristics that would provoke cause for concern .
If you want to find a hazardous nanoparticle , you should probably look below the 30nm barrier , says Wiesner .
But by narrowing the focus to particles below 30nm , is Wiesner falling into the same trap as those who claim the 100nm barrier holds any special significance ?
Ken Donaldson of the Safety of Nanomaterials Interdisciplinary Research Centre in Edinburgh and the author of another recent review of nanoparticle safety2 , argues that there is no proven consequence of any size - related change in properties .
’ If you focus only on this " quantum effect " of the change in physicochemical reactivity ... then [ the study ] shows that this does set in only at sizes below 30nm .
But in general there is no rational basis for restricting the definition of nanoparticles to those below 30nm .
It would be premature and without toxicological basis , ’ he says .
Teresa Fernandes , a nano safety expert at Edinburgh Napier University , worries that redrawing the boundaries will encourage the idea that there is no need to regulate above 30nm .
But she says Wiesner ’s work is important because it promotes debate .
Wiesner reasons that the 30nm limit is simply a guide .
’ I think it helps us focus on what materials might be of concern in developing regulations , but you ca n’t imagine that you define something at 30nm as toxic and 31nm as non -toxic , ’ he says .
’ The focus on novel properties , I think , is one categorisation scheme that might have some relevance for long term approaches to regulation . ’

For me , most of the things people know me from — Fawlty Towers or A Fish Called Wanda — are things I ’ve been able to write on spec because I had enough money to live .
Now I have to pay one million dollars a year until I ’m 76 .
So that means I have to organize my life around earning the first million dollars every year .
And the normal sources of income for people like me are drying up .
There are n’t as many film and TV parts — and you can do interesting documentaries but they do n’t pay anything .
So I ’m doing one - man shows and other things …
Like interviews like this , to sell some Fawlty Towers DVDs .
Yes , that ’s a big help .
I ’d always hoped that , at this stage in my life , I could live on the royalties and do the things I really want to do .
It ’s a large settlement .
Well , the absurd thing is , my wife brought no assets or income and we had no children .
And yet she seems to have finished up with a lot more than half of the money .
That ’s the insanity .
Can you laugh about something like this ?
You know , as they always say , it depends on whether you see life as a tragedy or a farce .
You ’ve often made terrible things seem hilarious .
Basil Fawlty was a jerk .
Well it ’s like in W.C. Fields — he ’s just about my favorite comedian , but if you actually met that character in real life , I do n’t think you ’d like him .
Basil ’s awful .
He ’s a terrible , shallow creature , completely obsessed with class .
Ah , but he is funny .
We laugh at Basil because , although he behaves appallingly to other people , a lot of the time it ’s because of his fear that Sybil will get very angry .
We also feel sorry for him .
When people behave badly out of fear , it ’s much funnier than if they were just behaving badly because that ’s their default mode .
And we recognize our own worst impulses in him ?
Oh , yes .
I think that there ’s an enormous number of people in England who , given enough stress , behave very much as Basil does .
That marvelous book Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman has this tremendous phrase : “ Stress makes you stupid . ”
So the more stress you put on the protagonist in the farce , the stupider he gets .
That ’s one of the delights of it .
They make worse and worse mistakes .
You ’re speaking to me from a hotel right now .
Are you a double celebrity among hoteliers ?
Yes , most of the hoteliers I encounter are aware of Fawlty Towers , but it does n’t stop them being terrible hoteliers .
I mean , this place that we ’re in at the moment , the Radisson … well , the accountants try to save a few pennies and meanwhile they absolutely ensure that somebody like me never comes back .
Why ?
They ’re greedy .
Earning a reputation gets completely forgotten in the rush for quick short - term profit , which is the great sin of American business .
I am often quite surprised at how poor the service is in even the most expensive chains , but I always exempt The Four Seasons , because I do think that ’s a marvelous chain .
But this Radisson , it ’s a mess .
The wastepaper baskets !
There ’s far too few wastepaper baskets , and when you do find them , they ’re always hidden away .
Like they are objects of shame .
I have by me now a tiny little wastepaper basket which contains a billowing plastic bag that makes it almost impossible to get anything into the bin .
But that ’s so the maid does n’t have to touch it .
The hotel is run for the benefit of the staff rather than for the customer .
Like Fawlty Towers .
Maybe you should open your own hotel .
I think it would be a tremendous thing to do , and I may produce some training films again , because most people are absolutely clueless , but I like projects that have ends to them .
With TV or a movie , you work on something for two years or six months and at the end of it , you move on .
I would not be good at something that required year after year of attention .
That ’s a big point of the new documentary on Monty Python .
The other Pythons were angry when you quit the show a year before everyone else .
Two things :
One is I did not like the fact that we were repeating a lot of our material , even if other people did n’t notice ; the others did n’t care .
They were having a good time .
I think if one was playing “ I ’m the pure artist , ” I would win on that one .
The other thing was that I was carrying the alcoholic [ the late Graham Chapman ] .
That seems to get forgotten in all of these discussions .
They were completely blind to an extraordinarily important point , which was : I was the guy who was having to work with the alcoholic .
They never said , ‘ We ’ll share part of that burden with you .
I ’ll write with him one day a week . ’
This is never mentioned .
It was ‘ Oh , John was rather difficult … ’
How bad was it ?
Well , I never knew what he was up to , because alcoholics — I now know quite a lot of them — they are all , I ’m afraid , basically liars .
The words are almost synonymous .
There were two types of days : days where I did 80 percent of the work and days when Graham did 5 percent of the work .
He was basically lazy , but he had two great qualities :
He was the most extraordinary sounding board and he was capable of coming in with very good off - the - wall ideas .
But he was very lazy .
In the doc , Terry Gilliam bashes your respect for psychotherapy .
I think Gilliam was so frightened of what he ’d discover if he ever explored his own conscience .
He is completely unbalanced , as are many of the Pythons .
He is notably unbalanced .
You were the first man to say “ shit ” on the BBC , and possibly the first man to say “ fuck ” at a funeral — Chapman’s .
What do you make of the controversy over an actress saying “ fucking ” on Saturday Night Live recently ?
I think the older you get the more you begin to realize what a madhouse we live in .
People get upset about things that do n’t matter at all and people do n’t really get upset at all about things that matter a lot .
You ’ve got a rotten , rickety old legal system that anyone with money can manipulate — and nobody goes around saying this ; they go around worrying that somebody said “ fuck . ”
I mean , frankly , it ’s pathetic and so completely half - witted that you give up any expectation of any kind of rational behavior of any kind , in any way , as you get older .
It ’s a madhouse .
There are small pockets of sanity , but the rest of it is irretrievably second - rate at best .
So when these things come along now , I just shrug .
On the Fawlty Towers commentary you say it ’s harder to laugh now .
You laugh less at entertainment because you ’ve seen most of the jokes before and you can guess where the new ones are going .
It ’s not like when you ’re young and you discover Buster Keaton or the Marx Brothers or W.C. Fields or Eddie Izzard or Bill Hicks .
What you begin to see is how funny life is .
You turn Sean Hannity on and there is wall - to - wall insanity .
They have absolutely no idea what clowns they are .
As you get older , are people getting stupider ?
It can be depressing .
But you have to let go of the idea that this can ever be a decent and rational place .
I already have quite a lot of material for a new show I will call Why There Is No Hope .
I ’ve tried it out .
A friend said it was fascinating afterwards because the more I destroyed people ’s hope that this could ever be , in any way , a rational planet , the more they laughed .
Could you give me a preview ?
Well , I ’m a funny kind of professor at Cornell , and there is a psychology professor there called David Dunning who discovered that in order to know how good you are at something , it requires almost exactly the same skills and aptitude as it does to be good at that thing in the first place .
In other words , if you ’re a really good tennis player or mathematician then you know how to tell how good you are .
But it also means if you ’re absolutely no good at something then you lack exactly the skills to realize your idiocy .
It explains why so many idiots out there have no idea that they ’re idiots .
Do you run into this in comedy ?
You find this particularly with scripts .
I wrote a really good script for Disney , and the woman in charge wanted to make changes which were completely and utterly wrong .
She had the confidence of the truly stupid .
Then you look at the Republican Party :
Here are people that are so out of touch with reality that it could be screamingly funny if it were n’t so dangerous .
As politics gets more childish , does satire get harder for you ?
Yes .
Take Sarah Palin — so many Republicans love her .
I suddenly realized that in order to actually understand that someone is not very bright — or to be brutal , that they ’re rather stupid — you really have to be more intelligent than them .
Most Republicans are n’t smarter than Sarah Palin .
It ’s true .
If there is no hope , you must not trust Obama .
No , I have real hope for Obama , because I think without the slightest doubt he is operating from a considerably higher level of mental health than we ’re used to in our politicians .
I think that ’s what frightens the shit out of Republicans .
Because if you put very mad people in a room with very sane people the mad people start feeling madder , do you see what I mean ?
Whereas , if you put mad people in together — if you put the Gestapo in together — they ’re all sort of reinforcing each other ’s madness and everyone ’s happy .

SAN FRANCISCO , Sept 4 ( Reuters ) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O said it would replace copies of digital books that it purposefully deleted from its customers ' electronic readers this summer , as the online retailer sought to make amends for the controversial incident .
In an email to the affected customers on Thursday , Amazon said it would provide owners of its Kindle electronic book reader with new copies of the George Orwell novels 1984 and Animal Farm for no charge .
Amazon said customers could also choose to receive a $ 30 gift certificate or check instead .
The email also contained a copy of the apology that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos made in July , in which he called the company ’s deletion of the books “ stupid , thoughtless and painfully out of line with our principles . ”
In July , Amazon acknowledged that it had deleted the Orwell e-books from the Kindles of an undisclosed number of owners .
Amazon said it deleted the books because it learned an outside company had added the books to Amazon ’s catalog but the outside company did not have the rights to sell them .
The move triggered a wave of criticism on the Internet , and Amazon was sued by a high - school student who said Amazon deleted his copy of 1984 and the “ copious notes ” he had taken on the book .
Amazon ’s email on Thursday said that the company would replace the deleted books along with any annotations made by customers .
Amazon spokesman Andrew Herdener said the move was unrelated to the lawsuit , and said the company does not comment on active litigation .

To create educational opportunities for the world 's poorest children by providing each child with a rugged , low - cost , low - power , connected laptop with content and software designed for collaborative , joyful , self - empowered learning .
When children have access to this type of tool they get engaged in their own education .
They learn , share , create , and collaborate .
They become connected to each other , to the world and to a brighter future .
Anyone trying to make a difference , and is not afraid to put words into deeds , especially if it is innovative , provocative and controversial , deserves my respect .
Especially if it is well thought through .
OLPC has my respect .
Proper education is one of the principal ways to eradicate poverty .
There are different means to boost education in the developing world .
Rendering technology more affordable and accessible is one .
... But it is not the only solution .
Cheap laptops can not feed hungry children , that is for sure .
But neither can " feeding children teach them how to read " .
Boosting education in the developing world has many challenges .
Starting at the basics :
How do we get the kids to come to school , if they have to work in the fields helping their parents to grow enough food ?
Once they come to school , how do we keep them in school up to the point their education becomes applicable to their lives ?
How do we train teachers , and keep them into education .
How do we avoid poaching of teachers by the commercial world ?
How do we ensure kids have enough nutritional food , are they properly de-wormed ( and are healthy enough ) , so they can capitalize to the max on the efforts brought ?
( there is a whole series of studies illustrating how proper nutrition boosts a child 's capacity to learn )
How do we make sure there is a proper school infrastructure , proper teaching material , proper latrines ?
How do we make sure the educational programme is institutionalized and self - sustainable ( I need to write something on sustainability as this is one of my sore points at the moment ) .
Attacking OLPC because they triggered only one part of the solution , is unfair , I think .
However triggering debates to ensure OLPC is properly integrated in a wholesome solution , is constructive .
However , as the cynical aidworker I sometimes am , I have to say that wholesome solutions to complex development goals are virtually non-existent .
It is simply not built into the humanitarian system .
It is very very very difficult to have different organisations work together for a common goal .
Even if it would be as simple as " address the problems of this ONE school in all of its aspects " .
Leave alone all schools in a country .
Beh ..
Different organisations have different means and goals .
But most of all , they compete .
They compete for the same donor - dollar .
In the end , why would I , as organisation X , work with organisation Y , if I know that in the end , we will be approaching the same donors for the same money ?
X and Y are competitors in a competitive world .
And that will remain forever ( unless at a certain point , there is a more even balance between the world 's needs and the world 's capacity to give .
Dream on ! ) .
And finally : OLPC is an easy target .
I will challenge anyone to bring up examples of aid projects which are the right bang for buck , with wholesome approaches , lasting and self - sustainable projects .
There are not many .
There is a lot of " make believe " , but there are not many good examples .
If the aid organisations would be commercial enterprises , the " aid business bubble " would have burst decennia ago .
And would have burst every five years .
OK , that is a lot of ranting , what is the solution then ?
According to me , we have to start at the basics .
Some food for thought :
Better and stronger oversight of the aid spending , both by the organisations themselves , governments and independent bodies .
Make the audits public .
Make the impact data public .
Work out better criteria to measure impact , sustainability and integration in wholesome solutions .
in wholesome solutions .
Ensure outcomes are measured by impact , and not by amount of money spent .
( You think I am kidding ?
I am not !
No donor is ever happy if at the end of the project , you return the balance of unspent money .
Ever ! )
Entice cooperation between organisations , while recognizing that healthy competition is good .
Transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency .
Shoot me .
I am a dreamer .

Fellow aidworker Alanna wrote a provocative post on UNDispatch about the " end of the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) dream " .
OLPC set out a couple of years ago , designing , manufacturing and distributing a simple laptop ( or call it a " Netbook " ) geared towards kids , specifically in developing countries .
Their mission was formulated as : From the beginning , the plan was ambitious , innovative , .. and controversial .
" Tall trees catch a lot of wind " is surely applicable .
The more as it was such an easy target for cheap sarcasm : " How will a laptop feed a hungry child " ?
You can imagine ... Alanna 's post is creating a bit of a sturr in the ICT4D ( ICT For Development ) , and in the development blogosphere as such ( Check out the latest posts via a Humanitarian News search ) .
I might disagree with Alanna on the OLPC , I surely appreciate provocative posts to stir up discussions .

IT 'S FREE Darla Horn , 26 , acknowledges she did n't give much thought to the cost of college when she enrolled at State University of New York in Purchase .
" My plans were to get out of Texas , and college became incidental , " says Horn , who grew up in Nacogdoches , a city of about 32,000 near the Louisiana border .
Because she did n't qualify for financial aid , she took out student loans , graduating in 2005 with a double major in journalism and anthropology and more than $ 80,000 in debt .
CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS :
Does it pay to go to college ?
BEST VALUE COLLEGES : Top 100 for 2009 COLLEGE BLOG : Beyond rankings : Curricula and censorship
Her loan payments were manageable until this year , when she lost her job as an information technology recruiter earning about $ 100,000 a year .
Currently self - employed , she 's behind on her loan payments .
In April , she organized an exhibition in Long Island that featured artwork by graduates who are trying to raise money to pay their student loans .
" To this day , I have yet to see the complete value of my education , " Horn says .
For years , an article of faith in this country has been that college is the gateway to a better life .
So deeply held is this belief that many students , such as Horn , borrow tens of thousands of dollars to attend prestigious public or private universities .
But as the worst recession since World War II trudges into its 21st month , many graduates are discovering that the college payoff could be a long time coming — if it comes at all .
New and prospective students , meanwhile , are abandoning their " dream schools " in favor of more affordable options , forcing many colleges to work harder to justify their price of admission .
In July , the unemployment rate for college graduates was 4.7 % , up from 2.8 % a year earlier , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
That 's still considerably lower than the 9.4 % rate for workers with only a high school diploma .
But unlike out - of - work high school graduates , many unemployed college grads face the additional burden of student loan payments .
Two - thirds of bachelor 's degree recipients last year graduated with an average debt of about $ 23,000 , according to Finaid.org , a financial aid website .
Total debt for borrowers with graduate or professional degrees ranges from $ 30,000 to $ 120,000 , Finaid.org says .
New graduates face an even more unforgiving job market .
Employers expect to hire 22 % fewer graduates from the class of 2009 than they hired from the class of 2008 , according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers .
The economic downturn is affecting the choices that students and their parents make : • Community college enrollment is soaring .
More than 90 % of community college presidents said enrollment was up in January from the previous year , and 86 % reported an increase in full - time students , according to a survey by the Campus Computing Project , which studies the role of information technology in higher education .
Alyssa Griffin , 19 , of Columbus , Ohio , would like to obtain a bachelor 's degree in interactive media from Capital University , a private school in Bexley , Ohio .
But to save money , she plans to spend her freshman and sophomore years at Columbus State Community College and live at home .
This strategy means Griffin will miss out on a traditional four - year college experience , but it will significantly reduce the cost of her college education — by more than $ 40,000 .
Tuition at Capital runs more than $ 27,000 a year , vs. about $ 6,000 at Columbus State .
" I have no issues with starting at Columbus State and then going on to Capital , " Griffin says .
Community colleges have long provided a way for adults to learn new job skills , often by attending part time .
But these days , they 're seeing a big increase in students such as Griffin , says Will Kopp , vice president for institutional advancement at Columbus State .
The median age of new students at Columbus State is 19 , he says .
By attending their first two years at a community college , Kopp says , " they 're paying maybe a third of the tuition at state universities ; maybe a tenth what they 'd pay at a private school . "
• Students who attend traditional four - year colleges are paying more attention to costs .
More than two - thirds of students who applied for college this spring said the economic downturn affected their choice of colleges , according to a survey by the Princeton Review .
The survey also found " a great concern around financial aid , " with 85 % stating that they would n't be able to pay for college without it , says Robert Franek , vice president , publishing , for the Princeton Review .
Similarly , 70 % of high schools reported an increase in the number of students who abandoned their " dream schools " in favor of more affordable options during the 2008 - 09 academic year , according to the National Association for College Admission Counseling .
More than 65 % reported an increase in the number of students planning to apply to a state instead of a private school .
Nearly one - third of private colleges expect freshman enrollment to decline in the 2009 - 10 academic year , according to a survey by the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities ( NAICU ) .
Overall undergraduate enrollment in private colleges is expected to increase by 0.2 % , the association said .
In the past 10 years , enrollment at both public and private schools has increased by an average of 1 % to 2 % a year .
Private colleges are well aware of the financial difficulties facing many families and have increased student aid by an average of 9 % , says Tony Pals , spokesman for the NAICU .
" Nearly nine out of 10 students at private colleges pay less than the list price , " Pals says .
" You also need to consider that students at private colleges are twice as likely to graduate in four years than their peers at public institutions . "
A long - term investment ?
Few would argue that college is a bad investment , but the economic downturn could diminish the value of that investment .
Those who graduate during a recession tend to start at smaller and lower - paying companies or firms , forcing them to change jobs more frequently than those who graduate during better times , according to a 2006 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
The study found that college students who graduate during a recession suffer an average 9 % reduction in annual earnings initially , and that the discrepancies do n't disappear until about 10 years after graduation .
Even before the recession , the value of a college investment was inflated , says Marc Scheer , author of No Sucker Left Behind : Avoiding the Great College Rip - Off .
Oft - quoted reports that college graduates earn $ 1 million more over their lifetimes than workers with high school diplomas help encourage students to take out unmanageable levels of debt , Scheer says .
" No debt amount seems steep compared to a $ 1 million payoff , " he says .
' Less likely to struggle '
The College Board , a non-profit association of more than 5,400 colleges and universities , estimates the lifetime " earnings premium " for a college graduate is $ 450,000 in today 's dollars , or $ 570,000 for workers with graduate degrees .
" That 's a much more accurate " estimate than the $ 1 million figure , says Sandy Baum , senior policy analyst for the College Board .
But Baum argues that a college education is more valuable during a recession , not less .
In a downturn , she says , " Most of the stories that say maybe it ( college degree ) is n't worth it any more find some unemployed college graduate , " she says .
" But unemployment among college graduates is still half that of high school graduates .
A college education payoff is at least as high as it was before the recession .
You 're so much less likely to struggle if you have an education . "
Laurence Kotlikoff , an economist at Boston University and developer of ESPlanner financial software , says his analysis of median earnings shows that college graduates nearly always fare better than those with just a high school diploma .
But the amount students borrow can significantly reduce that advantage , he says .
Brenda Jaeggi , 26 , of Galveston , graduated last May from Texas A&M University with a degree in maritime studies and more than $ 39,000 in student loans .
About $ 22,000 of her loans are private loans , which are costlier and carry less flexible repayment terms than federal student loans .
Now , Jaeggi is struggling to make her $ 400 monthly payments .
She 's considering moving to a less - expensive apartment , although that likely will mean living in a neighborhood that is n't as safe as the one she 's in now .
" I do n't have any regrets about going to Texas A&M , " Jaeggi says .
" I 'm proud to be part of that school and that culture .
I very much regret how easy it was to get a student loan .
Now , I 'm stuck in this really bad pickle . "
Graduates of elite schools contend that attending such a school gives them an edge in a tough job market .
Michelle Talbert , 39 , has more than $ 90,000 in student loans from her undergraduate studies at Cornell University and law school at the University of Pennsylvania .
She recently was laid off by a law firm in Fairfax , Va. , where she was a corporate associate specializing in mergers and acquisitions .
Talbert says the connections she made in college helped her obtain contract work .
Her current salary varies from month to month .
" I 'm really enthusiastic about not letting circumstances that could appear to be a hurdle stop you from achieving a dream , " says Talbert , a mother of two who got her undergraduate degree when she was 30 .
" For me , my dream was to go to college and go to law school . "
College financial aid specialists say students should take a hard look at average salaries in their chosen profession before taking out student loans .
" If you think you want to be a preschool teacher , you should be more hesitant about borrowing than if you think you 're going to be an engineer , " Baum says .
Darla
Horn says that if she had to do it all over , she would have taken a year off to figure out what she wanted to do with her life before attending college .
" Some kids know what they want — they want to go to medical school , or become doctors or lawyers , " she says .
" But for someone that does n't know what direction they want to head in , I would say , take a break , get to know yourself a little more , before you spend thousands of dollars on an education . "

High in the hills of Kenya 's Mau forest , some 20,000 families are facing eviction from their farms - accused of contributing to an ecological disaster which has crippled the country .
The authorities are to start the process of removing them any day now .
Farmers will be asked to surrender their title deeds for inspection .
If their documents are genuine , they have a chance of being resettled or compensated .
We must act now - before the entire ecosystem is irreversibly damaged
Raila Odinga , Prime Minister , Kenya
In pictures : Mau forest crisis
If not , they will simply be told to go .
" We are afraid .
Not only me , but all of us here , " says Kipkorir Ngeno , a teacher and father of six , from a village known as " Sierra Leone " .
" They call us squatters - a very bad name .
But this is my land .
It is not illegal . "
Drought and despair Mr Ngeno is one of those accused of responsibility for droughts which have left millions of Kenyans thirsty for water and hungry for retribution .
They call us squatters - a very bad name
Kipkorir Ngeno , Farmer , Mau forest
' We have nowhere else to go '
Mau forest is Kenya 's largest water tower - it stores rain during the wet seasons and pumps it out during the dry months .
But during the past 15 years , more than 100,000 hectares - one quarter of the protected forest reserve - have been settled and cleared .
Tearing out the trees at the heart of Kenya has triggered a cascade of drought and despair in the surrounding valleys .
The rivers that flow from the forest are drying up .
And as they disappear , so too have Kenya 's harvests , its cattle farms , its hydro- electricity , its tea industry , its lakes and even its famous wildlife parks .
The finger of blame is being pointed at the settlers in Mau .
And the solution , according to a special task force appointed by Prime Minister Raila Odinga , is to uproot the invaders and replant the trees .
Of 20,000 families living in the forest , they estimate that as few as 1,962 have genuine title deeds .
Civil conflict " We must act now - before the entire ecosystem is irreversibly damaged , " said Mr Odinga .
THE HEART OF KENYA
Mau forest is the largest in Kenya - the size of the Aberdares and Mount Kenya combined 10 million people depend on its rivers
They feed six lakes - Victoria , Turkana , Natron , Nakuru , Baringo and Magadi Plus eight wildlife reserves - including the Masai Mara , the Serengeti and Lake Nakuru
The rivers have potential for 518MW hydro electricity - 41 % of Kenya 's total
In all , the forest provides an economic benefit of 20 billion shillings ( £ 166 m ) per year ( UNEP )
But already , a quarter of its 400,000 hectares have been destroyed by farmers and loggers " We are looking at securing the livelihoods and economies of millions of Africans who directly and indirectly depend on the ecosystem . "
The prime minister was speaking at the United Nations - appealing for donations of $ 400 m ( £ 250 m ) to " rehabilitate " Kenya 's water supply .
If he does not act , he foresees a struggle for water and land which could escalate into a bloody civil conflict .
Because in the valleys downstream of Mau forest , farmers like Peter Ole Nkolia are running out of water , cattle , and patience .
" Those people up there need to just move , " says Mr Nkolia , as he stands by the carcass of a dead cow .
" If the destruction of Mau shall continue I can assure you that a lot of people will suffer .
" What you are going to see here in Narok is just the skeletons of cattle - and maybe people . "
Worse still , the water from Mau quenches thirst far beyond Kenya .
Its rivers feed Tanzania 's Serengeti and keep the fishermen of Lake Victoria afloat .
When you consider that Lake Victoria is the source of the Nile , you begin to grasp the scale of the crisis the Kenyan government is facing .
" This is no longer a Kenyan problem , " said Mr Odinga .
" Tanzania and Egypt are feeling the heat from the Mau .
" And the implications go beyond the environment .
This has the potential to create insecurity as people squabble over dwindling resources . "
' Buffer zone '
Chopping down the tree cover in Mau has removed a natural " pump " which keeps the ecosystem alive .
The people in Mau forest need to move ...
I cannot stay here suffering

Mau : the disaster downstream " It rains a lot in Kenya - but only in the rainy seasons .
Then you have four long months with not a drop , " explains Christian Lambrechts , from the Nairobi - based UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) .
" So you need a buffer zone - a way to ration the rain water and release it slowly into the rivers in the dry season .
That buffer is the forest .
" If you remove this ecosystem , you reduce the moisture reservoir .
Which means that in the dry season ... ' Hakuna maji ' .
No water . "
When the rains in Kenya stop falling , the 12 rivers which stem from the Mau forest are the lifeline for about 10 million people .
And this year in Kenya , the rains failed badly .
Narok county - the breadbasket of Kenya - was a barren dustbowl in April , the wettest month of the year .
The government declared a " national emergency " with 10 million Kenyans facing starvation .
Cattle keeled over and died , in their millions .
And as the drought worsened , Kenyan government was forced to bail out farmers by slaughtering their weak animals for just 8,000 shillings ( $ 105 ; £ 65 ) a head .
In western Kenya , the tea plantations of James Finlay , which feed on the rivers of western Mau , have seen their yields cut to 80 % .
And the town of Kericho experienced water rationing for the first time in a generation .
Trouble in paradise Wildlife tourism - another pillar of Kenya 's economy - is wilting in the heat .
Lake Nakuru , the birdwatcher 's paradise , is disappearing .
The rivers that feed it have run dry .
They come from Mau .
It is a lake you can literally walk across
Paul Opiyo , Deputy warden , Lake Nakuru
Kenya 's vanishing lake ' paradise '
And in the Masai Mara , the river which hosts the world famous " crossing of the wildebeest " has fallen to its lowest ever level .
Water scarcity has brought wild animals and farmers into conflict .
Deaths , injuries and compensation claims are at record highs in Narok , according to the Kenya Wildlife Service ( KWS ) .
The fuse for all these disasters was lit in Mau .
" The Mau , in a sense , is the hen that lays the golden eggs , " says Paul Udoto , of KWS .
" The eggs are Lake Nakuru , the Masai Mara , the tea plantations ... the farming that is being done by pastoralists .
" Once you destroy the centre - the hen - that is the Mau - then by necessity you have to lose the golden eggs . "
Frequent droughts
But can deforestation really be to blame for all these catastrophes ?
After all , there have always been cyclical droughts in Kenya .
The trouble is that these droughts are becoming more frequent , more severe and less predictable .
Particularly since 2001 - the year when 60,000 hectares of Mau were allocated to settlers and cleared .
I keep telling people ... if you destroy the forests , the rivers will stop flowing ... and you will die of hunger and starvation
Prof Wangari Maathai , Green Belt Movement
" At a time when the climate in Kenya is becoming drier , that is when you need to boost your ecosystem - to help it to absorb the impact of climate variability , " says Mr Lambrechts .
" Go in the opposite direction , and you are going to feel those impacts much bigger .
That is what we are currently feeling . "
Mr Lambrechts is one of 30 officials recruited to the task force by Prime Minister Odinga .
Their report , published in July , set out in painstaking detail how more than 100,000 hectares - one quarter of the entire forest reserve - was parcelled up and cleared for settlement .
Almost 20,000 land parcels were " excised " by the governments of Daniel arap Moi and Mwai Kibaki , and handed out to farmers - which helped to boost the two presidents ' popularity in the run-up to elections .
At the time , much of these excised land parcels were promised to Ogiek peoples , the original forest dwellers .
But the title deeds ended up largely in the hands of local officials and incoming settlers .
Meanwhile , in the southern Maasai Mau forest , almost 2,000 plots were illegally purchased within the protected forest reserve , with the help of local officials .
Plots known as " group ranches " were expanded , subdivided and then sold on to third parties , unaware that their new title deeds may be " irregular " or " bogus " .
An area of central Mau was " adjudicated " to local people who have traditional rights in the forest .
But elsewhere large chunks of the forest were occupied and squatted - " encroached " to use the official terminology - by settlers with no title claim whatsoever .
Political tightrope
The task force insists that almost all of these settlers and land owners should leave the forest as soon as possible .
But how many deserve compensation ?
This is a political tightrope for Prime Minister Odinga .

The task force has promised that each family will have their claim heard on a " case - to - case basis " .
All holders of " genuine " title deeds will be compensated - perhaps even those high - ranking public officials who are named by the task force as having received land via irregular means .
A search for new land to resettle farmers is underway , but is already provoking controversy .
" I hope when they go to the World Bank they wo n't get any money , " says Professor Wangari Maathai , the Nobel Laureate and environmental campaigner .
" The only reason why we are being held hostage with the Mau is because people who were in power want to be compensated . "
Double - whammy
But perhaps the biggest challenge of all facing Kenya is the ecological one - the co-ordinated replanting of 100,000 hectares of indigenous forest - more than 100 million trees .
It will take decades to restore the canopy - years in which Kenyans will continue to suffer from the double - whammy of local land degradation and global climate change .
Yet among environmentalists there is some relief that , at last , Kenya has woken up to a disaster that has been brewing for decades .
Countless warnings have gone unheeded , as Ms Maathai can testify .
" I keep telling people , let us not cut trees irresponsibly ... especially the forested mountains , " she says .
" Because if you destroy the forests , the rivers will stop flowing and the rains will become irregular and the crops will fail and you will die of hunger and starvation .
" Now the problem is , people do n't make those linkages . "
In Kenya this year , everyone is making those linkages .
Read some of your comments : I come from the environs of Mau forests .
In the 1990s when I was young , there was a land selling frenzy within the neighbourhood in preference for cheap or free forest land in Mau .
People used to boast of virgin soils and reliable rains in the Mau and to spice the deal , it was either free or sold at at throw away price .
Then , it used to rain a lot in our area .
I remember very long rains in April and December of every year .
Farming was booming as farmers could know when to plant their crops .
These days , it hardly rains .
Droughts are the order of the day .
The last time I saw the real rains was 1998 .
Gone are the streams that used to flow down our land , gone is the swamp that we used to hunt birds in my child hood .
The Kamwamba dam we used to fish and swim and watch ducks swim is dying .
I get sad a lot whenever I visit my rural home .
I do n't know what our children will inherit if all these continue .
Obviously a barren desert !
Our people are now poor and starving in a land once so affluent .
I get more sad when politicians politicise a purely environmental issue , when the global concern is global warming , they choose to think in terms of the next election .
Do n't these people read the international press ?
Even though there will be social consequences when the evictees finally arrive in our village , I think we should consider the greater good !
Kiprotich , Nairobi , Kenya Sometimes i feel tears in my eyes when I visit my rural home in masinga , ukambani .
Since i was young our area has always been rich of pastoralism and despite the fact that most rivers there are seasonal , we largely depend on clean pipe water from Masinga dam during dry season .
This water is no longer there , the pipes are dry because has the dam water level has dropped in its least level in its entire generation , why ?
Because the dam is located in Tana river which springs from the country 's largest catchment area , Mau forest .
This dam as you may well know houses the main electricity plant in the country and its dryin state has led to the rationing of electricity in large parts of the country .
We just urge our leaders to stop this calamity once and for all and the only way of doing this is restoring back the hen ( Mau ) to its glory of laying golden eggs ( the rivers flowing from it )
Reuben mwaana mbuve , Nairobi , kenya I have been an active member of the Boy Scouts Mvt in Kenya , and 24 years ago , we went camping in the forest and it was amazing .
I came back to Kenya for holidays with my friends from Dubai , and was shocked when I enquired about the campsite , located near LAKE NAKURU and to my utter dismay , was informed that it no longer existed .
I went there and yes , I was met by people selling charcoal and villages all set up .
I weeped dearly for my beloved country .
Shame for the perpetrators of this regime .
sad but true , my dear , beloved country is sinking , slowly , BUT surely into a state of despair and disillusionment :-(
Muchui Maingi , Dubai , U.A.E
I remember very well the times when most rivers in Kenya were flowing with clean water that was being put to domestic use .
But now the case is different what we are seeing is a bomb that is about to blow on our face due to our own actions .
For instance the Njoro river which i once had a chance of swimming in when i was a small boy while visiting my grandmother who lives in that area , prompts me to shed tears since what has been left of it a scary part that nobody ever thought of - a dry bed is all that is left for us to see .
i take this opportunity to urge my fellow Kenyans to join hands together and preserve our environment .
John Njoroge Ng'ang'a , Tehran , Iran I hope all of us have been taught a lesson for life ' .
NO one listened to mama Maathai in any way !
She fought uhuru park grabbing , warned about the constitution and sucking of ministers in 2005 , warned about the shamba system and the Mau .
Instead she was voted out of parliament the voice of truth was cast out .
Uama , Kenya
We are paying dearly for our mistakes , imagine the Maasai Mara without the Mara river , the waters in Mara river were so low this time an it really affected the spectacular migration of the wildebeest from the Serengeti to Mara , our hippos , crocodiles and other animals will starve .
Who will save the Mau ?
We are committing suicide by allowing this to continue , Its true that nature is very unforgiving .
Better for a few to cry or suffer than the whole nation .
We must act know not tomorrow .
David , Kilgoris , kenya
These people have to be moved if the nation is to survive .
They cannot have obtained the land legally because forests are protected areas where no human settlement is allowed .
Those documents ( title deeds ) though legitimate , were obtained in a fraudulent manner .
They were not supposed to be issued in the first place .
Corruption is the order of things here and we are now suffering from its effects .
Wachira , Nairobi , Kenya Europeans must become aware of their complicity because the well - financed flower industry that supplies European consumers is helping to drain the bird watching lakes with their expansive Kenyan operations .
This ecological double dipping is a terrible legacy for former colonial masters .
Dr. Tim Foresman , Formerly Nairobi - now Baltimore , Maryland USA
The drying climate of Kenya is not caused only by the actions of a few thousand settlers .
Certainly deforestation cannot help but we must analyze the drought in the context of the ongoing climate change of all of North Africa if not the world .
The government of Kenya is doing itself and its citizens a huge disservice by choosing use the settlers as scapegoats for what could be just another side effect of global climate change .
Are these settlers also responsible for the decline of the Arctic Sea ice ?
Or receding glaciers worldwide ?
Perhaps we 'd like to lay the collapse of the Larson ice shelf on their shoulders as well ?
Alex Fitzpatrick , Ottawa , Canada
The people who benefited from the Mau are not the ' squatters ' we have to compensate today , they are those who obtained parcels and sold them off .
As Wangari Mathai says , we have failed to hold our leaders accountable .
We will continue to suffer the effects as long we do not punish the real wrong doers .
The Mau crisis is a symptom of our lack of interest in accountability .
Those who acquired the land they never should have and sold it off or held on to it should be exposed and forced to pay .
Those who benefited should be found and made to pay .
Njeri , Nairobi , Kenya
Those people living in mau should not be moved - each one of them must plant at least 200 trees in their shambas .
They are there because government gave them the title deeds .
It is their right .
stella , molo , kenya Kenyans should support the government 's plan to remove the 20,000 people now settled in the Mau as a matter of urgency .
Compensation and other support for the evictees must not be used as a reason not to act .
The cost is incomparable to the loss of livelihoods of millions of people that are affected by the deforestation of the Mau .
What is important though is the fact that KFS and the government may be persuaded by the timber industry to re-establish monoculture plantations in the Mau .
It is my opinion that the entire are should be reforested with indigenous pioneer trees and tropical vegetation that is able to more effectively provide water catchment than exotic monocultures .
Prof. Karanja Njoroge , Njoro , Kenya
This is political and eviction alone cannot solve the problem .
We need to solve the issue by involving the community for peaceful coexistence
Stanley kilele , kericho , kenya I think the Government in Kenya has already stolen enough land from the people of Africa .
Citizens of that country has the right to live also .
william , nashville , united states
If you fly low and slow over Mau Forest you will appreciate that it has been destroyed .
Not ' is being ' destroyed but ' has been ' destroyed .
There are still some trees , of course , but the forest ecology has been devastated by Kenyan citizens at vast profit to themselves ... with complicit government approval and connivance .
Kenya has destroyed its own water - resource facilities ( most disgustingly , for short - term profit ) and then complains for lack of water in its aquifers , commonly blaming global warming as the culprit .
Global warming may well be causing or contributing to East Africa 's drought but the lack of protection from that drought lies within Kenya 's own borders and attitudes .
Like the rest of us they need to comprehend that , as the saying has it : " Against stupidity the gods themselves contend in vain " .
We all suffer from out own and our governments ' stupidities ... but Kenya 's stupidity is quite simply suicidal .
Howard I Holdsworth , Nairobi , Kenya Leaders / MPS in Kenya should look deep inside their hearts .
Most of them knows that they 've used innocent Kenyans to acquire land and also use the political power to still .
This is sickening ... Its not MAU forest problems but the real inside shady dealings and corruptions in Kenya .
Titus , KENYA
I recently visited my rural home ( in western Kenya - Kisii ) after three month absence .
I was surprised that a small stream ( river ) which runs across the village and which has never dried in my lifetime ( 42 yrs ) was now completely dry .
My old parents now have to rely on water delivered from Lake Victoria by tanker and they are lucky because I do the payments - many households and livestock are in pathetic state .
Thomas , Mombasa , Kenya 19 years ago I was the Water Resources Specialist on an environmental study of the Mau Forest funded by the UK government .
It did not need rocket science to predict that further forest conversion would cause negative impacts on regional hydrology .
The study made numerous management recommendations including excision of degraded forest to settle the Ogiek , forest regeneration , and improved forest and land use and titling governance .
Perhaps it 's time to dust off this and other reports , and to recollect that the original designation of the Mau forests were as watershed protection forests .
James Ramsay , Victoria , Canada
This is not just a Mau Forest issue , this is a countrywide issue , damage is being done to ' all ' major water catchment areas in this water scarce country , not a single one is intact .
Some forests have had to be entirely fenced to prevent logging .
In Nairobi city itself - three major indegenous forests have been corruptly degazetted and destroyed ( wangari mathaai was assaulted by police trying to defend one of these forests two decades ago ) Furthermore , ' Downstream ' activities all over the country , in drylands and wetlands , such as sand harvesting and open pit mining are wreaking incalculable damage to the environment .
This is a problem that may take a century to solve if we start today .
We have no choice but to do so .
concerned , nairobi , kenya I come from nyeri and stream that have been flowing from the aberdares since time immemorial are drying up .
govt should rehabilitate all forests in kenya not only mau .
people should also be made aware of the effects of wanton destruction of forest .
a mandatory stiff sentence put in place for anyone caught doing it .
Robert ndungu , Mombasa , kenya
The de-forestation of Kenya is an ecological time - bomb .
Indigenous hardwood forest all across the country is being destroyed by illegal charcoal burners .
But even more shocking is the fact that the thousands of tons of charcoal is not for the domestic market .
It is being exported for profit .
This illegal industry is robbing millions of Kenyans of their future .
Scapegoating subsistence farmers is perhaps a useful smokescreen .
P Warren , London , England
We are feeling the heat here , temperatures have been raising .
I live in a middle income neighbourhood and there is no water in our houses because the levels of the water in our dams are so low .
We are experiencing electricity rationing .
We are just in the middle of hot and dry stuff .
All these have been traced to Mau .
We need help in this country , environmental issues have been politicised and people are confused whom to listen .
Kenya is hanging at the cliff of environmental disaster .
Thomas , Yebei , Nairobi , Kenya I have been buying water since the beginning of this year .
I have three children the therefore I purchase 300 litres per day amounting to Kshs 100 every day .
I have a small garden whereby I use to plant vegetables .
We have gone without rain for almost the whole of this year .
We do not have electricity since we are having power rationing .
Jerusah , Naivasha , Kenya I have been seriously affected because the drying of the rivers whose source is the mau catchment area has resulted in both electricity and power rationing .
Now water is supplied to our taps only once a week while electricity is rationed on an almost daily basis ( 12 hr periods )
Dr.Ismail Thoya Ngoka , Nairobi , Kenya
Those people who are destroying
Mau forest should know that not only are they destroying their livelihoods but also they are putting the future of millions of people who depend on the water tower downstream at stake .
John , Molo , Kenya Desertification is a problem throughout the continent .
Lawlessness allows ignorant people to cut down trees to sell the wood for next to nothing .
In just one year time they feel that the weather in their town is dryer and hotter , but they fail to make the connection .
God protect the Kenyan government and allow them to save the forest , and the lives of millions of Kenyans .
René , Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso
The impact of climate change is grating every common man 's nerves here in Kenya .
Water is scarce , animals are dying , the land is bare , food prices are scratching the roof , temperatures are high , power is rationed ...
But every cloud has a silver lining : today I planted six trees and I am leaving my two decade career as a baker , having dedicated the next two to full time conservation .

An armada of robots may one day fly above the mountain tops of Saturn 's moon Titan , cross its vast dunes and sail in its liquid lakes .
Wolfgang Fink , visiting associate in physics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena says we are on the brink of a great paradigm shift in planetary exploration , and the next round of robotic explorers will be nothing like what we see today .
" The way we explore tomorrow will be unlike any cup of tea we 've ever tasted , " said Fink , who was recently appointed as the Edward and Maria Keonjian Distinguished Professor in Microelectronics at the University of Arizona , Tucson .
" We are departing from traditional approaches of a single robotic spacecraft with no redundancy that is Earth - commanded to one that allows for having multiple , expendable low - cost robots that can command themselves or other robots at various locations at the same time . "
Fink and his team members at Caltech , the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Arizona are developing autonomous software and have built a robotic test bed that can mimic a field geologist or astronaut , capable of working independently and as part of a larger team .
This software will allow a robot to think on its own , identify problems and possible hazards , determine areas of interest and prioritize targets for a close - up look .
The way things work now , engineers command a rover or spacecraft to carry out certain tasks and then wait for them to be executed .
They have little or no flexibility in changing their game plan as events unfold ; for example , to image a landslide or cryovolcanic eruption as it happens , or investigate a methane outgassing event .
" In the future , multiple robots will be in the driver 's seat , " Fink said .
These robots would share information in almost real time .
This type of exploration may one day be used on a mission to Titan , Mars and other planetary bodies .
Current proposals for Titan would use an orbiter , an air balloon and rovers or lake landers .
advertisement
In this mission scenario , an orbiter would circle Titan with a global view of the moon , with an air balloon or airship floating overhead to provide a birds - eye view of mountain ranges , lakes and canyons .
On the ground , a rover or lake lander would explore the moon 's nooks and crannies .
The orbiter would " speak " directly to the air balloon and command it to fly over a certain region for a closer look .
This aerial balloon would be in contact with several small rovers on the ground and command them to move to areas identified from overhead .
" This type of exploration is referred to as tier - scalable reconnaissance , " said Fink .
" It 's sort of like commanding a small army of robots operating in space , in the air and on the ground simultaneously . "
A rover might report that it 's seeing smooth rocks in the local vicinity , while the airship or orbiter could confirm that indeed the rover is in a dry riverbed -- unlike current missions , which focus only on a global view from far above but can't provide information on a local scale to tell the rover that indeed it is sitting in the middle of dry riverbed .
A current example of this type of exploration can best be seen at Mars with the communications relay between the rovers and orbiting spacecraft like the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
However , that information is just relayed and not shared amongst the spacecraft or used to directly control them .
" We are basically heading toward making robots that command other robots , " said Fink , who is director of Caltech 's Visual and Autonomous Exploration Systems Research Laboratory , where this work has taken place .
" One day an entire fleet of robots will be autonomously commanded at once .
This armada of robots will be our eyes , ears , arms and legs in space , in the air , and on the ground , capable of responding to their environment without us , to explore and embrace the unknown , " he added .
Papers describing this new exploration are published in the journal Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine and in the Proceedings of the SPIE .

Negative effects from daily multivitamins , vitamins vs. supplements , creatine , soy , Biotest Tribex Gold
Q&A with Mike Furci
Furci Home / Fitness Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Hello ,
I just happened along your article after ordering two bottles of Alpha Male off the BioTest Web site and immediately cancelled my order .
Thank you for mentioning that the ingredient vitex agnus castus could cause such unwanted effects !
I was wondering if there was a tribulus product you felt was effective and safe .
Also , is it necessary to take an estrogen blocker , such as 6 - OXO , along with a tribulus product ?
Thank you for your time !
Sincerely ,
Joe
Joe ,
Tribex Gold from Biotest works well .
You can get it from the same Web site you bought Alpha Male from .
I spent hours and hours trying to find the evidence that vitex agnus was beneficial for men to take , and that it had the benefits the manufacturer claims .
I found nothing that convinced me it was something a male should take .
In fact , I found just the opposite .
Alphamale was a great product I took in the past .
I e-mailed Biotest , and posted on their forum , asking for the research stating vitex agnus ’ benefits .
Although they are a good company , they never responded .
Unfortunately , I will not take it or recommend it as long as it contains vitex agnus .
Do you need to take an anti-estrogen like 6 - OXO ?
No .
Your endogenous testosterone will not go so high while taking Tribex Gold that you ’ll be producing too much estrogen .
Will taking 6 - OXO help reduce your estrogen levels , which does have benefits like increasing your natural testosterone levels ?
Absolutely .
I would alternate them each month if you ’re trying to save money .
However , if you can take both at the same time , have at it .
They work through different mechanisms .
Mike
Mike ,
I ’m currently taking a multivitamin because I ’m trying to change my health for the better .
Is this a good choice ?
Should I be taking other supplements ?
Sergio
Sergio ,
Short answer : no .
Multivitamins are a waste because the absorption is so poor .
Some vitamins and minerals compete with one another , making absorption even worse .
What I take : Vitamin D ( most important ) 10,000 iu per day ; Vitamin A once per week 5000iu ; CoQ10 100 mg / day ; Omega - 3 fish oil ; conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA ) ; and I cook with coconut and olive oils .
I recommend reading my article " Daily Consumption for Optimum Health , " and here are a few other websites to consult :
Vitamin D Council
WestonaPrice.org
Vitamin - D- Max.com ( this is where I purchase vitamin D )
VitaCost.com ( this is where I get Omega - 3 , CLA and CoQ10 . )
TheraBiotics.net ( this is where I get my probiotics )
( continued from Sergio ) :
Awesome !
This is exactly the info I am looking for .
I am trying to change my life around , a little at a time .
Rather than trying to change a million things at once , I am making changes really slowly so they will stick .
For the past year , I have been cooking all my own food for the family , cutting out eating out .
Thanks for all the advice !
Sergio ,
That ’s an excellent game plan .
Nothing will affect your health more than what you eat .
Remember , it ’s what you eat , not how much you eat .
" Everything in Moderation " is another article on things to avoid that will help make good food choices .
Hi Mike ,
I read your Q & A from 8/23/06 .
One of the questions was regarding creatine and weight loss .
I want to build muscle , but I still have some fat to lose .
I ’m not concerned with overall “ weight loss . ” just a loss in body fat .
I ’m currently consuming about 1,200 net calories per day .
I ’ve only been lifting for about a month and I ’m not very strong .
I weigh 152 pounds at 5 - foot - 8 , with about 33 percent body fat .
Should I go ahead and start supplementing with creatine now to get stronger , or wait until the fat is gone and I ’m actually working on gaining ( and eating to gain ) ?
Also , I should note that I ’m vegan and do not get any creatine in my diet .
I 'm currently supplementing L - L - carnitine and protein .
Thank you ,
Victoria F .
Victoria ,
Is the reason you 're a vegan a moral one , or do you believe eating any animal products is unhealthy ?
If it ’s a moral one I can understand it .
If it ’s a health issue , I recommend you start doing some real research .
Humans are in no way made or evolved to be vegans .
We are physiologically dependent on consuming quality protein from animal sources .
The broad differences in anatomy between man and herbivores are evidence that man did not , and should not , live on a diet high in plant foods , especially those rich in carbohydrates .
Humans are carnivorous animals .
The Stone Age diet , Dr. Walter Voegtlin challenges , was primarily one of a meat and fat eater .
Like the carnivorous dog , our jaws move in a vertical motion .
An herbivore ’s jaw moves in a rotary fashion .
We have canine teeth , and ridged molars and incisors designed for crushing and tearing .
Unlike the herbivores that lack canines and have flat molars , mastication is unnecessary and we do not ruminate or chew cud .
Our stomachs hold two quarts , empty in about three hours , secrete hydrochloric acid , lack bacteria and cannot digest cellulose .
An herbivorous sheep ’s stomach holds eight and a half gallons , never empties , digests cellulose , and bacteria are vital to its function .
An herbivore ’s stomach does n’t secrete hydrochloric acid , which is primarily for the digestion of protein .
Carnivores like man feed intermittently , while herbivores continuously feed ( graze ) .
An herbivores digestive tract is five times the size of man ’s relative to body size .
Unlike herbivores , human colons are short and rectums are small , and do not contribute to digestion .
Man ’s gall bladder has a vital function and is well developed .
The bladder function of an herbivore is weak or nonexistent because of the lack of fat in their diet .
The volume of feces from man is small because our digestion efficiency borders on 100 percent .
An herbivore ’s feces are voluminous because their digestive efficiency is less than or equal to 50 percent , and they must eat large quantities of food .
Being a vegan , despite what you may have been told or read , has several drawbacks nutritionally .
I ’m going to assume that the protein you take is of a plant origin ?
And if you ’re like many vegans you are probably consuming soy products .
Soy is one of the most - processed and unhealthy foods there is .
We have been led to believe that soy is a health food .
However , contained in the United States Food and Drug Administration ’s Poisonous Plant Database ( which contains references to the scientific literature describing studies of the toxic properties and effects of plants and plant parts ) there are 288 records under soy .
Several different substances cause the deleterious effects that soy has on our bodies .
I ’m just going to go over a few for you .
One of the substances contained in soybeans , which remains in soy products like protein , is goitrogens .
These are naturally occurring and interfere with the function of the thyroid gland .
Goitrogens get their name from the term “ goiter , ” which means enlargement of the thyroid gland .
Thirty grams of soy protein per day – about three tablespoons – has been shown to disrupt and slow thyroid function .
Thyroid disease is rampant in Asian societies and is increasing in the U.S .
Foods that contain goitrogens include broccoli , cabbage , mustard , peanuts , turnips , brussels sprouts and others .
However , unlike soy , cooking or fermentation easily neutralizes the goitrogens in these foods .
Heat , pressure or alkaline solutions used to process soy neither deactivates nor removes goitrogens from soy end products .
They are virtually in all soy foods ; the highest concentration being in products that are not fermented , like tofu , modern soy sauce , baby formula and -- you guessed it -- protein .
Another nasty substance contained in soy protein and other products that can inflict damage on your body are phytoestrogens .
Isoflavones are examples of phytoestrogens and are in many plants , with the highest concentration being in soybeans .
Phytoestrogens , although not hormones , are very similar and can bind to estrogen receptor sites and have been shown to cause negative effects .
Do yourself a favor and read the “ Whole Soy Story ” by Kaayla Daniel .
Do not succumb to the soy industry ’s ad campaigns and some in the supplement industry that claim soy protein is on equal ground with protein derived from milk .
It ’s not even close .
The only reason companies use this garbage is simply because it ’s inexpensive , not because of its quality .
The more quality protein you eat , the more fat you burn as fuel .
Protein consumption is directly related to thermo-genesis and satiety through multiple mechanisms .
A plant - based diet is in conflict with your goals .
And to answer your creatine question , I would n’t start to take it yet .
Get a good six months to a year of lifting under your belt .
You ’re just not going to benefit as a novice lifter .
Being a vegan , creatine is not your only worry as far as deficiency goes .
For instance , the only Vitamin B12 available in plant form is an analog and does nothing for humans .
You ’re not going to get much from the supplement L - carnitine .
You ’d be better off using an Omega - 3 supplement .
Read Daily Consumption .
Like I said , if you have a moral dilemma with eating animal - based protein I can respect that , but hopefully for our goals and overall health , you might want to try milk - based proteins to supplement with .
Good luck ,
Mike
( continued from Victoria ) :
Hi Mike , thank you so much for taking the time to reply to me .
I ’m vegan because it is ethically the right choice for me personally .
I know there are arguments for and against veganism as it relates to health , and both sides show evidence to support their claims .
I ’m not here to argue about the pros or cons of veganism -- that ’s just not my thing .
It ’s my choice .
I do n’t care if we ’re not meant to be vegan .
I do n’t think of soy as health food , it ’s just a necessary part of my diet .
No one will ever convince me to eat animal products , and I ’m not trying to get anyone not to eat them .
More importantly , it ’s not the point here .
I only mentioned it as it related to the specific question I asked .
If you have a chance , would you please elaborate on the answer you gave to my question ?
I would like to understand why a novice would not benefit from creatine , and also why you think L - carnitine is n’t helpful to me .
I am already supplementing Omega - 3 and B - 12 .
I really appreciate your advice and am looking forward to your response .
Thank you again for your time .
Victoria F .
Victoria ,
I respect your decision to be a vegan .
You ’re doing what you believe is the right choice ethically without imposing on others .
We need more like you .
I would never try to convince somebody like yourself to eat animal products ; however I do feel it is my obligation to educate people when it concerns their health .
Before I get to creatine and L - carnitine , I am asking that you start to educate yourself about soy consumption .
Soy is one of the worst foods you can consume .
Soy ’s effects are in direct opposition to what you ’re trying to accomplish .
“ The Whole Soy Story , ” will at least show you what products are the least harmful .
You must remember , however , that even the fermented varieties of soy , which have the least amount of anti-nutrients , are not made the same way they were for centuries in Asian communities .
Please be careful .
Carnitine is one of those supplements that have been shown to mobilize fat for fuel .
However , this is to such a small degree it is truly a waste to consume .
Omega - 3s , which are also one of the healthiest substances you can consume , are much more effective than carnitine .
O - 3s also work by curbing your appetite .
Take O - 3s with every meal and make sure to get at least 3 to 4 grams per day ; take more if you can afford it .
Creatine is one of the most - studied sports supplements , and is truly a fantastic substance .
Is it going to hurt you to take it as a novice ?
Absolutely not .
Will it help ?
It may .
However , it is important to get solid basics before adding in extras .
Your goal is to build muscle and lose fat .
What burns fat as fuel ?
Muscle .
Muscle drives the metabolism .
The more muscle you have the faster your metabolism is .
To build muscle you need to get stronger , period .
It ’s that simple .
Yet legions of people fail at this daily , monthly and yearly , despite -- in many cases -- taking supplements .
One must learn how to train to create the exact stimulus necessary to elicit an adaptive response .
This stimulus is intensity .
Only when a muscle is contracting with the greatest possible force can there be maximum intensity , which elicits the maximum adaptive response .
Training with intensity is a learned skill .
Creatine will help you gain strength and muscle only if you ’re training and recovering properly , and creatine ’s efficacy is a result of proper training .
I do not recommend any supplements to a novice except quality protein , which is a prerequisite for building muscle and good health .
I hope this helps .
Mike
( continued from Victoria ) :
Dear Mike ,
Thank you !
That was a very nice e-mail , and very helpful .
I ’m trying to be open minded about your advice to incorporate milk protein into my diet , but at the moment I ’m having trouble getting past my aversion to dairy products .
I ’m going to give it some serious consideration , and I intend to further investigate what you ’re telling me about soy .
I ’m glad you brought these things to my attention .
Thank you again ; I really appreciate your time and insight .

Investors are celebrating an incipient “ recovery , ” but the interventions responsible are sowing the seeds of a more violent contraction down the road .
The problem , quite simply , is debt .
We ’ve accumulated record amounts , yet many economists tell us we need more .
Leading the charge is Paul Krugman .
He exhorts us to borrow our way back to prosperity , but he does n’t acknowledge that his brand of Keynesian economics ignores debt ’s consequences .
If you look at a chart of America ’s total debt burden , he ’s leading us over a cliff .
( Click chart to enlarge in new window )
The problem begins with the flawed way Krugman and other economists measure well - being .
Primarily , they look at measures of activity , like GDP .
These tell us how much people spend , but say nothing about where we get the money .
Every so often , we overextend ourselves , buying too much useless stuff with too much borrowed money .
So we cut back , dumping the third family car and swapping the McMansion for a townhome .
But this is problematic for Krugman and other economists .
Less spending means falling GDP .
It means “ recession . ”
They ride to the rescue with two blunt instruments — monetary and fiscal policy — that encourage more borrowing and thus more spending .
More spending equals “ growth ” so economists congratulate themselves for engineering “ recovery . ”
But if recessions never happen , bad businesses and unpayable debts are never washed away .
They grow like cancer inside the system .
Since the mid-1980s , we ’ve intervened whenever the economy hiccuped , so sectors that should have shrunk sharply — like housing and finance — never did .
Feasting on easy credit , these sectors have exploded as a percentage of the economy .
Now , since individuals and corporations refuse to borrow more , the only way to grow spending is for the government to borrow .
According to George Cooper , author of The Origin of Financial Crises , “ what is missing from today ’s debate is recognition that previous growth rates were artificially supported by an unsustainable credit binge , itself the result of the misapplication of Keynesian policy . ”
Cooper counts himself a Keynesian but says Keynesian policy has become “ dangerously distorted . ”
“ We should be using Keynesian stimulus only to arrest the rate of credit contraction not to reverse it .
The harsh truth is that our economies desperately need a recession . ”
That ’s because they desperately need to de-lever .
As you can see in the first chart , debt relative to GDP is at record highs .
If we want sustainable growth , spending that drives it must come from savings , not more borrowing .
To get there , we must first pay old debts .
And that means recession .
Krugman is clearly aware of the consequences of excessive borrowing .
“ I ’m terrified about what will happen to interest rates once financial markets wake up to the implications of skyrocketing budget deficits , ” he wrote in 2003 , citing a $ 1.8 trillion 10 - year deficit projection from the Congressional Budget Office .
Fast forward six years , total debt has jumped 70 percent relative to GDP and optimistic projections put the 10 - year deficitat $ 9 trillion .
This time , however , Krugman dismisses deficit “ hysteria , ” arguing that we can grow our way out of debt .
“ We did it during the Clinton administration , ” he told me when he visited Reuters last week .
But we did n’t .
While Clinton balanced the federal budget , Americans plowed through their savings .
We kept growing because , in the aggregate , we were still accumulating debt .
( Click chart to enlarge in new window )
Krugman has also argued that we can handle larger deficits because we have in the past .
After all , public debt peaked at 118 percent in 1945 compared with 65 percent today .
Two problems .
First , the argument ignores tens of trillions of unfunded obligations for Medicare and Social Security , debt Krugman loudly lamented in his 2003 column .
It also ignores the higher private debt burden facing us today .
According to economist Steve Keen , “ Private sector debt accumulated in the 1920s was wiped out by the Depression , so in 1945 the private sector ’s debt burden was only 45 percent of GDP .
In that situation it was easy to wind down public debt from levels reached to finance WWII . ”
Today , private debt is a suffocating 300 percent of GDP , making more public debt that much harder to pay down .
We know how this movie ends .
Look at California — or Argentina .
We chortle from afar — “ how did their budget get so out of whack ? ” — yet our own profligacy puts us squarely on that path .
Like them , we ’ve shown no political will to deal with debt .
And so it will deal with us .
But we can print our own currency , you say .
If all else fails , the United States can inflate its way out of debt .
Nonsense .
If we try , our foreign lenders will cut us off .
As Krugman warned in 2003 : “ My prediction is that politicians will eventually be tempted to resolve the ( fiscal ) crisis the way irresponsible governments usually do : by printing money , both to pay current bills and to inflate away debt .
And as that temptation becomes obvious , interest rates will soar . ”
Yet today Krugman is leading the march , arguing that we can borrow indefinitely as long as deflation remains a threat .
Tell that to the Chinese .
What happens when they stop buying our bonds ?
To Cooper ’s point , we ’ll need government intervention to cushion the blow of de-leveraging .
But there ’s a difference between cushioning the blow and reinflating the bubble , which is what we ’re doing , wasting trillions propping up housing and banking .
The risk is that we ’ll have nothing left when we really need it , when the Great Leveraging becomes the Great De-Leveraging .
US and European powers threaten Iran
By Patrick Martin
26 September 2009
In what has all the hallmarks of an orchestrated political provocation , the United States , Britain and France , with the support of Germany , denounced a supposedly secret Iranian nuclear plant , threatened stepped - up economic sanctions and possible military action unless the facility was immediately open to inspection .
In a joint announcement Friday morning at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh , US President Barack Obama , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy appeared together before television cameras to issue the warning .
Germany ’s Chancellor Angela Merkel , who had left Pittsburgh to return home , issued her own statement of support for the threats against Iran .
Obama declared , “ The Iranian government must now demonstrate through deeds its peaceful intentions or be held accountable to international standards and international law . ”
He gave Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad six days to respond — by the time of an October 1 meeting in Geneva .
His approach echoed that of George W. Bush seven years ago in citing an alleged nuclear weapons program as the basis for going to war against Iraq .
This time , however , France has joined the US and Britain in the manufacture of a casus belli .
Both Brown and Sarkozy made even harsher threats than Obama at their joint press conference .
Brown demanded the drawing of “ a line in the sand ” and denounced what he called a shocking “ level of deception by the Iranian government and the scale of what we believe is the breach of international commitments . ”
This from a man who happily embraced all the lies peddled by Bush and Blair throughout the launching and waging of the war with Iraq .
Sarkozy declared , “ If by December there is not an in - depth change by the Iranian leaders , sanctions will have to be taken . ”
In what was taken by observers as a direct threat of military force , he added , “ Everything , everything must be put on the table now .
We cannot let the Iranian leaders gain time while the motors are running . ”
The plant singled out by the imperialist powers is a facility much smaller than the main Iranian nuclear facility at Natanz and has not yet become operational .
Nonetheless , Obama claimed , “ The size and configuration of this facility is inconsistent with a peaceful program . ”
According to figures supplied to the press by US Defense Department officials , Natanz has 8,500 centrifuges and room for many more , while the previously undisclosed facility , near the city of Qom , about 100 miles southwest of Tehran , can operate about 3,000 centrifuges .
This equipment is not in and of itself of military value , since the use of centrifuges is an essential part of the generation of fuel for nuclear reactors , by purifying uranium to the level of 3 to 5 percent concentration of the isotope uranium 235 .
Weapons - grade uranium requires a much higher concentration of U - 235 , as much as 75 to 80 percent .
The Iranian government sent a letter Monday , September 21 , to the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations agency that monitors civilian nuclear power operations , informing it of the existence of the previously undisclosed plant , but not detailing its location or scale .
IAEA spokesman Marc Vidricaire said : “ I can confirm that on September 21 Iran informed the IAEA in a letter that a new pilot fuel - enrichment plant is under construction in the country .
The letter stated that the enrichment level would be up to 5 per cent . ”
Subsequent statements from Tehran suggest that the facility is a backup for Natanz , which has been identified as a prime target for air strikes by Israel or the United States .
Israeli officials have repeatedly suggested that they will undertake such a military assault by the end of this year unless Iran surrenders to the US - led pressure campaign and dismantles its nuclear program .
The plant is built into a mountainside , making it more difficult to target militarily .
The location only 20 miles from Qom makes a military strike more dangerous politically as well , since the city is a long - established center of Shiite Islam with many seminaries .
The American media immediately took its lead from Obama , Brown and Sarkozy , raising a hue and cry over the Qom plant , without the slightest evidence portraying it as a factory for making atomic bombs and a danger to the world .
The plant is not even in operation yet , and the maximum degree of purification of uranium achieved by Iran at any plant is 5 percent , adequate only for a nuclear fuel cycle , not weapons production .
Citing “ a US counter - proliferation official , ” Newsweek magazine reported on its web site :
“ The reason why the US and other countries think this facility is probably intended for producing highly - enriched uranium for weapons is that it is too small for the kind of plant that would be needed to enrich the large quantities of uranium needed for a civilian power program … . ”
The opposite argument has been repeatedly made about the Natanz facility — that its size greatly exceeds the requirements of a civilian fuel generation plant .
In other words , whatever facts are available can be twisted to suit the purpose of those who are seeking to provoke a direct conflict between the major powers and Iran , which could become the pretext for efforts to overthrow the Iranian regime and install one more amenable to the dictates of US imperialism .
US intelligence officials have readily admitted that the existence of the Qom facility has been known for a year or more .
Press reports said the Bush administration specifically briefed Obama on the “ secret ” plant in discussions during the presidential transition .
Obama in turn informed Russian President Dmitri Medvedev earlier this week , after obtaining his support for tougher sanctions .
The timing of this “ revelation ” demonstrates that the sudden campaign of publicity and threats is a provocation , set to coincide with the opening of the UN General Assembly session , the G20 summit , and next Thursday ’s talks in Geneva between Iran and the so - called P5+1 group — the five permanent members of the UN Security Council , the US , China , Russia , Britain and France , plus Germany .
There has been a carefully prepared buildup to the October 1 talks , which will now feature an ultimatum from the six powers to Iran , with a deadline as early as December for the imposition of draconian economic sanctions , possibly including a ban on gasoline imports .
While Iran has huge oil and natural gas reserves — the real reason for the US - led campaign — it lacks the refining capacity to fully supply its domestic market with gasoline and diesel fuel .
Over the past 10 days , the Obama administration announced a shift in its missile defense policy , abandoning Bush administration plans for missile bases and radar stations in Poland and the Czech Republic , in order to obtain Russian support for a tougher line with Iran .
Then came Obama ’s speech to the UN General Assembly Wednesday , followed by a Security Council session chaired personally by Obama , which adopted a general resolution opposing nuclear proliferation , and then Friday morning ’s sensational announcement .
US press reports suggest that a major purpose of the Security Council meeting and the Friday press offensive was to induce China , the last holdout among the P5+1 , to drop its opposition to much tighter economic sanctions against Iran .
China voted for the Security Council resolution , which passed unanimously .
High - ranking Democratic Party leaders lined up behind Obama ’s bellicose posture .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the Qom plant “ a clear challenge to the international community . …
This facility sharpens our sense of urgency and underscores Iran ’s absolute need to engage seriously with us on October 1 and take immediate steps to demonstrate the exclusively peaceful nature of their nuclear program . ”
Senator John Kerry , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , issued a statement saying , “ In light of Iran ’s continuing deception , the international community must step up its demands that Iran halt its enrichment and reprocessing work . ”
A major argument being made behind the scenes — albeit openly in the US right - wing press — is that sanctions are the only alternative to an Israeli air attack on Iran that would have incalculable consequences for the peoples of the Middle East , and the entire world
A column posted on the web site of the Wall Street Journal , written by Pentagon consultant Anthony Cordesman , suggested that an Israeli attack on Iran could include nuclear weapons .
“ There are reports that Israel is increasing the range - payload of its nuclear - armed missiles and is developing sea - based nuclear - armed cruise missiles for its submarines , ” he observed .
He added , “ While Iran is larger than Israel , its population centers are so vulnerable to Israeli thermonuclear weapons that Israel already is a major ‘ existential ’ threat to Iran . ”
The Washington Post took note of the apocalyptic tone of the speech to the UN General Assembly Thursday by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , which its reporter described as a “ final warning to the world , ” saying that it “ could one day be seen as a milestone in the Mideast ’s march toward war . ”
If they 've delayed your flight by hours , the airline must look after you
To mark National Consumer
Week , here are five laws the canny shopper should be using in their battle to get stuff that actually works .
There is a war being fought between customers and many of the firms they have to deal with .
It is an asymmetric conflict - the little man versus the faceless , bad customer service monoliths .
On the little man 's side there are only newspaper consumer pages and a rather handy selection of laws .
SALE OF GOODS ACT The Headline :
You might not need that five - year extended warranty after all .
The Scenario : Your iconic white MP3 player , the totemic centre of your life , breaks down precisely 366 days after you bought it .
The large electronics firm that sold you the MP3 player says that because the one - year guarantee had elapsed , there 's nothing they can do to help you .
You 'll just have to buy another one .
Some items , like washing machines , are expected to last a long time Tears drip disconsolately on to its lifeless grey screen as you ponder what to do .
But there 's some good news .
The operative who spoke to you did n't know what they were talking about The Truth : The Sale of Goods
Act says that your MP3 player must be fit for purpose .
" It must be as described .
It must be of satisfactory quality , sufficiently durable , free from any defects , " says Dr Christian Twigg - Flesner , a consumer law expert at the University of Hull .
If you 've ignored the manufacturer 's warnings and have been leaving the player out in direct sunshine and wearing it in the bath , then you probably have n't got much of a case .
But if the player has been lovingly treated and has still conked out that suggests something may have been wrong with it at the very beginning .
It works like this .
For the first four - five weeks you have a " right of rejection " - if the item you 've bought breaks down , you can demand a refund .
For the next six months , you are entitled to replacement or repair of the goods .
It is up to the retailer to prove there was nothing wrong with it if they wish to get out of having to do the work .
And then after six months , there is still a duty to replace or repair faulty goods , but the onus is on you , the consumer , to prove that there was something wrong .
And the key time span is six years .
That 's how long goods may be covered by the Sale of Goods Act .
It all depends on what " sufficiently durable " means .
If a light bulb goes after 13 months , the consumer is not going to be overly gutted .
If their washing machine goes after the same time span they are going to be livid .
The government 's guidelines say : " Goods are of satisfactory quality if they reach the standard that a reasonable person would regard as satisfactory , taking into account the price and any description . "
And be aware that if you go to the washing machine repairer , spend money attempting to diagnose an inherent fault , and find out you have been using it the wrong way , then you are going to be out of pocket .
A key fact is that your relationship in the Sale of Goods
Act is with the retailer , not the manufacturer .
" The retailer likes shepherding you off to the manufacturer , " says Dr Twigg - Flesner .
And there are still reasons why you might want an extended warranty - they often include loan machines and ongoing technical support that you would otherwise miss out on .
But they are not always good value , says Dr Twigg - Flesner .
" I 've never bought one . "
Where it applies :
The law applies across the UK , but has numerous small differences as applied in Scotland .
CONSUMER CREDIT ACT
The Headline : Your credit card provider is often liable .
The Scenario :
You 've picked your dream sofa .
It 's an astoundingly cheap £ 500 , you paid by credit card , and you 're very excited .
The day of delivery arrives but no sofa materialises .
You switch on the news and see Astonishinglycheapsofas 'r 'us has gone bust .
It turns out £ 500 was too cheap for a quality sofa .
They 've been losing money hand over fist .
If the sofa firm goes bust all is not lost
You ring the company and an exasperated worker is rather unhelpful .
They tell you 're not going to get your sofa or your money back .
It 's all gone to the liquidators to pay the many creditors .
You quietly burst into tears .
No sofa and your £ 500 is gone .
The Truth :
The good news is it has not .
This is a great case for a refund from your credit card provider under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.
Section 75 only works for credit cards .
And it only works when you 're paying for things that cost between £ 100 and £ 30,000 .
" The bank is ... liable " says Espe Fuentes , a lawyer at Which ?.
" It 's as if they have sold you the sofa . "
The most obvious claim you have , and one that crops up when furniture firms go bust , is for non-delivery of goods .
But if you buy an item and after 13 months it is broken , and the shop that sold you it has gone bust , you can pursue the credit card provider .
The Killer Fact : Even if you only paid for a small part of the price of the goods with your credit card , the provider is still liable .
But bear in mind that the act only applies to single items worth more than £ 100 , not five items of £ 20 .
SUPPLY OF GOODS AND SERVICES ACT The Headline : Services are like goods .
The Scenario :
The garage repairs your car .
You get it out on the road and three days later the same fault crops up again .
The garage refuses to redo the work or compensate you , saying it's all a matter of opinion
This car is broken .
But whose fault is it ?
The Truth : " [ The act ] does the same for services as the Sale of Goods Act does , " says Ms Fuentes .
" The service provided has got to be provided with reasonable skill and care .
The goods bit means the widget has got to be of satisfactory quality . "
In essence , you have rights to put the bad service right .
Either the offending persons must do it , or they must pay for someone else to do it .
Where it applies : England , Wales and Northern Ireland are all covered , but common law in Scotland gives similar rights to the consumer .
DENIED BOARDING REGULATIONS
The Headline : Airlines cannot mess you around with impunity .
The Scenario : A budget airline , Acme Airlines we 'll call them , cancels your flight to a historic eastern European capital .
Oh , and it 's not going to compensate you either .
The Truth : The EU has brought in some regulations that have caused wailing and gnashing of teeth in some sectors of the airline industry .
If you are denied entry to a flight where you met all the boarding criteria - prompt check - in , valid ticket and in a fit state to board - or the flight is cancelled , you now have rights .
Many people have slept in airports over the years Firstly , you get " reimbursement of the cost of the ticket within seven days or a return flight to the first point of departure or re-routing to their final destination " .
You are also entitled to " care " .
The EU 's summary mentions " refreshments , meals , hotel accommodation , transport between the airport and place of accommodation , two free telephone calls , telex or fax messages , or e-mails " .
And you 're in line for compensation of 250 euros for all flights of 1,500 km .
You get 400 euros for all flights within the EU of more than 1,500 km , and the same for all other flights between 1,500 and 3,500 km .
All other flights get you 600 euros .
Compensation only applies to cancellation , not delay .
The airline can avoid compensation if passengers are notified at least two weeks before departure .
And if they are notified less than two weeks before , and are re-routed with only minor delays , they will also not be compensated .
There are rights for people who are delayed .
Different levels of delay entitle customers to different levels of care , while any delay of more than five hours allows a refund to be obtained , although obviously , you will not be any closer to your destination .
But the legislation contains a glorious get - out for airlines .
In " extraordinary circumstances " , they do not have to compensate passengers .
There is a great temptation for airlines to say that staffing shortages or technical faults are " extraordinary circumstances " .
But this get - out may not continue much longer .
" The European Court of Justice has cracked down , " says Dr Twigg - Flesner .
" Technical problems are not extraordinary circumstances . "
Where it applies :
The regulations are European law , so apply across the whole of the EU .
DISTANCE SELLING REGULATIONS
The Headline :
When it comes to buying over the web , you 're allowed to change your mind
If this is involved , it may be a job for the Distance Selling regs Scenario :
You buy an iconic white MP3 player from an online retailer as a birthday treat for yourself and , stone the crows , your aunt has only gone and bought you an iconic white MP3 player herself .
Yours is unopened so you try and return it , but the online retailer refuses to give you a refund .
The Truth : The Distance Selling Regulations allow customers a cooling - off period of seven working days .
For goods , this counts from the day after the goods are delivered .
For services , it 's seven working days from the contract being agreed .
This applies to all transactions carried out over a distance , not just to online transactions .
In a nutshell , you can get your refund .
But there are some things you should be aware of , says Ms Fuentes .
" You do have to bear in mind who pays the postage . "
And , she says , there are a range of things that are excluded : newspapers , magazines , personalised goods , flowers , food , software where the seal is broken , clothes that have been worn other than just to try them on , hotel bookings , and transport tickets .
Where it applies :
The law applies across the UK , but has some differences as applied in Scotland and Northern Ireland .
SMALL CLAIMS COURT
Obviously , the preferred course of action for most people is that the errant firm admits its mistake and settles your claim after the first letter .
For some people , writing to a newspaper consumer page offers an avenue to encourage haste on the company 's part .
But the ultimate recourse for most people - when the company is not budging an inch - is the small claims court , which costs a small fee to use , but can be used without the need for a solicitor .
Here is a selection of your comments .
I work for the County Court and often see articles like this implying that Small Claims Court is an easy solution when , in fact , it is n't always the best route .
The fee for initiating a claim will be somewhere between £ 25 - £ 1530 depending on the amount you are claiming , then there are further charges if the case actually goes to hearing .
It 's not enough to just be aggrieved and believe you are entitled to compensation , you must have documentary evidence to support your case to be in with a good chance of winning , especially when claiming from one of the larger companies .
I would strongly urge anyone who is considering issuing a claim in Court to also consider the option of Mediation .
It can often be more effective to negotiate for a reasonable sum of money .
The Court has a Small Claims Mediation Service which can be used by the majority of litigants and has an excellent success rate .
Louise , Bucks , UK I purchased a car from a BMW dealer in the midlands ( over 100 miles from my home ) .
When the car was delivered I was told that I could n't test drive it until it was paid for .
A couple of days later I changed my mind and asked the dealer to take the car back , they tried to sting me for £ 3000 .
I argued that the sale was covered under the Distant Selling Regulations but they refused to accept this .
They stated that the sale was not a distant sale because the delivery driver has concluded the business at my home .
The local Trading Standards office agreed with me , but the dealer would n't budge .
Eventually they did take the car back minus a £ 1500 credit note that I could n't use .
Trading Standards should prosecute these large retailers who bully consumers .
Philip Stone , Reading I purchased a top of the range washing machine which broke down three times .
the first two times were in the first year but the third was in the 13th month .
The retailer said I was not covered by any warranty and would have to pay for repairs .
However I stated that as this was a top of the line washing machine it should reasonably last more than 13 months and quoted the sale of good act .
To my dismay the retailer fobbed me off and stuck to their guns .
I rang the manufacturer directly and stated that even though responsibility was with the retailer they were the ones who actually manufactured the product and stated they refund me my money or i would pop down to their head office in a van and leave the washing machine outside .
Money back no problems !
Moral : quoting the sale of goods act will often mean nothing , stating you will turn up at HQ and give them bad publicity seems to be more effective .

Some retailers know the law and apply it without question .
I had an LCD monitor / TV which developed a fault just as it was three years old .
I emailed the firm , quoting the six years fit for purposes etc etc ... replacement monitor / TV delivered 24hrs later .
I did buy it direct from the firm so they were the retailer and manufacturer in my case .
H Carter , Bracknell , Berkshire I have just had a major argument between a manufacturer and a retailer over a vacuum cleaner which did n't work .
Each tried to palm me off on the other .
The " customer services " of the retailer just told me lies .
However a letter direct to the retailers chief executive sorted the issue in two days and got a gift voucher to say sorry .
Whenever I have had issues with a firm , I have found a letter sent to the named chief executive and marked private has results much quicker than talking to the half wit in customer services .
Bandsman , Coventry
We spent around £ 1000 buying a TV , TV table and DVD / video player .
The TV went wrong twice before the first year was up .
They said it would be days before they would be able to collect it for repair and they did not have a loaner until it came back .
They also said it was our problem when it broke down again just after the year was up for not taking out the extended warranty .
We are OAPs and the money we were already spending with them was enough at the time .
We had it done privately .
Finally it went wrong again and we were told it was no longer repairable .
It was around two years old .
We took the firm to Small Claims Court and lost .
We have been without a TV since January and watch catchup showings of the shows we like on broadband on my laptop .
The money is gone and we have nothing to show for it .
Not very fair , is it ?
Anon ,
East yorks I wonder if there is ever going to be any protection for small businesses from the consumer ?
Threats and blackmail are often used to gain refunds for items which have been clearly damaged by the consumer .
I thought we were meant to be a country encouraging innovation and small businesses , but in reality the consumer will get the support every time .
I guess there will be more space for more Starbucks on the high street though .
Mike , Derbyshire
It 's also worth mentioning that following my appalling experience with a large electricals retailer and subsequent phone calls to a support department despite the fact the product was a day old and should have been immediately exchanged , I took the product back , and that was n't without some moaning and groaning from the staff .
I then wrote to their head office and , despite the fact I had received a full refund , managed to negotiate the reimbursement of 30 - 40 minutes of premium rate phone calls on my mobile ( my only means of communication ) as long as I could provide the bill .
Simon Hitchenson , London
With regard to the Distance Selling Regs , you should have added the advice as published by the OFT under section 3.58 of the " guide for businesses on distance selling " ie " Can I insist that consumers who cancel an order within the cancellation period return the goods as new or in their original packaging ?
No .
Consumers are under a duty to take reasonable care of the goods while in their possession as discussed in paragraph 3.44 .
The DSRs allow consumers to examine goods they have ordered as they would in a shop .
If that requires opening the packaging and trying out the goods then they have not breached their duty to take reasonable care of the goods .
In these circumstances you cannot insist that consumers return the goods as new or in their original packaging .
You may ask consumers to return goods with the original packaging , but you cannot insist on this .
In the case of goods such as earrings that have hygiene seals , you may require consumers to exercise reasonable care by not removing the seals when examining them . "
Roman Haraburda , Coventry
Why do all of these articles portray all retailers as somehow trying to trick their customers ?
Most of us will try hard to resolve issues in a fair and reasonable manner and will go over and above the letter of the law to resolve issues .
It is worth pointing out though that , in many cases , it is difficult for the consumer to prove that a fault has been inherent from the date of purchase .
Jennifer , Milton Keynes
I 'm currently in dispute with a well - known high street retailer selling over the internet via an equally well - known online seller .
An mp3 player which they described as " brand new " is clearly a secondhand customer return with scratches all over the back of it and a faulty lead .
Getting a refund is like getting blood out of a stone .
Probably I will just have to write off the money to experience .
Otiscrow , Leicester
Don't forget to tell the readers that as long as they win in Small Claims , they can also recover the court filing fees .
Mark Stevens , London , UK I bought a frost free freezer and after 17 months it developed a fault .
I rang Consumer Direct who took me through the steps to take with the supplier .
I actually had to quote the Sales of Goods
Act to them ( as they were fobbing me off as I did not have extended warranty and the 12 months standard guarantee had expired ) .
I was told I needed an independent report stating the fault which turned out to be a manufacturing fault and I eventually obtained a new freezer to the value of the old plus reimbursement of the cost of the report .
I would not have had the success without contacting Consumer Direct first and knowing exactly what steps to take and standing my ground .
Mrs Yvonne Preston , Wakefield , West Yorkshire
One thing to note is that you are not covered by the Consumer Credit Act as you might think when using it through third - parties such as Paypal ; Paypal is not a financial institution .
If goods are n't received or there 's some kind of issue , you are n't covered by the act and have to raise the issue with Paypal using their dispute process .
Karen Chalmers , London I bought a £ 20 printer cartridge once .
It turned out not to fit my machine so the next day I returned it .
I was told that because I had removed it from its silver package , that I could n't return it in exchange for the correct cartridge .
I left the unused cartridge on the counter and left .
I have never returned to that shop again , preferring to travel the extra distance rather than offer them my custom .
How many hundreds of pounds are they likely to have lost in sales from me for just one small incident .
I fume today not because of the £ 20 but for the arrogance of the assistant who I 'm sure was in breach of the act .
The shop has since closed down .
Unlikely to be of my doing but good riddance to it !
I can't stand being ripped off .
It does my head in .
Paul Smith , Coventry
For instance , my family has a washing machine less than two years old that suddenly had an electronic fault error code displayed on it 's screen .
we contacted the company from where it was bought and stated that since it was less than two years old we were seeking a repair under the terms of SOGA .
Every advisor we spoke to stated that since it was over a year old and we had no warranty we would have to pay in excess of £ 100 to have it fixed nor were we able to seek compensation for the period we were unable to use it .
It became evident after contacting their head office , who denied a washing machine should last more than a year , that they were waiting to see just how far we were willing to go i.e. would we take it to a small claims court .
This experience is also reported by others for this company on various internet forums .
Eventually after a month of hassle and having to use family and friends washing machines we agreed to pay a 1/3 of the cost just to get it fixed as further delay was affecting our lives and a replacement machine in the meantime we were told was unavailable .
M Roarty , Lanarkshire Distance selling regulations are often kept quiet by on - line retailers .
I once bought an expensive computer monitor on - line .
It had a bright green dot in the middle of the screen - most annoying .
First , the vendor said they would not accept returns for defective pixels .
Then they tried to charge me a 15 % " restocking fee " .
Both these conditions turned out to be a violation of the distance selling regulations .
After consulting Trading Standards , who helped me with the cover letter , I got a refund less postage , which I wrote off to experience .

Also on the little person 's side in the UK are advice agencies such as the Citizens Advice Bureaux and law centres .

What 's the opinion on a laptop battery ?
Even extended warranties do n't cover them .
I 've got a laptop with three years at home coverage and a battery that 's only covered for 12 months .
John , Solihull , UK I recently bought a new PC on the internet .
While waiting for it to arrive I was showing a friend the specification on their site .
Imagine my surprise when the unit price had dropped by £ 180 .
After checking the web I found I was entitled to return the goods for whatever reason within 7 days .
I rang them up and said I was going to return the goods and reorder it at the new price .
Return carriage would have cost me about £ 20 , with the same again on the new unit .
I offered them the chance to save the hassle and reimburse me out right .
One quick chat to his line manager and the funds were credited to my account !
Puggs , Manchester
I would like to point out that all the above are at least wholly or partially due to EU law , not just the Air Passenger Regulation ( Disclosure : I work for the European Commission ) .
There is a proposal for a new consumer rights directive currently working its way through the Brussels machine which will improve consumer rights even more .
The EU is also responsible for improving cross border enforcement and improving awareness among consumers of their rights .
Finally there is now an EU cross border small claims procedure for to help resolve problems abroad .
Kevin O'Connor , Brussels
The distance selling regulations only apply to individuals .
Purchases for business are not covered , even if you 're a sole trader .
If it 's bought in the business 's name , then the regulation does n't apply .
I got burned by this a while ago and it cost me quite a bit of money and inconvenience when a computer I bought for my business was n't the right one and the retailer refused to take it back .
Simon Wilcox , London , UK I was flying back from Toronto to London on a national airline , when a mechanical fault caused a four hour delay .
We landed in London at 1 am , after all public transportation had closed , resulting in a £ 76 taxi ride to my house .
The airline refused to refund me for my taxi , despite their plane being the cause of our delay .
Transport Canada was similarly unhelpful after I wrote to them as well , claiming the " extraordinary circumstances " scenario .
The thing is , a few months earlier , they had rerouted me and put me in a hotel after a similar mechanical fault , after a 24 hour delay , so it seemed strange that they did n't even give me a phone call for a " mere " four hour delay .
Fingers crossed that the new rules help us all .

Scareware slingers have poisoned search results for Google Wave in a bid to expose users seeking the communication software to a fake anti-virus scan instead .
Ironically , Google searches for terms related to Google Wave return results that point to sites hosting rogue antivirus , net security firm Websense warns .
Google invited only 100,000 users to test its Google Wave collaboration service , a factor that has arguably increased interest in the service while also increasing the potency of fake offers for the service that actually promote malware .
Surfers also need to be wary about hunting for Microsoft 's new freebie anti-malware scanner via search engines .
Websense further warns that scareware distributors have poisoned search engine results so that sites passing off fake anti-virus scanners appear prominently in searches for Microsoft Security Essentials .
Both the Google Wave and Microsoft Security Essentials attacks rely on black hat Search Engine Optimisation techniques .
Wrongdoers typically break into well - established sites and create webpages stuffed full with relevant keywords , cross - linked to other sites compromised in the same way .
The tactic is designed to trick search engines into pushing doctored sites higher in search engine indexes for relevant terms .
Malicious scripts on compromised sites are established to forwarding prospective marks arriving via Google towards scareware download sites . ®

Men lie six times a day and twice as often as women , study finds
Men tell twice as many lies as women , it emerged yesterday .
Researchers found they tell six fibs a day on average to their partner , boss and work colleagues , but women come out with just three .
The study of 2,000 Britons also revealed that the most common lie told by both sexes was : ' Nothing 's wrong , I 'm fine . '
Fibbing : A study has found men tell 42 lies a week - twice as many as women ( Posed by models )
While men are likely to fib about having their last pint and claiming their partner 's behind does n't look too big , women avoid telling the truth about their latest shopping purchases .
Eighty - three per cent of adults of both sexes said they could easily tell if their partner was lying .
But body language expert Richard Newman said : ' Most people can't read the signals .
' They assume that if someone is hiding the truth , they would hide their face and avoid eye contact .
In fact , the opposite is true .
' Liars usually do everything they can to convince you of the truth , sitting still and looking at you to watch your reaction .
' People simply overestimate their skills in this area . '
The findings emerged in a poll by 20th Century Fox to mark the DVD launch of TV series Lie To Me , starring Tim Roth as a deception expert who helps to solve crimes .

Resigning in protest is not in the American grain .
Robert McNamara stuck around as Secretary of Defense even after he decided that the Vietnam War was a disaster ; Colin Powell did the same during the Bush Administration ’s push for war with Iraq ; and in the lead - up to the financial crisis , few high - profile executives stepped down over disagreements in philosophy or tactics .
But resigning in protest has gained popularity of late among an unlikely group : big corporations .
Last Monday , Apple announced that it would be quitting the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because of the Chamber ’s opposition to global - warming legislation .
And that was just the latest in a series of defections : in the past few weeks , the public - utility companies Pacific Gas & Electric , PNM Resources , and Exelon all announced that they ’d be leaving the Chamber , while Nike quit the organization ’s board of directors .
Historically speaking , this is a positive exodus .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
The Chamber of Commerce wo n’t be going out of business anytime soon , of course : it still has three million members , mostly small businesses , and a gargantuan lobbying budget .
Still , the decidedly public nature of these corporate departures — the companies made statements attacking the Chamber for obstructionism — complicates its claim to be representing the collective interests of American business .
One of the great strengths of business lobbies in recent decades has been their ability to maintain a united front .
Global warming has revealed fractures in that façade .
It ’s no surprise that the climate - change debate has become a flashpoint for the Chamber , since it encompasses everything that the organization routinely opposes : regulation , taxation , and a bigger role for government .
The Chamber was once considered more moderate than harder - line cousins like the National Association of Manufacturers .
But that ’s changed .
Back in 1971 , the future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell wrote a famous memo to the Chamber , arguing that the organization needed to become the center of an aggressive defense of the free - enterprise system , which Powell felt was under broad attack .
How influential the memo was is still debated , but , over the years , the Chamber became the organization Powell wanted it to be , becoming more ideologically cohesive and playing a key role in blocking consumer - protection legislation , labor - law reform , and financial regulation .
Its opposition to regulation now seems reflexive ; at the moment , its legislative priorities include opposing a consumer financial - protection agency , opposing a shareholder bill of rights , and opposing “ flawed health care proposals , ” which seems to mean any health - care proposal made by a Democrat .
And , while the Chamber does acknowledge that the threat of global warming is real , it has been unbending in its opposition to the current cap - and - trade proposal , and a senior official has called for a “ Scopes monkey trial ” to debate the science of climate change .
These stands may make most members of the Chamber happy : small business is the backbone of American conservatism , after all .
But the hard line on global warming may also reflect dynamics that typically shape group behavior .
In any large group , a few people do most of the work — usually those who are most ideologically committed or who have a direct stake in a particular outcome .
So decisions often end up reflecting not the wishes of the group as a whole but those of its most engaged members .
In the case of climate - change legislation like cap - and - trade , many of the companies on the Chamber ’s board of directors actually support it .
But among the few that publicly oppose it are coal companies , which have a huge stake in stopping any carbon - pricing system .
So it ’s not surprising that the Chamber ’s general approach is closer to Massey Energy ’s than to Nike’s .
These dynamics are familiar .
But major companies ’ leaving the Chamber rather than accept its policies is new .
During the debate over health - care reform in the early nineties , for instance , the Chamber ended up coming out against the Clinton health plan without losing the support of companies like Ford — even though reform would have benefitted automakers , hobbled as they are by health - care costs .
The recent resignations , and public dissent from companies that are still members , like Johnson & Johnson and G.E. , suggest that , when it comes to global warming , companies are unwilling to sit quietly by .
Why the difference ?
Partly , it may be a matter of self - interest ; Exelon , for instance , has big investments in renewable energy .
But it may reflect a calculation that global warming is simply too big an issue to get wrong , both economically — few companies are really going to benefit from the melting of the polar ice caps — and from a public - relations point of view .
It ’s also probably no coincidence that these resignations have come at a time when the Chamber ’s anti-regulatory zeal looks not just outmoded but self - defeating .
Had the Chamber supported tougher regulation of financial and housing markets , after all , the myriad small businesses it represents would undoubtedly be better off today .
And it ’s far from clear that across - the - board hostility to regulation is really in the best interests of the free - enterprise system .
We assume that lobbies always recognize what ’s best for their members .
But they do n’t , and , in the case of climate change , they may very well be missing what the companies that have resigned in protest have seen : global warming is n’t just bad for the planet ; it ’s bad for business . ♦
Grandmother of 300 leaves lessons behind A LEGACY LIVES ON
Gregoria Martinez , with one of her 300 living descendents , was a devout Catholic .
Gregoria Martinez , with one of her 300 living descendents , was a devout Catholic .

Except the Vernon grandma did n't have just a handful of grandchildren when she died Tuesday .
She had nearly 300 .
Ninety - eight were grandchildren ; 164 were great - grandchildren and 16 were great - great - grandchildren — all descendants of her own 11 offspring .
That 's without counting her three stepchildren or any of their descendants — or the three great - great grandchildren currently on the way .
The family purposely underestimated the total count but felt if all were included it could be as high as 500 .
Actually , they have been losing track .
Now , with nearly half the family attending the funeral Wednesday , family members passed out index cards to update names and phone numbers while they had their chance .
Martinez 's survivors packed the 500 - seat St. Mary 's Catholic Church in Quanah .
“ Her numbers are pretty astounding , ” said Jesse Jalomo of his mother - in - law .
She knew most of them
The devout Catholic woman , whose husband , Ponciano , died at the age of 94 sometime after their 50th wedding anniversary , “ could fill up our elementary school in Quanah with all the great - grandchildren and the great - great - grandchildren , ” Jalamo said .
And she knew practically all of them .
“ If one of my sons would come up to see her , she 'd say , ‘ Are you JJ ? '
He 'd say , ‘ It 's JJ , Grandma . '
And she 'd say , ‘ Are you doing right ?
Are you taking care of your family ? ' ”
Family and faith were her two priorities — and she insisted on talking about both with everyone .
But not by telephone .
“ She 'd say , You come to see me , face to face .
You want to speak to me , you come to my house , and you drink a cup of coffee with me . ”
She did n't preach about the benefits of large families , but did believe she was brought into the world to multiply .
When Gregoria was raising her children , she and her husband were migrant workers , traveling to Wisconsin to pick tomatoes and cucumbers , then back to Texas to pick cotton .
Elva , the youngest of the 11 children , said her mother believed a wife should have a meal cooked when the family returned at the end of the day .
“ Then you wait on your husband hand - and - foot when he returns home . ”
Only in later years did both Gregoria and her husband work as custodians at a nearby hospital .
Long marriages run in the family , with many grandchildren logging 20- , 30 - and 40 - year anniversaries .
Nearly three - quarters of the family live in Quanah or nearby , but the rest are spread as far away as Arizona and Missouri .
Quanah 's Percilla Montes , 20 , said she remembers picking pecans off the tree at her great - grandma 's house and going to church with her .
“ She always said that family was the most important thing , next to God . ”
Great - grandchild Montes said she knows about half of her family members .
“ I 'm part of a big crowd , ” she said .
“ I 'm used to being in a big family . ”

Hvalur 's catcher boats pulled in 125 fin whales this year
The company behind Iceland 's fin whaling industry is planning a huge export of whalemeat to Japan .
This summer , Hvalur hf caught 125 fins - a huge expansion on previous years .
The company 's owner says he will export as much as 1,500 tonnes to Japan .
This would substantially increase the amount of whalemeat in the Japanese market .
The export would be legal because these nations are exempt from the global ban on trading whalemeat , but conservation groups doubt its commercial viability .
Last year , Hvalur hf exported about 65 tonnes of whalemeat to Japan , a consignment that owner Kristjan Loftsson described as a " loss - leader " .
But following this year 's huge catch , he believes the next one can make money .
This is our best year yet - we 're very happy about that
Gunnar Bergmann Jonsson
Icelandic minke whaler " We 'll get a good price - we 're intending to make a profit , that 's for sure , " he told BBC News .
Mr Loftsson said he had now suspended fin whaling for this season , having caught 125 from a quota of 150 .
The remaining 25 can be carried over into next year 's hunting season .
This compares with a total of seven caught in the previous three years .
The fin is globally listed as an endangered species , though Icelandic marine scientists maintain stocks are big enough locally to sustain a hunt of this size .
EU centre New quotas were controversially set by the government of Geir Haarde just before it left office in January .
The new left - green coalition government has promised to review the situation , but has so far chosen not to revoke the five - year quotas set by its predecessor .
Johanna Sigurdardottir's government is to review whaling policy
The government has formally applied to join the EU , and it is entirely possible that the EU would demand an end to whaling as a condition of Iceland 's entry .
The application still has to be endorsed in a referendum - and some conservationists believe Mr Loftsson is using whaling as a way to lobby against EU membership .
" I think he is holding Icelandic politicians hostages to fortune , " said Arni Finnsson of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association ( INCA ) .
" He 's saying that 'unless I can do this , you would be denying Iceland $ 40 m in export income ' - and how can you argue against that if you 're a politician ? "
The $ 40 m figure was cited by the Fisheries Ministry under Mr Haarde 's government , said Mr Finnsson , as being the size of the potential annual export market .
Election issue ?
Along with other conservation organisations , INCA is adamantly opposed to trading in whalemeat , which they see as something with the potential to increase hunting in various parts of the world .
The trade is generally banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) .
THE LEGALITIES OF WHALING Objection - A country formally objects to the IWC moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
Example : Norway Scientific - A nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any IWC member can do this .
Example : Japan Aboriginal - IWC grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
Example : Alaskan Inupiat But Iceland and Japan - along with a handful of other countries - lodged reservations , as the treaty permits , and so are exempt .
Conservation groups doubt that such a huge export of meat to Japan can be profitable .
A consignment of anything approaching 1,500 tonnes would mark a major expansion of the amount of meat available on the Japanese market each year .
The exact tonnage caught by Japan 's whale and dolphin hunts varies each year , but 4,000 tonnes would be a reasonable ballpark figure .
Conservationists have raised the possibility that Japan 's new government will re-address its whaling policies .
But Yukio Hatoyama 's pre-election position appears close to that of his predecessor , holding scientific whaling to be a sovereign right and promoting the resumption of commercial whaling on abundant stocks .
Fresh supplies
Hunting for the much smaller minke whales in Icelandic waters , meanwhile , will probably end next week , with 80 caught so far .
" This is our best year yet - we 're very happy about that , " said Gunnar Bergmann Jonsson , head of the minke whalers ' association .
" We did n't start freezing any meat before around 15th / 20th August - we sold it all fresh - now we 're just freezing so we have something for restaurants and stores over the winter . "
Mr Jonsson said the minke whalers were also interested in exporting if the fin whale consignment proved successful .

Dealing with the prospect of food shortages in the next 40 years is a bigger problem than climate change , a Senate inquiry has been told .
With the world 's population expected to reach about 9.2 billion by 2050 , coupled with food demand growing at one per cent per annum , the requirement for food will roughly double by mid-century , academic Julian Cribb says .
Professor Cribb outlined his concerns to the Senate 's select committee on agricultural and related industries during a public hearing into food production in Canberra on Monday .
Under current projections , five billion people will face water scarcity by 2050 , and Australia wo n't have enough water to sustain food in 25 years time .
Adding to the mix , a quarter of arable land around the world was degraded in some form and global stock of good farm land was declining about one per cent each year , Professor Cribb said .
Since Hulu launched early last year , its popularity has quadrupled as millions of people turn to the free online video site to watch episodes of such television shows as “ Family Guy , ” “ The Office ” and “ Modern Family . ”
Some wonder how long the free flow of online video would last if Comcast Corp. ends up a part owner of Hulu .
The nation ’s leading cable company has made no secret of its disdain for Hulu ’s approach of giving away the shows that Comcast and other pay - TV distributors spend billions for -- and rely on to retain subscribers .
Comcast is in talks with NBC Universal about pooling their entertainment assets into a new company that would own 30 % of Hulu in addition to the NBC network and cable channels such as Bravo , E ! and Syfy .
Comcast would control the new entity and possibly have the clout to push Hulu to begin charging for access to some of its most popular shows , including “ It ’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia , ” “ The Daily Show With Jon Stewart ” or “ Psych . ”
“ Would Comcast put an end to the Hulu model of using the Web to distribute free TV content ? ” asked Michael Nathanson , senior media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “ Will Comcast continue to support Hulu ? ”

Hulu , a partnership between NBC , Fox and Walt Disney Co. , has been a nagging concern among Wall Street investors , who see the site not as a hedge against Internet piracy or viral video phenomenon YouTube but as a threat to the economic underpinnings of the television business .
The $ 22 billion a year in cable and satellite TV subscriptions paid to programmers underwrites the high cost of producing all forms of television programming .
Hulu already has limited users ’ access to certain cable programs , including FX ’s “ It ’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia , ” in response to an outcry from the television producers and cable companies that object to paying TV programmers hundreds of millions of dollars each year for shows that are offered free online .
Comcast Chief Executive Brian L. Roberts is among the cable executives who have made their concerns known to TV programmers , both privately and publicly .
He and other cable executives fear that Hulu could become the free alternative to cable TV subscriptions .
“ If I am any one of these programmers , not just ESPN , but the Food Network . . . and I have a business in that 50 % , 60 % , 70 % of my business comes from subscriptions , I want to think long and hard before I just put that content out there for free and not think through what it is going to mean to my business , ” Roberts said at an investor conference in May .

Owning content would give Comcast some control over the matter .
“ Arguably , their ability to shape online content distribution , and to recast windows for video on demand , would be an important attribute of any deal , ” wrote Craig Moffett , a cable industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein .
Comcast ’s interest in NBC Universal would dramatically expand its entertainment portfolio with such attractive cable channels as USA Network , MSNBC and CNBC as well as the Universal Pictures movie studio .
The proposed Comcast - NBC Universal venture would also give the cable operator a much greater role in deciding how and when TV shows and movies are distributed online and at what price to consumers .
The proposed venture would combine General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal -- which includes a movie studio and broadcast network , a television station group and KNBC - TV Channel 4 in Los Angeles , the Telemundo Spanish - language operation and Universal Studios theme parks -- with Comcast ’s entertainment holdings , including E ! Entertainment , the Golf Channel and several regional sports networks .

There is no guarantee that Comcast and NBC Universal will come together .
The deal hinges on whether a French company , Vivendi , decides to unload its 20 % stake in NBC Universal .
Vivendi must decide in the next two months , and then federal regulators -- already concerned about media consolidation -- would have to sign off on the venture of Comcast and NBC Universal .
If the deal is completed , Comcast would own 51 % and GE would have 49 % .
This would give the Philadelphia - based cable operator a stake in Hulu , which has experienced explosive growth during the last year .
The service ’s online audience swelled to 38.5 million viewers in August , up from 10.2 million a year earlier , according to ComScore Video Metrix , which tracks online audiences .
Hulu ’s growth and its elegant design drew Disney to join the partnership in April .
Wall Street is n’t alone in questioning whether Hulu is a hindrance to the TV industry .
Entertainment executives have been agonizing over the conundrum of how to respond to viewers ’ desire to watch video on their computers and portable devices without encouraging them to abandon their pay - TV subscriptions .
The debate has caused tension between the various quarters of the industry , not only pitting programmers against distributors but also opening internal rifts within media conglomerates themselves .

Last month , Soleil Securities estimated that Disney , Fox and NBC subsidize $ 33 million of losses at Hulu , which is only partially offset by $ 123 million this year in advertising .
That does n’t take into account the TV advertising revenue that media companies are losing as viewers increasingly watch shows on their PCs instead of their TV sets .
Soleil media analyst Laura Martin calculated that for every viewer who migrates to the Internet , the companies forfeit $ 920 a year in ad revenue .
The long - term risk , she said , is that people would eventually cancel their cable or satellite TV subscriptions .
Martin and other analysts hope Comcast would champion a move away from offering so many shows online for free .
“ It would accelerate the inevitable path of Hulu to charge for its premium content , ” Martin said in an interview .

The departure in June of one of Hulu ’s architects , Peter Chernin , the longtime chief operating officer of Fox parent News Corp. , meant the site lost a powerful advocate .
Hulu Chief Executive Jason Kilar lauded Chernin as an executive who “ learned long ago that it was never his or his teams ’ job to protect existing businesses ” but to maximize those businesses “ while at the same time ensuring that the seeds were planted and nourished for new businesses . ”
Absent Chernin , there is growing support among the site ’s owners to embrace a pay model , according to people familiar with the situation .
Hulu declined to comment for this story .

Already , several media companies , including Comcast and Time Warner Inc. , have been experimenting with their own video websites and with technology that would ensure that only paying subscribers get to watch premium cable shows on their computers at no additional charge .
Comcast has been testing the service , called On Demand Online , with 5,000 subscribers who type in their ID and password to gain access to video .
The cable operator has a dual interest : to retain cable TV subscribers as well as offer a reason for people to sign up for Comcast ’s high - speed Internet service or upgrade to speedier access .
What better incentive than bandwidth - hogging video files such as movies ?
Analysts have cheered the nascent efforts to extend the cable subscription model online through the use of “ authentication , ” the term for verifying a subscriber ’s identity .
“ Authentication is becoming a top priority for content providers as well as the cable operators , ” said Charles D. Segars , a movie producer and chief executive of the Ovation cable TV channel .
“ Do they make Hulu a paid site ?
It ’s going to be a very interesting debate . ”

Why a Mammogram
I was sitting in the waiting room of a radiological center waiting for my yearly torture — a mammogram — and catching up on my Prevention magazine .
What a coincidence that I saw a small article that said that mammography may identify women at increased risk of stroke .
The article said a large number of benign calcium deposits may indicate plaque buildup in the arteries .
The study , headed by Paul S. Dale , MD , was done at the University of Missouri .
Plaque buildup , or atherosclerosis , in the arteries leading to the brain is a major cause of stroke .
There have also been previous studies that have shown a link between calcium deposits and diabetes and heart disease .
In this new research , researchers examined the mammograms of 793 healthy women , ages 40 to 90 , with no history of stroke , heart disease , or diabetes .
They found the following :
86 of the women , or about 11 % , had calcification
Of 204 women who had a stroke , 115 or 56 % , had calcification
Since I ’m fortunate to not have any breast cancer in my immediate family , I had tried to talk my doctor out of getting a mammogram , but perhaps there might be more than one reason to have one .
I encourage you to get one as well .
Ever heard of a vitamin that cleans your arteries ?

Advertisement Japan has successfully launched its new space freighter from the Tanegashima base in the south of the country .
The 16.5 - tonne unmanned H - II Transfer Vehicle ( HTV ) is on a mission to re-supply the space station .
Its role is vitally important to the station project , which is set to lose the servicing capability of the US shuttle fleet next year .
The freighter left Earth atop an H - IIB rocket at 0201 local time on Friday ( 1701 GMT , Thursday ) .
Separation from the rocket 's upper - stage was confirmed some 15 minutes later .
The HTV mission is being directed by engineers in Tsukuba , Japan , and at the US space agency 's ( Nasa ) mission control in Houston .
The vehicle must conduct a number of tests of its navigation and rendezvous systems before making a close approach to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
Docking is not expected to take place until at least day eight of the mission .
The freighter is carrying about 4.5 tonnes of cargo on this maiden flight .
It has the capacity to carry six tonnes .
Over the next few years , the HTV , and the other robotic re-supply ships like it , will be central to the operation of a fully crewed , fully functional ISS .
" This HTV - 1 vehicle is a demonstration flight to verify its functionality and performance , " said Masazumi Miyake , one of the Japanese space agency 's ( Jaxa ) senior officials in the US .
" After completion of this mission we are planning to launch one operational HTV per year on average . "
Grab and dock
The flight to orbit marked the first time Jaxa had used the H-IIB rocket , a beefed up version of the existing H - 11A launcher .
The rocket incorporates additional solid - fuel boosters and a second main engine on its core stage to achieve significant extra thrust .
Unlike all previous spacecraft to visit the International Space Station ( ISS ) , the HTV will not drive all the way into the orbiting platform .
Instead , the Japanese ship will simply park itself under the bow of the ISS to allow the station 's robotic arm to grab it .
The vessel will then be locked into an Earth - facing docking port on the Harmony ( Node 2 ) connecting module .
Safety will be the primary concern for the ISS astronauts .
The robotic vessel will be monitored constantly to see that it is behaving as expected .
" [ The astronauts ] can command the vehicle to abort , to retreat or to hold .
They can also command the grapple fixture to separate in case there is a failed capture , " said Dana Weigel , a US space agency ( Nasa ) flight director for the mission .
The HTV will remain attached to the ISS for about six weeks while its supplies are unloaded .
In addition to the cargo ( 3.6t ) carried in its pressurised compartment ( accessed from inside the ISS ) , the ship has important cargo ( 900 kg ) mounted on a pallet in an unpressurised compartment .
These exterior supplies include two new Earth - observation experiments for the exposed " terrace " of instruments that sits outside Japan 's Kibo science module .
Again , astronauts will use the station arm to remove the pallet before handing it across to the Kibo arm , which will then position the new experiments .
As the freighter 's supplies are used up , the ship will be filled with station rubbish .
Ultimately , it will undock from the ISS and take itself into a destructive dive through the atmosphere somewhere over the south Pacific .
When the US shuttles retire at the end of next year or the beginning of 2011 , the ISS project will become dependent on five robotic freighters for its logistics : • The Russian Progress and European ATV have already demonstrated their flight capability .
Four more ATVs have been booked to fly to the station , one a year starting in 2010 .
•
After the first HTV mission , Japan plans a further six flights through to 2015 .
•
Two commercial US suppliers , SpaceX and Orbital Sciences , are in the process of developing their Dragon and Cygnus supply ships .
The first of these is scheduled to deliver supplies to the ISS no earlier than the end of 2010 .
HTV and Dragon are particularly important because of their ability to deliver larger items in their unpressurised compartments that would not normally fit through the docking port of a pressurised compartment .
Length : 9.8 m ; Diameter : 4.4 m ; Vehicle Mass : 10.5t ; Max cargo :
6t Pressurised cargo : Food , clothing , water , laptops , science equipment , etc External cargo : Equipment to study Earth 's oceans and the atmosphere First unmanned vehicle to deliver both pressurised and unpressurised cargo

9 - 9 -9 : The Number of the Beatles
The wait is over .
At long last , on September 9 , 2009 , 22 years after the Beatles back catalog was first released in basic , unremastered form on CD , their entire discography of official studio albums — twelve in all , plus Magical Mystery Tour and Past Masters Vol .
I and II — will arrive in stores , both individually and in box sets .
Plus there ’s The Beatles : Rock Band video game .
Its a momentous occasion , but not just for Beatles fans who want the new album mixes , liner notes and photos and the collected documentaries on DVD .
Or those who might want to role play as the Fab Four .
This is a pivotal day for the major labels of the music biz .
We all know that CD sales have taken a nosedive in the last ten years , dropping 50 % from what they used to be .
While digital downloads are making up for part of the deficit , overall music profits have shrunk .
It ’s been bad news for the major labels but good news for many indie artists who have more control over their careers and profit margins thanks to the Internet .
Still , if you want to get your music out on a mass scale , you need to be backed by a company with widespread distribution .
And the majors are hurting .
They ca n’t create or break pop stars much anymore ; American Idol does it far more effectively .
There are few rock bands that sell massive quantities these days ; many do better selling concert tickets and merchandise .
Plus concert promoter Live Nation is stealing their thunder by signing megastars like Madonna and Jay - Z to multi-platform deals that include album releases and a cut of all profits .
What does this have to do with the Beatles ?
Everything .
The biggest - selling band of all time , they continue to enthrall audiences nearly 40 years after they broke up .
Any time a new compilation , documentary or remix project emerges , it sells well .
People keep writing books about them , and magazines and newspapers keep printing stories about their history .
Their recorded oeuvre came out over a mere eight years , yet it was more influential and popular than the music of bands who have had careers spanning five or six times longer , including The Rolling Stones and The Who .
The Beatles are the ultimate catalog band , and while other artists may have released far bigger albums commercially , they have never had the consistent success of the Fab Four .
Amazon.com Widgets
There is n’t anyone from the last 25 years , beyond Michael Jackson , who has exhibited such staying power .
And it ’s something that the industry needs to look at .
After they saw CD sales soar in the mid-1990s on the backs of young talent like Alanis Morrissette , Hootie & The Blowfish and Shania Twain , the majors got lazy and greedy and seemed to care less for artist development .
Album prices went up .
The CD single , a collectors ’ favorite and a good way to make extra cash , was gradually phased out in America ; some figure it was to push the sale of increasingly expensive albums that had few if any good songs beyond the single (s ) .
Radio narrowcasting and constricted video playlists raised the stakes , compounding the problem for music labels and their rising talent .
No longer could an artist take a few albums to evolve , mature and reach platinum status .
They had to make it quickly to recoup investment , or they were dropped .
Sure ,
The Beatles rose to fame quickly ( thanks to singles initially ) , but they were that rare , exceptionally talented ensemble that could .
Most artists need time to grow , and the industry has grown impatient and nervous , preferring short - term success over long - term profitability , often to appease stockholders who want to make money right now .
Having a solid back catalog makes a difference , and young artists today usually do not get the chance to amass one .
Sure , Bruce Springsteen went platinum by his third album Born To Run , but it was not until nine years later in 1984 that he would become a superstar with the fifteen million selling Born In The U.S.A. , his seventh album .
Judas Priest took eight years and eight records to go platinum with Screaming For Vengeance , but once they did so their previous albums started to achieve gold ( 500,000 units ) or platinum ( 1 million ) status .
Similarly , AC / DC sold well worldwide but did not become an international sensation until their sixth album , Highway To Hell .
Its follow - up , the legendary Back In Black , was an even greater success .
Then , of course , there is the resurgence of classic songs , the best example being Queen ’s “ Bohemian Rhapsody , ” which was used in a funny lip - synching sequence in the movie Wayne ’s World that brought the song rocketing back up to the top of the charts 17 years after its initial release .
Many veteran bands are finding their catalog tracks to be lucrative today when licensing them out for movies , television shows and especially video games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band .
( Journey is one of the big licensing winners lately . )
While the idea of The Beatles : Rock Band game might sound like heresy to some , it will promote the group ’s music to a new generation of fans .
It is interesting to note that the game features a number of different scenarios , with the virtual Beatles performing everywhere from the Cavern Club in Liverpool to Shea Stadium .
The group went through many phases and looks and explored many styles of music .
Most artists today do n’t do that , at least on a mainstream level , and their handlers and stylists do not want to make really radical changes because conformity is the name of the game .
( And those that are followers of fashion tend to produce less interesting music . )
As The Beatles , Elvis and Michael Jackson have proven , originality sells a lot more music , not cookie cutter copycats .
Perhaps the idea of originality is anathema to an industry now built on chasing trends and making a quick buck .
But it is often original bands that carve out a niche for themselves and help prop up the backbone of the industry .
While big sellers like Nickelback and Linkin Park are important financially ( and remain viable ) , artists with cult - like followings such as Tool , Radiohead and Tori Amos also provide consistency , both in terms of album and ticket sales .
And as the Finnish band H.I.M. proved a couple of years ago , having a charismatic frontman , distinct sound , identifiable logo and marketable imagery is also important .
Look at Iron Maiden — their catalog and mascot Eddie continue to be cash cows for them , their management and their label 30 years into their recording career .
And their fans are devout and loyal .
October is Sex Ed Month of Action and organizers from Advocates for Youth , Catholics for Choice , Choice USA , Law Students for Reproductive Justice , NARAL , Planned Parenthood , SIECUS , Sierra Club , and Spiritual Youth for Reproductive Freedom are joining forces to tell Congress it 's time to finally get rid of failed abstinence - only programs and fund comprehensive sexuality education .
You can find information and tools for organizing a Call - In Day here .
You can also sign on to a petition in support of the REAL Act which would authorize funding for comprehensive sexuality education .
This is a crucial moment for comprehensive sex ed .
For the first time in a while we should have the support in the White House and Congress to de-fund abstinence - only programs and support real , accurate education about sex and sexuality .
However , politicians in DC are continuing the same old fight despite overwhelming evidence that ab - only does n't work .
Electing people who say they agree with us is only the first and easiest step in bringing about political change .
The real hard work comes after elections , when advocates need to hold officials accountable , push them to support our issues , and create a climate where that 's the most expedient political move for them to make .
The time is now : let 's finally make federal funding for comprehensive sexuality education a reality !

The contempt with which the president of France regards the president of the United States was displayed in public last week .
Nicolas Sarkozy was furious with Barack Obama for his adolescent warbling about a world without nuclear weapons at a meeting Mr. Obama chaired of the United Nations Security Council last Thursday ( 9/24 ) .
" We must never stop until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of the earth , " President Obama said .
What infuriated President Sarkozy was that at the time Mr. Obama said those words , Mr. Obama knew the mullahs in Iran had a secret nuclear weapons development site , and he did n't call them on it .
‘ President Obama dreams of a world without weapons ... but right in front of us two countries are doing the exact opposite , " Mr. Sarkozy said .
" Iran since 2005 has flouted five Security Council resolutions , " Mr. Sarkozy said .
" North Korea has been defying Council resolutions since 1993 . "
" What good has proposals for dialogue brought the international community ? " he asked rhetorically .
" More uranium enrichment and declarations by the leaders of Iran to wipe out a UN member state off the map . "
If the Security Council had imposed serious sanctions on the regimes which are flouting UN resolutions , the resolution Mr. Obama proposed about working toward nuclear disarmament would n't have been so meaningless , Mr. Sarkozy implied .
" If we have courage to impose sanctions together it will lend viability to our commitment to reduce or own weapons and to making a world without nuke weapons , " he said .
The extent of President Obama 's naivete - or duplicity - was on display Friday at the G20 summit when the president , flanked by Mr. Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , revealed to the American public that Iran had a second nuclear weapons site on a military base near the holy city of Qom .
News reports indicated Mr. Obama had been briefed on the site before his inauguration .
But he 's been conducting his foreign policy as if the mullahs could be trusted .
" Iran has been put on notice , " President Obama said in Pittsburgh .
Iran responded to being " put on notice " by testing Monday two ballistic missiles that could carry a nuclear warhead 1,200 miles .
It was to protect Europe from such missiles that the ABM system President Obama abruptly cancelled earlier this month was designed .
Obama administration officials said the ABM cancellation - regarded as a betrayal by Poland and the Czech Republic , where the missiles and radars were to be located - actually improved U.S. security , because it has made Russia more amenable to sanctions against Iran .
The UN Security Council has never passed strong sanctions against Iran because Russia and China have vetoed them .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said he still does n't like economic sanctions , but will support them if diplomacy fails .
China remains opposed .
President Obama should n't count on Russian support , said Soviet expert David Satter .
" Words are cheap for the Kremlin and the Iranians are aware of this , " he said .
" The Russians , having endorsed sanctions , will now find hundreds of reasons why any specific sanctions package is unfair ...
The reason is that support for Iran is Russia 's most important trump card in foreign relations and there is little likelihood they will give it up . "
Iran has been put on notice before .
At the G8 meeting in Italy in July , Mr. Obama and other leaders set a " firm deadline " of Sep. 10 for the Iranians to make a serious offer to negotiate about their nuclear program .
When the mullahs blew him off , Mr. Obama quietly extended the deadline until December .
December could be too late .
" Tehran soon could have humankind 's most frightening weapon if substantial diplomatic progress is not made in the coming days , " Rep. Howard Berman ( D - Cal ) , the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said Saturday ( 9/26 ) .
If severe economic sanctions are not imposed immediately , in months if not in weeks , only a military strike will b e able to prevent an Iranian bomb .
But after sternly lecturing Iran on its international obligations Friday , President Obama did n't call for sanctions .
He called for more negotiations .
And then , as the Iranians were spitting in his eye with the missile test , he jetted off to Copenhagen to lobby to have the 2016 Olympics held in Chicago .
No wonder Nicolas Sarkozy holds him in contempt .
Barack Obama has taken pains to assure Americans that illegal immigrants wo n’t be able to buy health insurance on his new exchange .
They ’ll still get free emergency care but they will be prohibited from paying the world ’s highest prices for health care .
What else are illegal immigrants going to be denied now ?
Will they be barred from the Apple Store and prevented from spending $ 3000 on a laptop ?
Prevented from buying Leica cameras ?
No haute couture , only prêt -à - porter ?
Meanwhile , we taxpayers in Massachusetts are stuck with the bill for housing Obama ’s Aunt Zeituni .
The Wikipedia entry on this illegal immigrant has a good explanation of how she has avoided deportation thanks to the U.S. court system taking years to process even the simplest cases , e.g. , Should a woman who has already twice been ordered deported , but did not leave , be… deported ?
( Put some judges and lawyers like that into a tire factory and pretty soon you need tariff walls to protect them against the Chinese . )
Massachusetts taxpayers have been paying for Aunt Zeituni ’s housing for six years .
Ever since Barack Obama ’s ascendancy to the White House , we ’ve also been paying for extra police details to deter the curious and the press .
The Obama family inflicted further cost and inconvenience on folks in this state during their family vacation in Martha ’s Vineyard , when roads and airspace were shut down for up to a week .
What could Barack Obama do to help Massachusetts ?
He owns a 14 - room , 6500 square foot house in Chicago ( using fossil fuels to heat 6500 square feet for a family of four in one of the coldest parts of the U.S. is apparently a demonstration of one ’s commitment to reversing global warming ) that presumably sits vacant nearly all year .
The house is guarded 24/7 by Secret Service agents .
The street is closed to non-residents .
Why ca n’t Aunt Zeituni live there ?
She would n’t be bothered by the rabble or the press .
She would n’t be a drain on Massachusetts citizens .
If Barack Obama wants to convince Americans that his health care plan wo n’t burden national taxpayers with the cost of caring for illegal immigrants , would n’t it be good for him to relieve the taxpayers of Massachusetts of the cost of caring for his illegal immigrant relative ?
Via this posting I hereby offer to pay for Aunt Zeituni ’s round - trip transportation to Chicago .
I will pick her up in her public housing complex , drop her off at the new Southwest Airlines terminal at Logan Airport , buy her a ticket on Southwest , and arrange for my friend Jen to pick her up at Midway .
Jen will drop Aunt Zeituni off at the Secret Service barriers and they can escort her to Obama ’s house .
We will reverse the process to get her back to Boston for her February 4 , 2010 immigration hearing ( source ) .
Scotsman Eric
Smart sounds extremely happy for someone who 's just cycled 23,000 kilometres .
In fact he 's so happy about it , that after a short break he 'll be mounting up again and pedaling for another 12,000 km .
Eric began this epic adventure 17 months ago in his home town of Aberdeen , Scotland , with no plans but to end up in Adelaide .
" My plan was to have as little plan as possible , " he said .
" I gave myself two years , but found myself here in Adelaide after 17 months .
I 've got seven left , so I now intend to cycle across New Zealand , San Francisco to New York , through Ireland and back to Aberdeen . "
By the time he 's finished , Eric will have racked up a mean 30,000 km through 19 countries over two years .
And the reason for all this pedal power ?
For 20 years , Eric suffered Myalgic Encephalomyelitis ( ME ) , a debilitating condition which can cause severe tiredness and fatigue , painful muscles and joints , and poor memory and concentration .
" The trip is to celebrate my recovery from poor health .
I love travel , cycling and I 'm a people person , so it was just to celebrate those things and bring awareness to ME . "
Eric 's plan is to raise $ 24,000 and he's not far off - his latest count is about $ 15,000 .
His story is inspiring and heartwarming , but Eric says he found both those things and more in the people he 's met during his travels .
" I 'm never really alone .
The warmth , love and compassion in every country I 've gone through has been incredible , " he said .
" I 've been travelling for 17 months , through 16 countries and people have been just amazing .
Nothing stolen , no moments of trepidation , no acts of violence against me - and I sleep in the streets .
" I sleep in bus shelters , under bushes - occasionally I sleep in backpackers to shave and wash my clothes , or I get invited into people 's homes - it 's just been incredible .
" I just cycle , sleep , and eat whenever .
Every country I 've cycled through at night , arrived at major cities in the middle of the night .
I meet a broader range of people and have a greater mix of experience doing it this way . "
Bumps along the way
But it has n't been a totally smooth ride .
Several injuries and near misses along the way have been what Eric describes as " character building " .
He suffered a broken collar bone in Italy , was hospitalised twice in Pakistan with food poisoning , had his fingers crushed when a motorbike ran over them in Indonesia , and went over the handle bars in Azerbaijan .
He also had to deal with " bitterly cold " weather in Turkey , which plunged to minus 38 degrees Celsius at night , and the hills , heat and humidity in Sumatra .
Clearly , the adventurous spirit is in Eric 's nature , and he has a special affection for Australia , which is why he originally wanted to finish here .
" I was in Adelaide over 20 years ago while I was hitchhiking and walking around Australia , " he said .
" I 've worked in Adelaide and it was the furthest place away I could think of with the alliteration of A . Plus I 've always wanted to come back to Australia . "
Eric says he 's always enjoyed riding a bike , but has never been " super keen " like you 'd imagine one would be to embark on such a journey .
" Prior to leaving , I went out and cycled for 80 km to see how I 'd get on and I was fine , so that 's the furthest I 'd ever cycled prior to leaving . "
And this no frills approach has been the theme of Eric 's ride .
No flashy gadgets or getup , just good old fashioned bike riding
" The trip 's been very basic .
I do n't have a GPS or a mobile phone or laptop and I 've only used two maps the whole trip , " he said .
" The people that I meet direct and shape the experience and these are the things I wanted to try .
I just wanted the trip to be about using my intuition and doing the things I believe in , instead of having a structured plan .
" I 'm very fortunate to be doing this ...
I do n't mean to be flippant about it , but I am just a tourist on a bike and I 'm blown away by the amount of interest that 's been shown .
" Complete strangers have invited me into their homes , many people have stopped and handed me a bottle of water or some food , or helped with directions .
They 've gone out of their way and completely gone the extra mile to help .
That 's been the biggest impression of my trip . "

The Golden Spurtle trophy will be coming to Oregon !
Matthew Cox , of Milwaukie , Oregon ’s own Bob ’s Red Mill today was named the 2009 World Porridge Making Champion .
A spurtle , besides just a fun word to say , is a wand - like thing usually made of wood that is traditionally used to stir porridge while it cooks ( and yes , you can find myrtle spurtles in Oregon ! ) .
The annual competition , held in Carrbridge , Scotland , celebrates Scotland ’s traditional national dish , porridge .
This is the first time an American team has entered the competition , held in Glasgow , Scotland , and they came away as the big winner !

There are several ways to run Windows programs on Linux ( virtualisation , WINE ) and vice versa really is n’t a problem either with Cygwin , or better yet , native ports thanks to the Windows variants of Gtk+ and Qt. Still , what if Windows support was built straight into the Linux kernel ?
Is something like that even possible ?
Sure it is , and the Chinese figured it ’d be an interesting challenge , and called it the Linux Unified Kernel .
I must admit I had n’t heard of this project just yet , but I was intrigued right away .
It ’s called the Linux Unified Kernel , and aims to combine the Linux kernel and the Windows NT kernel to effectively create a new kernel that supports both Linux and Windows binaries natively .
They do this by implementing Windows NT kernel mechanisms into the Linux kernel using kernel modules , such as NT ’s process management , thread management , object management , virtual memory management , synchronisation , system calls , Windows registry ( worms ?
Can ? Of ? ) , WDM ( device driver framework ) , Windows DPC mechanism , and so on .
Even Windows drivers would work using this new hybrid kernel ( a little kernel geek humour , there ) .
The new kernel actually supports two sets of system calls , one for Windows , and one for Linux .
Since I ’m not a programmer ( let alone a kernel programmer ) , I have to resort to Wikipedia to explain how this all works .
If I understand it all correctly , Windows binaries call the syscal table via a different interrupt than Linux binaries do ( int 0x2e vs. int 0x80 ) .
I ’m sure some of you will be able to provide more insight into what , exactly , this all means .
When it comes to the userland , the LUK project does not write its own material ; instead , it relies on the GNU project for the Linux side of things , and on Wine and ReactOS for the Windows side .
The people behind LUK hope that eventually , their code will be merged into mainline .
There ’s still a lot of work to do before every Windows application will just work out of the box , but progress is steadily made , and the Chinese Linux distribution MagicLinux even has a special version built on top of LUK .
Currently , it ’s x86 - only , but work is underway to port it to the Loongson architecture .
The Loongson 3 processor includes 200 additional instructions to speed up x86 translation , in case you ’re wondering how MIPS would run Windows .
In any case , version 0.2.4 of LUK was released recently , so if you ’re adventurous , you can get it from their download page .
Ummm .
So ... Richard Whitehouse , an artist from Ohio is constructing a piece called The Rape Tunnel .
It 's an installation in a gallery , a long narrowing tunnel that can be walked through , and he 's promising that anybody who enters it during the exhibition , he 'll attempt to rape .
In 2007 at the Seward Projects Space in Columbus , I had my first breakthrough with an installation that was to be the prototype for this current one .
It was called THE PUNCH - YOU -IN - THE - FACE TUNNEL .
It was the same set - up as THE RAPE TUNNEL except at the end of the tunnel I ’d punch the subject in the face instead of raping him or her .
The impetus was completely reactionary to the current state of art , and motivated by pure frustration .
As it turns out , I ended up breaking the nose of the third person to crawl through the tunnel , an aspiring model .
She went to the hospital and eventually sued me .
Her modeling career was put on hold .
The civil case was long and drawn out and the matter still has n’t been resolved .
To this day she still has unpaid medical bills .
The point of this long aside is that all this took place two years ago , and I ’m still having an impact on this young lady ’s life , something not many other artists could claim about their work
Rape seemed like the next logical step .
There 's more of this on the Artlurker site , including a Q&A where the artist goes into pretty graphic detail about his intention .
It 's clear from the piece that part of his objective is to generate discussion , protest , anger and debate , and I 'm more than willing to play my part by posting a link here .
But I think I 'll forgo the show itself .
Let 's discuss , on a range of subjects from morality , taste and art to internet hoaxes .
NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) -- Cosmetic advertisements in Asia are targeting men with blunt campaigns aimed at skin color that one lawmaker labels racist .
A still from a commercial for Emani 's skin whitener .
In one TV commercial , two men , one with dark skin , the other with light skin ; stand on a balcony overlooking a neighborhood .
The dark skin guy turns to his friend and says in Hindi , " I am unlucky because of my face . "
His light skin friend replies , " Not because of your face , because of the color of your face . "
Suddenly the light skin guy throws his friend a cream .
It 's a whitening cream .
It is one of several television commercials aimed at men in Pakistan and India .
In the end the darker skin actor is shown several shades lighter and he gets the girl he was after .
Most of the ads end up that way .
The commercials are sending a not - so - subtle message to men in Asia :
Get whiter skin , and you 'll get the girl and the job of your dreams .
Or at the very least you 'll be noticed .
" We always have a complex towards a white skin , towards foreign skin or foreign hair , " Jawed Habib says .
Watch how skin whitening ads send a harsh message »
Habib should know .
He owns a chain of 140 salons located in India and across the world .
" We Indian people , we Asian people are more darker , so we want to look more fair . "
Skin whiteners were once targeted only to women .
Now the products are a hot commodity for men .
Many of the brands being advertised for men are well known around the world -- including Nivea and Garnier .

A marketing study found sales for skin whitening creams have jumped more than 100 percent in rural India and sales for male grooming products are increasing 20 percent annually .
Hindustan Unilever , one of the largest consumer products companies in India , noted in recent annual reports that " skin lightening continues to be a major area of emphasis " for its skin care division .
And Emami Ltd. , the company which produces " Fair and Handsome , " sent CNN an email saying : " Fair and Handsome is a market leader with almost 70 percent market share in India and doing extremely well in Gulf countries and the Middle East as well . "
But in a country where most people have brown skin , the message being sent to men and women has some people outraged .
" Basically if you need a job you have to have white skin .
If you want a good partner , a companion you need white skin and you always seem to get it once you 've used the fairness cream .
Basically I think it 's completely racist and highly objectionable , " says Brinda Karat .
Do you think skin - whitening commercials are racist ?
Sound off below
Karat is a member of India 's Parliament who has made formal complaints about the advertisements to Indian authorities .
She says the ads are simply playing on a social stigma that already exists in India .
To get a good look at the pervasiveness of the stigma attached to dark skin in India all you have to do is look at the want ads for Brides and Grooms in the newspaper .
Arranged marriages are still commonplace in India , and the advertisements for brides and grooms often list physical attributes of the person being sought .
Many of the ads list " fair " as one of the wanted physical characteristics .
" I mean at a time when we 're talking about talents and skills , and the need for the accessibility to that to develop our potential ; what does it do to dark persons ' self esteem ? "
Karat says .
" I think it should be stopped . "
But the product makers say they are simply giving the public what it wants , and a few Indian consumers agreed .
Deepak Rajput said : " Everybody wants to look handsome and beautiful , why not me ? "
Salon owner Jawed Habib says he will accommodate if that is what the customer wants , but he does n't push the skin whitening products .
" Why do you even think about it ? "
He says : " Let 's accept the way we are . "

Let 's jump into the wayback machine , all the way to the summer of 1994 .
David G. was starting at his very first job out of school , developing some train control system software .
Perhaps not thrilling work , but hey , it was a job .
" David , I 'm so glad you were able to make your way here ! "
It was Tom , a thick , sweaty looking man in his 40s who gave a hearty , double - handed hand shake upon entering the door .
" Us old timers have been hoping for some fresh experience to come to our department here ! "
" Glad to be on board , " David smiled .
As a fresh graduate , he was n't quite sure what experience he might bring to the table , but who was he to turn down a compliment ?
Especially from his to - be mentor .
" Too bad that you did n't start here a day earlier , " Tom panted , " You missed some real excitement - one of the batch jobs failed and we had to manually update about 1,500 transactions .
Exciting stuff !
Just finished up about an hour ago ! "
" Wow , " David responded while discretely drying Tom 's perspiration off his hands when he began , " So ... are things always this exciting ? "
" Not ordinarily , but when you see me looking like ' this ' , you know that I 've been hard at work .
C'mon , I 'll show you how we do our magic here ! "
After a quick tour of the cafeteria , the break room , and the restrooms , it was on to the " machine " room .
The machine room was a small , multi-purposed , and moderately - warm room that housed some mechanical equipment , a few mainframes , and an ancient - looking tower computer that was stripped of its case cover .
" That 's the build machine , " Tom said , " it 's the only way to get software from the development network to the mainframes .
As the nickel tour ended , Tom showed David to his desk and began explaining the build - promote - deploy process they used .
" After compiling your software , " he said , " just submit it into a network directory , and the build machine will find it , compile it , and start copying it to the mainframe .
But here 's one catch : the build machine can get a little warm , which causes all sorts of problems in transferring files over .
But we have a pretty simple manual intervention , I 'll show ya . "
Just as David was about to ask for clarification , Tom responded , " I 'm going to submit a new package to the build machine .
Now since you 're new , I 'll give you a ten - second head start to get to the machine room and fan the build machine . "
David blinked .
" Excuse me ? "
" Yeah , you 'll have to fan air from the cooled hallway into the machine room TOWARDS the machine , or the promote will die and you 'll have to start over .
Ready ? "
David interrupted , " wait a second , is this a hazing prank — "
Clearly ,
Tom could n't hear him , as he increased his volume on each word continuing " Set ? Now ... GO ! GO !
Hustle man !
Hustle , Hustle , HUSTLE !! "
Like the wind , David hurried to the end of the hallway and made it to the closed - up machine room .
Upon entering , there was a large piece of cardboard with two cut out handles marked " machine Room Property - Do NOT Trash " .
It took a second , but David figured out what he was supposed to do : he grabbed the cardboard and started to fan the only machine without a case cover .
Dust and dirt swirled in the room and just has his arms were about to give out , Tom came up from behind him .
" You did it ! "
Tom was clearly impressed , " now put that fan down before you fall over !
The promote succeeded !
Now , let 's head on back so I can show you our filing system for post - promote documents ... "
As the months passed , David came to learn that , oddly enough , the younger and healthier non-smoking developers tended to have more success at getting their builds sent to the mainframe and tested .
Somehow , the procedure persisted over several years , through one building move and a few machine room moves .
And over all that time , nobody ever thought to vent A/C directly to the machine room , or a build machine that was n't so temperamental , or at the very least , buy an electric fan .
You would have to go back at least 15 million years to find carbon dioxide levels on Earth as high as they are today , a UCLA scientist and colleagues report Oct. 8 in the online edition of the journal Science .
" The last time carbon dioxide levels were apparently as high as they are today — and were sustained at those levels — global temperatures were 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than they are today , the sea level was approximately 75 to 120 feet higher than today , there was no permanent sea ice cap in the Arctic and very little ice on Antarctica and Greenland , " said the paper 's lead author , Aradhna Tripati , a UCLA assistant professor in the department of Earth and space sciences and the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences .
" Carbon dioxide is a potent greenhouse gas , and geological observations that we now have for the last 20 million years lend strong support to the idea that carbon dioxide is an important agent for driving climate change throughout Earth 's history , " she said .
By analyzing the chemistry of bubbles of ancient air trapped in Antarctic ice , scientists have been able to determine the composition of Earth 's atmosphere going back as far as 800,000 years , and they have developed a good understanding of how carbon dioxide levels have varied in the atmosphere since that time .
But there has been little agreement before this study on how to reconstruct carbon dioxide levels prior to 800,000 years ago .
Tripati , before joining UCLA 's faculty , was part of a research team at England ’s University of Cambridge that developed a new technique to assess carbon dioxide levels in the much more distant past — by studying the ratio of the chemical element boron to calcium in the shells of ancient single - celled marine algae .
Tripati has now used this method to determine the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth 's atmosphere as far back as 20 million years ago .
" We are able , for the first time , to accurately reproduce the ice - core record for the last 800,000 years — the record of atmospheric C02 based on measurements of carbon dioxide in gas bubbles in ice , " Tripati said .
" This suggests that the technique we are using is valid .

" We then applied this technique to study the history of carbon dioxide from 800,000 years ago to 20 million years ago , " she said .
" We report evidence for a very close coupling between carbon dioxide levels and climate .
When there is evidence for the growth of a large ice sheet on Antarctica or on Greenland or the growth of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean , we see evidence for a dramatic change in carbon dioxide levels over the last 20 million years .
" A slightly shocking finding , " Tripati said , " is that the only time in the last 20 million years that we find evidence for carbon dioxide levels similar to the modern level of 387 parts per million was 15 to 20 million years ago , when the planet was dramatically different . "
Levels of carbon dioxide have varied only between 180 and 300 parts per million over the last 800,000 years — until recent decades , said Tripati , who is also a member of UCLA 's Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics .
It has been known that modern - day levels of carbon dioxide are unprecedented over the last 800,000 years , but the finding that modern levels have not been reached in the last 15 million years is new .
Prior to the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , the carbon dioxide level was about 280 parts per million , Tripati said .
That figure had changed very little over the previous 1,000 years .
But since the Industrial Revolution , the carbon dioxide level has been rising and is likely to soar unless action is taken to reverse the trend , Tripati said .
" During the Middle Miocene ( the time period approximately 14 to 20 million years ago ) , carbon dioxide levels were sustained at about 400 parts per million , which is about where we are today , " Tripati said .
" Globally , temperatures were 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer , a huge amount . "
Tripati's new chemical technique has an average uncertainty rate of only 14 parts per million .

" We can now have confidence in making statements about how carbon dioxide has varied throughout history , " Tripati said .
In the last 20 million years , key features of the climate record include the sudden appearance of ice on Antarctica about 14 million years ago and a rise in sea level of approximately 75 to 120 feet .
" We have shown that this dramatic rise in sea level is associated with an increase in carbon dioxide levels of about 100 parts per million , a huge change , " Tripati said .
" This record is the first evidence that carbon dioxide may be linked with environmental changes , such as changes in the terrestrial ecosystem , distribution of ice , sea level and monsoon intensity . "
Today , the Arctic Ocean is covered with frozen ice all year long , an ice cap that has been there for about 14 million years .
" Prior to that , there was no permanent sea ice cap in the Arctic , " Tripati said .
Some projections show carbon dioxide levels rising as high as 600 or even 900 parts per million in the next century if no action is taken to reduce carbon dioxide , Tripati said .
Such levels may have been reached on Earth 50 million years ago or earlier , said Tripati , who is working to push her data back much farther than 20 million years and to study the last 20 million years in detail .
More than 50 million years ago , there were no ice sheets on Earth , and there were expanded deserts in the subtropics , Tripati noted .
The planet was radically different .
Co-authors on the Science paper are Christopher Roberts , a Ph.D. student in the department of Earth sciences at the University of Cambridge , and Robert Eagle , a postdoctoral scholar in the division of geological and planetary sciences at the California Institute of Technology .
The research was funded by UCLA 's Division of Physical Sciences and the United Kingdom 's National Environmental Research Council .
Tripati's research focuses on the development and application of chemical tools to study climate change throughout history .
She studies the evolution of climate and seawater chemistry through time .
" I 'm interested in understanding how the carbon cycle and climate have been coupled , and why they have been coupled , over a range of time - scales , from hundreds of years to tens of millions of years , " Tripati said .
In addition to being published on the Science Express website , the paper will be published in the print edition of Science at a later date .
The heyday of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) was in the 1970s and 1980s .
Here was the logical evolution of office and industrial automation that would put an expert into every computer and by doing so both replace and augment employees , changing forever the world of work .
Only it turned out not to function that way because we underestimated the effort involved .
It was easy to imagine putting intelligence into a computer but very difficult to do so in practice .
There was n’t enough processing power available for one thing , nor were there even enough experts , since it seemed to require having one on - hand to keep the machine in tune .
Now IBM appears to have a plan to do it all again , though with a twist .
And this time , thanks to Moore ’s Law and high costs for employee health care and pensions , it might even work .
God help us .
Today ’s computers are smaller and thousands of times more powerful than the ones we worked with during the AI boom , but the problem is still one of programming — getting knowledge into the system in an efficient and usable manner .
For that matter , it is hard to envision computers other than robots performing many of these workplace functions , and robots are n’t ready .
The better solution then , according to a just - published IBM patent filing ( US29228426A1 ) , might be to find a way to suck knowledge out of the experts then inject it into younger , stronger , cheaper employees , possibly even in other countries .
IBM ’s proposed Platform for Capturing Knowledge describes how to use an imersive gaming environment to transfer expert knowledge held by employees “ aged 50 and older ” to 18 - 25 year - old trainees who find manuals “ difficult to read and understand . ”
IBM also discusses how its invention could be made available for customers ’ use in return for “ payment from the customer (s ) under a subscription and / or fee agreement . ”
What we ’re talking about , then , is a possible revolution in workplace training , one where a lifetime of experience would ideally be sucked from the mind of an experienced worker to be injected into a trainee and then the older worker discarded .
There are several thoughts that came to mind as I read this patent application .
Could IBM really be serious about such a plan ?
Then I imagined how enthusiastically the idea must have been received at IBM intergalactic HQ in Armonk .
What a great idea !
Transfer knowledge from old to young , American to Argentinian , or even just hold it in machine storage for later use , disposing of the expert in the meantime .
To see it this way you have to understand one recent IBM mindset , which is that culturally IBM does not believe in job specialization .
Anyone can manage anything .
Anyone should be able to perform any job .
For a company whose motto used to be “ think , ” IBM is trying to reduce it to “ do as instructed . ”
This patent is a natural extension of that culture .
Though part of being an expert is the ability to figure out new stuff and master it .
But when you get rid of the real experts , who is going to figure out the new stuff ?
That does n’t automatically fall out of this computer gaming scenario , which teaches functions and techniques , not intuition or actual experience .
Then I thought about that moment late in the tenure of IBM CEO John Opel when someone came up with the bright idea of urging companies that leased IBM mainframes to buy them , creating a huge revenue bubble that grew the company to more than 400,000 employees , setting it up for its 1990s crash .
Converting the leases was not , in itself , a bad idea .
What was bad was assuming that such huge , essentially one - time , revenue would continue perpetually , which is exactly how IBM saw it .
Really .
Is n’t this the same thing , only now they are converting employees into some more disposable form ?
What happens when there are no more experts to convert ?
IBM ’s greatest threat is its ability to stifle innovation .
The way the company is off - shoring jobs and minimizing the value of its support workers demonstrates this .
The threat will be when a group of smart folks in China or India realize how things could be done better , then starts taking work away from IBM .
They will have access to an army of IBM foreign workers , too , who will bring customer contacts with them .
On the other hand , this application is also typical of an IBM patent .
There are many aspects to implementing such a training process — data gathering , information management , software , hardware , etc. — and IBM has patented every part .
So if anyone makes a something similar , IBM could sue .
If you create gaming software to teach almost anything to almost anyone , this patent may trump you .
In the end it may not matter then whether IBM runs out of experts or not .
Just so long as they do n’t run out of lawyers .

The new Lotus F1 Team has unveiled the first images of what its 2010 car will look like , having completed its first wind tunnel model .
Chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne views the completion of the model as a major achievement , even though he admits there is still plenty of work to do before it makes it onto the grid .
" The start of any windtunnel testing is an important step in the development of a new Formula 1 car , but it is particularly exciting for us as we continue preparations for our first season , " he said on Wednesday .
" It has been a very busy time since our entry was confirmed by the FIA .
We had been working on the entry for several months so we already had aspects of the team infrastructure in place ; the finances , the factory and the top management .
" Once our entry was confirmed in mid-September , we were able to accelerate our recruitment and car development process and this is really where we are at now . "
Gascoyne remains confident that Lotus will be ready in time for the start of the 2010 season , which kicks off in Bahrain in the middle of March .
" There is no escaping the challenges that we face simply to get the car ready for the first race of next season , but I am confident that we are up to the task in hand .
Our target is to get the car ready for a roll out by the middle of February so that we can carry out preseason testing in preparation for Bahrain in mid-March . "
Lotus has yet to confirm any of its drivers for next year , but AUTOSPORT understands that Jarno Trulli is favourite to lead the team in 2010 , potentially alongside another experienced driver .
Speaking about his drivers , Gascoyne said : " We have been looking closely at the driver market to determine our best options for next year including Malaysian drivers , but no decisions have been made yet .
" We need versatile drivers .
We need reliable and technically - minded drivers who can help us develop the car during the season , but at the same time we need drivers who are hungry for results and who can extract every little bit of performance from the car at all times . "
Beta Testing : Brothers Zelenty , Belok , and Molldrem try something new .
According to fraternal historian ­Nicholas Syrett , America ’s fraternity culture has thrived on a fear of homosexuality since the 1920’s .
All - male fraternal organizations , Syrett writes , “ compensate for what might be perceived by outsiders as either feminine or gay behavior by enacting a masculinity [ of ] aggressive heterosexuality . ”
In order to preempt homosexual interpretations of the fraternal bond , the brothers employ ritualistic paddling , frat house sex , and homophobic epithets to fight their way back to straight .
The Syrettian fraternal tradition poses some pre-professional problems for the young men on the campus of George Washington University .
After all , GW ’s fraternity brothers are the nation ’s future congressmen , investment bankers , and CEOs .
They wo n’t reach those positions if their Google profiles turn up associations with homophobic and misogynistic fraternities .
So GW ’s frat boys — and do n’t call them that !— are straining to undo the legacy of “ aggressive heterosexuality ” and gay - bashing forged by their predecessors .
It ’s an effort that involves a good deal of re-education , some new alliances , and a compensatory vice or two .
RUSHING .
Each September , GW ’s potential pledges navigate a monthlong schedule of university - sanctioned rush events .
The activities provide a brief introduction to each fraternity ’s social reputation .
Will the future fraternity brother enjoy s’mores at Kappa Sigma ’s “ acoustic jam ” or feast upon Kappa Alpha Order ’s steamed Maryland crabs ?
Will he chat up Sigma Chi ’s favorite sorority ladies or help Sigma Nu launch a frozen turkey down a Slip ’N Slide ?
Will he scarf Lambda Chi Alpha ’s Chipotle burritos or watch the brothers of TKE take a sledgehammer to a car ?
This year , Beta Theta
Pi decided to trade the food porn and the masculine displays of destruction for a more meaningful approach .
“ The events that I rushed into initially were food - focused , ” says Stephen Molldrem , the fraternity ’s vice president .
“ This year , we ’re trying something completely different .
Other fraternities will pick men who share their values out of the ones who show up for the Maryland blue crabs .
We attract men of values , and we then just happen to serve them Maryland blue crabs when they show up . ”
Beta Theta Pi Vice President Stephen Molldrem
That formula — values first , crabs later — helps weed out the homophobes with the hungry .
In Beta Theta
Pi ’s first rush event this year , titled “ Frat Versus Fraternity : Myths Debunked , ” Molldrem and his brothers discussed popular misconceptions about “ frat boys ” with potential pledges .
William Zelenty , the fraternity ’s rush coordinator , says the strategy had helped establish Beta Theta Pi as an organization of principle .
“ In the past , the fraternity was about upholding the status quo and letting the sexist and homophobic stuff fly , ” he says .
“ Now , we ’re dealing with it .
If you ’re the kind of person who goes around and says that kind of stuff , you ’re not the kind of person I want involved in our chapter .
Not everyone is perfect , but if any homophobic comments arise in a meeting or on the Listserv , I can tell you right now that it ’s quelled immediately . ”
Also not welcome at Beta Theta Pi : stereotypical comments about sexist and homophobic “ frat boys . ”
“ It ’s just patently offensive , ” says Molldrem , who is gay .
“ Even using the words ‘ frat boy ’ together can connote a bias . ”

HAZING .
When one GW sophomore pledged an off - campus fraternity last year , he was relieved that the hazing process did not involve the “ grotesque display of homosexual actions and physical pain ” he had heard rumors of back home in Alabama .
But what the hazing lacked in homophobia , it made up for in Kentucky Gentleman .
The night he officially pledged the fraternity , the student and his pledge class assembled in the frat house .
“ A trash can was brought out and put into the middle of the floor , and we were told to stand around the trash can , ” he says .
“ We were then asked to drop our pants , but to leave our underwear on , ” he says .
The light homoeroticism — and the trash can — proved red herrings for the main event .
Once the pants were dropped , the student says , “ a bottle of Kentucky Gentleman bourbon was introduced to the circle , opened , and passed around among the circle of pledges .
As the pledges drank , the brothers sang .
“ You would have to drink until they stopped singing , ” he says .
“ The first time , it was not that bad — they did n’t sing for that long , ” he says .
“ The second time , they sang for maybe 10 to 12 seconds — an extremely long time . ”
When the bottle was finished , the pledge pulled up his pants as a newly minted member of the fraternity .
“ Shortly after that , I blacked out , ” he says .
The student awoke in Georgetown University hospital to learn that he had left the post - pledging party , entered another student ’s dorm room , and urinated all over his possessions .
The student called the University Police Department , which administered the pledge a breathalyzer test .
He blew a .24 .
All hazing activities — from “ paddling ” to “ scaveneger hunts ” — are banned on the GW campus , and many fraternities honor school rules .
When GW frats do haze , the activities — low on the homoerotic domination , high on the blood alcohol content — comport with the campus ’ progressive nature .
When fraternity brothers do n’t fear associations with homosexuality , they ’re a lot less likely to turn their hangups into a good paddling .
But chugging alcohol is universal .
Stereotypically , “ frat boys are thought of as sexist and homophobic , but I do n’t know if I ’ve ever really heard that at GW , ” says Josh Brown , rush coordinator of Zeta Beta Tau .
Brown , who does n’t drink , says that even GW ’s wildest frat parties involve only “ drinking to prove yourself , ” not “ drinking to get a girl drunk . ”
PARTYING .
Todd Belok , a GW sophomore , was a member of the school ’s Naval ROTC program when he decided to pledge Beta Theta Pi. Belok wanted to make sure his potential brothers “ did n’t hate who I am , ” so he casually informed a couple of brothers of his sexual orientation over the course of the pledge process .
“ I was taking a course with one of the brothers who happened to be in my class , ” says Belok .
“ I asked if I could bring my boyfriend to [ a fraternity ] party , and he said that would be completely fine . ”
Later , inside the Beta Theta
Pi house , another brother “ pulled me over and told me it was totally OK , and they did n’t have a problem with it here . ”
Beta Theta Pi brother Todd Belok
The fraternity house quickly became a safe haven for Belok .
A few weeks later , Belok was again partying with his boyfriend in the Beta house when a couple of Belok ’s fellow NROTC midshipmen saw the couple kissing and reported the infraction to their superiors .
“ I had seen the guys at the party , and I was a little bit concerned , ” says Belok .
“ But I thought it was really wrong to keep on hiding . ”
The incident , which led to Belok ’s dismissal from NROTC under “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , ” revealed a growing rift between two of the nation ’s most masculine traditions — fraternity life , which embraced Belok ’s sexual orientation , and military life , which rejected it .
Belok ’s dismissal has n’t prompted Beta Theta
Pi to take a more discriminating approach to its guest policy .
“ What are you going to do ?
Stop everyone at the door and ask them about their thoughts on various social subjects ? ” says Belok .
But it has renewed the house ’s commitment to its idea of fraternity culture .
“ A lot of the brothers were really angry that it happened , ” says Belok .
“ And they were really angry that it happened here . ”

Mr Blunkett is vice - president of the Alzheimer 's Society Former Home Secretary David Blunkett has pledged to donate his brain to dementia research .
The Sheffield Labour MP is backing a £ 2 m scheme encouraging more people to allow their brains to be used for research after they die .
Mr Blunkett is also vice - president of the Alzheimer 's Society .
Dr Chris Morris , from the Brains for Dementia research brain bank at Newcastle University , said donations were vital in helping to find a cure .
He said : " Much of what we know about the brain , how it works and the treatments we currently have for dementia , comes from research on donated brain tissue .
I hope to be using my brain for a good while longer yet , but I 'm pleased to know that it may help people in the future
David Blunkett MP
" Brains from people without dementia are particularly important as they help us work out the difference between healthy older people and people with dementia . "
Brains for Dementia , which is jointly funded by the Alzheimer 's Society and Alzheimer 's Research Trust , is coordinated by King 's College London and has centres in Newcastle , Cardiff , London , Manchester and Oxford .
Mr Blunkett , Labour MP for Sheffield Brightside , said : " I hope to be using my brain for a good while longer yet , but I 'm pleased to know that it may help people in the future when I no longer have need of it . "
The society 's head of research , Dr Susanne Sorensen , said it was vital to examine human brains - rather than those of animals - to enable comparisons between those of people with and without dementia .
A YouGov poll revealed that a third of 2,021 adults surveyed did not know it was possible to donate their brains .
Donations ' vital ' Discworld author Sir Terry Pratchett , who as patron of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust has led a high - profile campaign to increase awareness of the illness , said it was vital to encourage donations .
He told BBC Radio 5 live 's breakfast show : " Research into Alzheimer 's lags behind that of cancer , even though as a disease Alzheimer 's costs the nation more than heart attacks , strokes and cancer put together .
" They 're certainly going to have my brain because it 's about time somebody made use of it . "
The wife of Roland Boyes , the former MP for Houghton and Washington who died of Alzheimer 's , agreed .
Pat Boyes said : " I 'm donating my brain to the brain bank and I 'm proud that my legacy could help researchers to make the treatment breakthrough we so urgently need . "

Dark matter is either weirder than we thought or does not exist at all , a new study suggests .
A galaxy is supposed to sit at the heart of a giant cloud of dark matter and interact with it through gravity alone .
The dark matter originally provided enough attraction for the galaxy to form and now keeps it rotating .
But observations are not bearing out this simple picture .
Since dark matter does not radiate light , astronomers infer its distribution by looking at how a galaxy ’s gas and stars are moving .
Previous studies have suggested that dark matter must be uniformly distributed within a galaxy ’s central region – a confounding result since the dark matter ’s gravity should make it progressively denser towards a galaxy ’s centre .
Now , the tale has taken a deeper turn into the unknown , thanks to an analysis of the normal matter at the centres of 28 galaxies of all shapes and sizes .
The study shows that there is always five times more dark matter than normal matter where the dark matter density has dropped to one - quarter of its central value .

Undiscovered force ?
The finding goes against expectations because the ratio of dark to normal matter should depend on the galaxy ’s history – for example , whether it has merged with another galaxy or remained isolated during its entire existence .
Mergers should skew the ratio of dark to normal matter on an individual basis .
“ There is absolutely no rule in physics that explains these results , ” says study co-author Hong Sheng Zhao of the University of St Andrews in the UK .
The authors suggest there may be an undiscovered force of nature working between the dark matter and the normal matter , since gravity alone cannot maintain this constant ratio .
Modified gravity
Alternatively , they say our understanding of gravity may need modification to eliminate the need for dark matter entirely .
Some existing theories , such as MOND ( modified Newtonian dynamics ) attempt to do just that , suggesting that gravity does not fade away as quickly as current theories predict .
But Mark Wilkinson of the University of Leicester , who was not involved in the study , urges caution in interpreting the results .
“ Although this clearly shows much more interplay between normal and dark matter than expected , it is too early to say exactly what this means , ” he told New Scientist .
Wilkinson speculates that normal matter may wield more of an influence on dark matter than expected .
He says supernova explosions might somehow be able to blow dark matter out of the galaxies ’ central regions .

A long - standing debate about the structural transition that DNA undergoes when it is stretched seems to have been resolved
Researchers in Europe have literally unravelled a mystery that has been puzzling scientists for years : what happens to a molecule of DNA when it is stretched to its breaking point .
The question is important because DNA is subjected to a range of mechanical manipulations within the cell : it can be folded , unfolded , coiled and uncoiled , unzipped and zipped up again .
A detailed understanding of the elastic properties of DNA can give scientists key insights into interactions of DNA and the proteins that carry out these manipulations .
Almost two decades ago it was shown that when a molecule of double - stranded DNA is pulled from either end , it undergoes a peculiar transition .
Initially the molecule resists stretching .
Then , at a force of 65 piconewtons , the polymer suddenly surrenders and stretches to 1.7 times its original length with little additional force .
It then becomes resistant to stretching once more .
Two competing ideas arose to explain this behaviour .
The first suggested that the DNA remains intact , but that at 65 pN the helix unwinds to form a straight ladder and that the base pairs - the ’ rungs ’ of the ladder - tilt .
The second idea was that the strands of DNA come apart - that the rungs of the ladder break , forming lengths of single - stranded DNA .
Now Erwin Peterman of Vrije University in Amsterdam and colleagues from France and Sweden appear to have answered the question .
The researchers carried out a well - established DNA - stretching experiment by attaching one end of each strand of a length of double - stranded DNA to a polystyrene bead .
The beads can be pulled apart with a controlled and measurable force by lasers - a process called optical tweezing .
However , in a novel approach the team exposed the DNA to two different fluorescent tags .
One binds exclusively to single - stranded DNA and the other to double - stranded DNA .
In this way it is possible directly to view under a microscope if the DNA breaks into single strands or remains intact .
’ Pulling the DNA from both ends is a bit like pulling on a jacket that has a double - ended zipper , ’ says Peterman .
’ What we found was that at the transition force the zipper starts to come apart at either end , but remains zipped in the middle .
In other words , the DNA comes apart at either end , and under tension this single - stranded DNA is 70 per cent longer than double - stranded DNA . ’
Peterman adds , ’ I think this work will make it possible to understand in really great detail the thermodynamics and energetics of what happens to DNA when it is stretched , and this will help us make good models of the interactions of DNA with proteins . ’
Sarah Harris , who models DNA stretching at the University of Leeds in the UK , is thrilled by the study .
’ It is an absolutely gorgeous piece of work .
It tells us about the way the structure of a single molecule is changing under tension , something we have not been able to see before , ’ she says .
’ It does look as though they have solved the question - but as always these issues are very complicated so this might not be the end of the story . ’

Added link to Nieman Journalism Lab , which first publicized the Google filing .
Google is planning to roll out a system of micropayments within the next year and hopes that newspapers will use it as they look for new ways to charge users for their content .
The revelation was made in a document that Google sent to the Newspaper Association of America in response to a request for paid - content proposals that the association sent to several technology companies .
The Google document , which was first publicized by the Nieman Journalism Lab , indicates that the micropayment system will be an extension of Google Checkout , a payment system that Google rolled out in 2006 and positioned as a competitor to eBay ‘s PayPal service , the leading system for online payments .
“ While currently in the early planning stages , micropayments will be a payment vehicle available to both Google and non-Google properties within the next year , ” Google wrote .
“ The idea is to allow viable payments of a penny to several dollars by aggregating purchases across merchants and over time . ”
Ten other companies responded to the association ’s request , including Microsoft , I.B.M. and Oracle .
But Google ’s plans are particularly interesting because of the delicate relationship between the newspaper industry and the company .
In the document , Google said that newspapers could also use Checkout to charge for subscriptions , but it described the system for managing the subscriptions as “ fairly rudimentary . ”
Newspapers have been grappling with an industrywide financial crisis that has devastated many dailies .
The industry is trying to find new ways to earn revenue , and several publishers are evaluating ways to charge for content .
Randy Bennett , senior vice president of business development for the industry association , said the request for proposals was made following a meeting of its members in May .
He said it is now up to individual newspapers to decide whether to pursue relationships with any of the companies that submitted proposals .
Google , which has long relied on advertising for the overwhelming majority of its revenue , said that it believed that paid content could be a good complement to advertising .
“ While we believe that advertising will likely remain the main source of revenue for most news content , a paid model can serve as an important source of additional revenue .
In addition , a successful paid content model can enhance advertising opportunities , rather than replace them , ” the company wrote .
The Google proposal , if it goes forward , could put the company in competition with Journalism Online , a venture backed by Steven Brill and L. Gordon Crovitz , which has recently said that it had tentatively signed more than 500 newspapers for its services .
Those services include “ hybrid models for paid content . ”
Journalism Online is one of the companies that presented a proposal to the association .
In a statement , Google said :
The Newspaper Association of America asked Google to submit some ideas for how its members could use technology to generate more revenue from their digital content , and we shared some of those ideas in this proposal .
It ’s consistent with Google ’s effort to help publishers reach bigger audiences , better engage their readers and make more money .
We have always said that publishers have full control over their content .
If they decide to charge for it , we ’ll work with them to ensure that their content can be easily discovered if they want it to be .
As for Checkout , we do n’t have any specific new services to announce but we ’re always looking for ways to make payments online more efficient and user - friendly .
Google has been experimenting with new ways to highlight news content and new ways to display it .
August 1 , 2006 Far Technologies ’ latest clever military aviation idea could have far reaching consequences as it enables military air forces to use fewer resources in performing more missions .
Jet fighters are frightfully expensive weapons that require a lot of effort getting them to the fight .
Aerial refuelling enables fighters to cover vast differences but once they ’ve used their onboard firepower , usually in just a few minutes , they need to go back to base , land , re-arm and start all over again .
The Airborne Weapon Re-Arming system ( ABRA ) removes much of that process by re-arming aircraft in the air close to the fighting zone .
ABRA doubles most measurables such as attacks executed and operational tempo , without increasing the aircraft fleet .
The operational flexibility is both simplified and improved .
Aircraft can remain in the vicinity of targets , the density of the attacks can be dramatically increased , response times ( from target detection to attack ) reduced , pressure on operating bases decreased and there ’s a significant reduction in determining and allocating the sequences of the combat forces and formations for the mission along with increased aircraft availability for alternative real time mission allocation .
Aircraft can even take off without ordnance and be configured appropriately enroute .
On top of that , ABRA would also enable a continuation of aircraft usage when the home base or carrier ship is under attack and greater aircrew familiarity with the constantly changing battle arena .
Isreali - based FAR Technologies Ltd. ( FAR ) is a conceptual and technological incubator for initiating and nurturing innovative concepts and technologies in the military aviation arena .
FAR conducts preliminary feasibility studies , engineering design and patent applications and is seeking partners to develop , sell or license their range of innovative IP .
One of the best ideas we ’ve seen for a while , the Airborne Weapon Re-Arming system ( ABRA ) for fighter aircraft effectively multiplies the effectiveness of a fighter aircraft many times .
By re-arming aircraft in the air close to the fighting zone , the much quicker turnaround time means a fighter aircraft can be used multiple times at the same place – one fighter might take the place of three or four or more .
Due to the extremely high cost of fighter aircraft , there is a constant demand for improved operational versatility and efficiency and operational costs would be significantly less for applying the same amount of force .
ABRA allows for the efficient aerial delivery of bombs from a cargo aircraft to an attack aircraft ( fighter jet or UCAV ) and is a low cost add - on because neither the cargo and combat aircraft will require modification .
Closed circuit TV enables the re-arming to take place day or night and the design allows for the cargo plane to carry large quantities of possible armaments enabling attack aircraft to be reconfigured for multiple missions .
In addition to the efficient weapon storage system inside the cargo plane , there ’s a remote driven BOOM operating from an aft door , which uses its own aerodynamic lift surfaces to produce it ’s own lift as it carries the ordnance , hence reducing the momentum on the tanker
ABRA can be fitted to any combat aircraft , be it fighter .
helicopter and UCAV .
The fighter aircraft is equipped with " smart pylons " , which allow connecting and interface with the cargo Aircraft robotic arm boom system to enable the installation and activation of any weapon on the attack aircraft ’s pneumatic multi-action ejection mechanism .
Based on the concept and technology , Professor Asher Tishler , from the Faculty of Management at the Tel Aviv University , conducted an analysis of the potential combined operational , logistical and economical contribution of airborne rearming on 3 – 9 hours bombing missions at ranges of 250 to 1,000 nautical miles from the operating base .
For UCAVs , 12 – 30 hour mission durations were analyzed .
The analysis demonstrated a dramatic increase in the number of bombs dropped for a given mission duration :
* Increase of well over 100 % more bombs for close - by target zones *
Increase of well over 200 % more bombs for far away target zones *
A dramatic reduction in the time required to drop a given number of bombs on the target zone - Over 60 % reduction in the time required for close - by target zones - About 70 % ( or more ) reduction in the time required for far away target zones

Middle age is n't all bad .
Here is just one of the unsung bonuses : if you passed your driving test before 1997 , you 're already qualified to raise merry hell on public roads at the wheel of a car - plus - caravan " outfit " of up to 8.25 tonnes in weight .
So when you see someone under 30 towing a caravan , be content that at least they know what they 're doing , having proven so in a stringent supplementary test .
Except you wo n't , because unless they 're stealing it or are en route to some Top Gear - sponsored demolition derby , no one under 30 tows a caravan .
Two things threaten that demographic .
First , recession : a domestic caravan holiday is cheap , which explains why bookings at Caravan Club sites are up by 40 per cent this year .
Second , Airstream - the only caravan it 's OK to want , or indeed ever to refer to by name - has just released a modish European range .
These factors are fated never to work in tandem , however , because Airstreams are tremendously expensive .
In the deeply conservative world of caravan design , standing out from the crowd is a simple matter of not looking like a big margarine tub .
With their curvaceous silver flanks and their smoked glass , the new Airstreams manage this with some ease .
The European range pays strident homage to the US firm 's iconic 1936 launch model , a gleaming , bullet - nosed embodiment of that era's obsession with aerodynamics and shiny metal , fittingly crafted by the designer responsible for Charles Lindbergh 's Spirit of St Louis monoplane .
It 's a testament to their timeless appeal , and aluminium 's rust - resistant durability , that an astonishing 70 per cent of all Airstreams ever made are still on the road .
Mindful that I live in a road of modest breadth and challenging geometry , I elected to pick up my Airstream International 684 - and the mighty Land Rover thoughtfully provided by the firm to save my turn - of - the - century Mondeo estate any embarrassment - from the car park of our local B&Q .
The prudence of this arrangement asserted itself at once .
The principal distinction of Airstream 's European models , I 'd been told , was that they 'd been condensed in sympathy with our cramped and twisty - turny continent .
Compact was not a word that sprang to mind as I surveyed my family 's home and haulier for the weekend ahead : a shining , eight - wheeled convoy that filled the tarmac chasm between garden deliveries and the trolley rack .
It would have looked more at home trundling across Red Square on May Day .
Two shimmering tonnes and 50 grand 's worth of hand - riveted aluminium and high - end consumer electronics : on the caravan spectrum , this was well away from Father Ted 's holiday home , and closer to the sort of thing that Russell Crowe might be found losing his temper inside .
If Jeremy Clarkson 's tireless caravan - baiting suggests a man protesting too much , his guilty secret would be an Airstream at the back of the quadruple garage .
My daughters were won over before they even got in , by the step that electrically projected itself to welcome them up to the door .
My son was never going to be a tough nut to crack , institutionalised as he is to bijou living after 15 years in a box room , sleeping on a stilted bed with his nose a foot from the ceiling .
The permanent queen - sized mattress installed at the Airstream 's very distant back seemed to placate my wife who , like me but with greater foreboding , had expected to assemble something from many lengths of sofa cushion .
For me , one glance around the interior - flat - screen telly , downlighters , climate control - emphasised how wonderfully little this weekend would share with my solitary relevant experience , a family tour of North Wales during an earlier recession - related caravanning boom in the mid-70s .
That caravan , borrowed from my grandfather , was built from hardboard and Formica , and offered only two berths .
So it was that every night my older siblings and I huddled together at the mildewed flaps of an earwig - colonised army - surplus tent pitched alongside , watching my parents knock back the Mateus Rosé .
Justice was served when our chemical toilet overturned during an ascent of Britain 's second - steepest road , shedding its grim load across their sleeping quarters .
The last time I looked , which in fairness was n't recently , caravans were still exclusively furnished in horrible brown gingham and made out of old kitchen units .
The Airstream really is not .
Pimped up beyond all recognition , it hardly deserves to be called a caravan .
Bold colours and elliptical storage holes impart the retro-futuristic vibe of a space - station shuttle in 2001 .
The bathroom sink is one of those swanky counter - top porcelain troughs , and the white - piped leather and louche cushions give the U - shaped seating zone the look of a holding area for high - class groupies .
If you 're not a glutton for attention , look elsewhere for your mobile accommodation .
We were n't so much going on holiday as going on tour .
The 684 is Airstream 's hugest model , something I came to appreciate as the cheery man who 'd delivered it walked me around the preposterous perimeter .
Street - legal I might have been , but it was n't hard to understand why Airstream had politely insisted on bolstering age with a little experience .
The week before , at their behest , I had travelled to the Caravan Club 's training centre in Sussex for a half - day caravan - manipulating masterclass .
Under the calm eye of instructor Bernie Jones , I very nearly succeeded in backing a much smaller and less valuable caravan through a precise 90 - degree turn , the standard campsite - parking procedure .
" It 's all about confidence , " Bernie said after one of my more complete failures , but it was actually about defying every tenet of spatial logic .
A mastery of parallel parking is n't going to help : you 're better off calling on an aptitude for cutting your own hair .
With a left - handed scythe , in the dark .
You turn the wheel very slightly one way , and the caravan goes drastically the other ; a tiny corrective adjustment and your outfit is swiftly jack - knifed at five - to - one .
Then Bernie tells you to do it again using only your big sticky - out mirrors , and this time everything goes wrong in reverse .
It 's like the Highway Code redrafted by Escher .
The stand - out message of that day : when it comes to opportunities for cartoon misadventure , the caravanner is spoilt for choice .
He can forget to crank down the prop stands in each corner , and have the caravan and its contents seesaw destructively to earth when his family climbs in .
He can forget to crank them back up before he leaves , doing terrible things to the caravan chassis and anything in its path .
He can drive away with the electric cable or the waste - water container still plugged in , or the little front jockey wheel still lowered .
He can leave a window ever so slightly open , and arrive at his destination to find the caravan internally slathered with road filth , or omit to attach the " breakaway cable " , and arrive to find it gone .
Bernie had already given me a 16 - point pre-departure checklist , and attempting to acquire familiarity with the Airstream man 's supplementary 12 - pointer ( " 10 : prime toilet " ) meant we lurched out into Chiswick roundabout at the height of Friday 's early evening rush hour .
The Land Rover acknowledged its monstrous burden with only the slightest hint of inertia ; I did my white - faced expressionless best to ignore whatever might be going on at the Airstream 's unseen rear , a couple of postcodes behind .
The motorway was better , despite the jolt of panic that accompanied every reflex glance in the rear - view mirror , and the accompanying revelation that we were being aggressively tailgated by a New York subway carriage .
Every time we approached a service station a growing number of family members pleaded for refreshment and , later , bladder relief , but they pleaded in vain .
A close - quarter manoeuvre before a baying crowd of Happy Eaters just was n't going to happen .
Other motorists seemed torn between covetous rubber - necking and exhibiting their Clarkson tendency .
Glamorous , huge and shiny it might be , but it was still a caravan .
Kids in passing cars would beam and wave , then their dads would cut me up .
Only lorry drivers gave their unreserved headlight - flashing approval , and even they dropped back in embarrassment once we left the M40 and its forgiving expanses of carriageway and began waywardly punishing kerbs and mini roundabouts .
To those with partners less fixated on Tudor pageantry , the West Midlands may not seem an obvious choice for a weekend break .
Yet something had lured dozens of large white boxes to the Caravan Club 's immaculate Chapel Lane site , south of Birmingham , and it can't just have been the newly restored Elizabeth Garden at Kenilworth Castle .
The rain that now fell steadily had long been predicted , as had the unseasonal chill in the air .
Most caravan owners are campers made good : perhaps part of the fun of caravanning is doing it in weather that makes you really glad you 're not in a tent .
The sight of our Zeppelin nosing up to the gates brought faces to many plastic windows .
" Caravan parking is a voyeuristic sport , " Bernie had warned me , " especially when someone turns up towing a massive silver cigar . "
My navigational probings proved so instantly and shriekingly inept that within moments the site warden had trotted up and was talking me in - left hand down , full lock , to me , to you .
Every order was the precise opposite of my expectation , but in a minute we were geometrically aligned in position A .
Almost at once the first of many curious neighbours squelched over .
" I said to the wife , ' Stick your wellies on , love - we 've got to have a look at that ' . "
He probably meant the Airstream , rather than the spectacle of a wet family losing a fight with a stubborn jockey wheel .
It was 40 minutes before everything was unhitched , cranked down , clipped on and plugged in to my semi-satisfaction , yet despite that and the weather , anticipation was somehow sustained .
The electric step hummed out and we piled aboard .
A night in a caravan : an experience that life had thus far denied each of us , to the regret of very nearly all .
Fiddling with switches and finding the corkscrew occupied a happy half hour .
Then we microwaved ready meals , and ate them perched on those groovy leather banquettes , watching Casualty .
Washing up five plates and priming the odd toilet somehow accounted for all our 40 litres of water : over the weekend we had to refill the drum five times .
Caravanning is certainly an effective way to confront the reality of human wastefulness , and indeed human waste .
But parenting is so much easier when you 've got emptying the toilet cassette in your armoury of punishments .
Huw Edwards said goodnight , and in the absence of Freeview and board games the entertainment options instantly withered .
This could have proved an awkward juncture in the holiday schedule : a couple of hours of parental us - time ahead , with the only place to enjoy it now waiting to be turned into our children 's bed .
But the journey had left me spent , and you can't make teenagers go to sleep at 10.30 pm on a Friday .
My wife and I and our 10 - year - old stumbled off to the big bed at the back , and left the other two to enjoy some them - time .
It should have been an incendiary situation : a small space and two physically determined young people deep into a phase of mutual hatred .
It is a tribute to the convivial mood engendered by Airstream life that we were woken by birdsong not bloodshed .
An unedifying fry - up fuelled us for Kenilworth , and after a complementary side - trip to Warwick Castle we got back to Chapel Lane in time for the Eurovision Song Contest .
Despite the mood lighting and surround sound , I was by now detecting the odd echo of my childhood caravanning experience : the mysterious underfloor gurgles , the ropey TV reception , the banged elbows , the cupboard doors dashed into faces .
Spill a pint of milk at home and it's a pain .
In a caravan it 's an apocalypse .
Crammed round the table , we all got alarmingly into Eurovision .
With one loud voice we cheered and chortled and roared ugly partisan abuse .
The enhanced camaraderie was almost unavoidable : stick a family in a caravan and you bring it together in the most literal sense .
Already I could feel the first twinges of regret that in the morning we'd be stepping down that electric step for the last time .
But this was tempered with the surging , untrammelled glee that having done so , we would - by very gracious arrangement with the Airstream man - be driving back down the M40 gloriously unencumbered .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Ken Lewis does n't have a golden parachute , but he's all set for a comfortable landing -- unlike his long - suffering shareholders .
The Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) chief executive officer said Wednesday he 'll step aside at year - end after eight years at the helm .
Based on the company 's most recent proxy statement , he will have $ 53 million in pension benefits waiting for him when he leaves .
That should give him about $ 3.5 million a year in pension payouts for the rest of his life -- at a time when people who bought the stock when he took the reins in 2001 are underwater on their investments .
Although the bank swore off employment contracts and eliminated golden parachutes seven years ago , Lewis can thank a pension plan that dates back decades for his rich retirement rewards .
While this plan was open , certain top executives were eligible to accrue benefits they would receive following retirement in the form of annuity payments .
Lewis was the biggest winner in these plans , but other BofA execs benefited as well .
Vice Chairman James
Hance , for instance , retired in 2005 with an indicated annual benefit of $ 2.7 million .
Ironically , BofA decided to freeze this so - called supplemental executive retirement plan at the same time it got rid of golden parachutes , citing the need to better align executive compensation with investor returns .
By any measure , those have been poor at BofA of late .
The company 's stock fetches less than half its year - ago price and remains below its level when Lewis took over in April 2001 -- even after a 563 % jump off lows from this March .
But before BofA made its compensation switch , Lewis had participated for more than a decade in the supplemental pension plan -- racking up the more than $ 50 million supplemental plan account .
That 's not all .
Lewis also has $ 10 million in deferred compensation owed to him and another $ 8 million in restricted stock and stock options as of Dec. 31 that will continue to vest over coming years , according to the most recent proxy filing .
BofA referred questions about Lewis ' retirement plan to those filings .
Assessing a total value on Lewis ' walking - away pay is an inexact science , given changes in BofA 's stock price and other factors .
But Paul Hodgson , senior research associate at the Corporate Library governance tracker , said his firm 's most recent survey of retirement plans puts Lewis ' take at $ 64 million .
That number is down by more than half from 2006 , when BofA shares traded above $ 50 , compared with a recent $ 16.21 .
But it still " puts him in the top 40 " nationwide , Hodgson said .
Not that Lewis should need the money .
Though his cash salary has been $ 1.5 million annually since he took the reins in 2001 , he has managed to chalk up $ 63 million in pay and perks over the past three years , according to filings -- including almost $ 10 million last year , which ended with Lewis bickering with federal officials over the terms of its purchase of brokerage Merrill Lynch .
In the end , the U.S. backed BofA 's purchase of Merrill -- but at a steep cost to Lewis ' standing with shareholders , who stripped him in April of his chairmanship , prompting numerous critics to start the countdown to his departure .
" Ken Lewis 's resignation as CEO is the overdue but inevitable result of the overwhelming shareholder opposition registered at Bank of America 's 2009 annual meeting , " the CtW Investment Group , long a vocal critic of Lewis ' leadership , said in a statement Wednesday evening .
" The onus is now on the board of directors to engage with shareholders to name a successor who can quickly restore the bank 's credibility with investors , regulators and Congress . "
Lewis ' decision to throw tens of billions of shareholder dollars at Merrill when it was on the brink of collapse even drew chortles from the likes of Warren Buffett , the billionaire investor who last month dubbed Lewis the " ironic hero " of the meltdown .
But with BofA shares down two - thirds from their 2006 highs , Lewis will depart as no hero to investors -- ironic or otherwise .
Correction :
An earlier version of this story misstated the name of the Corporate Library , a corporate governance watchdog , and the title of senior research associate Paul Hodgson .
But how will it hang on me ?
Next time you are trapped inside a neon - lit changing room trying on a possible clothes purchase , you might think of calling a mathematician , rather than a sales assistant , to help work out why those trousers are n't hanging just right .
Researchers from Harvard University and the University of Santiago in Chile have begun to solve the equations governing the way in which fabric drapes , and hope that their work will help make shopping a little easier in the future .
We have an innate appreciation for the way fabric moves and falls .
We can tell when an artist has accurately depicted the way clothes respond to the shape and motion of the wearer , or when some computer animations fall short with rubbery , unrealistic outfits .
But science has had a hard time describing exactly how a piece of fabric will drape over an object - because of the complicated and changing patterns of folds arising from the competing gravitational and bending forces .
Rather than using large - scale computation to solve the problem , L. Mahadevan and his colleagues focused on the elements of draping - the flat sheets , cylinders and cones - that make up the folded surface .
" These elements of draping are clearly illustrated by considering three distinct but related examples : the suspension of a heavy elastic sheet from a point , along a straight line , or along a curved line , " the researchers wrote in their recent paper , published in the US journal , the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
When a circular sheet was hung from a point in its centre , the researchers were able to describe exactly when and how it would switch from bending in half cylindrically to falling into a cone with one or two folds .
At the heart of their mathematical equations was the gravity length , which is the length scale where the balance between the bending and gravitational energies becomes important .
The gravity length of a fabric is
whereis the thickness of the fabric , is its density , is the gravitational constant , andis its bending stiffness , which takes into account both its stiffness and the way in which stretching it in one dimension affects how it changes shape in the other two dimensions ( think of a rubber band thinning in cross- section as you stretch it ) .
In a rubber sheet , , while for a sheet of wrapping paper , which is thinner and stiffer ,
Using scaling arguments , they were also able to predict the shape , including the number of folds , for other situations , where the sheet in question was much larger than the material 's gravity length , or was instead covering a circular table , or suspended from a curtain rail .
The researchers hope that they will eventually be able to reconstruct more complicated draping surfaces by piecing these simpler structures together .
" We have to ' stitch ' the resulting cones , cylinders and flat sheets together much as a couturier does , " they wrote .
But which ones are the perfect fit ?
Although fashion designers might not use these results themselves - " they tend not to be interested in mathematical equations of any shape or form , " says Jennifer Bougourd , a researcher from the London College of Fashion - the growing field of virtual shopping might .
You can already use a virtual changing room in Selfridges in London to find your perfect pair of jeans .
A 3D scanner creates a model of your body , and then software wraps pattern pieces from designer jeans around the virtual you - if the jeans do n't fit , the virtual jeans will either stand away from the model or not wrap all the way around .
Bourgard says that the computer representation of the hang of the denim is very good , but that " the main interest is getting the fabric representation and drape working for every type of fabric " .
Plus looks forward to the day we can try on any outfit in a store at the touch of a button , without even having to remove our shoes !
BOGOTA , Colombia – Wearing headphones and seated in front of computers , a dozen government spies eavesdrop on the telephone calls of suspected criminals .
The agents are members of the DAS , Colombia ’s main intelligence agency , and they ’ve received court orders to carry out these particular phone taps .
But for at least the past four years , DAS agents have also been illegally monitoring telephone calls made by Colombian politicians , human rights activists , judges and journalists .
Many are political adversaries of President Alvaro Uribe , who is trying to change the constitution in order to run for a third four - year term next year .
And because the DAS operates under the direct authority of the president ’s office , many critics suspect Uribe or his inner circle .
“ The big question is who gave the order ? ” said Enrique Santos , editor of Semana , Colombia ’s most influential news magazine , which uncovered the scandal earlier this year .
“ It ’s normal for an intelligence agency to monitor guerrillas , paramilitaries and drug lords , ” he added .
“ But when the DAS wire taps journalists and the political opposition , you have a huge problem . ”
It ’s not as if the Colombian government lacks for true enemies .
The country ’s guerrilla war has been grinding on for 45 years while the illegal narcotics trade remains as robust as ever .
But the DAS – the Spanish acronym for the Department of Administrative Security – has a long history of being infiltrated by criminals and of targeting innocents .
Just last month , police arrested a former DAS director after linking him to the 1989 murder of then - presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan .
Uribe ’s first DAS chief has also been jailed on charges of colluding with death squads to assassinate three union leaders and a university professor .
Since then , Uribe has gone through three more DAS directors who have failed to clean up the agency .
In the domestic spy scandal — dubbed DAS - gate — one of the main targets has been Ivan Velasquez , a Supreme Court justice who is leading an investigation into ties between pro-Uribe lawmakers and paramilitary death squads .
One of the illegal recordings to surface was a cell phone conversation between Velasquez and James Faulkner , the legal attache at the American Embassy in Bogota — which drew a sharp protest from the U.S. State Department .
Also spied upon was Rafael Pardo , a presidential candidate for the opposition Liberal Party who was monitored by the DAS in 2006 .
“ It was nothing relevant , ” Pardo said of his phone conversations that the DAS recorded .
“ The problem for me is not the content .
The problem is that this is a crime . ”
Even though government investigators have yet to get to identify the culprits , the president ’s critics are trying to use DAS - gate to scuttle his re-election plans .
They claim that Uribe has amassed too much power and that the illegal phone tapping is a telltale sign of a paranoid government that sees enemies around every corner .
“ This has become a political debate and people are trying to take advantage , ” said Felipe Munoz , who was named director of the DAS earlier this year .
Munoz pointed out that even high government officials , like Vice President Francisco Santos , were targeted by the DAS .
And just as opponents of Richard Nixon were disappointed when their names did n’t show up on the infamous White House “ enemies list , ” Munoz said he ’s heard from Colombian politicians who were crestfallen to learn their phones had n’t been tapped by the DAS .
At DAS headquarters , a massive concrete bunker in the center of Bogota , Munoz tried to demystify the agency .
Wearing a wool sweater and a smile , he showed off his private office which contained several suitcases that were sealed shut with tape and filled with electronic eavesdropping equipment labeled “ Triggerfish 4000 . ”
The bulky equipment brought to mind the 1980s - era surveillance gear featured in “ The Lives of Others , ” the Oscar - winning film about Stasi agents spying on East German artists .
Munoz said he turned the machines over to government investigators who later returned them to the DAS , but he has refused to put them back into operation .
“ They ’ve been sitting here since April , ” Munoz said .
Still , Munoz admitted that much of the illegal spying took place outside the DAS building and from the inside of panel trucks outfitted with mobile surveillance equipment .
He blamed the problems on the enormous size of the DAS .
Thought to be Latin America ’s largest spy agency , the DAS employs more than 6,500 people .
Besides gathering intelligence , its duties include stamping passports at border checkpoints , providing security at airports and protecting government officials .
Rather than a master plan emanating from the presidential palace , Munoz said , the domestic spying was likely the work of rogue agents .
He argued that Uribe is the most popular president in recent Colombian history and has no need to spy on his opponents .
“ He ’s never said : ‘ Check out what that judge is doing ’ or ‘ Find out what the opposition is up to . ’” Munoz said .
“ The only instruction I ’ve ever received from the president is to fight the criminals . ”
Earlier this month , Uribe announced that he would close the DAS and farm out its activities to the army , police and other government agencies .
But the scandal has made no dent in his job - approval rating , mainly because his hard - line security policies have reduced kidnappings and homicides and made Colombia safer .
“ The people from the ruling class , academia and the media talk about how dangerous it would be for Uribe to remain in power , ” said Santos of Semana magazine .
“ But for the majority of Colombians , Uribe has been a great president and they want him to remain in power . ”

Sibel Edmonds , the FBI Turkish translator turned whistleblower , is the most gagged person in the history of the United States .
The Justice Department under George W. Bush ’s Attorney General John Ashcroft twice silenced her using the rarely employed state secrets privilege .
The government and the mainstream media have presented a united front against her , calling her a " kook " and a liar , even though the gag order in itself confirmed that she had a tale to tell about massive government corruption that was all too credible and would embarrass Democrat and Republican alike .
Sibel ’s day in court came in early August when she was allowed to give a detailed deposition under oath in connection with a lawsuit filed in Ohio .
Her deposition , naming names and providing corroborating details was predictably ignored by the mainstream media but was a sensation on the blogosphere .
It led to my conducting an interview with Sibel for The American Conservative magazine , which appeared this week .
Why is Sibel ’s tale important for every American and why is it being ignored by our elected officials and the Fourth Estate ?
The story is important because it is about massive and systematic corruption of our elected officials and senior bureaucrats with the active connivance of the media .
Worse , the corruption was carried out by agents of several foreign governments and involved nuclear secrets stolen from American defense laboratories and military bases that were , in some cases , sold to the highest bidder .
Some of the congressmen involved are now retired and working for those very same foreign governments that stole America ’s secrets .
To those who claim that Sibel Edmonds is a fraud and that she is propagating lies for reasons of her own I would observe the following : Sibel has been interrogated by two US Senators , by the Justice Department ’s Inspector General ’s Office , and by suspicious fact checkers working for the television news program 60 Minutes , for the Times of London , and for Vanity Fair .
She has been found to be a credible witness by everyone who has taken the time to talk to her and no one has ever been able to disprove any aspect of her story .
Could it be that Sibel Edmonds is a clever and possibly even diabolical fraud artist who has manipulated me and others ?
Of course it ’s possible , though I would point out that she has convinced a number of skeptics that there is substance to her allegations .
I for one spent twenty years in Army intelligence and the CIA listening regularly to scoundrels , liars , and thieves spin their tales .
If Sibel Edmonds is a fabricator , she is a damned good one .
I would also note that there is a fundamental flaw to the criticism of Sibel , which is that she claims that every single statement made by her is backed up by actual documents in FBI investigative files dealing with the activities of foreign agents who were suborning our elected officials and senior bureaucrats .
She has even provided the numbers of the files .
At the end of the day , either the files and the evidence they contain are there or they are not .
If they are not , then the government should make its case publicly that fraud is being committed by Sibel and her supporters and take whatever legal action they consider to be appropriate .
I would suggest that the silence from the government over this matter in itself confirms that the allegations are true in every detail .
Why does no one want to look into Sibel ’s accusations ?
I would guess that it is partly because her tale involves Washington ’s most powerful foreign policy lobby , that of Israel , and also the less powerful but undeniably important lobby of Turkey .
But it is also due to the fact that both Democrats and Republicans are the evildoers in her story as well as senior officials in the Pentagon and State Department who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations .
It is a can of worms that no one wants to touch , which is precisely why it should be opened and examined if the public is every to regain faith in government .
Some of Sibel ’s allegations would be extraordinary at any time and are almost hard to believe .
She reports that the CIA was covertly supporting al - Qaeda linked groups in the Balkans and central Asia right up until 9/11 .
She tells how a reporter at the New York Times was fed material by senior state department official Marc Grossman who was at the time taking bribes from Turkish contacts while alerting Turkish and Pakistani intelligence officers to the fact that Valerie Plame ’s company Brewster - Jennings was a CIA cover unit engaged in preventing nuclear proliferation .
Sibel names Pentagon insiders who obtained personnel information on government employees and contractors so that they could be targeted by foreign intelligence officers .
She reveals that congressman Tom Lantos was openly passing classified information on to the government of Israel and that Israel would take what it wanted and then pass the remainder on to the Turks .
Sibel describes how highly sensitive information from US defense labs would be collected by foreign graduate students carefully inserted into the labs then sold to the intelligence services of countries like Pakistan that were developing their own nuclear weapons .
She details how one married Democratic congresswoman who was bisexual was targeted by Turkish agents and filmed being seduced by a woman who was provided for her , possibly to enable blackmail to secure the congresswoman ’s cooperation .
Sibel ’s tale includes descriptions of how other congressmen received bribes and illegal political contributions and were rewarded by being given well - paying jobs ever after , with several of them now working for Turkish companies or as lobbyists for Turkey .
She confirms that the Bush Administration was seeking to attack Iraq long before the twin towers fell , detailing how before 9/11 several Pentagon officials discussed with the Turkish government the invasion and division of Iraq into " spheres of influence " between Washington and London .
The talks broke down when Ankara decided that it wanted its own slice of the pie .
And no one seems to care .
Congressman Henry Waxman , formerly chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee , seemed interested in Sibel Edmonds ’ story and appeared willing to open hearings , but his enthusiasm vanished at some point and he refused to return her calls .
Was it because Israel was involved that Waxman developed cold feet ?
Was it because some of the traitors were Democrats ?
Quite possibly a combination of the two , though it is only my speculation .
The current chairman of the committee Edolphus Towns has displayed no interest in the Edmonds case in spite of the Obama Administration ’s pledge to bring change to government .
It is clear that if the citizens of the United States are every actually to hear what Sibel Edmonds has to say it will be because the people demand it .
It is time to call one ’s congressman and ask " What about Sibel Edmonds ? "
It is time to write letters to the newspapers and television news media demanding that her story be told .
If there is ever to be even a minimum of accountability and a restoration of some measure of integrity in government it has to start somewhere .
Why not start by listening to Sibel Edmonds ?

PROVO -- Unemployment in Utah rose again last month , and that surely contributed to the crowd that turned out Monday for a chance at a job at a burger joint .
The popular In - N - Out chain is opening Utah branches , and hundreds of people showed up at the Provo SpringHill Suites Marriott to apply for one of 150 positions at the new Orem and Draper locations .
Those applying for a position gave several of reasons why they wanted to work for the fast - food chain .
The No. 1 reason is a competitive starting wage .
One applicant , Jordan McAllister , said , " When I got here , the line went all the way around the building .
It was kind of interesting . "
Despite the large turn - out , McAllister was confident .
" I felt like my interview went pretty well .
I got to be realistic and look at the amount of people here , but I felt good about it , " he said .
Another applicant , Lori Gardner , said flipping burgers might not be her first choice , but she'd be happy with the job .
" It 's hard to find a job right now .
A lot of places are n't hiring , so you just have to do what you have to do , " Gardner said .
In - N - Out starts its employees off at $ 10 an hour .
The competitive wage had one woman waiting in line for over an hour .
In 1948 , the first In - N - Out Burger was founded by Harry and Esther Snyder in Baldwin Park , California .
For the next several decades , In - N - Out grew slowly throughout Southern California , and in 1992 opened its first chain outside Southern California in Las Vegas .
In - N - Out subsequently migrated into Northern California and in 2000 moved into Arizona and Utah in 2008 ( Washington ) .
In - N - Out has never franchised , and plans to remain privately owned .
The menu- burgers , fries and drinks - is still the same basic menu since 1948 .
Everything is still made fresh to order .
There are no microwaves or freezers .
Its slogan is , " quality you can taste . "
** History of In - N - Out Burger **! [ ] ( http://media.bonnint.net/slc/1511/151138/15113857.jpg)
" I think people really want to work for In - N - Out Burger , but I think if you throw the economics into it also , it probably helps the process a little bit , " said Raymond Maldonado , regional manager for In - N - Out Burger .
In - N- Out executives said the chain 's new locations are ideally located for shipping in fresh ingredients .
They said the company prides itself on the quality of its food , and the customers like it too .
" The response has just been very overwhelming and welcoming .
We feel very excited to be here , " said divisional manager Kristi Calmy .
Open interviews for the Draper and Orem locations continue through Tuesday .
Interviews for the American Fork location will be held the week before Thanksgiving .
The Orem location is expected to open sometime in November .
No word yet on when the Draper and American Fork locations will open .

The Free Software Foundation France ( FSF France ) is jubilant about a recent court ruling that has affirmed the validity of the open source GNU General Public License ( GPL ) under French copyright law .
This successful GPL enforcement effort will send a strong message about the importance of open source license compliance to the French software industry .
The GPL is a copyleft license that mandates reciprocal disclosure of source code .
When a company incorporates code that is licensed under the GPL into their software product , they are obligated to make their own code available under the terms of the GPL , which stipulates that source code must be made available for third parties to study , modify , and redistribute .
Companies that ship GPL - based products must provide notice to end users and promise to furnish source code upon request .
Companies that use the GPL but fail to comply with the license 's terms are exposing themselves to the risk of copyright infringement litigation .
GPL noncompliance is almost always the result of ignorance or honest misunderstanding .
In such cases , organizations like the FSF and the Software Freedom Law Center will engage with perpetrators and attempt to educate them about their legal responsibilities so that a nonconfrontational solution can be reached outside of court .
In a handful of rare cases , however , companies have stubbornly attempted to defy licensing obligations and end up being taken to court by developers who are represented by open source advocacy legal groups .
This almost never ends well for the companies in question and they typically end up settling out of court when they realize that they can't win .
It 's very rare for a GPL enforcement case to proceed all the way to an actual ruling .
One example from Europe is a 2007 case in which VoIP company Skype was slapped with an injunction for failing to make source code available for a Linux - based VoIP handset .
The recent case in France involved a dispute over the licensing of remote desktop access software .
A company called Edu4 , which sells distance learning tools and multimedia equipment for education , was distributing a derivative of an open source VNC software client , but declined to provide its source code despite its obligation to do so under the GPL .
The company had also stripped out copyright notices and other markers that would have identified the program to users as open source software .
Association pour la formation professionnelle des adultes ( AFPA ) , an education organization that purchases software from Edu4 , pursued GPL enforcement with the help of FSF France when Edu4 refused repeated requests to make the source code available .
The infringement lawsuit , which was filed by AFPA in 2002 , has now come to a close with the Judge deciding against Edu4 .
The fact that a software recipient , rather than the developer , was successful in a GPL enforcement effort could have implications for how questions of standing are evaluated in future open source licensing disputes in France .
" We 've long said the GNU GPL is enforceable , and of course we 're pleased to see another court reaffirm that fact , " said FSF France president Loic Dachary in a statement .
" It 's a commonly held belief that only the copyright holder of a work can enforce the license 's terms — but that 's not true in France .
People who received software under the GNU GPL can also request compliance , since the license grants them rights from the authors . "
The notion of copyright law protecting the rights of content recipients is very compelling and it could significantly lower the barriers for GPL enforcement in France .
Equally important is the significance of a successful GPL enforcement effort in another European country .
It demonstrates the robustness of the GPL and its capacity to function properly in diverse jurisdictions .

A collaboration between scientists at Vanderbilt University and the University of California , San Francisco has led to the first direct information about the molecular structure of prions .
In addition , the study has revealed surprisingly large structural differences between natural prions and the closest synthetic analogs that scientists have created in the lab .
Prions are the infectious proteins responsible for human Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease , bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or “ mad cow ” disease , scrapie in sheep and several other related nervous system disorders in mammals .
For a number of years , scientists have been using the tools of genetic engineering to create synthetic versions of these particles so they could study them more easily .
Although researchers have made particles that appear identical to natural prions , they have had trouble duplicating their infectious behavior .
“ We expected to find subtle differences , but we found major differences instead , ” says Gerald Stubbs , professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt University .
“ Although we cannot say for certain that the differences we ’ve seen can explain why natural prions are so infectious , there is a good chance that they are closely related . ”
The study , which was recently published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , was a joint effort by the Stubbs laboratory and that of Stanley Prusiner at the University of California , San Francisco , who received the Nobel prize for the discovery of prions .
“ Our results will aid in attempts to create the infectious synthetic prions that are needed to figure out how prions work and ultimately to find cures for the diseases that they cause , ” says the lead author of the study , Holger Wille , assistant adjunct professor of neurology in the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases , which is based at UCSF and directed by Prusiner .
Prusiner ’s group was the first one that succeeded in making infectious prions in the test tube .
However , they are not nearly as infectious as the real thing .
Six years ago , Prusiner contacted Stubbs , who is a world authority on determining the molecular structures of fibrous materials , and asked if he was interested in collaborating on an effort to characterize the detailed structure of prions .
It did n’t take much convincing .
“ I ’ve always been interested in prions , so I readily agreed , ” says Stubbs .

Prions , because of their association with mad cow disease , are the most notorious of the amyloids , which are insoluble clumps of fibrous protein that play a role in a number of neurodegenerative diseases , including Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s and Lou Gehrig disease , as well as some other common illnesses , including type II diabetes .
“ It is particularly difficult to determine the molecular structure of fibrous materials like these because they have an intrinsically high level of disorder , ” Stubbs explains .
When viewed with an electron microscope , which can magnify images up to one million times , the natural and synthetic prions look nearly identical .
They both clump together to form microscopic filaments .
At a magnification of approximately one hundred thousand times , the only visible difference is the width of the filaments : the synthetic material shows a wider distribution of widths than the natural material .
The Stubbs lab used unconventional X - ray diffraction methods to get the first details of the molecular structures of natural prions and Prusiner ’s synthetic prions .
The researchers found that the synthetic prions were shaped something like a ladder .
Based on electron microscopic images , the Prusiner lab had proposed that the natural prions have a more complex , three - sided cylindrical shape , and the X - ray experiments supported this proposal .
“ The natural , infectious prions are folded into a much more complicated shape , ” says Stubbs .
Proteins are molecules that are folded into shapes that determine their biological properties .
Prions and the other amyloids are cases in which proteins are misfolded into shapes that interfere with normal biological processes .
“ Normally , the cellular systems deal with misfolded proteins but , for some reason , these slip through the cracks , ” he says .
Prions do n’t have any DNA in their make - up so they do n’t reproduce in a normal fashion .
Instead , they spread by transforming proteins they come into contact with into prions by causing them to misfold .
“ Our data on prion structure is an important step toward understanding prion infection , ” says Stubbs , “ and understanding the process is essential before people can design drugs that restrict or prevent it . ”
The research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health , Fairchild Foundation , G. Harold and Leila Y. Mathers Foundation , the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy .
As SmileySam and pronin2 have both diaried , an article in today 's Roll Call emphasizes that the Progressive Block is n't bluffing ( sub. req . ) when it comes to their support of a public option .
The article focuses on the work Darcy Burner has been doing as executive director of the American Progressive Caucus Policy Foundation to help the Progressive Caucus organize around the public option .
" We have never had the Progressive Caucus organized the way it is right now , " Burner said during a Friday roundtable with Roll Call .
" This is not the normal scenario .
And Speaker [ Nancy ] Pelosi [ D - Calif . ] knows it . "
The public insurance provision has sparked a game of rhetorical chicken between , on the one hand , liberals who have pegged it as essential and , on the other , moderate Democrats and some White House officials , who have called it a deal - killer in the Senate and diminished its importance to broader reform .
As an unusually contentious public debate over the reform drive has put Democrats on the defensive over the August recess , liberal leaders have been upping the ante on the public plan to beat back a building perception it would end up getting scrapped in conference negotiations .
Speaker Pelosi does indeed know that the Progressive Block is organized and prepared for a fight .
House leadership has been adamant on teh fact that a bill wo n't pass the House without a public option , and has been working on reminding the entire caucus that the public option has huge support from the American public .
Most recently they sent a memo to Democratic members summarizing recent polling .
The memo . . . is designed to arm Congressional Dems with ammo to beat back claims that the public option ’s popularity has tanked .
" Coordinated attacks by Republicans and other opponents of health insurance reform have had little effect on the strong support for a public health insurance option , " the memo reads .
It also includes this handy summary graph of recent polling .
( Click to enlarge . )
All this reinforces a great post from Chris today over at Open Left .
He details all the reasons why it is possible to pass a non - co - op public option now : a ) reconciliation would work to pass the bill ; and , b ) majorities in both branches of Congress support a public option .
In the House , as the Roll Call article reminds us , there 's a large enough Progressive Block to derail a bill without it .
It 's popular with the American people , it 's popular with the majority of Democrats in Congress .
So if it does n't happen , as Chris says , it 's a political choice .
Here is the choice :
Pass a public option in health care reform , either using reconciliation or convincing some Senators to vote for cloture even if they do n't vote for the final bill .
The methods required to do so will cause damage to the Democratic congressional leadership and Obama administration 's attempts to look bipartisan .
Private health insurance industry groups will likely severely hold back donations , and target quite a few " moderate " Democrats in swing or Republican - leaning districts .
Do n't pass a public option in health care reform , either by trying to force the progressive block to fold or by passing nothing at all .
This will probably mean fewer uninsured people are provided insurance , and that health care costs neither stabilize nor reduce their share of GDP .
Further , progressive grassroots blowback will be immense , at least by the standards of progressive grassroots blowback .
This is a choice .
Democrats can pass a public option if they want to .
If all goes awry , do n't let Democrats tell you after the fact that they had no other options .
Tell them that there was a viable path to the public option they could have followed , but they chose not to follow it for political reasons .
It 's not just the DFH bloggers saying this , the NY Times editorial board agrees , saying " Democrats are thus well advised to start preparing to use an arcane parliamentary tactic known as ' budget reconciliation ' that would let them sidestep a Republican filibuster and approve reform proposals by a simple majority . "
A scientist credited with helping discover evidence of water on the moon was arrested on charges of attempting to pass along classified information to an FBI agent posing as an Israeli intelligence officer .
The Justice Department said Stewart David Nozette , 52 , of suburban Chevy Chase , Maryland , was charged in a criminal complaint with attempting to communicate , deliver and transmit classified information to an individual he believed to be an Israeli intelligence officer .
The complaint does not allege that the government of Israel or anyone acting on its behalf violated US law .
In Jerusalem , where the story broke late at night , Israeli government officials had no immediate comment .
Nozette was arrested by FBI agents .
He is expected to make his initial appearance in federal court in Washington today .
In an affidavit supporting the complaint that was unsealed yesterday , FBI agent Leslie Martell said that on September 3 , Nozette received a telephone call from an individual purporting to be an Israeli intelligence officer .
The caller was an undercover FBI agent .
Nozette agreed to meet with the agent later that day at a hotel in Washington and in the subsequent meeting the two discussed Nozette 's willingness to work for Israeli intelligence .
Nozette allegedly informed the agent that he had , in the past , held top security clearances and had access to US satellite information , the affidavit said .
Nozette also was alleged to have said he would be willing to answer questions about this information in exchange for money .
The affidavit said the agent explained that the Israeli intelligence agency , Mossad , would arrange for a communication system so Nozette could pass on information in a post office box .
Nozette agreed to provide regular , continuing information and asked for an Israeli passport , the government alleged .

Looks like Kate Gosselin is getting her own show ... all at the expense of Jon .
After months of his grousing , the patriarch is literally being subtracted from their TLC reality show , which the network has just officially renamed Kate Plus 8 .
When it relaunches in November , the show will center more around Kate 's single - mom plight raising eight kids , with Jon only making occasional appearances .
" Given the recent changes in the family dynamics , it only makes sense for us to refresh and recalibrate the program to keep pace with the family , " network president Eileen O'Neill says in a statement .
" The family has evolved and we are attempting to evolve with it . "
According to the press release , Jon " will continue his exclusive relationship " with TLC , but that 's not exactly the whole story …
One year after the biggest economic collapse since the Great Depression , Congress is still debating new financial regulations to protect consumers and prevent risk - taking in the financial sector .
The House Committee on Financial Services is currently undertaking the important first step of writing , amending and voting on some of the pieces of the long - proposed financial regulatory reform .
While debating these issues top committee members have been the recipients of disproportionate campaign contributions from the very industry that they are tasked with regulating .
Twenty - seven committee members have so far received over one - quarter of their contributions from the finance , insurance and real estate ( FIRE ) sector .
This includes Chair Barney Frank , Ranking Member Spencer Bachus , four subcommittee chairs and four subcommittee ranking members .
Of the twenty - seven , twelve committee members received over 35 % of their contributions in 2009 from the FIRE sector .
Ranking Member Bachus , a crucial decision maker on the committee , received 71 % of his campaign contributions from the finance , insurance and real estate ( FIRE ) sector so far this year .
( These numbers run from January 1 - June 30 . )
For his career , the Alabama congressman receives 45 % of his contributions from the FIRE sector .
Bachus leads the committee in his reliance on FIRE sector campaign contributions .
Bachus has taking a position in opposition to most of the regulatory reforms .
Bachus recently stated in a hearing , “ this is absolutely the wrong time to be creating a new government agency empowered not only to ration credit , but to design the financial products offered to consumers . ”
The industry has already had successes this year .
Committee consideration of a bill to create a proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency was delayed after industry trade groups sent a letter to the committee demanding they delay consideration .
The bill was later changed to be narrower in focus than the original language .
A Bloomberg report also notes that the derivatives lobby , headed by large banks JPMorganChase , Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse , worked the New Democrats , including Rep. Melissa Bean , to get changes made to a bill aimed at filling holes in derivative regulation .
Officials in the Obama administration stated that the resulting bill , released as a discussion draft , “ created too many loopholes and had the potential to exclude all hedge funds and corporate end - users from oversight . ”
Bean received 42 % of her $ 634,535 in campaign contributions in 2009 from the FIRE sector .
" They ca n’t pay what they owe ! ” he began angrily .
Then he paused , collected his thoughts and started over : “ Tim Geithner saved them on terms extremely favorable to the banks .
They should support all of his proposed reforms . ”
Mr. Johnson continued , “ What gets me is that the banks have continued to oppose consumer protection .
How can they be opposed to consumer protection as defined by a man who is the most favorable Treasury secretary they have had in a generation ?
If he has decided that this is what they need , what moral right do they have to oppose it ?
It is unconscionable . ”
... Starting on Wednesday , the House Financial Services Committee will take up a number of reforms proposed by the Obama administration , hoping to push them through the committee so they can be voted on the House floor as part of a larger financial reform package .
Among the proposals the committee will tackle is , yes , the establishment of a new consumer financial protection agency .
The administration ’s outline for this new agency -- which would regulate mortgages , credit cards , debit cards , installment loans and any other product issued by a financial institution -- was sent up to Capitol Hill in July .
Since then , Barney Frank , the committee chairman , has made a number of substantial changes , none of which , I have to say , have strengthened the proposed legislation .
He stripped the bill of the much - promoted “ plain vanilla ” provision , which would have forced , say , mortgage brokers to offer customers a 30 - year fixed mortgage alongside any exotic option A.R.M. mortgage they wanted to push .
He has changed the nature of an oversight panel , so that it would consist of the top bank regulators -- the very same regulators who did such a miserable job looking out for consumers during the housing bubble .
He has tinkered with the way the agency will be financed , making it less onerous for the banking industry and more onerous for nonbank financial institutions that will come under the agency ’s purview .
Saddest of all -- at least from where I ’m sitting -- he abandoned the so - called reasonableness standard , which would have forced bankers to make sure their customers both understood the products they were buying and could afford them .
Mr. Frank has said that such a provision would put bankers in an “ untenable position . ”
Yet that is precisely what brokers are required to do when they sell a stock or a bond to their customers .
Why should n’t the same standard apply to a banker making a mortgage loan ?
Part of the reason Mr. Frank made those changes is that he needs the support of conservative Democrats if he hopes to turn this bill into law .
But it is also because he felt a need to mollify , at least to some extent , the bank lobby , especially the community bankers who populate every Congressional district in the country .
Indeed , in a recent missive to its members , the American Bankers Association trumpeted its success in helping make the bill more palatable to the banking industry ...
Not long ago , the A.B.A. sent an “ action alert ” to its member banks , pleading with them to call their congressman in a last - ditch effort to stop the bill .
( “ Passing more laws that will overly complicate and restrict the products our customers need is detrimental to our banks , ” the note read in part . )
And even if the bill does pass , the industry is hoping to pervert its purpose , so that it will become a means to stifle competition from nonbank financial institutions .
As Congress debates the measure , 400,000 people ran out of benefits in September and another 208,000 are set to lose them this month , according to the National Employment Law Project .
Some 1.4 million people will stop receiving checks by year 's end if Congress does n't act , according to the employment law project .
In most polls , the majority of Americans favor a non-profit alternative -- like Medicare -- that would give the private health industry some competition .
So if so many of us , including President Obama himself , want that public option , how come we 're not getting one ?
Because the medicine that could cure our health care nightmare has been poisoned from Day One - fatally adulterated , thanks to the infamous , Washington revolving door .
Movers and shakers rotate between government and the private sector at a speed so dizzying they forget for whom they 're supposed to be working .
If you 've been watching the Senate Finance Committee 's markup sessions , maybe you 've noticed a woman sitting behind Committee Chairman Max Baucus .
Her name is Liz Fowler .
Fowler used to work for Wellpoint , the largest health insurer in the country .
She was its vice president of public policy .
Baucus ' office failed to mention this in the press release announcing her appointment as senior counsel in February 2008 , even though it went on at length about her expertise in " health care policy . "
Now she 's working for the very committee with the most power to give her old company and the entire industry exactly what they want -- higher profits -- and no competition from alternative non-profit coverage that could lower costs and premiums .
A veteran of the revolving door , Fowler had a previous stint working for Senator Baucus -- before her time at Wellpoint .
But wait , there 's more .
The person who was Baucus top health advisor before he brought back Liz Fowler ?
Her name is Michelle Easton .
And why did she leave the staff of the committee ?
To go to work -- surprise -- at a firm representing the same company for which Liz Fowler worked -- Wellpoint .
As a lobbyist .
You can't tell the players without a scorecard in the old Washington shell game .
Lobbyist out , lobbyist in .
It 's why they always win .
They 've been plowing this ground for years , but with the broad legislative agenda of the Obama White House - health care , energy , financial reform , the Employee Free Choice Act and more -- the soil has never been so fertile .
The health care industry alone has six lobbyists for every member of Congress and more than 500 of them are former Congressional staff members , according to the Public Accountability Initiative 's Little Sis database .
They want a public option about as much as you want the swine flu , and just to be certain Congress sticks with the program , the industry has been showering megabucks all over Capitol Hill .
From the beginning , they wanted to make sure that whatever bill comes out of the Finance Committee puts for - profit insurance companies first -- by forcing the uninsured to buy medical policies from them .
Money not only talks , it writes the prescriptions .
In just the last few months , the health care industry has spent $ 380 million on lobbying , advertising and campaign contributions .
And -- do n't bother holding onto your socks -- a million and a half of it went to Finance Committee Chairman Baucus , the man who said he saw " a lot to like " in the two public option amendments proposed by Senators Rockefeller and Schumer , but voted no anyway .
... One reporter in particular was out to break their grip .
His name was David Graham Phillips .
One day in 1906 , readers of Cosmopolitan Magazine opened its March issue to discover the first of nine articles by Phillips titled , " The Treason of the Senate . "
He wrote , " Treason is a strong word , but not too strong , rather too weak , to characterize the situation which the Senate is the eager , resourceful , indefatigable agent of interests as hostile to the American people as any invading army could be , and vastly more dangerous : interests that manipulate the prosperity produced by all , so that it heaps up riches for the few : interests whose growth and power can only mean the degradation of the people , of the educated into sycophants , of the masses toward serfdom . "
The public outrage provoked by Phillips and other muckrakers contributed to the ratification of the 17th amendment to the Constitution , providing for the direct popular election of senators , who until then were elected by easily bought - off state legislators .
[ A ] faction of Wall Street - funded " New Democrats " [ read : Melissa Bean ] are trying to gut a White House proposal to change that paradigm and establish minimum floors of bank regulation that states can go beyond .
According to the Wall Street Journal this Democratic congressional faction is trying to flip the proposal on its head by making the final product establish a federal ceiling whereby states cannot regulate banks any further .
In his brief career as a U.S. Senator and a presidential candidate , it appears that Barack Obama was given more money from the FIRE Sector ( Finance , Insurance , Real Estate ) than anyone else in the history of the legislative branch .
The three all - time winners were all senators who ran for president : Barack Obama - $ 42,268,166John McCain - $ 33,339,458 Hillary Clinton - $ 29,800,366
Close behind them were three more Senators who are also former presidential candidates , John Kerry , Joe Lieberman and Chris Dodd .
Wall Street is n't taking any chances .
I was 100 % onboard with Glenn Greewald 's feeling 's of shock and awe yesterday morning when he reminisced about Dick Durbin 's stunning April admission about the banksters : " And the banks -- hard to believe in a time when we 're facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created -- are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill .
And they frankly own the place . "
His suggestion that there has been a financial coup d'etat goes right to the basic problems of this nation .
The sector as a whole has doled out $ 2.28 billion in campaign contributions since 1990 and spent another $ 3.69 billion in lobbying since 1998 .
And what did they get for their nearly six billion dollars in thinly - disguised bribes to Congress ?
A license to steal ( from us ) , in the form of some good old fashioned bipartisan deregulation -- a religion for Republicans and a nifty business proposition for mostly conservative Democrats Blue Dogs and for non-believing Republicans .
Last week Paul Blumenthal of the Sunlight Foundation shined a very bright spotlight on the comfy monetary relationship between members of the House Financial Services Committee and the legalistic , vaguely disguised bribes from that same FIRE sector .
Of the 73 members of the committee , only 10 appear to be innocent of accepting bribes , or at least of not being in severe conflict of interest -- Maxine Waters ( D - CA - the only member with the ethics to not acceptmoney from the sector the committee oversees ) , Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , Steve Driehaus ( D - OH ) , Keith Ellison ( D - MN ) , Mary Jo Kilroy ( D - OH ) , Frank Lucas ( R - OK ) , Carolyn McCarthy ( D - NY ) , Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) , Adam Putnam ( R - FL ) and Al Green ( D - TX ) .
In the light of President Obama 's apparent determination to revisit the failed banking regulatory initiatives Congress started working on when the economy started disintegrating under the conservative orthodoxy ( i.e. - Greed is Good ) of the Bush Regime , yesterday ' sasked a very pertinent question : Have Banks No Shame ? .
Hopefully Joe Nocera , the savvy author of A Piece of the Action , was thinking rhetorically .
Last night my broker went on a tirade , demanding to know why he had to have his taxes raised to pay for a bunch of lazy poor people who could n't afford insurance .
I did n't ask him to go and dig ditches for minimum wage and I did n't remind him that without zero percent interest rates , an overly active , tax - payer supported FDIC and the TARP bailout for Wall Street -- thattaxes were used for -- he would n't have any insurance ( or a job ) himself now .
Nocera put an aspect of the question , more tactfully -- what do the banks owe the country after all the bailouts ?-- to former IMF economist Simon Johnson .
You may have caught Obama 's speech Friday ( there 's a video of it below ) in which he calls for Congress to get on the stick in terms of protecting Americans from predatory banksters -- the same banksters who financed his -- and their -- political careers and the same banksters he -- and they -- are counting on to cough up the money for future campaigns .
Why do I feel a whole lot of nothing is about to happen ?
Oh , they 'll make some nice noises and , sure , they 'll make some pathetic incremental steps -- which the Republicans and Blue Dogs will fight as though they were establishing a Soviet Republic -- but Obama live up to his promise .
Is Change in the air ?
Hope ?
Yesterday Digby pointed out that they have n't even been able to get the simplest of emergency regulations implemented -- a widely supported extension of unemployment benefits -- because of an inability to deal effectively with die - hard reactionaries and obstructionists , in this case Arizona extremist Jon Kyl .
If Kyl were worried that he might get strung up by the enraged citizens of Arizona , he might stop playing his games .
But he is n't -- not worried and not ready to stop the obstructionism and rotten attitude towards the American families who have given him such a nice -- albeit totally undeserved -- life .
If they can't deal with something this simple , how are they going to be able to go up against not just a two - bit twerp like Jon Kyl , but against the entire banking industry ?
Our Nobel laureate did single out the worst players on the block Friday for special attention -- the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , an arm of the worst faction of the Republican Party ... though some think the worst faction of the Republican Party is just an arm of the Chamber at this point .
The president says the Consumer Financial Protection Agency the Chamber ( and GOP ) are so dead set against would have " just one mission : to look out for the financial interests of ordinary Americans .
It will be charged with setting clear rules of the road for consumers and banks , and it will be able to enforce those rules across the board ...
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending millions on an ad campaign to kill it .
You might have seen some of these ads -- the ones that claim local butchers and other small businesses will somehow be harmed by this agency .
This is , of course , completely false -- and we ’ve made clear that only businesses that offer financial services would be affected by this agency .
I do n't know how many of your butchers are offering financial services .
" In an OpEd fortoday , Bill Moyers and Michael Winship discuss the poisonous -- even deadly -- role DC 's infamous revolving door between government and Corporate America has played in the destruction of meaningful universal health care .
If anything , their arguments are even more true for Wall Street .
That helped -- for a few years .
But , as Durbin said last April , " they frankly own the place .
" David Sirota 's OpenLeft column today makes the point that conservatives are undermining " progressive federalism " ( in short , the good parts of states ' rights ) on behalf of the banksters who have underwritten their political careers .

Rant /
Rave is a relatively new group blog that offers ( as the name suggests ) an outlet for people to rant or rave on what ever subject tickles their fancy .
Although Rant / Rave promotes an open door application policy , many if not most writers on the site have been approached before hand .
Justin Gardner , the editor of political site Donklephant ( a site I was involved in when it launched ) was approached to write for the site , as I presume most others where .
They offer a revenue split up front , but possibly more in private deals .
By its nature , the site does host a variety of opinion , but likewise it does promise to edit / delete opinions that are out there , or just plain offensive .
Which begs the question : how is it that the Scientology propaganda post “ Put another shrink on the barbie , Cobber ” is not only still published on the site , but as I write this , the most popular post on Rant / Rave .
The post is an attack on Adam Ferrier , the founding partner of Australian PR firm Naked Communications , and a trained Psychologist .
Ferrier wrote a post detailing his experiences with the Church of Scientology in Australia , noting that his results with a Scientology “ personality test ” showed unsurprisingly how badly off he allegedly was .
Ferrier ’s post was transparent and detailed , which is far more than you can say for Jack H Remington at Rant / Rave .
Remington ’s bizarre Scientology fueled attack starts from the beginning , where he writes :
A wacky Australian Psychologist has launched a bigoted and underhanded blog attack on religion and the nation of the USA .
The Aussie ‘ Psycho ’ , pseudonymously [ sic ] known as the Fiddler , normally exercises his penchant for insanity by such things as ‘ testing ’ an erectile dysfunction clinic , and writing about his experiences on his blog .
Where do you start there ?
There ’s no pseudonym for starters , Adam is real and his name is on the post .
He does however have a track record of investigating and writing about shams , and erectile dysfunction scams are big in Australia .
But it gets better , because its time to trash Australia due to an off the cuff remark Adam made about white toothed Americans .
See if you can guess that this text is really about Scientology
Confirming Australia ’s reputation as a nation of criminals , founded by criminals , for criminals , the Fiddler has now turned to trashing a Church and the people of the USA in his hilarious blog .
Not a church mind you , but the Church of Scientology .
But wait , there ’s more :
Fraudulently presented himself at the Australian Church of Scientology as a member of the public , when in fact he is a long - time Psych , the Fiddler infiltrated the Australian Church to take a free personality test .
How is turning up for a Scientology test fraudulent exactly ?
or is being a trained psychologist automatically disqualify you ?
But if it ’s fanciful already , wait until you read the next bit :
Even though Mr L Ron Hubbard , as the Senior Naval Officer in Northern Australia , saved Australia from invasion in World War Two , many Australians like the Fiddler , with notable exceptions such as the great Ms Kate Ceberano , Ms Jodhi Meares , and Mr James Packer , remain resentful .
I ’m sadly not making that last part up .
Hubbard was never the Senior Naval Officer for Northern Australia .
Wikipedia has his “ naval ” record here .
His only time in Australia was on route to the Philippines , where he was held over for a month , and then sent back to the United States for “ assuming unauthorized authority and attempting to perform duties for which he has no qualifications . ”
Indeed , even Hubbard ’s own account of his time in the Pacific says nothing of him single handedly saving Australia , when he said ( and this is a direct quote ) “ I was flown in from the South Pacific as the first casualty to be shipped out of the South Pacific war back to the States . ”
Notably the Australian ’s he mentions are all Scientologists as well , and no one here remains resentful , after all , it was Australian troops that turned back the Japanese army in New Guinea , not American troops .
But I digress .
The bigger question is why does this tripe remain on Rant / Rave ?
Even for Scientology propaganda , this is beyond the pale .
It does say something about Scientology though : love them or hate them , you can fairly say that they are now seriously rattled , and are lashing out at the first opportunity , and it ’s all about Anonymous as well .
Do n’t believe me ?
Here ’s the last extract from the post :
You are obviously acting as an agent for the cyberterrorist group “ Anonymous ” .
You should be honest about your true intentions for attacking Scientology in this article , which is that you do not want people to get better and want to impede the creation of a saner planet .
I wonder how Australian Scientologists feel about Scientology trashing Australia ?

On the other hand , there are some renewable fuel options that have either proven themselves as solid contenders , or have not yet demonstrated fatal flaws that would disqualify them at this point .
In this essay I will cover some of those .
First , I will cover a pair of first generation biofuels that have proven that they can compete with oil on a cost basis , and then a pair of next generation biofuels that I believe will be competitive .
I got quite a few interesting e-mails and comments following my previous essay : Biofuel Pretenders .
I probably should have mentioned - but I thought it went without saying - that pretenders usually do n't think they are pretenders and will therefore protest mightily at the characterization .
A number of people who e-mailed assured me that they have really cracked the code to affordable biofuels , and that we would be hearing more about them soon .
Another person who wrote to me about algae said that he has been following algae since 1973 , and he wrote " In spite of all the hype and non - stop press releases , no one to my knowledge is producing algae on a commercial basis for biofuel production . "
*
Ultimately , I would be happy to be proven wrong on this , but I am just calling it as I see it .
Caveats
There are some other things that I need to point out , but if history is any guide these caveats will be completely ignored by some .
First , I am discussing liquid fuels here , even though I am hopeful that electric cars become a real contender .
Second , calling something a contender is not an endorsement – particularly of the first generation contenders .
Palm oil can compete with petroleum on price to some extent .
The wisdom of using palm oil for fuel is a different matter .
So please do not confuse how I see it with how I would prefer to see it .
Third , I am fully aware that there are limits to the biomass that can be removed from the soil .
I want to be sure that biomass that is grown and used responsibly .
One of the things I am involved in right now concerns farmed biomass that removes few nutrients from the soil .
There are even ways to produce biomass that can improve the quality of the soil .
Imagine a tree that sends down deep roots , brings nutrients up from the subsoil , and concentrates them in the leaves which then fall off and add to the soil .
It is not science fiction , and my new group has people working on these types of biomass .
Finally , for those who go on an anti-car rant any time there is a discussion of liquid fuels : I personally would like to see a big reduction in motorized transport .
The basis of our future energy strategy has to start with conservation .
But I believe we will need liquid fuels for applications like long haul trucking , airline transport , and marine applications .
There will likely be a liquid fuel need for emergency vehicles .
So while I am under no illusions that bio - derived fuels can replace our petroleum usage , I believe they can make a contribution for critical applications .
The First Generation Contenders
Sugarcane Ethanol
Ethanol that is produced in conjunction with sugar production , especially from tropical regions like Brazil , has some unique attributes that have enabled it to compete on a head to head basis with gasoline pricing .
Specifically , during the production of sugar , the bagasse ( sugarcane residue ) is pulverized and washed many times .
Many soluble inorganic constituents that may normally pose an ash problem for a boiler are washed out in the process .
What remains after processing is a pretty clean biomass feed for the boilers .
The normally vexing logistical issues are n't present because the biomass is already at the plant as a result of the sugarcane processing .
So they essentially have free boiler fuel , which minimizes the fossil fuel inputs into the process .
That enables ethanol production that is relatively cheap , and that is largely decoupled from the impact of volatile fossil fuel prices .
There are several reasons we do n't this in the United States .
Last year I made a visit to the largest sugar producer in Louisiana , and they explained the reasons to me .
Ethanol can be produced from sugar ( but sugar subsidies discourage this ) , or from the molasses that is produced as a co-product .
( The latter was the basis of the plant I visited in India ) .
For sugar producers in the U.S. , the economics of the by - product molasses generally favor using it as an additive to animal feed .
If the U.S. had a year - round growing season as they do in the tropics , it is more likely that the animal feed market would start to become saturated , and conversion into ethanol might be more attractive .
Further , a bagasse boiler is a major capital expense , so there needs to be a high level of confidence that in the future ethanol will consistently be a more economical outlet than animal feed .
For Brazil , this is certainly the case .
The ultimate downside of sugarcane ethanol will come about if the U.S. and Europe begin to rely heavily on tropical countries for their fuel needs - thus encouraging a massive scale - up .
First , trading oil imports for ethanol imports does n't do much for domestic energy security .
More importantly , it may encourage irresponsible usage of the land in an effort to feed our insatiable appetite for fuel .
I think the ideal situation would be to produce the sugarcane ethanol and use it locally , rather than try to scale it up and supply the world .
In this way , sugarcane ethanol could be a long - term contender for providing fuel for the tropics , but not a long - term contender for major fossil fuel displacement outside of the tropics .
Palm Oil
The other major first generation contender is palm oil - which also comes with a lot of environmental risk .
Palm oil is derived from the African Oil Palm .
The oil palm is a prolific producer of oil , which can be used as fuel ( and food ) .
This is also a plant that thrives in the tropics , and is capable of annually producing upwards of 500 gallons of oil per acre .
To my knowledge there is no other oil crop that consistently demonstrates these sorts of yields ( acknowledging that algae could theoretically produce more ) .
The price of palm oil over the past 5 years or so has traded in a range comparable to that of crude oil ; $ 50 - $ 75 a barrel for the most part ( although like petroleum , prices shot up to around $ 150 / bbl in mid-2008 ) .
Palm oil can be used unmodified in a diesel engine , although some precautions are in order ( and I do n't recommend it ) .
It can also be processed to biodiesel , or hydrocracked to green diesel .
The extra processing will generally make the final product somewhat more expensive than petroleum , but demand has still been strong due to biofuel mandates .
The risks with palm oil are significant , though .
Palm oil presents an excellent case illustrating both the promise and the peril of biofuels .
Driven by demand from the U.S. and the European Union ( EU ) due to mandated biofuel requirements , palm oil has provided a valuable cash crop for farmers in tropical regions like Malaysia , Indonesia , and Thailand .
The high productivity of palm oil has led to a dramatic expansion in most tropical countries around the equator .
This has the potential for alleviating poverty in these regions .
But in certain locations , expansion of palm oil cultivation has resulted in serious environmental damage as rain forest has been cleared and peat bogs drained to make room for new palm oil plantations .
Deforestation in some countries has been severe , which negatively impacts sustainability criteria , because these tropical forests absorb carbon dioxide and help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions .
Destruction of peat land in Indonesia for palm oil plantations has reportedly caused the country to become the world ’s third highest emitter of greenhouse gases .
Because palm oil is capable of competing on price , it was originally viewed as a very attractive source of biofuels .
In recent years , countries have begun to rethink their policies as the environmental implications of scaling up palm oil production began to unfold .
As is so often the case , the biofuel mandates that politicians thought were a good idea have had some pretty serious unintended consequences .
Next Generation Biofuel Contenders
Here is how I would define a next generation Biofuel Contender : A technology that is capable of supplying 20 % of our present liquid fossil fuel consumption on a net energy basis .
Yes , 20 % is somewhat arbitrary , but it weeds out a lot arguments over many potential small contributors .
If you set the bar too low - say 5 % - all kinds of things come out of the woodwork and make claims .
Too much to discuss or debunk .
Set the bar too high - say 50 % of our current usage - and in my opinion no renewable fuel can meet that target via biomass .
Although the pretenders will insist that they can .
I will focus in this essay on the United States , because I am most familiar with our energy usage and biomass availability , but these arguments should be applicable in many places around the world .
Consider for a moment the amount of energy locked up inside the 1.3 billion tons of dry biomass that the Department of Energy and the USDA suggest can be sustainably produced each year .
( Current biomass usage is 190 million tons / year ) .
Woody biomass and crop residues - the kind of biomass covered in the 1.3 billion ton study - contains an energy content of approximately 7,000 BTUs per pound ( bone dry basis ) .
The energy content of a barrel of oil is approximately 5.8 million BTUs .
Thus the raw energy contained in 1.3 billion tons of dry biomass is equivalent to the energy content of 3.1 billion barrels of oil , which is equal to 42 % of the 7.32 billion barrels the United States consumed in 2008 .
This calculation tells you a couple of things .
First , the 42 % represents an upper limit on the amount of oil that could be displaced by 1.3 billion tons of biomass – presuming we could really produce that much sustainably .
The actual amount of oil displaced would be much lower because energy is required to get the biomass to the biorefinery and then to process it .
So replacing oil with biomass is n't going to be a trivial task , and a process must be capable of turning a respectable percentage of those biomass BTUs into liquid fuel if it is to be a contender .
But it is unlikely that we are going to replace anything approaching our current level of energy usage with biomass .
Imagine a process that only captures 25 % of the starting BTUs as liquid fuel .
The liquid fuel production of 1.3 billion tons would then be 10.5 % of our oil usage instead of 42 % - and that 's before we consider the energy requirements from the logistical operations ( like getting that wood to the biorefinery ) .
This is the realm of the pretenders ; they waste a lot of BTUs during the production of the liquid fuel .
What we really need is a process that can capture > 50 % of the BTUs as liquid fuels .
That 's what it will take to be a contender , and quite frankly I do n't believe cellulosic ethanol has a chance of pulling this off on a large scale .
However , there are at least two technologies that can achieve net liquid fuel yields in excess of 50 % of the BTU value of dry biomass .
These technologies are flash pyrolysis and gasification .
I will talk about each below .
( Hydrocracked oils – green diesel - might get close as well , but the most consistent oil producers are generally also foods ) .
Flash Pyrolysis
Flash pyrolysis involves rapidly heating up biomass to around 500°C .
The reaction takes place in about 2 seconds , and the products are pyrolysis oil ( also called bio - oil ) and char .
The process can handle a wide variety of feedstocks , the oil yield is approximately 70 % by weight , and the energy content per pound of oil is similar to the starting material .
Thus , approximately 70 % of the initial BTUs are captured in the oil before we have to start subtracting out energy inputs .
Char is frequently mentioned as a great soil amendment ( as terra preta , for instance ) , but I do n't really know if there is a market for it .
As someone recently said to me , it may be like biodiesel and glycerin .
In theory there are all kinds of uses for glycerin , but the market was quickly saturated as biodiesel production ramped up .
Glycerin suddenly became a disposal problem .
Terra preta does in fact appear to be a great soil amendment , but people are going to have to show that they will buy it .
It seems to me that the ideal solution would be to use the char to help heat the biomass , unless the ash properties are problematic for the process .
There are definite downsides to flash pyrolysis .
Heating up to 500 °C will subtract from the net energy production , and while heat integration is possible , it would be more difficult to achieve in a hypothetical mobile unit ( which I think could finally provide an outlet for the millions of acres of trees destroyed by the Mountain pine beetle ) .
The properties of the raw oil are such that it is n't suitable for transport fuel as produced .
It is not a hydrocarbon and is very acidic .
Without upgrading , it can't be blended with conventional diesel .
There are various issues around reproducibility and stability , especially if the biomass quality varies .
The oil is suitable for power generation or gasification , and can be upgraded to transportation fuel , albeit at greater expense and lower overall energy efficiency .
With those caveats , it is still a contender .
It could be knocked out of contention as a viable transportation fuel if the upgrading process is too expensive or energy intensive , but at present no fatal flaw has emerged .
There are a number of companies involved in pyrolysis research .
Dynamotive Energy Systems has been working on this for a while ( I first wrote about them in 2007 ) .
UOP - a company that specializes in product upgrading for refineries - has teamed with Ensyn to form a joint venture called Envergent Technologies .
The company intends to make pyrolysis oils from biomass for power generation , heat , and transport fuel ( this is where UOP 's skills will come into play ) .
Gasification : Biomass to Liquids
The following example is just one reason I think gasification is going to play a big part in our future .
During World War II , the Germans were cut off from liquid fuel supplies .
In order to keep the war machine running , they turned to coal to liquids , or CTL ( coal gasification followed by Fischer - Tropsch to liquids ) for their liquid fuel needs .
At peak production , the Germans were producing over five million gallons of synthetic fuel a day .
To put that into perspective , five million gallons probably exceeds the historical sum of all the cellulosic ethanol or synthetic algal biofuel ever produced .
Without a doubt , one week 's production from Germany 's WWII CTL plants dwarfs the combined historical output of two technologies upon which the U.S. government and many venture capitalists are placing very large bets .
South Africa during Apartheid had a similar experience .
With sanctions restricting their petroleum supplies , they turned to their large coal reserves and once again used CTL .
Sasol ( South African Coal , Oil and Gas Corporation ) - out of necessity - has been a pioneer in gasification technology .
Today , they have a number of gasification facilities , including the 160,000 bbl / day Secunda CTL facility , which has been highly profitable for the company ( but very expensive relative to oil prices when constructed ) .
In total , Sasol today synthetically produces about 40 % of South Africa 's liquid fuel .
While we can speculate on the source of future fuel supplies in a petroleum constrained world , we do know that two countries that already found themselves in that position turned to gasification as a solution .
The technology has a track record , is scalable , and today commercially produces synthetic fuel in volumes cellulosic ethanol or algal fuel can only dream about .
We hope various other technologies scale and that technical breakthroughs allow them to compete .
But gasification has already proven itself as a viable go - to option .
There are presently a number of operating CTL and GTL plants around the world .
Shell has been running their Bintulu GTL plant for 15 years , and is currently building the world 's largest GTL plant with a capacity of 140,000 barrels / day .
The biomass to liquid fuel efficiency for gasification is around 70 % ( See Section 1.2.2 : Second - Generation Biofuels ) , a number cellulosic ethanol will never approach .
In short , no other technology to my knowledge can convert a higher percentage of the embedded energy in biomass into liquid fuels .**
Of course there 's always a catch .
Despite large reserves of coal , the United States has not turned to gasification as a solution .
Why ?
High capital costs .
At the end of the day the desire to keep fuel prices low consistently overrides our desire for energy security .
( There are also greenhouse gas concerns over using coal gasification which should not be an issue for waste biomass gasification ) .
But biomass is more difficult to handle , so there are added costs above those of coal gasification .
So you have a process that is more capital intensive than a conventional oil refinery , or even a cellulosic ethanol plant .
But what you save on the cellulosic ethanol plant ultimately costs a lot in overall energy efficiency .
Until someone actually scales up and runs a cellulosic ethanol plant , we can only speculate as to whether cellulosic ethanol is even a net energy producer at scale .
Interestingly , one of the " cellulosic ethanol " hopefuls that we often hear so much about - Range Fuels - is actually a gasification plant .
( Ditto Coskata ) .
The front end of their process is intended to produce syngas in a process derived from that of World War II Germany .
For their back end they intend to produce ethanol , which in my opinion is an odd choice that was driven purely by ethanol subsidies .
But this is definitely not the optimal end product of a gasification process .
They are going to lose a lot of efficiency to byproducts like methanol ( which is actually a good end product for a gasification plant ) - and that 's assuming they get their gasification process right .
They are then going to expend some of their net energy trying to purify the ethanol from the mixed alcohols their process will produce .
The question for me is not whether BTL can displace 20 % of our petroleum usage .
I believe it can .
The question is whether we are prepared to accept domestic fuel that will cost double ( or more ) what we pay today .
In the long run - if oil prices continue to rise - then BTL plants that are built today will become profitable .
The risk is that a sustained period of oil prices in the $ 50 - $ 70 range will retard BTL development .
But I do n't expect that to happen .
Conclusions
In my opinion , the question of which next generation biofuels can compete comes down to fossil fuel prices .
If oil prices are at $ 50 for the next 10 years , it will be difficult for next generation renewable fuels to compete .
Despite the many promises of technologies that will deliver fuel for $ 1 a gallon , I think that target is likely to be reached only on paper .
My view on which technologies will be competitive is based on 1 ) .
An expectation of an average oil price over the next 10 years that exceeds $ 100 / bbl ; 2 ) .
An expectation that we will need to efficiently convert the available biomass .
3 ) . Knowledge of what many of the major players are doing .
I expect biomass prices to rise as well , and inefficient technologies that may be competitive if the biomass is free and fossil fuel inputs like natural gas are low - priced will not survive as the prices of both rise .
I am certainly interested in helping promote promising next generation technologies , so if you think I have missed some really promising ones then feel free to add your thoughts .
It is possible that a company like LS9 or KiOR will ultimately be successful , but they are going to require some technical breakthroughs .
Those do n't always happen ( I am waiting for a laptop battery that runs my laptop for a week on a single charge ) .
Given the great number of renewable energy start - ups , it wo n't be surprising if one or more of them eventually makes a contribution , but the odds are against most of them .
I selected pyrolysis and gasification as strong contenders because they do n't require technical breakthroughs in order to produce large amounts of fuel .
The technical aspects of gasification at large scale are well - known .
This is not the case with most companies seeking to compete in the next generation arena .
Personal Note on Technology Development
On a personal note , since I have long believed in the promise of gasification as a future solution to our liquid fuel problem , it may come as no surprise that my new role in Hawaii has connections into this area .
While several have figured out what I am doing , I still do n't have the green light to explicitly discuss it ( but I should before year - end ) .
I am not being coy , it is just that we still have some pieces to put in place , and then I will explain why I believe we are building a platform that is unique in the world .
I can say that my new role is as Chief Technology Officer of a bioenergy holding company , and the platform we are putting together does not exist elsewhere to my knowledge .
One of the things I am very interested in is developing conversion technologies for woody biomass and crop wastes .
I have a number of technologies on my plate right now , but I am searching for other pieces that improve the economics ( scalability is important ) .
For example , in the earlier example of the beetle - infested forests , the logistical challenge of getting the biomass to a processing facility - without consuming a large fraction of the BTU value of the tree - is significant .
Biomass has a low energy density relative to fossil fuels , and cost - effective technologies are needed for improving that equation .
I am speaking to a number of people with promising technologies around this area , but am always open to speaking to others who have ideas , prototypes , or pilot plants demonstrating their technology .

* Following the publication of this essay on my blog , I had a meeting with someone inside the Department of Defense who is involved in testing fuel for the military .
The person said they were able to get some algal fuel to test from one of the well - known names – for around $ 100 / gal .
** I have heard from a couple of people that 70 % seems too high , and is likely a result of an improper energy balance .
I have personally seen this number several times , but I have not seen a full energy accounting to validate that .
One person who is very well - versed in gasification said that total energy balance will probably put the liquid fuel recovery at about 50 % of the starting BTUs .
( You can't calculate an EROEI from this unless you also have the fossil fuel inputs – primarily from the logistical operations ) .

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp paid its chief executive Steve Ballmer 5.5 percent less for the last fiscal year as the world ’s biggest software company suffered its first ever drop in annual sales .
Ballmer , CEO since 2000 , earned a total of $ 1,276,627 for fiscal year 2009 , which ended June 30 , according to a filing with securities regulators on Tuesday .
That is slightly below the previous fiscal year ’s total of $ 1,350,834 .
Ballmer ’s salary of $ 665,833 was up slightly from last year , but his bonus was slashed by $ 100,000 to $ 600,000 .
At his own request , Ballmer receives no compensation in the form of Microsoft shares .
Microsoft lowered compensation for most of its highest - level executives in the last fiscal year .
It said in January that it had frozen salaries for fiscal 2010 which started July 1 , in response to the difficult economic climate .
The company suffered its first - ever drop in annual revenue in fiscal 2009 and operating profit fell 9 percent to $ 20.4 billion .
Its shares fell 13.6 percent over the 12 - month period .
Even in good times , Microsoft has never made a splash with huge pay packages , although many of its employees and executives have become millionaires by owning Microsoft shares .
Ballmer himself owns about 408 million Microsoft shares , according to Tuesday ’s filing , worth more than $ 10 billion .
Fight Club hit theaters ten years ago today .
The film was critically divisive , struggled with the right marketing , and had a lukewarm run at the box office .
But then came the overstuffed two - disc Special Edition DVD , complete with a fake - cardboard slipcase .
It was exactly the right kind of gorgeously overproduced fetish object demanded by the burgeoning DVD zeitgeist .
Right in time for the ascendance of internet geek culture , Fight Club invented a whole new artistic species – the mass - marketed cult film .
Passed along from friend to friend in a DVD case that looked like a box of anthrax , it was the HD masterpiece for the home theater decade , and its influence can be felt all over the modern movie landscape .
It ’s worth taking a look at how the style and content of the film influenced the first decade of the new millennium .
The Neon Grunge style :
The look of Fight Club is simultaneously bleached out and richly colorful .
Characters hang around monochromatic tavern cellars and underlit city streets and a mansion which looks like a steampunk haunted frat house , but bright swaths of color decorate the screen , and the people themselves seem almost to glow .
That ’s especially true of Brad Pitt , who , as the charismatic Tyler Durden , walks around with a spotlight trained on his lipstick - rouge leather jacket .
The film feels a little bit like Vincente Minnelli making a horror film based on an American Apparel advertisement .
That lusciously scuzzy aesthetic has since become the de facto Hollywood blockbuster visual style .
You can see it in high - contrast , color - saturated blitzkriegs like Terminator Salvation and Quantum of Solace , every Michael Bay movie since Bad Boys 2 , every Harry Potter movie since Prisoner of Azkaban , and every gorgeously grime - laden Saw clone .
You can see remnants of Fight Club three times a week on the CSI trifecta , with the harsh crime scene lighting playing off the psychedelic glow of Las Vegas , Miami , and New York .
Oliver Stone , David Lynch , and Michael Mann blazed the trail , but it took David Fincher to give that style an addictive swagger , and American movies have never really looked the same .
The Fighting Men : Tyler Durden offers all kinds of cultish soliloquies on the state of modern culture , and lines like this one stick out : “ We ’re a generation of men raised by women .
I ’m wondering if another woman is really the answer we need . ”
This is also someone who has a sex scene so explicit it needed to be digitally animated .
The weird combination of hyper - macho misogyny and anxious self - loathing seems to directly predict Judd Apatow movies and the rise of torture porn .
Do n’t forget : the only real woman in Fight Club is Helena Bonham Carter ’s Marla , the rare drugged - out floozy who ’s also a damsel in distress .
That ’s two female stereotypes , for the price of one !
Fight Club predated a decade which would see Hollywood steadily move away from trying to present women onscreen ; sometimes officially , more often just by churning out a steady stream of superhero films with the perfunctory lame girlfriend role .
Fight Club tackles this new guy - on - guy world head - on .
There should n’t be any question in your mind that Ed Norton ’s character loves Tyler Durden , even though ( SPOILER ALERT ) that becomes a bit less homoerotic and more narcissistic after the third - act twist reveals that he actually is Tyler Durden .
You could argue that Fight Club is actually a hilarious rebuke of post - feminist misogyny , since Ed Norton ’s character ends up opposing his Durden self , but part of the film ’s brilliance is how indecisive it really is about itself .
Fight Club morphs into Project Mayhem , a Weatherman - esque band of skinhead anarchists , their anti-establishment shenanigans ( Let ’s blow up a café ! ) are treated with all the serious sobriety of a Roadrunner cartoon .
The film was the alleged inspiration of a total idiot who tried to bomb a Starbucks in an attempt .
You could say he missed the point , or you could say that Fight Club has no point .
The richly decorated tombs near Luxor are a magnet for archaeologists
The Louvre museum in Paris will return five ancient fresco fragments to Egypt within weeks , France 's government says .
The announcement comes two days after the head of antiquities in Cairo said he would cease all co-operation with the museum until they were sent back .
The Egyptians say the Louvre bought the Pharaonic steles in 2000 even though it knew they had been stolen in the 1980s .
They are believed to be from a 3,200 - year - old tomb of the cleric , Tetaki , in the Valley of the Kings , near Luxor .
The steles , which are each only 15 cm ( 5.9in ) wide and 30 cm ( 11.8 in ) high , are currently part of the Louvre 's reserve collection .
' Acquired in good faith '
The decision to return the disputed fragments came after the French Culture Minister , Frederic Mitterrand , convened a special meeting of a national committee empowered to rule on restitution .
Restitution is now a matter of weeks away
French ministry of culture
The committee 's experts were said to have been satisfied with the evidence presented by the Egyptian authorities showing they had been stolen .
" Restitution is now a matter of weeks away , " the culture ministry told the AFP news agency after the meeting , adding that the committee had voted unanimously to return the artefacts .
The ministry also said the steles had been " acquired in good faith " by the Louvre .
Four were purchased from the Maspero gallery in France in 2000 , while the fifth was acquired at auction in Paris in 2003 .
Ancient Egyptian artworks and relics are displayed in many of the world 's top museums , but in recent years the Egyptian government has stepped up pressure to repatriate some of them .

Half of all the home fires in Detroit are caused by arson .
And many of those who set fire to houses are set by desperate homeowners seeking to avoid foreclosure by collecting on fire insurance payments .
Call it Detroit 's version of mortgage modification .
“ As the city has been plagued with foreclosures and an unemployment rate above 28 percent , fire officials have said that some despairing owners are risking prison to get out of debt , and vacant , foreclosed homes are being torched , ” the Detroit news reports .
Arson is up 27.8 percent since 2004 , with 6,486 arsons investigated by the Detroit Fire Department 's Arson Squad last year .
Arson-related insurance fraud in Detroit is up roughly 40 percent from 2005 to 2008 .
Detroit has the nation ’s worst delinquency rate , at 10 percent of all mortgages .
The onboard video surveillance equipment on more than half of Muni 's buses and trains was not fully operational when an emergency audit was ordered by the San Francisco transit agency after the stabbing of an 11 - year - old boy on a city bus last month .
The Chronicle obtained the results of the audit Monday through a public records request .
The inspection 's findings highlight for the first time the extent of the problem Muni has had in keeping a key component of its safety and security system in good working condition .
The entire fleet , with the exception of the cable cars and historic streetcars , is outfitted with cameras .
Of the approximately 960 vehicles equipped with surveillance devices , 22 percent were deemed completely nonfunctional and an additional 30 percent only partially functional , the inspection found .
The remaining 48 percent worked .
The audit found a range of problems : blurry images , vandalized cameras , poor sound , broken data packs , bad cables and inoperable recorders , among others .
Since the audit was completed in late September , Muni has scrambled to fix the malfunctioning components - and has made progress , said Muni spokesman Judson True .
The percentage of vehicles with equipment that is either fully or partially inoperable is down to 20 percent .
But that still means a Muni rider has a 1 - in - 5 chance of boarding a bus or train without a properly working surveillance system .
Odds are ' anything goes '
" That 's not very comforting , " Sandy Campbell , a yoga instructor and Muni regular , said as she waited for a Van Ness Avenue bus outside City Hall on Monday .
" I know the cameras can't always stop a fight or someone from grabbing a cell phone , but they might at least help the police catch who did it . "
Supervisor Bevan Dufty , a mayoral aspirant who has focused on San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency safety issues , said cameras also can be a good crime deterrent - if they 're working .
" Now the odds are that anything goes , " he said .
Board of Supervisors President David Chiu called the initial finding that only half the surveillance systems were fully operational horrific .
" It 's not something that taxpayers , riders and operators should have to expect on the buses , " he said .
Muni chief Nathaniel Ford agreed .
" These video systems simply must be fixed , and they must stay fixed , " he said .
High - profile incidents
Muni has been under fire since 11 - year - old Hatim Mansori was stabbed during what police described as an unprovoked attack aboard a 49 - Van Ness / Mission bus on Sept .
1 . Not all the onboard cameras were working .
The boy 's screams can be heard , but the attack can't be seen clearly .
The assailant has not been captured .
The video equipment also was n't working on a Muni Metro train that slammed into another train at West Portal Station in July , leaving 48 people injured and investigators searching for clues to what happened .
Authorities had better luck breaking the case of the Oct. 5 beating of an 18 - year - old actor on a 9 - San Bruno bus .
An onboard camera helped police identify and arrest three suspects .
Lagging inspections
Before last month 's audit , Muni did not routinely inspect the onboard surveillance equipment .
While they have plans to do so in the future , no concrete policy has been developed .
With six different surveillance systems , and some of the equipment as old as 9 years - virtually ancient in the world of technology - Muni has had trouble securing all the needed parts to make the repairs .
The agency declared an emergency on Sept. 25 to allow normal procurement and contracting procedures to be bypassed , with the goal of 100 percent working systems by Nov. 30 , said James Dougherty , Muni 's chief safety officer .
Completing the work " is a top priority . "
BART has included its surveillance system in its regular maintenance program for several years and has seen the failure rate drop from 60 percent to 10 percent , according to spokesman Linton Johnson .
The estimated cost to make all the repairs on Muni is $ 1.2 million , with a source for only a third of the funding identified so far , True said .

The hysteria shown at town hall meetings this summer is simply the tip of an outpouring of organized hostility to government that is unparalleled in our history .
We have had wildly emotional opposition movements in the past — red scares , nativist riots , anti-Catholic and anti-Semite outbreaks .
And there are some parallels with past forms of extremism .
People who think Obama is a Muslim are like anti-New Dealers who thought Roosevelt a Jew or John Birchers who thought Eisenhower a Communist .
But there was a kind of crazy consistency in those old causes ( if they can be called that ) .
The institutional Catholic Church was officially anti-democratic in the past , and the United States was falsely thought to be a Christian nation .
The John Birch Society was fanatically anti-Communist , but most Americans were at least strongly anti-Communist .
There were always emotional roots behind the formal position of the extremists .
Richard Hofstadter found status anxiety and anti-intellectualism in the right - wing extremism of the 1950s .
Now , however , there is a deeply panicky combination of pathologies — racist , xenophobic , fundamentalist — screaming about death camps and euthanasia and baby - killers and 9/11 conspiracies ( by the “ truthers ” ) .
Every aspect of our present government is considered illegitimate .
Some look at our leaders and recognize nothing of themselves in them .
They see a black man as president and cannot even consider him a citizen , a Christian , a sane man — he must be a Muslim , a Nazi , a Hitler .
They see a Latina on the Supreme Court .
They see a woman as secretary of state .
They see a black attorney general .
This is not America .
The John Birch Society was at least focused on communism .
The new emotions raging have no focus , just an infection and mutual reinforcement of nameless fears .
This is less the pushing of a political position too far than a multiple - sourced and violent nervous breakdown , a St. Vitus dance from the Middle Ages .
Bircher “ extremism ” was mild compared to these anguished roilings .
People feel betrayed , robbed of their country .
The waving of the Constitution at the town halls had nothing to do with constitutional arguments .
It was a way of saying , “ Give us back what we thought our country was all about . ”
Extremism is normally a protest against what is seen as rapid change .
But the changes these frightened people think they see are not rapid , they are monstrous .
How serious is this new hysteria ?
It is hard to say .
It is normally remarked that only “ the fringes ” hold beliefs like the birther - deather nonsense .
That is probably true .
But the willingness of others to entertain these fantasies — in a recent survey , 42 percent of Republicans said that Obama was born outside the US — is also a new thing .
There is nothing opponents can do about most of this .
In the past , extremism was checked by people who were partly or nominally on the side of the extremists .
Barry Goldwater dissociated his 1964 campaign from the John Birch Society .
William F. Buckley rebuked the anti-Semites on the right .
On the other side , there were plenty of liberals who denounced the Weather Underground or the Black Panthers .
But now supposedly responsible Republican leaders , commentators , and congressmen — Iowa Senator Charles Grassley and Arizona Representative Trent Franks — encourage the citizenship and euthanasia screamers .
A recent vice - presidential nominee endorses the death panels myth .
There is little or no determination to dissociate the right in general from the right - wing fringes .
Why is this ?
Partly , I suppose , the Republican Party has shrunk so drastically that it feels it cannot cut away any supporters .
This is the opposite of what was said about the banks , that they were too big to be allowed to fail .
The birthers are too small to be allowed to fail .
Everyone must be kept in the camp if there is to be a camp at all .
This situation cannot be reversed until and unless the Republican Party begins to recognize that keeping these people in the camp will destroy the camp , that the party cannot pretend to respect and responsibility before the electorate so long as they coddle the crazies .
Barry Goldwater was considered an extremist in his day , but his movement went on to prevail for a time because he did not temporize with Birchers , anti-Semites , or religious fanatics .
William F. Buckley became an influential supporter of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan because he was willing to free his movement from fringes like the John Birch Society , the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby , the Ayn Rand objectivists , the anti-fluoride kooks , and other exotic specimens .
That is the price of full participation in our national politics .
It is a price the current Republican Party is unwilling to pay .
Cooley and Los Angeles City Atty .
Carmen Trutanich argue that the stores , which now number in the hundreds , are selling marijuana for profit in violation of state law .
The Marijuana Policy Project , based in Washington , D.C. , commissioned the poll by an independent firm , Mason - Dixon Polling & Research , after Los Angeles County Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley threatened all dispensaries in the county with prosecution .
The poll , completed Monday and Tuesday , also found that 74 % support the state 's medical marijuana law , while 54 % want to see marijuana legalized , regulated and taxed .
More than three - quarters of the voters in Los Angeles County want to see medical marijuana dispensaries regulated , rather than prosecuted and forced to close , according to a poll released today by a national organization that supports marijuana legalization .
" I think the take - home message here is voters in L.A. County overwhelmingly support the state 's medical marijuana law .
They think dispensaries , properly regulated , can be a part of that , and Mr. Cooley 's really out of step , " said Bruce Mirken , the California - based spokesman for the organization .
The poll of 625 voters found that 77 % of voters want to regulate dispensaries , while 14 % want them closed .
Both Democrats ( 83 % - 7 % ) and Republicans ( 62%-30 % ) support regulation over prosecution .
The Los Angeles City Council is on the verge of adopting regulations after two years of debate and almost 13 years after voters passed Proposition 215 , the Compassionate Use Act .
The proposed law would ban sales of marijuana .
Dispensary operators say they do not sell it , but collect donations to recoup their costs , but they fear the ordinance will be used against them .
Sandi Gibbons , a spokeswoman for the district attorney , said that Cooley merely intends to enforce state law .
" Selling marijuana over the counter for profit is a violation of the law , " she said .
" Mr. Cooley has said that , if it is found that the marijuana is being supplied in accord with the Compassionate Use Act , then those operations are not targets . "
The poll found support for treating marijuana similarly to alcohol among county voters across most demographics , except voters who are 65 or older and Republicans .
Both groups oppose it by about a 10 - point margin .
Young people , voters between 18 and 34 , strongly support legalization , 72% - 18 % .
Legalization supporters are collecting signatures for four different initiatives that could be on the ballot next year .
The Marijuana Policy Project has reservations about moving forward , noting that younger voters typically turn out more heavily in presidential election years .
The poll underscores the growing support for legalization , but the majority is not a large one .
" It 's a sign of huge progress , " Mirken said .
" It 's not a sign that you are going to win . "
Mason - Dixon randomly selected voters from the county 's registration list and interviewed those who said they voted regularly .
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points .

Because the AP does not use the word " homosexual " in any story or headline .
Not only is it inflammatory and outdated , but the AP ’s own style guide restricts the use of " homosexual . "
Secondly , the TV ad references so - called " consequences of homosexual marriage , " including the assertion that schools are forced to teach about " homosexual marriage . "
Let me make two points :
One , there is nothing about schools or education in Question 1 .
Two , this is simply a cynical page from California ’s Prop 8 campaign to change the subject , divert attention , raise fears , and never , ever talk about fairness , equality or marriage for loving , committed same - sex couples .
Here ’s what all Maine parents care about :
That their kids are safe , secure and accepted .
In Maine , we believe that all families matter , and that schools are a welcoming place for learning .
And here ’s one lesson we know about Maine :
We will not let any distortion , lie or misrepresentation about marriage equality go unanswered .
Not one .
That ’s why we ’re going up soon with a strong rebuttal .
On TV and radio .
But we need the netroots support from people like you to get these rebuttal ads up and keep them up .
And we need to be nimble so that when the next attack comes , we ’re ready and able to answer .
Please donate today so we can fight these distortions .
It 's not all bad news though .
Markos has announced that he is commissioning a Research 2000 poll for us .
The results will come by the end of the week .
In the meantime , donate , donate , donate .
Today , we 're releasing an early version of Google Chrome Frame , an open source plug - in that brings HTML5 and other open web technologies to Internet Explorer .
We 're building Google Chrome Frame to help web developers deliver faster , richer applications like Google Wave .
Recent JavaScript performance improvements and the emergence of HTML5 have enabled web applications to do things that could previously only be done by desktop software .
One challenge developers face in using these new technologies is that they are not yet supported by Internet Explorer .
Developers can't afford to ignore IE — most people use some version of IE — so they end up spending lots of time implementing work - arounds or limiting the functionality of their apps .
With Google Chrome Frame , developers can now take advantage of the latest open web technologies , even in Internet Explorer .
From a faster Javascript engine , to support for current web technologies like HTML5's offline capabilities and < canvas > , to modern CSS / Layout handling , Google Chrome Frame enables these features within IE with no additional coding or testing for different browser versions .
To start using Google Chrome Frame , all developers need to do is to add a single tag
< meta http -equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " chrome=1 " >
When Google Chrome Frame detects this tag it switches automatically to using Google Chrome 's speedy WebKit - based rendering engine .
It 's that easy .
For users , installing Google Chrome Frame will allow them to seamlessly enjoy modern web apps at blazing speeds , through the familiar interface of the version of IE that they are currently using .
We believe that Google Chrome Frame makes life easier for web developers as well as users .
While this is still an early version intended for developers , our team invites you to try out this for your site .
You can start by reading our documentation .

EIGHTEEN months before he was hanged , Saddam Hussein told the FBI he allowed the world to believe he had weapons of mass destruction because he was worried about appearing weak to Iran , reports said yesterday .
According to declassified accounts of the FBI interviews released yesterday , the former Iraqi president said he felt so vulnerable to the perceived threat from " fanatic " leaders in Tehran that he would have been prepared to seek a " security agreement with the United States to protect ( Iraq ) from threats in the region " .
The Washington Post reported that summaries of the FBI interviews underlined Saddam 's fear of Iran .
In the interviews , Saddam said he considered Tehran a greater threat than the US .
Iran and Iraq had fought an eight - year war in the 1980s , and Saddam was convinced Iran was trying to annex southern Iraq , which , like Iran , is largely Shia , the report said .
George Piro , the FBI agent who conducted the interviews , said : " Hussein viewed the other countries in the Middle East as weak and could not defend themselves or Iraq from an attack from Iran . "
Former US president George W. Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 after Saddam refused to comply with UN resolutions requiring UN weapons inspectors unfettered access to suspected WMDs production facilities .
" The threat from Iran was the major factor as to why he did not allow the return of UN inspectors , " Mr Piro said .
" Hussein stated he was more concerned about Iran discovering Iraq 's weaknesses and vulnerabilities than the repercussions of the United States for his refusal to allow UN inspectors back into Iraq . "
The report said Saddam noted that Iran 's weapons capabilities had increased dramatically while Iraq 's weapons had been " eliminated by the UN sanctions " , and that Iraq would have to reconstitute its weapons to deal with that threat if it could not reach a security agreement with the US .
In the FBI interviews , Saddam at one point acknowledged he should have permitted the UN to witness the destruction of Iraq 's weapons stockpile after the 1991 Gulf War .
The FBI summaries of the interviews - 20 formal interrogations and five " casual conversations " in 2004 - were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the National Security Archive , an independent non-governmental research institute , and posted on its website yesterday , the paper said .
The detailed accounts of the interviews were released with few deletions , although one , a last formal interview on May 1 , 2004 , was completely redacted , the Post said .
Thomas Blanton , director of the archive , told the paper he could conceive of no national security reason to keep Saddam 's conversations secret .
Paul Bresson , a bureau spokesman , told the paper he could not explain the reason for the redactions .
The 20 formal interviews took place between February 7 and May 1 , followed by the casual conversations between May 10 and June 28 .
Saddam was later transferred to Iraqi custody and executed in December 2006 .
The formal interviews covered in extensive detail Saddam 's rise to power , the invasion of Kuwait and Saddam 's crackdown on the Shia uprising , while the subject of Iraq 's WMDs and links with al - Qa'ida and its leader , Osama bin Laden , were raised in the casual conversations , the report said .
Mr Blanton told the paper the FBI received orders from Washington to delve into topics of intense interest to Bush administration officials .
Mr Piro raised bin Laden in his last conversation with Saddam , but the information he yielded conflicted with the Bush administration 's many efforts to link Iraq with the terrorist group , the report said .
Saddam said he had never met bin Laden and the two of them " did not have the same belief or vision " .

I am not a dedicated football fan but I like to tend a game once in a while and sometimes watch the matches on TV .
Yesterday my local team played the quarter - final in our national cup where a situation made the whole country explode .
Our keeper injured his leg in an accident earlier in the match but he continued .
Later in the game this happened :
What would you do if you were the attacker .
Would you stop ?
Many thinks he breaks the Fair Play rule , but all of them are unwritten .
Who decides what to be Fair Play or not ?
I think its unfair to judge the attacker , I bet he would be hated by his own if he stopped the game .
The referee did n’t have time to blow the whistle until the attacker scored .
When I see a match I hate it when the players grab the opponents clothes or uses hand - tricks hidden from the referee to stop an attack .
The players does n’t seem to be willing to play fair anyway so why do we suddenly judge some of the cases ?
This is how many wanted him to do it :

Slinging php code to and fro one day , I found myself needing to process a potentially large result from a url–a result too large to fit within PHP ’s memory limit .
However , I could process this result a line at a time , so I could avoid buffering the entire thing in memory .
I could n’t use cURL , since it buffers everything , but I could use PHP ’s handy file - like stream interface , fetch the url with an fopen ( ' http://my-url.n.e.t/', 'r ' ) ; and then use fgets ( ) to keep only a line in memory at a time .
It was a great plan , but I noticed that I occasionally got garbage lines or bogus input .
Using http cli tools like wget and curl revealed nothing out of the ordinary , until I realized that those garbage lines were the uninterpreted length markers for Transfer - Encoding : chunked .
PHP ’s http stream handler does not decode chunked transfers .
There is a pecl function http_chunked_decode( ) , but it operates on strings , not streams , so I would still have to buffer the entire input first .
PHP ’s streams allow you to attach a chain of stream filters to a stream to process input and output ( it ’s the same mechanism ob_gzhandler ( ) uses ) .
My plan was to create a stream filter to transparently unchunk the stream .
Unfortunately , the documentation on writing your own stream filter is pretty sparse , and the examples I could find on the web were all very trivial .
After a few false starts , however , I was able to create an http stream unchunker :
/** * A stream filter for removing the ' chunking ' of a ' Transfer - Encoding : chunked ' * http response * *
The http stream wrapper on php does not support chunked transfer * encoding , making this filter necessary .
* * Add to a file resource with < code>stream_filter_append($fp , ' http_unchunk_filter ' , * STREAM_FILTER_READ ) ;</ code > * *
If the wrapper metadata for $ fp does not contain a < code > transfer - encoding : * chunked < / code > header , this filter passes data through unchanged .
* * @license BSD * @author Francis Avila */ //
Stream filters must subclass php_user_filter class http_unchunk_filter extends php_user_filter { protected $ chunkremaining = 0 ; // bytes remaining in the current chunk protected $ ischunked = null ; // whether the stream is chunk - encoded .
null=not sure yet // this is the meat of the filter .
//
The class must have a function with this name and prototype //
It must return a status -- one of the PSFS _ * constants ; function filter ( $ in , $ out , &$ consumed , $ closing ) { if ( $ this ->ischunked===null ) { $ this -> ischunked = self : : ischunked ( $ this -> stream ) ; } // $ in and $ out are opaque " bucket brigade " objects which consist of a // sequence of opaque " buckets " , which contain the actual stream data .
//
The only way to use these objects is the stream_bucket_* functions .
//
Unfortunately , there does n't seem to be any way to access a bucket // without turning it into a string using stream_bucket_make_writeable ( ) , // even if you want to pass the bucket along unmodified .
//
Each call to this pops a bucket from the bucket brigade and // converts it into an object with two properties : datalen and data .
//
This same object interface is accepted by stream_bucket_append ( ) .
while ( $ bucket = stream_bucket_make_writeable ( $ in ) ) { if (! $ this ->ischunked ) { $ consumed += $ bucket - > datalen ; stream_bucket_append ( $ out , $ bucket ) ; continue ; } $ outbuffer = '' ; $ offset = 0 ; // Loop through the string .
For efficiency , we do n't advance a character // at a time but try to zoom ahead to where we think the next chunk // boundary should be .
//
Since the stream filter divides the data into buckets arbitrarily , // we have to maintain state ( $ this -> chunkremaining ) across filter ( ) calls .
while ( $ offset < $ bucket - > datalen ) { if ( $ this->chunkremaining===0 ) { // start of new chunk , or the start of the transfer $ firstline = strpos ( $ bucket - > data , " \r
" , $ offset ) ; $ chunkline = substr ( $ bucket - > data , $ offset , $ firstline - $offset ) ; $ chunklen = current ( explode ( ' ; ' , $ chunkline , 2 ) ) ; // ignore MIME - like extensions $ chunklen = trim ( $ chunklen ) ; if ( ! ctype_xdigit ( $ chunklen ) ) { //
There should have been a chunk length specifier here , but since // there are non -hex digits something must have gone wrong .
return PSFS_ERR_FATAL ; } $ this -> chunkremaining = hexdec ( $ chunklen ) ; // $ firstline already includes $ offset in it $ offset = $ firstline + 2 ; // +2 is CRLF if ( $ this ->chunkremaining===0 ) { // end of the transfer break ; // ignore possible trailing headers } } // get as much data as available in a single go ... $ nibble = substr ( $ bucket - > data , $ offset , $ this -> chunkremaining ) ; $ nibblesize = strlen ( $ nibble ) ; $ offset += $ nibblesize ; // ... but recognize we may not have got all of it if ( $ nibblesize === $ this -> chunkremaining ) { $ offset += 2 ; // skip over trailing CRLF } $ this -> chunkremaining -= $ nibblesize ; $ outbuffer .= $ nibble ; } $ consumed += $ bucket - > datalen ; $ bucket - > data = $ outbuffer ; stream_bucket_append ( $ out , $ bucket ) ; } return PSFS_PASS_ON ; } protected static function ischunked ( $ stream ) { $ metadata = stream_get_meta_data( $ stream ) ; $ headers = $ metadata [ ' wrapper_data ' ] ; return ( bool ) preg_grep ( '/ ^Transfer - Encoding : \s+ chunked\s*$ /i' , $ headers ) ; } function onCreate ( ) { if ( isset ( $ this -> stream ) ) { //
This is usually not defined until the first filter ( ) call .
$ this ->ischunked = self : : ischunked ( $ this -> stream ) ; } } } stream_filter_register ('http_unchunk_filter ' , ' http_unchunk_filter ' ) ;
What you are left with is a stream filter you can then use like so :
$ fp = fopen ( ' http://my.url', 'r ' ) ; stream_filter_append( $fp , ' http_unchunk_filter ' , STREAM_FILTER_READ ) ;
If the http stream has a chunked transfer encoding , the filter will automatically unchunk it .
However , it ignores extended data ( anything after the hex - encoded chunk - length ) and trailing headers , both of which are in the http specification but hardly ever used .
The Llullaillaco mummies are the spectacularly preserved bodies of three sacrificial children from a 500 - year - old Inca civilisation found at more than 6,500 m above sea level in the Peruvian Andes .
I ’ve just found a study that brain scanned the mummies and the results are nothing short of stunning .
I ’ve tried to link each scan to the picture of the relevant mummy ( although I have to say , the online photos of the mummies are a bit inconsistently labelled so I apologise for any mismatching ) and you can see how remarkably well - preserved they are both inside and out .
The mummies are of a 15 - year - old girl , a 7 - year - old boy and a 6 year - old girl that are thought to have been left as part of a ritual Inca sacrifice .
From the article :
The scientific excavation was carried out at an altitude of 6,739 m above sea level on the summit of Mount Llullaillaco in the northwestern Argentinean Andes at an average temperature of ‚ Ä ì 15 ¬ ∞C .
These children had been sacrificed 500 years ago in times of the Inca Empire to appease the mountain deities and to ensure the emperor ’s well - being .
In addition , the mummies were buried with more than 100 objects , including textiles , gold and silver statues , pottery , and feathered headdresses .
The children had been buried in three pit tombs built by the Incas by enlarging natural niches in the bedrock at the summit shrine of Mount Llullaillaco , which is considered to be the highest archaeological site in the world .
The mummies were individually buried 1.7 m deep with their associated offerings .
The funerary sites were covered with a mixture of soil and stones , which was also used to fill in the platform that was later built to cover the burials .
According to a National Geographic news story , the older girl was found to have chewed coca leaves and drunk corn liquor , the latter possibly to put her asleep .

The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has busted a strange set of spyware purveyors — US retailing giants Sears and Kmart .
The FTC this week approved its final consent order against the companies ( which share the same owner ) over an episode that can only be chalked up to incompetence of a truly epic scope .
Sears Holding Management Company decided that it could really use a lot more marketing data to fuel its decision - making process , so it began offering visitors to sears.com and kmart.com a special invite — sign up for " My SHC Community , " download a piece of " research " software , and earn 10 American dollars .
That 's right — 10 ... American ... dollars .
All one had to do to secure this bounty was turn over to the company every single bit of information about one 's Web browsing .
This was n't just about the websites visited , or even about specific URLs ; the " research " software transmitted the complete contents of a browsing session , even secure sessions .
This meant that Sears and its data collection partner would have access to the " contents of shopping carts , online bank statements , drug prescription records , video rental records , library borrowing histories , and the sender , recipient , subject , and size for web - based e-mails , " said the FTC .
Among other things — the software also collected non-Web information about the user 's personal computer .
Also , do you ever wish you could transmit
all your secure session data to Sears ?
Sears did tell people that it would track their " online browsing , " but when security researchers looked into the software in early 2008 , they charged that the disclosure was mostly buried in legalese .
As we wrote at the time , " [ Security researcher Ben ]
Edelman heavily scrutinized all documentation that came with signing up for the community and found a few mentions of tracking software buried deep within the tangled legalese ( for example , one mention was on page 10 of a 54 - page license document ) .
This , he says , goes against regulations by the Federal Trade Commission that require clear , unavoidable disclosure and ' express consent ' from the user before installing such software . "
The FTC agreed .
It launched an investigation of its own after the story came to light , and found that Sears did mention the tracking , but provided details only in " a lengthy user license agreement , available to consumers at the end of a multi-step registration process . "
The agency charged that Sears did not " adequately disclose the scope of the tracking software 's data collection . "
Under the settlement ( PDF ) with the FTC , Sears has now agreed to destroy all data gained from the experiment and stop collecting data from any software still running in the wild .
In addition , if it wants to do any tracking in the future , the company has committed to " clearly and prominently disclose the types of data the software will monitor , record , or transmit .
This disclosure must be made prior to installation and separate from any user license agreement .
Sears must also disclose whether any of the data will be used by a third party . "
No money changed hands ( well , except for those 10 American dollars ) , but Sears is out of the spyware business — at least for now .

The family of Larry Don Wheeler , cousin of Texas Governor Rick Perry , is waiting to hear from the authorities as to why their loved one died in a “ burst of gunfire ” after sheriff ’s deputies arrived at his home Saturday night .
Wheeler ’s death “ is not making any sense , ” family lawyer David Gossom told the TimesRecordNews in Wichita Falls , Texas , adding that the family “ is in shock ” from the incident .
ADVERTISEMENT
According to that news report , deputies from the Montague County Sheriff ’s Office showed up at Wheeler ’s home in Nocona , northwest of Dallas , after reports of a gunshot being heard in the vicinity .
Soon afterward , Wheeler died in what the Associated Press describes as an “ exchange of gunfire . ”
The AP report cites Montague County District Attorney Jack McGaughey as saying that “ Wheeler was holding a shotgun and an officer was shot in the hand . ”
The TRN reports that the family is “ waiting to see if there is a reasonable explanation for what happened . ”
The Texas Rangers and the local district attorney ’s office are investigating , and an autopsy is pending .
Wheeler evidently had no history of conflict with the local police .
According to his obituary , Wheeler “ passionately worked many years to support his cousin , Governor Rick Perry . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
A 2005 press release from Gov. Perry lists
Wheeler as the Nocona steering committee head for Perry ’s 2006 re-election campaign .
Perry is widely known as a “ tough - on - crime ” politician who fiercely supports the death penalty and aggressive policing .
The TRN describes Wheeler as a quiet individual who loved “ golf , traveling and writing , ” and whose violent death “ is a sharp contrast to the life he lived . ”
Remember Lee Iacocca , the man who rescued Chrysler Corporation from its death throes ?
He 's now 82 years old and has a new book , ' Where Have All The Leaders Gone ? ' .
Lee Iacocca Says ...
Am I the only guy in this country who 's fed up with what 's happening ?
Where the hell is our outrage ?
We should be screaming bloody murder !
We 've got a gang of clueless bozos steering our ship of state right over a cliff , we 've got corporate gangsters stealing us blind , and we can't even clean up after a hurricane much less build a hybrid car .
But instead of getting mad , everyone sits around and nods their heads when the politicians say , ' Stay the course ..'
Stay the course ?
You 've got to be kidding .
This is America , not the damned , ' Titanic ' .
I 'll give you a sound bite : ' Throw all the bums out ! '
You might think I 'm getting senile , that I 've gone off my rocker , and maybe I have .
But someone has to speak up .
I hardly recognize this country anymore ..
The most famous business leaders are not the innovators but the guys in handcuffs ..
While we 're fiddling in Iraq , the Middle East is burning and nobody seems to know what to do .
And the press is waving ' pom - poms ' instead of asking hard questions .
That 's not the promise of the ' America ' my parents and yours traveled across the ocean for .
I 've had enough .
How about you ?
I 'll go a step further .
You can't call yourself a patriot if you 're not outraged .
This is a fight I 'm ready and willing to have .
The Biggest ' C ' is Crisis !
( Iacocca elaborates on nine C's of leadership , with crisis being the first . )
Leaders are made , not born .
Leadership is forged in times of crisis .
It 's easy to sit there with your feet up on the desk and talk theory .
Or send someone else 's kids off to war when you 've never seen a battlefield yourself .
It 's another thing to lead when your world comes tumbling down .
On September 11 , 2001 , we needed a strong leader more than any other time in our history .
We needed a steady hand to guide us out of the ashes .
A hell of a mess , so here 's where we stand .
We 're immersed in a bloody war with no plan for winning and no plan for leaving .
Obama is running the biggest deficit in the history of the country .
We 're losing the manufacturing edge to Asia , while our once - great companies are getting slaughtered by health care costs .
Gas prices are skyrocketing , and nobody in power has a coherent energy policy .
Our schools are in trouble due to poor leadership in school districts .
Our borders are like sieves .
The middle class is being squeezed every which way .
These are times that cry out for leadership .
But when you look around , you 've got to ask : ' Where have all the leaders gone ? '
Where are the curious , creative communicators ?
Where are the people of character , courage , conviction , omnipotence , and common sense ?
I may be a sucker for alliteration , but I think you get the point .
Name me a leader who has a better idea for homeland security than making us take off our shoes in airports and throw away our shampoo ?
We 've spent billions of dollars building a huge new bureaucracy , and all we know how to do is react to things that have already happened .
Name me one leader who emerged from the crisis of Hurricane Katrina .
Congress has yet to spend a single day evaluating the response to the hurricane or demanding accountability for the decisions that were made in the crucial hours after the storm .
Everyone 's hunkering down , fingers crossed , hoping it does n't happen again .
Now , that 's just crazy .
Storms happen .
Deal with it .
Make a plan .
Figure out what you 're going to do the next time .

Les personnes âgées se suicident en moyenne beaucoup plus que le reste de la population , surtout après 85 ans , chez elles ou en maison de retraite , souvent en raison de dépressions non diagnostiquées , dans une indifférence générale que déplorent les professionnels .
En France , comme " dans plusieurs pays , les taux de suicide les plus élevés se retrouvent chez les aînés , spécialement chez ceux qui ont 85 ans et plus " , constate l'Association internationale pour la prévention du suicide ( AIPS ) , qui parraine la Journée mondiale de prévention du suicide le 10 septembre .
Ainsi , quand le taux est de 17,1 suicides pour 100.000 habitants dans la population générale , il est de 32 pour les 75 - 84 ans , de 44 pour les 85 - 94 ans et de 38,8 chez les plus de 95 ans , selon les chiffres de l'Institut national de recherche médicale ( Inserm ) .
Les hommes de plus de 95 ans se suicident même dix fois plus que le reste de la population .
Depuis 30 ans , la France compte environ 3.000 suicides chez les plus de 65 ans , sur les 10.000 environ répertoriés chaque année .
Se sentant " rejetés par une société très méprisante envers les gens qui ne sont plus actifs " , souvent isolés et voyant leur état physique décliner , beaucoup de patients âgés ne voient pas d'autre issue , explique le Dr Sophie Moulias , gériatre à l'hôpital Ambroise - Paré de Boulogne - Billancourt ( Hauts - de - Seine ) .
Plus les personnes avancent en âge , plus elles choisissent des méthodes radicales -- pendaison , coup de fusil ou défenestration -- , " ce sont moins des tentatives que des suicides " réussis , explique aussi Sophie Moulias .
Wisconsin Woman on Twitter : ' Thank Goodness ' for Miscarriage Penelope Trunk is coming under fire from some for her candor online .
Oct. 1 , 2009  -- Penelope Trunk , 42 , built her career advising others on how to create a professional online identity by telling them what to share and what to leave out .
But early last week , the professional blogger and CEO of her own company , " Brazen Careerist , " posted on her Twitter account , " I 'm in a board meeting .
Having a miscarriage .
Thank goodness , because there 's a f***- up 3 - week hoop - jump to have an abortion in Wisconsin . "
Trunk 's apparent relief and offhand attitude toward her unwanted pregnancy has fueled the debate among many women on whether she and others are overstepping their professional boundaries by going public online about controversial health issues .
" The issue of pregnancy stirs up a lot of emotions , " said Scott Wetzler , clinical psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York .
" Her bravado suggests that everything is OK , but things are more complicated than she 's making it out to be .
There 's nothing wrong with her brazen [ attitude ] , but underneath I think there 's more ambivalence she 's not acknowledging . "
Trunk 's candor resulted in more than 70 of her Twitter followers jumping ship -- a consequence that Trunk told ABCNews.com she found surprising .
The Wisconsin resident said that her attempts to schedule an abortion in that state turned into a bureaucratic nightmare when she attempted to go through her insurance provider .
She subsequently made an appointment to have one in three weeks in Illinois .
But within three days of the appointment , she miscarried , she said .
" I thought a lot of people would be responding about having to cross state lines to get an abortion , but a lot of it has also been [ about ] whether you should be sad about miscarriage , " Trunk told ABCNews.com .
" I think the issue surrounding the three - week wait is controversial , but not the relief . "
Trunk , who has two children and has recently had a divorce , said she had already experienced a miscarriage after the first of her two children were born .
" The first time I had a miscarriage I was sad about it , and it was a very typical experience , " she said .
" But I think it 's limiting that it 's only OK to talk about miscarriages if you 're sad about it . "
Trunk added that while many of the responses to her tweet criticized her for releasing too much personal information , some women in the blogosphere are applauding Trunk 's frankness about her feelings .
" The idea that miscarriage is something personal that should be kept secret whether a woman wants to keep it secret or not , when so so many women have them , is a problem , " wrote Rachel Walden , of Nashville , Tenn. , in the blog , " Women 's Health News . "
" The idea that people 's bodies should effectively be hidden from the work environment where we spend so much of our time is problematic in its own ways . "
" If the public at large had to face up to the fact that not every miscarriage is met with a vale of tears , that could have a dramatic impact on how we regard pregnancy , abortion , and women 's diverse experiences with our reproductive functions , " wrote Amanda Marcotte in the women 's issue blog , " XX Factor . "
How Much Information Is Too Much Information ?
Still , at a time when anything goes in the digital realm , is it possible to share too much ?
Indeed , while online communities go the extra mile to assure users of privacy and confidentiality , some users indulge in an openness that is uncommon in other social settings .
Lisa Neal Gualtieri , adjunct clinical professor of the health communication program at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston and an expert in social media and public health , said that while many people are aware that they are sharing personal health information through social networks like Twitter or blogs , they may not realize the effect their attitude toward a health condition may have on other readers .
" When you move to electronic ways of communication in general , there is a sense of emotional detachment even though emotions are being expressed , " said Gualtieri .
" Twitter is interesting because it 's so public , and so immediate , and it 's so contained ; you 're not going into detail , and it can be highly emotional . "
According to Gualtieri , social media technology has introduced new ways to view health conditions that many people may not otherwise openly discuss .
" It 's making a health issue , or opinions regarding a health issue , more of the common vernacular , " she said .
" But for all the talk about privacy online with these types of sites , this is a way you 're being very public about health information . "
Trunk , who bases her career on the use of social media , said that older and younger generation of social media users have different ideas of what information is acceptable to share online .
" My personal brand is transparency in the workplace , " she said .
" If there is a personal issue that is taking you away from work , then it becomes a career issue . "
In fact , Trunk said , her tweet is her own experiential example of the advice she gives her readers about exercising transparency and honesty in the workplace .
" If you 're pregnant or have had a miscarriage , you should tell your boss , " she said .
" Top performers [ in careers ] are communicative , so to tell my board that I 'm going to Chicago to get an abortion , that 's a no- brainer . "
Miscarriage Not Uncommon , Doctors Say
Miscarriage is the most common type of pregnancy loss , according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .
The American Pregnancy Association reports that women ages 35 to 45 have a 20 to 35 percent chance of miscarriage , and the chances of miscarriage increase as women get older .
According to Wetzler , while many people may commonly associate miscarriage with feelings of disappointment or even despair , many women are ambivalent immediately after their experience .
" Miscarriage is enormously frequent , and in a vast majority of cases it's not met with depression , " said Wetzler .
" I think [ miscarriage ] is a natural and common medical event , and like other common and medical things , there are a multitude of reactions , some of which may be relief , disappointment and the realization that pregnancy is a risk . "
The context of experiencing a miscarriage also factors into how a woman will react , he said .
Generally , women who are older or who have been trying to get pregnant for many years may feel more upset than women who have had a miscarriage after already having a child .
And while many women express their reaction in different ways , Wetzler said for some women , sharing the news with an online community may feel just as comforting as sharing the news with family or close friends .
" The notion that it 's shameful or personal to talk about your health in any capacity is unfair , " he said .
" However , typically someone in control of their career is in charge of other things in their life , like their health , " Wetzler added .
" I 'm personally skeptical that she 's as brazen as she thinks she should be . "
I usually dismiss people who say that social media “ changes everything . ”
At least in marketing , it ’s a variation on a theme of “ listen , react , and serve your customer ” that has served us well for generations .
But in a world where everyone is a publisher and critic — and can potentially be sued for it — this DOES change everything in the world of public relations !
I ’ve been honored to explore this topic with Steve Farnsworth , Chief Digital Strategist of Jolt Social Media , who is absolutely one of the smartest PR and marketing guys I know .
On Monday I wrote a post describing a real case where a marketing firm , Low and Tritt , sued a Knoxville pizza restaurant for $ 2 million over alleged libelous comments on Facebook and Twitter .
The fact is , this is just the beginning — we are going to witness more and more of this kind controversy .
The marketing firm ’s reputation is now spinning out of control .
Once it goes viral , what can a company do ?
Steve answers this for us in a guest post , his first ever !
________________________________________________
When Mark challenged me to respond to his post on libel lawsuits and social media , I was thrown for a loop .
Crisis communications for a business who had sued a client or tenant ?
Where do you even start on a self - inflicted gunshot wound like that ?
It was a little like asking me to talk about safety to a young man as he recovers in the hospital burn ward , after he met the business - end of a Roman candle in a deeply misguided Jackass reenactment .
All you can really do is take pictures of the awkward injuries to show the other kids that it is just not a good idea .
You do n’t want to try this at home .
Being a regularly reader of {grow} I could n’t pass up a chance to work with Mark or his challenge .
To mix things up , Mark agreed to participate in a Twitter chat ( # SM4B ) with me on Wednesday October 7 , 2009 .
A sampling of the comments from the chat are included at the end .
Since I only have access to openly published details of the case , and lack internal insights of the cases Mark cited in that post , it is difficult to address those situations specifically .
So , I am using this assumption :
The marketing firm realizes that as an unintended consequence of the lawsuit they risk potential irreversible damage to the firm ’s long - term reputation , a reputation that they have spent years nurturing , and the very real potential of lost future business .
Situation Analysis
At risk for both parties
Loss of Money : court fees , attorney fees , and judgments against the loser by the court .
Also , vendors and banks see extending credit or loans to a business in litigation as potentially risky .
Bifurcated Mental Focus : Cases can drag out for months or even years .
Being involved in a lawsuit , even if you think you might win , is a drag .
It takes your mental focus off your business , family , and your life .
With so much at risk you ca n’t think about building your business , taking care of your family , or health .
Time Sink : Meeting with lawyers , responding and filing court documents , and depositions all take your most valuable and limited resource : time .
Brand Impact Risk for Pizza Restaurant
You want people to think , “ Hey you ’re the guy who makes that fantastic Three - Cheese Pasta Bake . ”
Not , “ Hey , you ’re the guy who called your agency crooks and got sued for a million dollars . ”
Needless to say this is way off topic for your brand image .
Brand Impact Risk for Marketing Firm
Even if the courts decide that they are the clear victim in our scenario , the public is going to see the offending words calling them crooks and thieves repeatedly , and hear accusations that their work is subpar .
Public sentiment , as reflected by dozens of published comments , is establishing them as “ That agency that sues its clients . ”
There is absolutely no upside for their brand .
They could be a very reputable agency , but this will impact new business development for years .
My Suggested Plan Of Action
Make
It A Non-Issue News , and social media discussions , thrives on conflict .
Often when words have been said , and egos bruised , it is next to impossible to have a meeting of the minds , but that would be my first effort .
Both sides have a lot at stake in this case , and both have a great deal to gain by putting their differences aside and coming to terms .
No one is going to be happy .
However , if they can agree on settling this matter quickly they can start repairing reputations and move on to building their business .
Create A Listening Dashboard
The train is off the tracks , but you still need to know where it ’s going to land so you can be prepared to engage or adjust your efforts as needed .
Using an RSS reader like Google Reader , I would create several persistent searches for terms related to the case and save them as RSS feeds .
At a minimum , sites I would include are Google Alerts , Twitter search , and Technorati .
Probably Social Media Firehose ( Yahoo Pipes ) , too .
Speak Once On The Topic and Shut - Up I would write a very conversational , from - the - heart , brief blog post from the face of the company ( owner , president , or GM ) on the resolution .
I would have them acknowledge , in clear , but gentle terms , their mistakes , and I would do this without mentioning Pizza Kitchen by name .
No need to beat a dead horse .
I want to capture the human nature of the situation , a genuine mea culpa , so that the public would connect with the people involved .
If the client had any believability on video I would do it on camera , and then post it to YouTube .
Create Positive Online Content Diluting the negative online content with expert content is extremely important .
Any time a new customer Googles L+T they will see the negative results .
So , they should publish downloadable , no sign - up required white papers , case studies , and / or e-books .
Also , they need to start a blog hosted on their website ( huge SEO benefits ) , and develop a videos series to post to YouTube .
All the content must be well crafted and targeted to potential client ’s business concerns .
The blog and videos must provide great usable advice and demonstrates their marketing expertise .
This will help return some positive standing to search results , and likely shorten their sales cycle .
Show Your Face and Become a Resource
It looks like L+T primarily works with local businesses .
I would create a few powerful presentations designed to help local business owners generate new clients , and then take it on the road .
I would talk to any group that could put 5 or more butts in seats .
Getting management out in front of potential clients will do a lot for rebuilding the company name by putting a human face on it , and great for generating new business .
L+T should continue to evaluate damage to new business , and decide how best to evolve their efforts .
Also , I would seriously consider rebranding the company and changing the name .
When I suggested this during the chat it met with a number of dissenting opinions .
The general sentiment was that the negatives would outweigh the benefits because people would see it as hiding behind a different name .
However , this does not track with the effects I have seen in the real world .
Names are very powerful .
Johnson & Johnson rebuilt their very damaged brand effectively after the Tylenol tampering scare , but they were the victims and got out in front of the story .
It is almost impossible to rehabilitate a brand that consumers see as the bad guy .
Blackwater Security Consulting knew this and changed their name pronto .
Now , if you ask a room full of people what Blackwater ’s new name is , most would be unable to tell you .
It ’s Xe Services LLC .
For a full listing of comments , search Twitter for # SM4B .
Here is a sampling of some of the best insights :
@Dan_Holden :
So even if they are right ( win the lawsuit ) they ’ve damaged the reputation of the firm , perhaps irreparably .
@kimmolinkama : Maybe this is simply the first highlight case of ambulance - chasing turning into tweet - chasing ?
@steve_dodd : the power of an apology … fix it and move on … would generate positive press that more than counteracts negative
@NitinGuptasays : I agree that BPB has risked its reputation and future business by sueing .
.. but was PD justified in defaming the agency ?
@Dan_Holden :
My resolution would be to get the suit out of court and have a pizza and beer … maybe even sponsor a neighborhood beer bash
@markwschaefer :
My take is that suing a customer is almost always a losing proposition .
And now under the glare of SM … wow .
What have I missed ?
What would you do in the event of a social media PR crisis ?

New legislation expected to be introduced this week would give federal medical marijuana defendants greater leverage in federal court by allowing attorneys to present evidence of medical use and compliance with local and state laws , a move prohibited under current law .
The “ Truth in Trials Act , ” authored by Rep. Sam Farr ( D - CA ) and co-sponsored by 20 other Democrats and Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , “ enables individuals facing federal prosecution for marijuana - related offenses to provide evidence during trial that the activities they were engaged in were performed in compliance with their state ’s duly - enacted medical marijuana laws , ” noted advocacy group Americans for Safe Access .

Farr explained to media that the legislation is meant to give additional protection to medical marijuana defendants who are still being targeted by prosecutors in spite of President Barack Obama ’s new policy of not prosecuting patients abiding by state law .
“ This ( directive of the president ) is n’t an executive order .
It ’s not law , and it could change with a new attorney general or a new president , ” Farr explained , according to the Santa Cruz Sentinel .
“ Our bill would codify this ( directive ) . ”
“ We need strict drug laws , but we also need to apply a little common sense to how they ’re enforced , ” he continued .
“ This legislation is about treating defendants in cases involving medical marijuana fairly , plain and simple . ”
The legislation is backed by virtually the entire cross-section of drug law reform organizations , along with interfaith groups and medical advocates , according to a list provided to the press .
Groups include “ Americans for Safe Access ( ASA ) , American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , National Association of People With AIDS ( NAPWA ) , National Minority AIDS Council ( NMAC ) , and AIDS Action Council . ”
“ The fallout from this lack of an affirmative defense is quite severe , ” a letter to members of the House Judiciary Committee explained .
“ In the past few years , dozens of people have been convicted in federal court and sentenced to lengthy prison terms of between 5 - 20 years for activity that was lawful under their state ’s medical marijuana law .
Furthermore , there are currently at least two dozen pending federal cases in which defendants are unable to mount an adequate defense , underscoring the urgent need for this legislation . ”

Americans for Safe Access says the legislation …
* Reaffirms States ’ Rights : The “ Truth in Trials ”
Act is a common sense and compassionate measure that attempts to reconcile the enduring conflict between federal and state laws on a very important and private medical matter .
* Preserves Existing Laws : The “ Truth in Trials ”
Act defers to existing law by providing for criminal penalties if the defendant ’s use of cannabis is not exclusively limited to authorized medical use .
* Restores Fundamental Fairness : The “ Truth in Trials ”
Act promotes fundamental fairness by allowing medical marijuana defendants to introduce evidence that may be considered by the judge and jury .
The bill is expected to be put before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime , Terrorism and Homeland Security .
Companion legislation is pending in the U.S. Senate .
ヒトの性交は、妊娠の目的だけでなく、コミュニケーションとして行われることがあります。
妊娠を望まない場合は避妊をすることになります。
ただ、さまざまな理由により避妊ができなかったり、コンドームが外れてしまうなどの理由で避妊に失敗してしまうこともあります。
また、それ以外にも、大変残念なことですが強姦などの事件を含め、性交の強要により避妊ができなかったというケースも聞きます。
何らかの事情で避妊に失敗し、望まない妊娠を避けるために、緊急避妊薬（モーニングアフター・ピル）という薬があります。
このモーニングアフター・ピルには、2パターンあります。
1つは「緊急避妊薬」という薬で、レボノルゲストレルを有効成分とする（SOH-075）のことになります。
これは、フランスで開発され、「ノルレボ」という名で約60カ国で販売されていますが、2010年3月現在、日本では販売されておらず、あすか製薬の100 %子会社である株式会社そーせいが治験を終了し承認申請をしている状況です。
ただし、2006年4月から強姦事件の被害者は緊急避妊薬を公費で得られるようになっています。
もうひとつは、 「モーニングアフターピル」と称し、緊急避妊薬と同じ効果が得られるホルモン濃度の量の経口避妊薬（ピル）を服用するというパターンです。
これには、製剤に含まれるホルモン量の関係から、低用量よりも中用量の経口避妊薬が使われることがあります。
なお、アフターピルについては、着床成立前に避妊目的で服用する薬剤ですので、着床し妊娠が分かってから行う中絶とは全く目的が異なります。
そして、日本は、先進国として緊急避妊を承認していない唯一の国になっていますが、ピルの通販で購入する事も可能です。

The awe - inspiring images chronicle Reed 's travels through more than 2,000 U.S. counties documenting some of America 's most deadly and spectacular weather .

TORNADOES
A tornado is a narrow , violently rotating column of air that extends from the base of a supercell thunderstorm ( hurricane ) .
You can only see them when there is enough moisture in the air .
The severe thunderstorms which produce tornadoes form where cold dry polar air meets warm moist tropical air .
The wind coming into the storm starts to swirl and forms a funnel .
The air in the funnel spins faster and faster and creates a very low pressure area which sucks more air ( and objects ) into it .
These twisters are most common in a section of the United States called Tornado Alley , with most forming in April and May .
Most tornadoes spin cyclonically ( anti-clockwise ) in the Northern hemisphere .
Encountering hundreds of tornadoes , super - cell thunderstorms and hailstorms that have produced icy orbs twice the size of a softball , Jim 's pictures are breathtaking .
Unlike other so - called ' storm chasers ' , who are often labelled adrenaline junkies for their obsessive pursuit of extreme weather , Jim is driven by his love for art and his interaction with nature by documenting the unpredictable changes in weather and climate .
' You might ask , ' What 's the difference , really ? ' , the 48 - year - old who lives in South Carolina said .
' I do n't chase anything really .
What I do is about preparation , evaluation , second - guessing and forecasting .
' And if you 're a pro or if you 're a Storm Chaser that has pride you want to be out in the field before that storm warning is ever issued . '
Jim 's professionalism and dedication is reflected in his meticulous planning for each shoot .
' The day before a potential event , I 'm looking at the computer models , maps and data just like any weatherman on TV does , ' explains Jim .
' That part is a lot of science , but once I get there , it becomes a lot more artful .
I 'm out there interpreting the sky and observing the landscape .
That helps me decide which camera and lens I want to use .

Yet despite his thorough approach , even Jim can't control the elements .

' I was down there with a meteorologist partner and we thought it was going to be a Category 2 .
It suddenly changed directions and intensified to nearly a Category 5 and caught us out in the open .
' We were literally swatting away debris and getting hit by shrapnel .
It 's the only time I ever videotaped a goodbye to my mom .
I thought , ' This is it . '
' Trees were coming out of the ground , but what saved our hides , was the centre of the eye .
In the matter of a few minutes , we went from violent winds to dead calm .
It 's the only time in my career I have experienced that .
It 's other worldly and bizarre in a good way .
' We had a 4 minute 52 second window and we found someone with a tornado shelter and they let us in .
' My second was during Hurricane Katrina .
We were in Gulfport , Mississippi , at the same hotel we had been in for three other storms .
It was built just after Hurricane Camille so it was designed to withstand a Category 5 .

Extreme weather photographer Jim Reed has spent the last 20 years being as close as possible to tornados
' We rode it out in this five storey hotel about 70 yards from the water .
We were poking our heads out of the doors and windows as much as we could until the surge reached out to us .
It was about 26 or 27 feet in our area .
' We could n't go downstairs anymore after that .
When the water subsided , it was like someone had pulled the stopper on the bathtub and the water went out faster than it came in .
' Everything to the east and west of us had been completely raised from the concrete foundations .
Our hotel had lost half of the building .
We were the only area left standing .
We could 've been crushed - I still dream about it .'
Jim 's fascination in weather began as a young boy thanks to a variety of severe storms in his home town of Springfield , Illinois , which included tornadoes , blizzards , ice storms , floods .
In 1969 , Jim and his mother , Audrey , found themselves trapped by the outer bands of historic hurricane Camille while returning from a family vacation near Mississippi .
Moving into writing , producing and directing , it was n't until 1991 after seeing footage from two Wichita photojournalists riding out an F - 5 tornado , that he turned his eyes , and lens , to the sky .
With 2010 marking his 19th consecutive year in the field , Jim is now focusing on his first love - meteorological art .
It may come as no surprise that Jim is considering switching gears and slowing down .
' I 'm setting new goals for 2010 , ' he said , explaining that the pace of editorial photography does n't appeal to him as much as the art .
' I want to shoot less and exhibit more . '
Jim currently has images being shown at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC in conjunction with the new Sargent and the Sea exhibit about artist John Singer Sargent .
Or , as Nikon , the camera manufacturer who sponsors the artist , calls them , " atmospheric portraits . "
' You watch the genesis of this remarkable event that will never be repeated , ' said Reed .
' Every single storm is unique to the environment .
It 's almost like as this storm matures I need to stay with it ( something like ) karma moves in , you get into this dance with nature and I just love it . '

I find working through mind - bending problems is a good way to test how well you 've figured out a concept and also get intimately familiar with details .
Here are some problems that should be done as you work your way through Typeclassopedia .
Functors Implement fmap for Either e , ( ( , ) e ) and ( (-> ) e ) .
for , and .
Write a function with type signature Functor f => ( a -> b ) -> f ( f a ) -> f ( f b ) .
If you are stuck , try writing the function for a specific instance of functor .
Can this type signature be generalized ?

We were skimming along at a brisk clip through Fisherman ’s Cut , in the heart of the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta , when we saw it : a fishing trawler scuttled on the levee bank , bleached white by the wind and the sun , like a skeleton beached on the boulders that shape this narrow , man -made channel connecting the False and San Joaquin rivers .
The tugboat that had been pushing the trawler had n’t fared well , either .
Too small for the job , it kept chugging till the end , right into the levee bank , where it now rests behind the larger vessel like a sunken dingy , the little engine that could n’t .
“ They should ’ve got a bigger boat , ” quipped Chris , my brother , imitating Roy Scheider ’s character in Jaws .
My brother , I should point out , is a salvage nut .
We were riding in his bass boat , and he already had his eyes on the rusty , cast - iron windlass still bolted to the trawler ’s deck .
He cut the engine and pulled up next to the derelict .
We crawled over the starboard gunwale and up the canted deck one at a time , the fragile bones of the wreck creaking beneath our weight .
The windlass was too heavy to bring back on the boat , and Chris headed aft in search of other potential booty .
I crawled up to the bow and peered over the port gunwale , where the wayward vessel ’s name was still visible on the hull .
The Dream .
The name could n’t be more fitting , because it is here , in the heart of the Delta , that the dreams for California ’s future economic growth threaten to pile up on the rocks .
Two - thirds of the state ’s population , 25 million people , depends on the Sacramento - San Joaquin Delta for at least some of their water supply .
Water from the Delta irrigates 3 million agricultural acres .
California ’s economic growth depends upon its ability to provide water for future population growth .
But the Delta ’s levees and ecosystem are rapidly deteriorating , threatening to completely cut off the Bay Area and Southern California ’s water supply , crashing the economy and potentially endangering millions of people .
Right this minute , legislators are working feverishly to address the crisis before the end of the session .
One proposed solution : a peripheral canal bypassing the Delta .
Yes , one of California ’s longest - simmering water feuds has once again attained full boil .
For more than a half century , skirmishes over the peripheral canal have pitted Northern Californians against Southern Californians , farmers against developers , environmentalists against politicians .
The divisions go further than that ; internecine politics and unlikely bedfellows have always played a role in California ’s water wars .
The debate can get ugly , and has even been known to divide father and son .
Trust me on that one .
I know from personal experience .
According to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s Delta Vision Blue Ribbon Task Force , approximately one - third of the Delta ’s inflows are siphoned off by upstream , downstream and in - Delta water users .
From Redding to Los Angeles , everyone ’s got a straw in this thing .
PHOTO BY R.V. SCHEIDE
It ’s one big suck .
But the task force says we need even more water from the Delta if California ’s economy is to continue to grow .
That ’s problematic because we ’ve turned the largest estuary on the West Coast into our own personal toilet .
“ The Delta is in an ecological tailspin , ” the task force reports .
“ Invasive species , water pumping facilities , urban growth and urban and agricultural pollution are degrading water quality and threatening multiple fish species with extinction . ”
Throw in global warming , sea - level rise , increasingly brackish water , crumbling levees , frequent droughts and the occasional earthquake , and it ’s not so hard to understand the panel ’s sense of urgency .
The proposed canal would draw water directly from the Sacramento River near Freeport and “ convey ” it 50 miles south , around the eastern edge of the battered ecosystem to the massive state and federal pumping stations near Tracy .
Think of it as open heart surgery , only on a grander scale .
That ’s kind of the way engineers look at it .
But opponents of the long - sought - after peripheral canal see things differently .
To them , it ’s a knife that stabs deep into the heart of the Delta .
I grew up on dams and water projects .
My father is a retired power - plant operator .
Dad got out of the Navy when I was 9 , and we moved to Idaho , my mom ’s home state .
He quickly gained a job with Idaho Power in American Falls , where for the next several years we lived right next to the power plant downstream from the dam that backs the Snake River into the 30 - mile - long American Falls Reservoir .
For my two younger brothers and me , growing up in small rural town had its advantages .
Idaho was relatively unspoiled in the late 1960s ; fishing and hunting were popular pastimes that began at an early age .
As a young teenager , I spent summers moving heavy irrigation pipe by hand , mucking about alfalfa , wheat and potato fields in rubber boots for 6 cents a section .
By the time school started in the fall , my wrists were thick with calluses , I ’d earned enough money to pitch in with Dad on a dirt bike and the reservoir had been pumped near dry .
There ’s a certain cache in having a father who makes electricity for a living .
My brothers and I were always welcome visitors down at the power plant , where we learned firsthand how water spins the turbine that spins the shaft that spins the generator that makes the juice .
The vertical shafts were 3 feet in diameter but spun at low rpm , so we could reach out and touch them .
We were n’t the wealthiest family in town , but if Dad had ever gone on strike and the electricity had stopped flowing , everybody else would have been screwed , even the rich people .
This paternal prestige grew further after Dad was hired by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and we moved to Grand Coulee Dam , which spans the Columbia River in eastern Washington .
Once the largest dam in the world , Grand Coulee is one of the crowning achievements in the massive federal makeover of the American West that began in the Great Depression .
Hoover Dam came first and may surpass it aesthetically , but Grand Coulee Dam makes up for it in sheer bulk .
PHOTO COURTESY OF HTTP://GRANDCOULEEDAM.INFO
“ Water ?
We got water ! ”
So says the Grand Coulee Dam Area Chamber of Commerce in its latest advertising campaign .
This photo of the dam was taken from Crown Point , where many a native teenager have lost their virginity .
The dam ’s construction created thousands of much - needed jobs .
As it neared completion in 1941 , folk singer Woody Guthrie , then under contract with the federal Works Progress Administration , paid homage to the achievement in “ Grand Coulee Dam ” :
Well , the world has seven wonders that the trav’lers always tell ,
Some gardens and some towers , I guess you know them well ,
But now the greatest wonder is in Uncle Sam ’s fair land ,
It ’s the big Columbia River and the big Grand Coulee Dam .
Believe me , you learn all of this stuff immediately upon your arrival at “ The Dam . ”
The 10,000 or so people remaining in the three small towns in Grand Coulee ’s vicinity since Woody and the workmen pulled up stakes have no other history to cling to .
So they brag about the dam .
Not that there is n’t plenty to brag about .
The dam is more than a mile across .
Electricity generated by the project was used by Seattle - based Boeing Company to build the aircraft that helped the United States prevail in World War II .
Its 33 generators produced more energy than any power plant in the nation .
Plus , my dad worked there .
Reinforced by a daily high - school bus ride that every morning provided me with a panoramic view of the concrete monolith ’s 550 - foot - tall edifice , I started thinking about the dam in mythical proportions .
It had always been there , immutable , inscrutable , immovable , and it would remain long after I was gone .
Above all , I was thoroughly convinced that the Bureau ’s efforts to tame the rivers of the arid American West were a righteous endeavor .
That all changed after I moved to California .
Like Hoover and Grand Coulee dams , construction on the Bureau ’s Central Valley Project began during the Great Depression .
The CVP consists of a series of rivers , dams , canals and pipelines stretching 500 miles north to south , from Redding to the San Joaquin Valley .
Shasta Dam , near Redding , is the cornerstone of the project .
In 1978 , Dad transferred from Grand Coulee to Shasta , and the family moved to Redding .
Although a massive structure in its own right , Shasta is match for neither Grand Coulee ’s majesty nor its electrical output .
In fact , generating electricity was never Shasta Dam ’s primary purpose , used only to justify the structure ’s cost .
All those summers slogging through muddy spud fields , watching the reservoir run dry , and it had never really dawned on me .
It ’s not about the electricity .
It ’s about the water .
The state was near the end of a long drought , people were putting bricks in their toilet tanks and Dad ’s role took on a new prominence .
In arid California , water is even more important than electricity , and he now had his hands on the levers controlling half of the state ’s water supply .
The audacious complexity and scope of the CVP ’s 20 reservoirs , 11 power plants and 500 miles of canals blows my mind to this day .
It seems incredible to me that anyone could even think it up , let alone build it .
New York , California and 13 other states are accusing biotech giant Amgen Inc. of offering kickbacks to medical providers to boost sales across the country of its anemia drug Aranesp , which increasingly has been beset by safety concerns .
In a suit filed Friday in federal court in Massachusetts , the states accuse Amgen sales representatives of encouraging doctors and other healthcare providers to bill insurers for Aranesp that the practitioners received free from the company , according to a statement issued by New York Atty .
Gen. Andrew Cuomo .
The practice , which the suit contends was known to Amgen ’s upper management , allegedly cost taxpayer - funded Medicaid programs and other insurers millions of dollars in overpayments .
The suit also alleges that Amgen , of Thousand Oaks , conspired with two other defendants -- drug wholesaler ASD Healthcare and group drug- purchasing network International Nephrology -- to offer “ illegal inducements ” to medical providers to increase sales of Aranesp .
These allegedly included sham consulting agreements , weekend retreats and other rewards .

“ Drugs should be prescribed to patients on the basis of need , effectiveness and safety , not on a corporate giant ’s promise of an all - expense - paid vacation , ” Cuomo said .
“ In an egregious violation of the law , Amgen allegedly bribed medical providers and left taxpayers footing the bill for free drug samples . ”
In a statement , Amgen said , “ We believe that the allegations are without merit , and we look forward to the opportunity to examine these matters with the states before the court . ”
The company said it would not comment further because the case is in litigation .
Mike Kilpatric , a spokesman for AmerisourceBergen Corp. , the Pennsylvania - based parent company of ASD Healthcare and International Nephrology ( now known as Integrated Nephrology Network ) , also denied the allegations .
He added that his company had received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice “ related to the issues set forth in this case ” and was cooperating with the government , but declined to provide specifics .

The Justice Department declined to comment .
Aranesp is one of Amgen ’s top - selling drugs , though its sales have declined in recent years as safety concerns have mounted .
Amgen , which reported revenue of $ 15 billion in 2008 , said sales of Aranesp fell to $ 3.1 billion last year from $ 4.1 billion in 2006 .
Anemia drugs , including Aranesp and two others produced by Amgen -- Epogen and Procrit -- are given to kidney disease and cancer patients to boost red blood cell production and raise hemoglobin levels .
According to a report on a 2006 congressional hearing , the drugs are the single biggest medication expense for Medicare , another taxpayer - funded insurance program .

Anemia drugs have come under increasing fire after a series of studies found that high doses can lead to increased risk of heart attack , stroke , heart failure and tumor growth in some patients .
In 2007 , the Food and Drug Administration issued a “ black - box warning ” for Amgen ’s anemia medications -- the strongest warning possible about potential side affects .
The Associated Press reported late Friday that a new study raised fresh safety concerns about the drugs , finding that Aranesp nearly doubled the risk of stroke in people with diabetes and chronic kidney problems who are not yet sick enough to need dialysis .
The lawsuit against Amgen focuses on a practice known as “ overfill . ”
Aranesp is often sold in one - dose vials .
Pharmaceutical industry standards require that drug makers include a small amount of medicine in excess of the prescribed dosage -- known as overfill -- in such vials , according to the suit .
However , the suit alleges that at least as far back as 2002 , Amgen manufactured Aranesp with overfills that were well above the recommended amounts .
According to the suit , the overfill allowed doctors , hospitals and other medical providers to bill their patients ’ insurers for medicine that the provider had essentially gotten free .

“ In offering the overfill inducement to medical providers , Amgen ’s sales force encouraged medical providers to administer higher doses of Aranesp to patients without any clinical need for that higher dose , ” the states allege .
Amgen prepared spreadsheets calculating potential revenue from overfill billings that the drug maker ’s sales reps could show to their clients during office visits , the lawsuit contends .
In the suit , one Amgen saleswoman alleges that she was trained “ how to show medical providers the overfill and other economic incentives without leaving any documentation behind . ”
The lawsuit describes alleged instances of New York healthcare facilities ’ submitting Medicaid reimbursement claims for Aranesp that were ineligible for payment because Amgen ’s alleged overfill practices violated the state ’s anti-kickback laws .
Between June 2005 and March 2008 , for example , a healthcare facility in New York City sought payment from the state ’s Medicaid program for at least 3,445 Aranesp treatments that included free overfills , according to the suit .
The program paid at least $ 1.3 million in reimbursements “ that were ineligible for payment , due to Amgen ’s inducement , ” the suit contends .
Advertisement
In another case , the lawsuit alleges that a nurse practitioner at a New York kidney - disease clinic who adopted the overfill billing practice was later paid $ 31,600 by Amgen over four years to promote Aranesp to other kidney specialists .
The states involved in the lawsuit accuse Amgen of violating a variety of state laws , including fraud , false claims and unjust - enrichment statutes .
The suit is seeking triple damages and civil penalties , which in some states amount to $ 10,000 per violation .

Moneybags Adelson financed the teabaggers & now is backing Charlie Crist against their hero Marco Rubio
“ We were very disappointed with Gov. Charlie Crist when he supported the stimulus , the bailout , and he appeared publicly with President Obama , ” said Everett Wilkinson , a South Florida - based organizer for Tea Party Patriots .
“ The opposition comes from Crist ’s support for the largest spending plan ever and the environmental policies he ’s pushing on the American people . ”
Rubio has already made appearances at Florida tea parties , and protesters have been seen waving signs declaring , “ Anybody but Charlie Crist . ”
He also has Armey ’s endorsement , and Armey headlined a Dallas fundraiser for him several weeks ago .
“ He has put a financial burden on my four children that will amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars each , ” Clowdus says of Conaway on his campaign website .
“ I think it was a bad , bad political decision , ” Armey said of the 34 Senate Republicans and 91 House Republicans who voted for the TARP bailout , “ and if you talk to grass - roots activists , it has become a political test for them . ”
The biggest funder of the Republican Party , sleazy Las Vegas gangster Sheldon Adelson , will be hosting a fundraiser for someone he sees as another prospective U.S. senator to do his bidding : Charlie Crist of Florida .
It 's somewhat ironic because Adelson underwrote the expenses of the teabagger movement -- as the sugar daddy of the Astroturf firm Freedom 's Watch ( to the tune of millions of dollars ) -- and the far right of that movement has just announced that they are targeting Crist for defeat .
The teabaggers announced yesterday that they will be turning their guns ( not literally we hope ) against mainstream conservatives like Crist in order to secure the nominations of far right extremists like Marco Rubio .
They want to remake the Republican Party more in their own image .
Deranged GOP has - been , Dick Armey , is rushing to the head of the parade , threatening Republicans who are n't deferential enough to the extremist elements he purports to lead .
The teabaggers are fully behind extreme right fringe candidate Marco Rubio who trails Crist in the polls .
And local teabagger organizations in other states are rushing to embrace lunatic fringe candidates who -- if nominated by the GOP -- are likely to guarantee the election of Democrats .
So far the teabaggers are pushing for unelectable candidates in Colorado , Connecticut , California .
They apparently got stumped when no one could find a state that started with " D , " but they are expected to find more states soon .
Teabaggers also talk about taking over local Republican Party organizations , especially in states that tend to go for secessionism and hard core extremism like South Carolina and Texas .
Teabaggers are already at war with South Carolina GOP incumbent Bob Inglis and their latest target is another conservative backbencher who they say slipped up , Texas kook Mike Conaway , who represents the heart of the Lonestar State , CD - 11 ( Odessa , Midland , San Angelo ) .
Conaway , like many Republicans voted for Bush 's TARP program , and a teabagger named Canyon Clowdus is challenging him in the GOP primary .
Other Republican
House members who voted for TARP on October 3 , 2008 include conservative stalwarts like Spencer Bachus ( R - AL ) , Roy Blunt ( R - MO , now running for the U.S. Senate ) , John Boehner ( R - OH ) , Mary Bono - Mack ( R - CA , another target of teabaggers ) , Ken Calvert ( R- CA ) , Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) , Mike Castle ( R - DE , now running for the U.S. Senate ) , Charlie Dent ( R - PA ) , David Dreier ( R- CA ) , Mary Fallin ( R - OK , now running for Oklahoma governor ) , Pete Hoekstra ( R - MI , now running for Michigan governor ) , Mark Kirk ( R - IL , now running for the U.S. Senate ) , John Kline ( R - MN , a radical teabagger himself ) , Jerry Lewis ( R - CA , widely considered the most corrupt member of Congress ) , Dan Lungren ( R- CA ) , Buck McKeon ( R- CA ) , Gary Miller ( R- CA ) , Mike Rogers ( R - AL ) , Hal Rogers ( R- KY ) , Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( R- FL ) , Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) , Mean Jean Schmidt ( R- OH ) , Pete Sessions ( R - TX ) , John Shadegg ( R - AZ ) , Mark Souder ( R- IN ) , Zach Wamp ( R - TN , now running for Tennessee governor ) , and Frank Wolf ( R - VA ) .
Among the Senate Republicans who voted for TARP and may now face the ire of teabaggers are Bob Bennett ( R - UT ) , Richard Burr ( R- NC ) , John Ensign ( R-NV ) , Chuck Grassley ( R- IA ) , Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - TX , now running for Texas governor ) , Johnny Isakson ( R- GA ) , John McCain ( R - AZ ) , Lisa Murkowski ( R - AK ) , Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , and John Thune ( R - ND ) .
Many of these Republicans are facing teabagger - supported extremists in the primaries .
One such challenge -- to Arlen Specter -- already caused a partisan fence jump .
And Bob Bennett is unlikely to win renomination in Utah .
In Florida Rubio is gaining momentum among right - wing activists and he could actually snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory for the GOP , beating Crist in the primary and then going down to a real drubbing in the general election against a middle of the road Democratic nonentity .

ALBANY , N.Y .  New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said Wednesday that he 's prohibiting the state 's $ 116.5 billion public worker pension fund from doing business with investment advisers who have made political contributions to the comptroller .
The executive order also would apply to donations to candidates running for comptroller .
DiNapoli's announcement is in advance of an expected ban by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on so - called pay - to - play donations .
" I 've met with the chair of the SEC to urge the implementation of a national ban on pay - to - play political contributions , but we do n't have to wait for the SEC to finalize its proposed rule , " DiNapoli said .
Actions in the comptroller 's office from before DiNapoli took office have been scrutinized in recent months .
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has been investigating private equity firms involved in corruption at the state 's public pension fund under DiNapoli 's predecessor .
The new ban applies for two years from the date of the contribution .
The New York State Common Retirement Fund has about 350,000 retirees and 650,000 active members .
It had $ 116.5 billion in assets at the close of its last quarter , down from the historic high of $ 154 billion in spring 2008 .
Many of the companies Cuomo investigated for their actions in an alleged pay - to - play scheme have paid restitution and are implementing reforms that the attorney general 's office developed .
Two ex-aides to former Comptroller Alan Hevesi are awaiting trial on charges that they instructed the companies to hire politically connected middlemen , known as placement agents , as a condition of doing business with the state .
Hevesi resigned in 2006 and was convicted of using staff for personal purposes .

( CNN ) -- Keith Felch is admittedly a big guy , but more than a few super - fit cyclists in Southern California have been left wondering how that dude just went flying by .
Keith Felch calls his electric bike a " hill eraser " because he can ride it to work without breaking a sweat .
And then his wife , Mary , comes motoring past .
" They stare , like how can a girl go past me , " she says , laughing .
It takes the other riders a few seconds but then they figure it out .
They have electric motors .
The Felches , who live in Aliso Viejo , California , used to drive everywhere , except when they used their bikes for recreation .
That changed when they got their new e-bikes , made by a company called Optibike .
Now , they ride to go shopping and to go to breakfast -- but mostly they ride to work .
Keith Felch says the couple has cut 50 percent of their car - use since they started electric biking .
And there are other benefits .
Keith Felch dropped 30 pounds and his blood pressure fell 10 points in the first six months he owned the bike , he says .
The Felches do n't exactly classify themselves as " environmentalists , " although Mary said it is important to have a positive effect on the planet .
" I learned that the worst amount of smog that you put out [ in an automobile ] is in the first mile , so if we can make even some of those shorter trips on our bicycles , it makes a big difference , " she says .
Who wants one ?
Brent Meyers , director of sales for Ultra Motor US , says electric bikes attract different types of buyers .
Many are looking to make a green imprint .
Some are " active adults " who have ridden bicycles for years who -- as they get older -- are unable to do the same kind of riding they did when they were young .
Other buyers want to ride their bikes to work quickly -- and avoid a sweaty entrance into the office .
Oddly -- or perhaps not -- Ultra Motor US sees its strongest sales when the price of oil skyrockets , says Meyers .
Two wheels , a motor and 100 million riders
Electric bikes are still somewhat of a novelty in the United States , but in China they 're everywhere .
In fact , Chinese electric bikes number more than 100 million -- which is about four times the number of Chinese private cars , according to Electric Bikes Worldwide Reports .
The bikes are popular in Europe as well .
Sales figures for the United States are hard to pinpoint .
In the United States , about 200,000 electric bicycles were sold last year , said Ed Benjamin of the Light Electric Vehicle Association -- about twice the number sold in 2005 .
But the industry has hit a bump in the road from the recession , as sales were down about 10 percent in 2009 , he said .
E - bikes are mostly made by specialty companies , but the growing sales trend has been noticed by the big boys .
Trek , a worldwide leader in bike sales , has been making electric bikes for three years , but only introduced them in the United States in the past year .
Other well - known companies like Schwinn and Giant are increasing their presence in the e-bike field .
At Interbike , the biggest bicycle industry convention in the United States , there were more than 20 companies displaying e-bikes this year .
Meyers said only a few years ago , it was about five .
Prices range from a few hundred dollars -- the E - Zip Trailz Hybrid costs $ 398 at Wal - Mart -- to more than $ 13,000 for OptiBike 's top - end model .
Prices increase as battery technology and components get better .
Steve Roseman of The Electric Bike Network in San Francisco , California , said most buyers he sees do n't balk at the price , which can be as much as a good road or mountain bike .
They are mostly concerned with how far they can go on a battery charge and how fast .
What 's an ' e - bike ' ?
By law , electric bikes must have no more than 1 horsepower and go no faster than 20 mph ( on motor power alone ) .
Basically they are much like traditional bicycles with small motors that power the bike or assist a rider with pedaling .
Many have gears like a regular bike .
" It 's just adding the throttle aspect , other than that it handles like a regular bicycle , " Keith Felch said .
He says he uses the throttle all the time , choosing one of two modes -- eco [ half power ] or fast [ full power ] .
He says he once tried a regular bike for his 4 ½- mile ride to one of his music studios where he teaches jazz improvisation .
But the hills nearly got him .
He calls his electric bike a " hill eraser . "
It also makes the ride to his farthest studio -- 22 miles away -- seem much closer .
He says he gets about 35 miles on his primary battery and has an additional one for long rides .
Shifting views
But as they tout the virtues of electric bikes , advocates also realize that there will have to be a shift in the way Americans view them before they become as popular as they are in Europe or China .
" There are two possible sides to the equation , " Roseman said .
" One would be a change in the way people view transportation .
There are still a lot of SUVs out there .
...
People still have a hard time thinking about riding a bicycle unless they are 10 years old , it seems .
So there needs to be a little shift in mentality . "
" But having said that , I think there is a growing awareness about health and transportation and environmental issues so it could be that we are just reaching a juncture where things will change [ for e-bikes ] . "
Meyers says people also have a preconceived notion about electric bikes .
Some view them as expensive or poor quality or uncomfortable .
And Meyers admits , e- bikes are not for everybody .
As Roseman says , people who live in Spandex will probably always prefer a really good road bike and hard - core city cyclists may well stick to their fixed - gear bikes .
Meyers says Ultra , which sells its bike for $ 2,700 , is n't for those kinds of people .
" That 's not our customer , " he says .
" Our customer is someone who wants some form of electric transportation , green transportation , that can get them from Point A to Point B comfortably . "
The Felches say taking a test drive will change a skeptic 's attitude .
" If you ride one , it will blow your mind , " Keith Felch says .
" When you get on one it 's like being in a flying dream you 've had .
It 's like everything you 've dreamed your bicycle should do in your wildest dreams -- it 's doing it . "

What To Do When You ’re Drunk ?
Tired of never having anything to do when you ’re drunk ?
It seems that most of us resort to the same intoxicated pass times : beer pong , card games and socializing with others .
While these activities are certainly fun , it seems that new and original drunken experiences can be hard to come by .
In fact , having a unique and fun time while drunk is n’t very hard , you just have to use your imagination .
Today , we explore fifteen fun and easy things to do when you ’re drunk .
Try some out the next time you crack open your favorite bottle .
1. Breaking Stuff
Breaking stuff can be a great outlet for aggression and child - like fun when you ’re drunk .
The more ridiculous the stuff you ’re breaking , the more fun it usually is .
Electronics are always extra-enjoyable .
Try to get your hands on some old computers or TV sets that have n’t been used in ages .
Once you ’re good and hammered , haul off and bust them apart however you desire .
Try throwing them off high places or swinging a baseball bat at them .
The first crunch your bat makes through the screen is always satisfying .
If you ca n’t find old electronics or furniture or anything like that , try smaller items .
Something as simple as smashing glass bottles on an ally - way can be a blast when you ’re loaded .
2. Yell At People ( Especially Strangers )
One of alcohol ’s most beloved ( and also most regretted ) side effects is lowered inhibition .
Simply put , you do n’t care to stop and think about what you ’re doing before you do it .
For this reason , yelling at complete strangers is a ton of fun .
The best way to go about this is to convince a sober friend to drive you and your drunk buddies around town .
When you see people walking on the sidewalk , just lean out the window and scream at them .
What you scream at them is entirely up to you .
Insults tend to be the most fun when drunk , but almost anything that comes to mind will do .
If you ca n’t find a sober friend to drive you around , you might try screaming at people outside the bar you ’re hanging out at .
This can be fun too , but you ’ll have to censor yourself a bit unless you want to get into a fight .
3. Sing and Dance
Let ’s face it , karaoke would have never caught on if it were n’t for drunk people trying to have a good time .
Loud music and alcohol seem to go hand in hand and , for as long as brew has been consumed , people have sung and danced after a few drinks .
One of the most fun things about karaoke nights at bars is that you do n’t have to worry about being a great singer .
You can actually be considerably off key as long as you give a good performance .
If you pick a song everyone knows and dance around like you ’re really into it , you ’ll have the whole bar dancing and singing along in no time !
When you ’re drunk though , you do n’t even need a bar and a karaoke machine and a crowd of fellow drinkers .
A stereo with your favorite CDs , a car radio , an Ipod or even a live concert are perfect ways to dance around like a crazy person and sing your lungs out .
4. Ride Bumper Cars
With most amusement parks serving alcohol these days , the question of what to ride after you ’ve had a bunch of beer often gets raised .
Roller coasters seem tempting , but the fear of throwing up makes them look unappealing .
Spinning rides are off limits , and free falls make your stomach rise to your chest .
Bumper cars , on the other hand , are the perfect drunk ride .
Bumper cars allows you and your buddies to recklessly smash into each other with little cars , shoving one another into the wall and racing around a track at speeds that feel much faster than they actually are .
The best part of it is , you can do all this without much danger to personal safety .
This is an activity which is best performed with a large group of friends .
You do n’t wanna be the one crazy adult in a bumper car slamming into little kids like a drunken maniac .
On the other hand , if you and six of your friends commandeer the track , it will be an experience to talk about for a long time .
5. Play Competitive Video Games
From the old days of whiskey fueled poker to the modern frat house sponsored beer pong tournaments , drinking seems to go hand in hand with friendly competition .
Video games can be a great outlet for this alcohol induced spirit .
Get a few buddies of yours around a bottle of something strong and an Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 and let the good times roll .
Before your know it you ’ll be shoving , cussing , cheering and screaming at your friends about “ who ’s the f*cking man ” and making sure they all recognize you as their daddy .
The best games for such a night are those which pit all players against each other , such as Mortal Kombat , Golden Eye , Rainbow Six , or Street Fighter .
Games in which your friends pick teams , such as all the popular sports games , can be excellent choices too .
6. Try To Meet New Chicks / Dudes
Alcohol has made the chase of the opposite sex infinitely more fun since the day the first village of people received the first barrel of wine .
Whether you prefer a loud and pumping night club or a smaller , more relaxed bar , mingling is always easier with some liquid courage running through your veins .
The next time you plan to go out with friends , dress your best and spray yourself down with your favorite scent .
From there it ’s simply a matter of picking out other good looking people , and let the alcohol calm your nerves enough to go over and chat with them .
Before long , you ’ll no doubt be having some cool conversations with other cool people , and you might even get lucky and score a phone number or two .
7. Go Swimming
This is certainly one of the more dangerous drinking activities , yet under the right conditions it can be a great time .
Drunk swimming feels awesome because the weightless sensation that water usually produces is amplified .
The relaxing properties of swimming are also heightened when you are drunk .
Of course , the risk of drowning is also greater , so do n’t drunk dive alone .
Always have a sober friend around in case you get into any trouble .
The best place to swim drunk is a heated personal pool .
The ocean can be more dangerous because of its greater depth , sea animals , and unpredictable currents and waves .
A soothing pool or hot tub can do wonders for the senses after consuming some adult beverages , and are generally much more controllable and thus less dangerous .
8. Go On Swings
As a kid , swings were some of the most fought over and cherished playground amusements .
Many of us have never sat on a swing much past sixth or seventh grade , but that no longer need be the case .
Swinging while drunk can be some of the most fun you can have , and it does n’t even cost a dime .
This activity is not for those prone to motion sickness , as the back and forth motion may aggravate the stomach .
Those who do not get motion sickness , though , will experience a sweet head rush and the sensation of flying while drunk swinging .
This can be a great way to pass the time while talking to a fellow drunken friend or simply listening to your MP3 player alone .
Just do n’t try jumping off like you did when you were younger !
You will land off balance and uncoordinated , resulting in a broken limb or busted head .
Keep it on the swing .
9. Go to See An Action Movie
If you have a high amount of testosterone in your blood , you know how exciting a big Hollywood action movie can be .
All too often though , we find that the story lines and writing in such movies are atrocious , and the multi-million dollar explosions , fight scenes , car chases and other special effects rarely make up for the intelligence insulting writing .
That is why these movies are often best viewed drunk , and on the big screen .
Hopped up on booze , you rarely care about the stupid dialogue and instead become enthralled and amazed by the massive special effects you are viewing .
The best plan is to pick an insane action movie , the biggest one out at the moment , and plan a night for you and your friends to go see it .
Pick a theater with a built in bar , or at least that has one one located in walking distance .
If these are not available , pick a designated driver and buy a bottle of your favorite spirits .
Kill the bottle between your friends ( excluding the driver , of course ) and head over to the theater .
Try and sit relatively close , as everything will look so much more epic the bigger the screen is .
10 . Smoke a Hookah
A Hookah is a rather large middle eastern smoking apparatus used for exotic and uniquely flavored tobacco variants .
In many middle eastern cultures , the smoking of a hookah is a social tradition between friends or families .
Hookah smoke is far less harsh than cigarette smoke , and tastes distinctly of fruit rather than tobacco .
The proper enjoyment of a hookah usually takes between 30 - 45 minutes , and results in a relaxed body and clear mind .
Most cities have “ hookah bars , ” or small pubs where hookahs are available at hourly rates .
Hookah smoke tastes great with the flavor of many brown spirits or dark beers , and the dual relaxing effect of the alcohol and hookah will put you in a state of relaxation that can best be described as Zen .
Check your local listings for such bars , it might just become a regular , therapeutic part of your week .
11 . Eat a Huge Meal
After a long night of downing booze nothing hits the spot like a big , hot meal .
Many people choose to go out to a diner or late night restaurant for such a meal .
This is convenient because the last thing you want to be doing while sloshed is firing up a grill or a stove and attempting to make food .
Serious burns or knife cuts easily follow from this .
Stick with the restaurant , and try to find a place close to the bar or club you usually party at .
This can be a great way for you and your friends to kill time while sobering up , and any place open late near a bar is used to serving drunk people , so you can be sure you wo n’t be disturbing anyone .
12 . Jump In a Moon - Bounce
One absolutely wild way to have a good time while drinking is to rent a massive moon bounce for your next party .
You may think the moon bounce is just for kids , but you might be surprised to see how large these things come nowadays .
The moon bounce is a far safer alternative to a trampoline , which has caused many a broken leg for drunk jumpers in the past .
The nice thing about the moon - bounce is that it is enclosed , and even the walls and ceiling are either inflatable cushion or mesh netting .
This way , if things get rowdy and people start throwing each other around a bit , or you loose your balance while showing off your sweet front flip , you are quite well protected against injury .
Moon bounce jumping can provide endless amounts of juvenile fun for dizzied adults as long as safety is taken into consideration .
13 . Get Thrown
Out of a Public Place
Either by excessive PDA with your significant other , problems with a group of people in attendance , or just due to over - all excessive rowdiness , never will you feel more righteous than when you and your friends are thrown our of a public place drunk .
Pointing with indigent fury and screaming about how “ this is bullsh *t ” and how “ you do n’t have to take this ” while your friends hold you back and drag you out of a place can make you feel like someone to be reckoned with .
As long as you do n’t do anything to get yourself arrested , being asked to leave a place for drunken conduct , creating a huge scene upon leaving , almost always provides some great laughs and cheap thrills for a night of debauchery .
14 . Calling Friends
The all too common “ drunk dial ” is great way to pass the time while standing outside your favorite bar or just sitting around your house after drinking a bunch of beer .
Who should you call , you might wonder .
The best bet is to call other close friends who are either themselves out having a wild night or would otherwise find it funny that you ’re calling them tanked .
Do n’t worry about what you ’ll say , generally once they pick up hilarious conversation will just naturally flow .
If they do n’t answer , leave them a message .
It is always hysterical ( and sometimes embarrassing ) when your friend lets you listen to the drunken message the next day .
Whatever you do , do n’t make the mistake of calling a longed for ex-lover or straitlaced co-worker or boss .
These are fatal mistakes that will come back to haunt you the minute you take off your beer - goggles .
On the other side , there are hotlines for those struggling with drinking problems , which will be your favourite number if you continue with hard drinking .
🙂
15 . Make Some Art
If you find yourself four to the floor and all alone , it can quite entertaining to practice your favorite art .
If you play an instrument , jam out .
If you ’re a painter , break out your canvas and have at it .
If instead you prefer digital art , load up Photoshop and go to town , and if you ’re a writer , try and crank out a short story .
Not only can you sometimes find inspiration drunk that you might not have had sober , it also ensures a fun time checking out what you did when you sober up .
Art is all about expressions , and some of the most influential cultural pieces were created by someone just as blasted as you .

The first Miss Cougar America did not cry , muss her mascara , carry a bouquet of roses or wear a crown .
Miss Cougar America , Gloria Navarro , 42 , of Redwood City , proudly accepted her title before more than 200 guests , most of them men in their 20s , 30s and 40s , at Dinah 's Hotel in Palo Alto on Friday .
She said she was proud to represent a new breed of woman : empowered , secure and willing to break boundaries .
" It 's a new beginning for me , " said the suburban management consultant , married for 20 years , recently divorced and ready for something - or someone - new .
" I went from soccer mom with short hair , flat - heeled shoes and fanny packs to cougar .
I believe every woman has a cougar in them - someone who does n't need a man for anything other than companionship . "
The contest was part of the first - ever National Cougar Convention produced by Rich Gosse and the Society of Professional Singles , billed as the largest singles organization in the world .
The 250 available tickets sold out two days before the event .
The evening , which included a keynote address by Internet radio host and author Francesca Gentille and her boyfriend , Tahil Gesyuk , 14 years younger , drew a racially diverse crowd of men and women who came from as near as Stanford University and as far as London , looking for love , or at least an adventure .
The party included three hours of dancing , drinks and booths filled with items ranging from " Cougar Kits " to " Cougar kitty " T - shirts for $ 20 sold by Becky Aguilar of Mountain View , recently divorced and looking for fun , but not necessarily younger men , she said .
Miss Cougar America was selected by a vote of the men in attendance .
Watching from a distance was hotel guest Mark Friedman , 45 , of Boston , in town for a wedding .
" I 've never seen so many useless 20 - year - olds in my life , " he said .
" This is a uniquely American phenomenon . "
Apparently not .
Two female guests , Birgita Cameron and Rita Sangha , flew in from London for the event .
Sangha runs a
Web site for women who are attracted to young men and Cameron was a runner - up in the Miss Cougar America contest .
Sandy Miller , 35 , a former administrative assistant from San Jose , and Jenny Lane , 41 , a dog sitter from Cupertino , had mixed feelings about the party .
They had gone to a professional singles mixer in San Francisco earlier this year sponsored by the Society of Professional Singles and were on Gosse 's mailing list and decided to give the Cougar Convention a try .
" We 're getting walked past by guys going for women in their 60s , " Lane said .
" I guess we should have known , " Miller said .
" It 's a little like prom without a date , or a bad wedding . "
Ricky Rivas , 24 , a radio ad salesman from the South Bay , was more prosaic .
" Older women and younger men ?
It does n't matter nowadays - we 're past that barrier .
It matters what you bring to the table , " he said .
" Look at Sotomayor , Condoleezza Rice , Hillary Clinton , pushing the boundaries in the working world .
The Bay Area is the perfect place for this .
The Bay Area has lots of transplants , people looking for the perfect storm of opportunities , if you will .
Women are more empowered here . "

George Smoot on last Friday 's " Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader ? "
Unfortunately for host Jeff Foxworthy 's humor routine , which is usually based on insulting his guests , Smoot sailed through questions on the angles of an equilateral triangle and whether the conga was a percussion instrument .
The show 's writers tried to inject some tension with a fifth - grade astronomy query : " What country was the first to put a human being in space ? "
Smoot quickly remembered the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin , but Foxworthy stumped him on the year — 1961 .
That proved to be the Foxworthy 's only opportunity to poke fun at the Nobel laureate .
Part of game play is cribbing answers from the show 's stable of adorable , TV - ready ten - year - olds .
So the fifth graders began to look decidedly pouty as Smoot answered question after question unaided .
Finally , apparently realizing that he was taking all the fun out of the show , Smoot decided to " cheat " by blindly " copying " the on - stage ten - year - old 's answer to the $ 500,000 question .
This is by far the riskiest move a contestant can make , and Smoot clearly knew the answer to the question .
Luckily , he was n't punished for his good sportsmanship ; ten - year - old Francesca answered the question correctly , and Smoot went on to be the show 's second - ever million - dollar winner by correctly answering the question " What US state is home to Acadia National Park " — it 's Maine .
Smoot flirted with the small screen earlier this year with a cameo on nerdtastic sitcom " The Big Bang Theory . "
Not only was it nice to see someone actually win " 5th Grader " for a change — other episodes end on a rather more embarrassing note — but it was wonderful for an important modern physicist to enter the American consciousness and crack a few redneck jokes about himself while he was at it .
The audience oohed and aahed when he pulled out his Nobel medal , and Smoot even got to say a word about his research .
FOXWORTHY : " So , how does a guy go about proving the Big Bang theory ?
" SMOOT : " We figured out over the years a way to make a picture of the embryo universe .
"
FOXWORTHY : " Oh , wow .
" SMOOT : " So it 's the very beginning of the universe , but it 's got the blueprint for what 's gonna happen later .
" Foxworthy then cut in , joking , " You found the infant uni ... I can't even find my keys half the time ! "
Thanks , Jeff .
Still , one of the most exciting advances in cosmology made it onto primetime television , even for just a few seconds .
And well done explaining it , Dr. Smoot .
What Smoot described as finding " the embryo universe " provided crucial evidence for the big bang , transformed cosmology from a theoretical to a decidedly experimental science , and earned him half the Nobel .
In 1989 , Smoot and colleague John Mather ( he 's got the other half ) launched the Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer satellite , which goes by the cute name COBE , to take detailed measurements of the cosmic microwave background .
" We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study , and that 's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine , in a certain sense , " Smoot explained in a talk he gave at a design conference last November .
Because the universe is so vast and light has a 300 million meter per second speed limit , it can take equally vast amounts of time for light from other galaxies .
Light is a snapshot of a place as it looked when the light left it , whether that be eight minutes ago or millions of years ago .
The cosmic microwave background , or CMB , is the oldest light in the universe , an approximately 2.7 Kelvin bath of microwaves coming to us from just 380,000 years after the Big Bang .
It is a snapshot of the universe in its infancy , " when the universe was hot and dense and very different , " as Smoot says , and the farthest back our time machine can take us .
The picture below , from one of Smoot 's slides , shows a series of nested spheres with the Milky Way in the center .
The outer boundary of what we can see , that strange Jackson Pollock of rainbow speckles , is the CMB .
" You see the whole big picture ? "
Smoot asked his audience .
" The beginning of time is funny — it 's on the outside , right ?
" The speckles on the CMB map are really the tiniest of wrinkles , differences of one part in 100,000 .
The CMB was first detected in 1965 when a pair of scientists could n't get rid of some noise in a radio receiver .
It matched the Bing Bang theory ; when the hot , dense universe expanded , it cooled , filling the universe with remnant heat — the CMB .
But for years after that , scientists thought the CMB was completely uniform .
It turned out that the CMB was more like an abstract painting that 's just one color .
You have to look very closely to see the bumps and texture of the paint brush , and that 's just what Smoot and Mather did with COBE .
From these tiny wrinkles , Smoot explained , " we 're going to go .. to these irregular galaxies and first stars to these more advanced galaxies , and eventually the solar system , and so forth . "
So " embryo " is precisely the right word — the hot dense universe folds in itself the irregularities that grew up into the grand structures of stars and galaxies as we know them today .
" The wrinkles allowed Smoot and Mather to measure the intensity of the different wavelengths within the CMB .
Mapping intensity versus wavelength , the researchers created a curve that matched exactly the predictions of the Big Bang theory — another experimental pillar supporting the theory .
Since COBE , experimental cosmology has grown into an exciting field of its own , with projects ranging from balloons at the edge of space to the the South Pole Telescope to the Planck space telescope , the successor to COBE and later CMB observer WMAP .
You can see the improved resolution from COBE to WMAP in the following picture ; the images of the world are for comparison to show the kinds of details that COBE smooths out .
Planck , orbiting around Lagrange point 2 has just seen first light and will map the early universe in greater detail than either COBE or WMAP .
This would have been too long a story for primetime television , but I 'm still happy that Smoot managed to shoehorn a sense of science and wonder into the episode .
However , I 'm still left wondering why George Smoot , who donated his Nobel prize money to establish fellowships , needs a million bucks .
Earlier this year , Maj. Gen. Richard Formica , who oversees the training of the Afghan security forces , spoke to me about the difficulties of creating an army in a country where only one in four adults is literate .
“ What percentage of police recruits can read ? ” Formica asked when we met at his headquarters in Kabul .
“ When I was down in Helmand , where the Brits were training police officers , they said not only could none of them read but they did n’t understand what a classroom was .
How can you train officers if they ca n’t write arrest reports ? ”
Perhaps McChrystal ’s most intriguing idea is his belief that he can persuade large numbers of Taliban to change sides .
Coaxing insurgents back into the fold was , after all , one key to pulling Iraq back from the brink of apocalypse .
Beginning in late 2006 , tens of thousands of Sunni tribesmen , many of them former insurgents , agreed to stop fighting and to come onto the payroll , usually as policemen .
Almost overnight , the Iraqi insurgency was reduced to Al Qaeda fanatics and a handful of others who could be targeted by McChrystal ’s commandos in JSOC .
This shaky — very shaky — arrangement is still keeping what peace there is in Iraq today .
McChrystal says he intends to begin a similar effort in Afghanistan .
The idea , he said , would not be to try to flip the Taliban ’s leaders — that ’s not likely — but rather its foot soldiers .
The premise of the program , McChrystal says , is that most of the Taliban ’s fighters are not especially committed ideologically and could be brought into society with promises of jobs and protection .
“ I ’d like to go pretty high up , ” McChrystal said , referring to the Taliban ’s hierarchy .
“ It could be people who are commanders with significant numbers of troops .
I think they can be given the opportunity to come in . ”
The effort , McChrystal said , is based on his own reading of the Taliban and of Pashtun culture : most of the people fighting the United States , he argued , are motivated by local and personal grievances .
They want more of a voice in local governance , for instance , or they want jobs .
“ Historically , the Pashtuns are very practical people , ” McChrystal told me .
“ Pashtun culture adjudicates disagreements in a way that mitigates blood feuds .
The Pashtun people go out of their way not to do things that cause permanent feuds .
They have always been willing to change positions , change sides .
I do n’t think much of the Taliban are ideologically driven ; I think they are practically driven .
I ’m not sure they would n’t flip to our side . ”
To help him achieve this , McChrystal recruited his old friend Graeme Lamb , who played a similar role in Iraq .
The trick in Iraq , Lamb said , was timing : by late 2006 , many Iraqis , even the insurgents , had grown tired of fighting .
“ What we did in Iraq in mid-2006 — had we tried to do it in mid-2004 , it would have crashed and burned , ” Lamb told me .
“ Because at the end of the day , people had n’t exercised their revenge .
They had n’t stood at the edge of the abyss and looked into it . ”
Lamb said the time may have arrived for something similar in Afghanistan , if only because everyone is exhausted by so much war .
“ Now is a good time , ” he said , “ because people are very serious on all sides . ”
The reconciliation plan might end up bringing into the fold some disreputable characters , but neither Lamb nor McChrystal has much of a problem with that .
“ In my view , ” McChrystal said of the insurgents , “ their past is not important .
Some people say , ‘ Well , they have blood on their hands . ’
I ’d say , ‘ So do a lot of people . ’
I think we focus on future behavior .
They can enter the political process if they want to . ”
Stem cells in umbilical cord blood have been used to treat blood disease A clampdown on unproven and potentially unsafe stem cell research is being called for by an expert group .
Bionet , a group of expert Chinese and European doctors , lawyers and bioethicists , says countries throughout the world must develop more effective regulation for this emerging science .
They say desperate patients are being subjected to a huge amount of hype when they travel abroad for treatments .
The only way to counter that is through proper clinical trials , they say .
Professor Nicholas Rose , from the London School of Economics , who led the group , said Bionet 's team had talked to physicians in China and Europe because China had now overtaken India as the place where pharmaceutical companies were carrying out most of their trials .
They had provided a wealth of anecdotal evidence about their concerns that stem cell research was being moved too rapidly into clinical practice without proper study .
He said : " The key is informed consent .
Doctors should be able to tell the patient about the short - term and long - term prognosis and the things we do n't know about the risks . "
Recommendations Bionet is recommending that the safety and efficiency of stem cell treatments is investigated through state - of - the - art clinical trials before they are offered to patients .
It also says doctors should be honest about the conditions under which germ cells , embryos or embryonic tissue has been collected .
It also recommends that they should only be imported and used for research if they were collected under conditions which are either similar or equivalent to those in the receiving country .
Brian MacNeill who went to China twice for stem cell treatments
Nobody should be coerced by unfavourable circumstances or by being dependent on someone to donate cells or tissue for research , banking or treatment purposes , Bionet says .
And there should be quality standards for stem cells used in clinical practice .
These should include the bacterial and viral contamination applied during the production of the stem cells .
China introduced new regulations in May calling for clinical trials before stem cell treatments were offered to patients .
Professor Qui Renzong , vice - president of the ethics committee at the Chinese Ministry of Health , said : " In China there are about 150 institutions now providing stem cell therapy for diabetes through to spinal injuries . "
Foreign patients were paying an average of $ 25,000 ( £ 15,434 ) he said but since the regulations were only recently introduced there was no way of knowing how many foreigners had made trips to China for treatments .
Patient 's visits
One patient who did go to China is 39 - year - old Brian MacNeill , from Argyll , on the west coast of Scotland .
He sufferers from hereditary ataxia , a muscle - wasting neurodegenerative disease .
Mr MacNeill said : " All I can say about the treatment I had with stem cells in China was that I felt a great benefit after the first lot of four injections , with lots of therapy as well , and good benefit from my second visit about one year later .
" The second visit was needed as I felt some of my symptoms come back after 10 months and now the second visit has lasted around 14 months .
" I now am feeling symptoms come back but cannot afford to go for more stem cells .
If I could I would .
" It 's better to feel good now when you have an illness than be somebody very unhappy and ill anyway without even trying . "
A Department of Health spokesperson said : " Any new therapy or treatment requires carefully controlled and evaluated clinical research before it can be considered safe and effective .
" In the UK , there is strict regulation to ensure that vulnerable patients are not exploited or put at risk .
" When stem cell ' treatments ' are based overseas , regulatory oversight and jurisdiction is particularly problematic .
" We take this very seriously and strongly encourage anyone considering participating in overseas stem cell ' research trials ' or buying internet treatments to talk to their doctor and follow health guidelines . "

John Harwood lets one slip on MSNBC and tells the truth about these people fear mongering over the President speaking to school children next week .
Novotny : John , what about this controversy over opposition to Obama 's speech to school children ?
Harwood : I 've got to tell you Monica , I 've been watching politics for a long time and this is , this one is really over the top .
What it shows you is there are a lot of cynical people who try to fan controversy and let 's face it , in a country of three hundred million people there are a lot of stupid people too , because if you believe that 's it 's somehow unhealthy for kids for the President to say work hard and stay in school , you 're stupid .
Novotny : Ouch .
Harwood :
In fact , I 'm worried for some of those kids , I 'm worried for some of those kids of those parents who are upset .
I 'm not sure they 're smart enough to raise those kids .

To combat the financial crisis set off by the collapse of the housing bubble , the Federal Reserve Board has lent out more than $ 2tn through various special lending facilities .
While the Fed discloses aggregate information on the loans made through each of the facilities , it will not disclose how much money it lent to specific banks or under what terms .
By contrast , the Treasury puts this information about its $ 700 bn TARP bailout up on its website .
Partly in response to this huge increase in the Fed 's power ( its secret lending is equal to two - thirds of the federal budget ) , more than 270 representatives in Congress have co-sponsored a bill that would have the Government Accountability Office audit the Fed .
In principle , this audit would examine the Fed 's loans and report back to the relevant congressional committees , which could decide to make this information public .
Most people might consider it perfectly reasonable to have Congress 's auditing arm review what the Fed has done with $ 2tn of the taxpayers ' money to ensure that everything is proper .
After all , we would n't let other government agencies spend one millionth of this amount ( $ 2 m ) without some sort of record that could be verified .
However , the Fed and its chairman Ben Bernanke , do not see it this way .
Bernanke warned Congress last month that such an audit could jeopardise the Fed 's independence , which in turn , " could raise fears about future inflation , leading to higher long - term interest rates and reduced economic and financial stability " .
OK , Bernanke warned Congress that if the Fed had less independence , it could lead to " reduced economic and financial stability . "
We have just been through a year in which the Great Depression was a more frequent topic of conversation than the Superbowl , World Series , and Oscars combined .
In fact , Bernanke is given credit for preventing another Great Depression .
The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting that unemployment will average in the double digits throughout 2010 and it will not be until 2014 that the unemployment rate falls back to its normal level .
Did Bernanke forget about the current state of the economy and the financial collapse that he was frantically trying to head off when he warned Congress that if the Fed were less independent , it could lead to " reduced economic and financial stability " ?
After all , how do you get less economic and financial stability than the Great Depression ?
This is not the first time that Bernanke 's memory appears to have failed him when addressing Congress about an important policy issue .
Last September , when he was telling Congress that the economy would collapse if it did not approve the $ 700 bn TARP bailout , he warned that the commercial paper market was shutting down .
This was hugely important because most major companies rely on selling commercial paper to meet their payrolls and pay other routine bills .
If they could not sell commercial paper , then millions of people would soon be laid off and the economy would collapse .
What Bernanke apparently forgot to tell Congress is that the Fed has the authority to directly buy commercial paper from financial and non-financial companies .
In other words , the Fed has the power to prevent the sort of economic collapse that Bernanke warned would happen if Congress did not quickly approve the TARP .
In fact , Bernanke announced that the Fed would create a special lending facility to buy commercial paper the weekend after Congress voted to approve the TARP .
Bernanke has taken extraordinary measures in the last year that have been successful in preventing a much worse downturn .
Nonetheless , Congress should not forget that it was incredible mismanagement by Bernanke and his predecessor Alan Greenspan that brought about this disaster in the first place .
If Bernanke is approved for another term , as seems likely , Congress should not hesitate to use more oversight than it did in past years .
And , it certainly should not let the Fed send $ 2tn out the door without a verifiable paper trail .
Given the track record for Bernanke 's version of bank independence , it is hard to imagine that greater congressional oversight would lead to worse outcomes .

The Max Baucus Society for Creative Procrastination , aka the Senate Finance Committee , finally moves this morning on its final votes on the health insurance reform bill .
Three months later and five steps back from where everybody else who 's touched the bill ended up .
Important !
Serious !
When we last left our heroes , they were working with a committee divided 13 - 10 in favor of Democrats , with nine certain " no " votes from Republicans , and two question marks for Senators Wyden ( D - OR ) and Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , who are unhappy enough with the committee product to let it be known in the press that they 're unhappy .
Among Republicans , of course , only Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) is even remotely entertaining the idea of voting in favor of the bill .
The Hill reminds us this morning of what 's happening behind the scenes , and what 's likely to come of it :
If more than one of those three senators joins the panel ’s Republicans and votes against the bill , healthcare reform would suffer a tough blow on Tuesday and might not recover .
It ’s likely Baucus will have the votes .
Committee chairmen generally do n’t schedule a vote they wo n’t win , and at least two of the three senators are likely to make a leap Tuesday in the hope the bill will improve as it moves forward .
The fact that critics of the Baucus bill such as Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) are already strategizing for the floor debate is a strong indication that Baucus will have the support he needs on Tuesday .
That 's the basic reality .
Chairmen , like floor leaders , generally do n't schedule a vote they wo n't win .
Or at least do n't know the outcome of ahead of time .
And yes , Senators are already strategizing for the floor debate .
But that strategizing could , and in fact must , go ahead no matter what the outcome of the committee vote .
In fact , the outcome matters very little , since whatever is produced in the so - called " merging " process will come to the floor under Rule XIV .
In that sense , whether the Finance committee reports a bill out or not makes no difference , except for perception 's sake .
And frankly , I 'm not so sure the perception 's such a bad one .
Given that the process can move ahead regardless of the outcome of the vote , now's as good a time as any to signal disapproval both of the bill 's direction , and the ridiculous process that brought us here .
A failed vote does not in fact delay this process , which by all reports is already well underway .
But it could severely undercut Baucus ' claim to a leadership role in the subsequent process ( not to mention his designs on clean energy and climate change legislation ) , which I think would be a capital idea .

A new study from Cincinnati Children ’s Hospital Medical Center is a good indicator of just how poorly conceived drug policy in America is .
MSNBC has the AP article here .
From the article :
In the study , researchers from Cincinnati Children ’s Hospital Medical Center evaluated 1998 - 2005 data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers .
During that time , nationwide calls related to teen abuse of ADHD drugs , specifically stimulants , increased from 330 to 581 yearly , and there were four deaths .
Overall , 42 percent of teens involved had moderate to severe side - effects and most ended up getting emergency - room treatment .
My daughter has fairly intensive ADHD .
Adopting a regimen involving Concerta in the morning and Ritalin in the afternoon meant the difference between passing and failing 9th grade .
I resisted medicating her for years , and when it was clear that she was making less and less progress in school and in social relationships , I relented .
I believe it was the right decision .
Her grades went up , she made some friends she could keep , and so long as she took her medication , she stayed on a stable course .
Another reason I decided to put her on medication was based on a study done some years ago that linked ADHD with increased probability of drug abuse and other risky behaviors .
It is n’t surprising that kids who are predisposed toward risky behavior and drug abuse will abuse drugs that are handed to them a month ’s worth at a time .
What is surprising is that despite all of the evidence that ADHD medication can and does kill children , and despite all the evidence that ADHD medication can and does lead children to abuse these drugs , Ritalin is legal and Marijuana is not .
While Marijuana has yet to claim an overdose victim , there were 4 deaths from ADHD drug abuse in the study .
Imagine a freer America where Marijuana is controlled to the same degree that ADHD medicine is controlled .
In addition to the personal liberty we would enjoy , and the drastically reduced cost of incarcerating those who deal in the substance , we would perhaps see a similar study showing Marijuana abuse , only this time it would not include the deaths of children .
A Conservative who believes it is permissible to make ADHD medication available to children despite the chance of abuse and death , yet believes it is impermissible to make Marijuana available to adults is no Conservative at all .
Conservatives , after all , deal in reality .
Democratic Congressman Barney Frank has recently introduced yet another bill attempting to adjust drug policy to obvious reality .
Conservative Republicans should be the ones introducing this bill , if they want any credibility with those of us who would see drug policy determined by the facts , and not ideology .
Ritalin is not going away , and neither is Marijuana .
One kills , and the other does not .
This is the reality .

The models of Marvel are heading back to comics in the upcoming miniseries " Models Inc. , " where " Project Runway " style consultant Tim Gunn is forced to don an Iron Man suit to defend a fashion exhibit from villains .
The book by Paul Tobin and Vicenc Villagrassa launches on September 9th , during the real Fashion Week in New York , and ComicsAlliance has an exclusive interview with Gunn and Marvel Marketing Coordinator Margarita Vaisman about his guest appearance in the Marvel Universe and the fashion expert 's philosophy on superhero style .
A long - time comics fan who once created a 30 " x 40 " pen and ink compilation of Marvel characters in art school , Gunn seems over the moon about his comics cameo .
" I really am beside myself ; I become a superhero , which is incredible , " said Gunn .
" I 'm not a fistfighter -- I 'm more of a biter and hairpuller , so the whole idea that I 'm a superhero is phenomenal . "
He also responded very positively to the idea of a Marvel Universe - themed challenge on " Project Runway , " adding that " I 'm pushing for it .
I think it 's a great idea ! "
Gunn found it hard to choose a single style icon in the Marvel Universe , saying instead that " in their own way I believe [ the Marvel superheroes ] are each a style icon , and this is not a Miss America response , I assure you .
I say that for a very particular reason .
I really believe in the semiotics of clothes .
The clothes we wear send a message about we are perceived and how we want the world to greet us .
Every Marvel character is so perfectly branded for who he or she is ...
Fashion - wise , I give them all an A +. "
The only fashion tragedy discussed was the Incredible Hulk , who destroys his outfits everytime he transforms .
" Lots of stretch , that would certainly help , " said Gunn .
" Excellent seam allowance so we could repairs the damage if necessary .
But I think it 's really all about developing a textile specifically for the Incredible Hulk . "
Sounds like a job for unstable molecules !

The low , flat - topped hills of south Orissa have been home to the Dongria Kondh long before there was a country called India or a state called Orissa .
The hills watched over the Kondh .
The Kondh watched over the hills and worshipped them as living deities .
Now these hills have been sold for the bauxite they contain .
For the Kondh it 's as though god had been sold .
They ask how much god would go for if the god were Ram or Allah or Jesus Christ .
Perhaps the Kondh are supposed to be grateful that their Niyamgiri hill , home to their Niyam Raja , God of Universal Law , has been sold to a company with a name like Vedanta ( the branch of Hindu philosophy that teaches the Ultimate Nature of Knowledge ) .
It 's one of the biggest mining corporations in the world and is owned by Anil Agarwal , the Indian billionaire who lives in London in a mansion that once belonged to the Shah of Iran .
Vedanta is only one of the many multinational corporations closing in on Orissa .
If the flat - topped hills are destroyed , the forests that clothe them will be destroyed , too .
So will the rivers and streams that flow out of them and irrigate the plains below .
So will the Dongria Kondh .
So will the hundreds of thousands of tribal people who live in the forested heart of India , and whose homeland is similarly under attack .
In our smoky , crowded cities , some people say , " So what ?
Someone has to pay the price of progress . "
Some even say , " Let 's face it , these are people whose time has come .
Look at any developed country – Europe , the US , Australia – they all have a ' past ' . "
Indeed they do .
So why should n't " we " ?
In keeping with this line of thought , the government has announced Operation Green Hunt , a war purportedly against the " Maoist " rebels headquartered in the jungles of central India .
Of course , the Maoists are by no means the only ones rebelling .
There is a whole spectrum of struggles all over the country that people are engaged in –the landless , the Dalits , the homeless , workers , peasants , weavers .
They 're pitted against a juggernaut of injustices , including policies that allow a wholesale corporate takeover of people 's land and resources .
However , it is the Maoists that the government has singled out as being the biggest threat .
Two years ago , when things were nowhere near as bad as they are now , the prime minister described the Maoists as the " single largest internal security threat " to the country .
This will probably go down as the most popular and often repeated thing he ever said .
For some reason , the comment he made on 6 January , 2009 , at a meeting of state chief ministers , when he described the Maoists as having only " modest capabilities " , does n't seem to have had the same raw appeal .
He revealed his government 's real concern on 18 June , 2009 , when he told parliament : " If left - wing extremism continues to flourish in parts which have natural resources of minerals , the climate for investment would certainly be affected . "
Who are the Maoists ?
They are members of the banned Communist party of India ( Maoist ) – CPI ( Maoist ) – one of the several descendants of the Communist Party of India ( Marxist - Leninist ) , which led the 1969 Naxalite uprising and was subsequently liquidated by the Indian government .
The Maoists believe that the innate , structural inequality of Indian society can only be redressed by the violent overthrow of the Indian state .
In its earlier avatars as the Maoist Communist Centre ( MCC ) in Jharkhand and Bihar , and the People 's War Group ( PWG ) in Andhra Pradesh , the Maoists had tremendous popular support .
( When the ban on them was briefly lifted in 2004 , 1.5 million people attended their rally in Warangal . )
But eventually their intercession in Andhra Pradesh ended badly .
They left a violent legacy that turned some of their staunchest supporters into harsh critics .
After a paroxysm of killing and counter - killing by the Andhra police as well as the Maoists , the PWG was decimated .
Those who managed to survive fled Andhra Pradesh into neighbouring Chhattisgarh .
There , deep in the heart of the forest , they joined colleagues who had already been working there for decades .
Not many " outsiders " have any first - hand experience of the real nature of the Maoist movement in the forest .
A recent interview with one of its top leaders , Comrade Ganapathy , in Open magazine , did n't do much to change the minds of those who view the Maoists as a party with an unforgiving , totalitarian vision , which countenances no dissent whatsoever .
Comrade Ganapathy said nothing that would persuade people that , were the Maoists ever to come to power , they would be equipped to properly address the almost insane diversity of India 's caste - ridden society .
His casual approval of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) of Sri Lanka was enough to send a shiver down even the most sympathetic of spines , not just because of the brutal ways in which the LTTE chose to wage its war , but also because of the cataclysmic tragedy that has befallen the Tamil people of Sri Lanka , who it claimed to represent , and for whom it surely must take some responsibility .
Right now in central India , the Maoists ' guerrilla army is made up almost entirely of desperately poor tribal people living in conditions of such chronic hunger that it verges on famine of the kind we only associate with sub-Saharan Africa .
They are people who , even after 60 years of India 's so - called independence , have not had access to education , healthcare or legal redress .
They are people who have been mercilessly exploited for decades , consistently cheated by small businessmen and moneylenders , the women raped as a matter of right by police and forest department personnel .
Their journey back to a semblance of dignity is due in large part to the Maoist cadre who have lived and worked and fought by their side for decades .
If the tribals have taken up arms , they have done so because a government which has given them nothing but violence and neglect now wants to snatch away the last thing they have – their land .
Clearly , they do not believe the government when it says it only wants to " develop " their region .
Clearly , they do not believe that the roads as wide and flat as aircraft runways that are being built through their forests in Dantewada by the National Mineral Development Corporation are being built for them to walk their children to school on .
They believe that if they do not fight for their land , they will be annihilated .
That is why they have taken up arms .
Even if the ideologues of the Maoist movement are fighting to eventually overthrow the Indian state , right now even they know that their ragged , malnutritioned army , the bulk of whose soldiers have never seen a train or a bus or even a small town , are fighting only for survival .
In 2008 , an expert group appointed by the Planning Commission submitted a report called " Development Challenges in Extremist - Affected Areas " .
It said , " the Naxalite ( Maoist ) movement has to be recognised as a political movement with a strong base among the landless and poor peasantry and adivasis .
Its emergence and growth need to be contextualised in the social conditions and experience of people who form a part of it .
The huge gap between state policy and performance is a feature of these conditions .
Though its professed long - term ideology is capturing state power by force , in its day - to - day manifestation , it is to be looked upon as basically a fight for social justice , equality , protection , security and local development . "
A very far cry from the " single - largest internal security threat " .
Since the Maoist rebellion is the flavour of the week , everybody , from the sleekest fat cat to the most cynical editor of the most sold - out newspaper in this country , seems to be suddenly ready to concede that it is decades of accumulated injustice that lies at the root of the problem .
But instead of addressing that problem , which would mean putting the brakes on this 21st - century gold rush , they are trying to head the debate off in a completely different direction , with a noisy outburst of pious outrage about Maoist " terrorism " .
But they 're only speaking to themselves .
The people who have taken to arms are not spending all their time watching ( or performing for ) TV , or reading the papers , or conducting SMS polls for the Moral Science question of the day : Is Violence Good or Bad ?
SMS your reply to ...
They 're out there .
They 're fighting .
They believe they have the right to defend their homes and their land .
They believe that they deserve justice .
In order to keep its better - off citizens absolutely safe from these dangerous people , the government has declared war on them .
A war , which it tells us , may take between three and five years to win .
Odd , is n't it , that even after the Mumbai attacks of 26 / 11 , the government was prepared to talk with Pakistan ?
It 's prepared to talk to China .
But when it comes to waging war against the poor , it 's playing hard .
It 's not enough that special police with totemic names like Greyhounds , Cobras and Scorpions are scouring the forests with a licence to kill .
It 's not enough that the Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF ) , the Border Security Force ( BSF ) and the notorious Naga Battalion have already wreaked havoc and committed unconscionable atrocities in remote forest villages .
It 's not enough that the government supports and arms the Salwa Judum , the " people 's militia " that has killed and raped and burned its way through the forests of Dantewada leaving 300,000 people homeless or on the run .
Now the government is going to deploy the Indo - Tibetan border police and tens of thousands of paramilitary troops .
It plans to set up a brigade headquarters in Bilaspur ( which will displace nine villages ) and an air base in Rajnandgaon ( which will displace seven ) .
Obviously , these decisions were taken a while ago .
Surveys have been done , sites chosen .
Interesting .
War has been in the offing for a while .
And now the helicopters of the Indian air force have been given the right to fire in " self - defence " , the very right that the government denies its poorest citizens .
Fire at whom ?
How will the security forces be able to distinguish a Maoist from an ordinary person who is running terrified through the jungle ?
Will adivasis carrying the bows and arrows they have carried for centuries now count as Maoists too ?
Are non-combatant Maoist sympathisers valid targets ?
When I was in Dantewada , the superintendent of police showed me pictures of 19 " Maoists " that " his boys " had killed .
I asked him how I was supposed to tell they were Maoists .
He said , " See Ma'am , they have malaria medicines , Dettol bottles , all these things from outside . "
What kind of war is Operation Green Hunt going to be ?
Will we ever know ?
Not much news comes out of the forests .
Lalgarh in West Bengal has been cordoned off .
Those who try to go in are being beaten and arrested .
And called Maoists , of course .
In Dantewada , the Vanvasi Chetana Ashram , a Gandhian ashram run by Himanshu Kumar , was bulldozed in a few hours .
It was the last neutral outpost before the war zone begins , a place where journalists , activists , researchers and fact - finding teams could stay while they worked in the area .
Meanwhile , the Indian establishment has unleashed its most potent weapon .
Almost overnight , our embedded media has substituted its steady supply of planted , unsubstantiated , hysterical stories about " Islamist terrorism " with planted , unsubstantiated , hysterical stories about " Red terrorism " .
In the midst of this racket , at ground zero , the cordon of silence is being inexorably tightened .
The " Sri Lanka solution " could very well be on the cards .
It 's not for nothing that the Indian government blocked a European move in the UN asking for an international probe into war crimes committed by the government of Sri Lanka in its recent offensive against the Tamil Tigers .
The first move in that direction is the concerted campaign that has been orchestrated to shoehorn the myriad forms of resistance taking place in this country into a simple George Bush binary :
If you are not with us , you are with the Maoists .
The deliberate exaggeration of the Maoist " threat " helps the state justify militarisation .
( And surely does no harm to the Maoists .
Which political party would be unhappy to be singled out for such attention ? )
While all the oxygen is being used up by this new doppelganger of the " war on terror " , the state will use the opportunity to mop up the hundreds of other resistance movements in the sweep of its military operation , calling them all Maoist sympathisers .
I use the future tense , but this process is well under way .
The West Bengal government tried to do this in Nandigram and Singur but failed .
Right now in Lalgarh , the Pulishi Santrash Birodhi Janasadharaner Committee or the People 's Committee Against Police Atrocities – which is a people 's movement that is separate from , though sympathetic to , the Maoists – is routinely referred to as an overground wing of the CPI ( Maoist ) .
Its leader , Chhatradhar Mahato , now arrested and being held without bail , is always called a " Maoist leader " .
We all know the story of Dr Binayak Sen , a medical doctor and a civil liberties activist , who spent two years in jail on the absolutely facile charge of being a courier for the Maoists .
While the light shines brightly on Operation Green Hunt , in other parts of India , away from the theatre of war , the assault on the rights of the poor , of workers , of the landless , of those whose lands the government wishes to acquire for " public purpose " , will pick up pace .
Their suffering will deepen and it will be that much harder for them to get a hearing .
Once the war begins , like all wars , it will develop a momentum , a logic and an economics of its own .
It will become a way of life , almost impossible to reverse .
The police will be expected to behave like an army , a ruthless killing machine .
The paramilitary will be expected to become like the police , a corrupt , bloated administrative force .
We 've seen it happen in Nagaland , Manipur and Kashmir .
The only difference in the " heartland " will be that it'll become obvious very quickly to the security forces that they 're only a little less wretched than the people they 're fighting .
In time , the divide between the people and the law enforcers will become porous .
Guns and ammunition will be bought and sold .
In fact , it 's already happening .
Whether it's the security forces or the Maoists or noncombatant civilians , the poorest people will die in this rich people 's war .
However , if anybody believes that this war will leave them unaffected , they should think again .
The resources it'll consume will cripple the economy of this country .
Last week , civil liberties groups from all over the country organised a series of meetings in Delhi to discuss what could be done to turn the tide and stop the war .
The absence of Dr Balagopal , one of the best - known civil rights activists of Andhra Pradesh , who died two weeks ago , closed around us like a physical pain .
He was one of the bravest , wisest political thinkers of our time and left us just when we needed him most .
Still , I 'm sure he would have been reassured to hear speaker after speaker displaying the vision , the depth , the experience , the wisdom , the political acuity and , above all , the real humanity of the community of activists , academics , lawyers , judges and a range of other people who make up the civil liberties community in India .
Their presence in the capital signalled that outside the arclights of our TV studios and beyond the drumbeat of media hysteria , even among India 's middle classes , a humane heart still beats .
Small wonder then that these are the people who the Union home minister recently accused of creating an " intellectual climate " that was conducive to " terrorism " .
If that charge was meant to frighten people , it had the opposite effect .
The speakers represented a range of opinion from the liberal to the radical left .
Though none of those who spoke would describe themselves as Maoist , few were opposed in principle to the idea that people have a right to defend themselves against state violence .
Many were uncomfortable about Maoist violence , about the " people 's courts " that delivered summary justice , about the authoritarianism that was bound to permeate an armed struggle and marginalise those who did not have arms .
But even as they expressed their discomfort , they knew that people 's courts only existed because India 's courts are out of the reach of ordinary people and that the armed struggle that has broken out in the heartland is not the first , but the very last option of a desperate people pushed to the very brink of existence .
The speakers were aware of the dangers of trying to extract a simple morality out of individual incidents of heinous violence , in a situation that had already begun to look very much like war .
Everybody had graduated long ago from equating the structural violence of the state with the violence of the armed resistance .
In fact , retired Justice PB Sawant went so far as to thank the Maoists for forcing the establishment of this country to pay attention to the egregious injustice of the system .
Hargopal from Andhra Pradesh spoke of his experience as a civil rights activist through the years of the Maoist interlude in his state .
He mentioned in passing the fact that in a few days in Gujarat in 2002 , Hindu mobs led by the Bajrang Dal and the VHP had killed more people than the Maoists ever had even in their bloodiest days in Andhra Pradesh .
People who had come from the war zones , from Lalgarh , Jharkhand , Chhattisgarh and Orissa , described the police repression , the arrests , the torture , the killing , the corruption , and the fact that they sometimes seemed to take orders directly from the officials who worked for the mining companies .
People described the often dubious , malign role being played by certain NGOs funded by aid agencies wholly devoted to furthering corporate prospects .
Again and again they spoke of how in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh activists as well as ordinary people – anyone who was seen to be a dissenter – were being branded Maoists and imprisoned .
They said that this , more than anything else , was pushing people to take up arms and join the Maoists .
They asked how a government that professed its inability to resettle even a fraction of the 50 million people who had been displaced by " development " projects was suddenly able to identify 1,40,000 hectares of prime land to give to industrialists for more than 300 Special Economic Zones , India 's onshore tax havens for the rich .
They asked what brand of justice the supreme court was practising when it refused to review the meaning of " public purpose " in the land acquisition act even when it knew that the government was forcibly acquiring land in the name of " public purpose " to give to private corporations .
They asked why when the government says that " the writ of the state must run " , it seems to only mean that police stations must be put in place .
Not schools or clinics or housing , or clean water , or a fair price for forest produce , or even being left alone and free from the fear of the police – anything that would make people 's lives a little easier .
They asked why the " writ of the state " could never be taken to mean justice .
There was a time , perhaps 10 years ago , when in meetings like these , people were still debating the model of " development " that was being thrust on them by the New Economic Policy .
Now the rejection of that model is complete .
It is absolute .
Everyone from the Gandhians to the Maoists agree on that .
The only question now is , what is the most effective way to dismantle it ?
An old college friend of a friend , a big noise in the corporate world , had come along for one of the meetings out of morbid curiosity about a world he knew very little about .
Even though he had disguised himself in a Fabindia kurta , he could n't help looking ( and smelling ) expensive .
At one point , he leaned across to me and said , " Someone should tell them not to bother .
They wo n't win this one .
They have no idea what they 're up against .
With the kind of money that 's involved here , these companies can buy ministers and media barons and policy wonks , they can run their own NGOs , their own militias , they can buy whole governments .
They 'll even buy the Maoists .
These good people here should save their breath and find something better to do . "
When people are being brutalised , what " better " thing is there for them to do than to fight back ?
It 's not as though anyone 's offering them a choice , unless it's to commit suicide , like some of the farmers caught in a spiral of debt have done .
( Am I the only one who gets the feeling that the Indian establishment and its representatives in the media are far more comfortable with the idea of poor people killing themselves in despair than with the idea of them fighting back ? )
For several years , people in Chhattisgarh , Orissa , Jharkhand and West Bengal – some of them Maoists , many not – have managed to hold off the big corporations .
The question now is , how will Operation Green Hunt change the nature of their struggle ?
What exactly are the fighting people up against ?
It 's true that , historically , mining companies have often won their battles against local people .
Of all corporations , leaving aside the ones that make weapons , they probably have the most merciless past .
They are cynical , battle - hardened campaigners and when people say , " Jaan denge par jameen nahin denge " ( We 'll give away our lives , but never our land ) , it probably bounces off them like a light drizzle on a bomb shelter .
They 've heard it before , in a thousand different languages , in a hundred different countries .
Right now in India , many of them are still in the first class arrivals lounge , ordering cocktails , blinking slowly like lazy predators , waiting for the Memorandums of Understanding ( MoUs ) they have signed – some as far back as 2005 – to materialise into real money .
But four years in a first class lounge is enough to test the patience of even the truly tolerant : the elaborate , if increasingly empty , rituals of democratic practice : the ( sometimes rigged ) public hearings , the ( sometimes fake ) environmental impact assessments , the ( often purchased ) clearances from various ministries , the long drawn - out court cases .
Even phony democracy is time - consuming .
And time is money .
So what kind of money are we talking about ?
In their seminal , soon - to - be- published work , Out of This Earth : East India Adivasis and the Aluminum Cartel , Samarendra Das and Felix Padel say that the financial value of the bauxite deposits of Orissa alone is $ 2.27 trillion ( more than twice India 's GDP ) .
That was at 2004 prices .
At today 's prices it would be about $ 4 trillion .
Of this , officially the government gets a royalty of less than 7 % .
Quite often , if the mining company is a known and recognised one , the chances are that , even though the ore is still in the mountain , it will have already been traded on the futures market .
So , while for the adivasis the mountain is still a living deity , the fountainhead of life and faith , the keystone of the ecological health of the region , for the corporation , it 's just a cheap storage facility .
Goods in storage have to be accessible .
From the corporation 's point of view , the bauxite will have to come out of the mountain .
Such are the pressures and the exigencies of the free market .
That 's just the story of the bauxite in Orissa .
Expand the $ 4 trillion to include the value of the millions of tonnes of high - quality iron ore in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and the 28 other precious mineral resources , including uranium , limestone , dolomite , coal , tin , granite , marble , copper , diamond , gold , quartzite , corundum , beryl , alexandrite , silica , fluorite and garnet .
Add to that the power plants , the dams , the highways , the steel and cement factories , the aluminium smelters , and all the other infrastructure projects that are part of the hundreds of MoUs ( more than 90 in Jharkhand alone ) that have been signed .
That gives us a rough outline of the scale of the operation and the desperation of the stakeholders .
The forest once known as the Dandakaranya , which stretches from West Bengal through Jharkhand , Orissa , Chhattisgarh , parts of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra , is home to millions of India 's tribal people .
The media has taken to calling it the Red corridor or the Maoist corridor .
It could just as accurately be called the MoUist corridor .
It does n't seem to matter at all that the fifth schedule of the constitution provides protection to adivasi people and disallows the alienation of their land .
It looks as though the clause is there only to make the constitution look good – a bit of window - dressing , a slash of make - up .
Scores of corporations , from relatively unknown ones to the biggest mining companies and steel manufacturers in the world , are in the fray to appropriate adivasi homelands – the Mittals , Jindals , Tata , Essar , Posco , Rio Tinto , BHP Billiton and , of course , Vedanta .
There 's an MoU on every mountain , river and forest glade .
We 're talking about social and environmental engineering on an unimaginable scale .
And most of this is secret .
It 's not in the public domain .
Somehow I do n't think that the plans afoot that would destroy one of the world 's most pristine forests and ecosystems , as well as the people who live in it , will be discussed at the climate change conference in Copenhagen .
Our 24 - hour news channels that are so busy hunting for macabre stories of Maoist violence – and making them up when they run out of the real thing – seem to have no interest at all in this side of the story .
I wonder why ?
Perhaps it 's because the development lobby to which they are so much in thrall says the mining industry will ratchet up the rate of GDP growth dramatically and provide employment to the people it displaces .
This does not take into account the catastrophic costs of environmental damage .
But even on its own narrow terms , it is simply untrue .
Most of the money goes into the bank accounts of the mining corporations .
Less than 10 % comes to the public exchequer .
A very tiny percentage of the displaced people get jobs , and those who do , earn slave - wages to do humiliating , backbreaking work .
By caving in to this paroxysm of greed , we are bolstering other countries ' economies with our ecology .
When the scale of money involved is what it is , the stakeholders are not always easy to identify .
Between the CEOs in their private jets and the wretched tribal special police officers in the " people 's " militias – who for a couple of thousand rupees a month fight their own people , rape , kill and burn down whole villages in an effort to clear the ground for mining to begin – there is an entire universe of primary , secondary and tertiary stakeholders .
These people do n't have to declare their interests , but they 're allowed to use their positions and good offices to further them .
How will we ever know which political party , which ministers , which MPs , which politicians , which judges , which NGOs , which expert consultants , which police officers , have a direct or indirect stake in the booty ?
How will we know which newspapers reporting the latest Maoist " atrocity " , which TV channels " reporting directly from ground zero " – or , more accurately , making it a point not to report from ground zero , or even more accurately , lying blatantly from ground zero – are stakeholders ?
What is the provenance of the billions of dollars ( several times more than India 's GDP ) secretly stashed away by Indian citizens in Swiss bank accounts ?
Where did the $ 2bn spent on the last general elections come from ?
Where do the hundreds of millions of rupees that politicians and parties pay the media for the " high - end " , " low- end " and " live " pre-election " coverage packages " that P Sainath recently wrote about come from ?
( The next time you see a TV anchor haranguing a numb studio guest , shouting , " Why do n't the Maoists stand for elections ?
Why do n't they come in to the mainstream ? " , do SMS the channel saying , " Because they can't afford your rates . " )
Too many questions about conflicts of interest and cronyism remain unanswered .
What are we to make of the fact that the Union home minister , P Chidambaram , the chief of Operation Green Hunt , has , in his career as a corporate lawyer , represented several mining corporations ?
What are we to make of the fact that he was a non-executive director of Vedanta – a position from which he resigned the day he became finance minister in 2004 ?
What are we to make of the fact that , when he became finance minister , one of the first clearances he gave for FDI was to Twinstar Holdings , a Mauritius - based company , to buy shares in Sterlite , a part of the Vedanta group ?
What are we to make of the fact that , when activists from Orissa filed a case against Vedanta in the supreme court , citing its violations of government guidelines and pointing out that the Norwegian Pension Fund had withdrawn its investment from the company alleging gross environmental damage and human rights violations committed by the company , Justice Kapadia suggested that Vedanta be substituted with Sterlite , a sister company of the same group ?
He then blithely announced in an open court that he , too , had shares in Sterlite .
He gave forest clearance to Sterlite to go ahead with the mining , despite the fact that the supreme court 's own expert committee had explicitly said that permission should be denied and that mining would ruin the forests , water sources , environment and the lives and livelihoods of the thousands of tribals living there .
Justice Kapadia gave this clearance without rebutting the report of the supreme court 's own committee .
What are we to make of the fact that the Salwa Judum , the brutal ground - clearing operation disguised as a " spontaneous " people 's militia in Dantewada , was formally inaugurated in 2005 , just days after the MoU with the Tatas was signed ?
And that the Jungle Warfare Training School in Bastar was set up just around then ?
What are we to make of the fact that two weeks ago , on 12 October , the mandatory public hearing for Tata Steel 's steel project in Lohandiguda , Dantewada , was held in a small hall inside the collectorate , cordoned off with massive security , with an audience of 50 tribal people brought in from two Bastar villages in a convoy of government jeeps ?
( The public hearing was declared a success and the district collector congratulated the people of Bastar for their co-operation . )
What are we to make of the fact that just around the time the prime minister began to call the Maoists the " single largest internal security threat " ( which was a signal that the government was getting ready to go after them ) , the share prices of many of the mining companies in the region skyrocketed ?
The mining companies desperately need this " war " .
They will be the beneficiaries if the impact of the violence drives out the people who have so far managed to resist the attempts that have been made to evict them .
Whether this will indeed be the outcome , or whether it'll simply swell the ranks of the Maoists remains to be seen .
Reversing this argument , Dr Ashok Mitra , former finance minister of West Bengal , in an article called " The Phantom Enemy " , argues that the " grisly serial murders " that the Maoists are committing are a classic tactic , learned from guerrilla warfare textbooks .
He suggests that they have built and trained a guerrilla army that is now ready to take on the Indian state , and that the Maoist " rampage " is a deliberate attempt on their part to invite the wrath of a blundering , angry Indian state which the Maoists hope will commit acts of cruelty that will enrage the adivasis .
That rage , Dr Mitra says , is what the Maoists hope can be harvested and transformed into an insurrection .
This , of course , is the charge of " adventurism " that several currents of the left have always levelled at the Maoists .
It suggests that Maoist ideologues are not above inviting destruction on the very people they claim to represent in order to bring about a revolution that will bring them to power .
Ashok Mitra is an old Communist who had a ringside seat during the Naxalite uprising of the 60s and 70s in West Bengal .
His views cannot be summarily dismissed .
But it 's worth keeping in mind that the adivasi people have a long and courageous history of resistance that predates the birth of Maoism .
To look upon them as brainless puppets being manipulated by a few middle - class Maoist ideologues is to do them a disservice .
Presumably Dr Mitra is talking about the situation in Lalgarh where , up to now , there has been no talk of mineral wealth .
( Lest we forget – the current uprising in Lalgarh was sparked off over the chief minister 's visit to inaugurate a Jindal Steel factory .
And where there 's a steel factory , can the iron ore be very far away ? )
The people 's anger has to do with their desperate poverty , and the decades of suffering at the hands of the police and the Harmads , the armed militia of the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) that has ruled West Bengal for more than 30 years .
Even if , for argument 's sake , we do n't ask what tens of thousands of police and paramilitary troops are doing in Lalgarh , and we accept the theory of Maoist " adventurism " , it would still be only a very small part of the picture .
The real problem is that the flagship of India 's miraculous " growth " story has run aground .
It came at a huge social and environmental cost .
And now , as the rivers dry up and forests disappear , as the water table recedes and as people realise what is being done to them , the chickens are coming home to roost .
All over the country , there 's unrest , there are protests by people refusing to give up their land and their access to resources , refusing to believe false promises any more .
Suddenly , it 's beginning to look as though the 10 % growth rate and democracy are mutually incompatible .
To get the bauxite out of the flat - topped hills , to get iron ore out from under the forest floor , to get 85 % of India 's people off their land and into the cities ( which is what Chidambaram says he'd like to see ) , India has to become a police state .
The government has to militarise .
To justify that militarisation , it needs an enemy .
The Maoists are that enemy .
They are to corporate fundamentalists what the Muslims are to Hindu fundamentalists .
( Is there a fraternity of fundamentalists ?
Is that why the RSS has expressed open admiration for Chidambaram ? )
It would be a grave mistake to imagine that the paramilitary troops , the Rajnandgaon air base , the Bilaspur brigade headquarters , the unlawful activities act , the Chhattisgarh special public security act and Operation Green Hunt are all being put in place just to flush out a few thousand Maoists from the forests .
In all the talk of Operation Green Hunt , whether or not Chidambaram goes ahead and " presses the button " , I detect the kernel of a coming state of emergency .
( Here 's a maths question :
If it takes 600,000 soldiers to hold down the tiny valley of Kashmir , how many will it take to contain the mounting rage of hundreds of millions of people ? )
Instead of narco - analysing Kobad Ghandy , the recently arrested Maoist leader , it might be a better idea to talk to him .
In the meanwhile , will someone who 's going to the climate change conference in Copenhagen later this year please ask the only question worth asking :
Can we leave the bauxite in the mountain ?
Felicia Tang Lee was a Perth Catholic schoolgirl with big dreams - but instead of making a name in mainstream Hollywood , she drifted into the world of adult film .
The final chapter of her life was a gruesome one .
The 31 - year - old , who also worked as a bikini model and had uncredited parts in The Fast And The Furious , Rush Hour 2 and Cradle 2 The Grave , was found dead earlier this month in a Los Angeles home she shared with her accused killer and boyfriend , Brian Lee Randone .
US authorities allege she suffered a slow , painful death at the hands of Randone - a former pastor and reality TV show contestant .
Her injuries were so severe Randone was charged with a count of torture as well as murder .
Autopsy results are pending but investigators believe she was beaten and suffocated .
The killing has shocked her close - knit family and friends .
" Felicia loved life and lived it to its fullest , " Lee 's family , who have declined interview requests , said in a statement .
" However , she was more than just a public figure .
" Felicia was above all a human being , a daughter , a sister , a friend to many who continue to love and honour her , as much in life and in her passing . "
Lee was born in Singapore and moved to Perth with her family when she was 11 - years - old , enrolling in an all - girl private Catholic school .
Two years later her family moved to Los Angeles .
At the age of 19 , she began modelling for fashion catalogues and bikini calendars .
Later she moved into adult films , starring in titles including Asian Fever , Hotel Decadence and Sugar Daddy Wanted .
Lee also made numerous appearances on Playboy TV and was a competitor on a pay - per- view strip poker TV tournament hosted by Carmen Electra .
Lee and Randone met poolside at the MGM Grand Casino in Las Vegas in April and the couple lived together in a house in the LA suburb of Monrovia .
Just after noon on September 11 , Randone made an emergency call to authorities , telling them Lee was not breathing .
Paramedics could not revive her .
Authorities said evidence obtained from the home did not match up with Randone 's version of events .
He was charged four days later and is being held in an LA County jail in lieu of $ US2 million ( $ 2.29 million ) bail .
Randone , originally from Omaha , Nebraska , obtained a bachelor 's degree from the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago and a master 's of divinity degree from Southwestern Seminary in Fort Worth , Texas .
He became a reality TV star when in 2000 he appeared as a contestant on The Sexiest Bachelor In America .

Old Filth
by Jane Gardam
320 pp , Chatto & Windus , £ 15.99
Once a Raj orphan , always a Raj orphan .
In Jane Gardam 's superb new novel , Sir Edward Feathers , an antediluvian retired judge , enters extreme age carrying his secret wound coiled inside him like a baby .
Born in Malaya to a mother who immediately dies and a father whose heart has been petrified by the first world war , Eddie is expelled to the loveless mother - country .
He is alone , with the Raj orphan 's stiff - upper - lipped anguish as to where " home " is .
Shuttlecocked to and fro between institutions and colonies , Eddie 's odyssey is a sad mock epic version of the wanderings of the children of the British empire , partly based on the early life of Rudyard Kipling .
Sir Edward is " said to have invented Filth - Failed in London Try Hong Kong " , as the Benchers in the Inner Temple muse , having spotted " the old coelocanth " lunching in their midst .
A bit of a mystery , they agree , such a magnificent chap , benevolent , popular , and just that one rancorous dispute " with Veneering " that does n't add up .
So who is " Old Filth " ?
All we have is an empty chair .
He has just left .
We begin where we end by pondering Filth 's absence .
Are you interested in venerable lawyers , the relic of empire ?
You will be .
Do you want to know about the Far Eastern Bar ?
A reader of Old Filth , despite its unpromising title , will become passionately curious about such matters .
This novel is surely Gardam 's masterpiece .
On the human level , it is one of the most moving fictions I have read for years .
I shall always remember the scene in which , putting up at the garish hotel that has replaced The Old Judges ' Lodging , this most ramrod - backed and disciplined of elderly men sees his wife 's obituary whilst doing his stately breakfasting .
He " wept silently behind his hands , sitting in this unknown place " , the sole figure in the vastness of the dining room .
He weeps on and on .
Round him the staff clear the table , change the cloth .
" They said not a word . "
Rich in such moving perspectives , Old Filth is even richer in its tragicomic style .
This is the rare novel that drives its reader for ward while persistently waylaying and detaining by the sheer beauty and inventiveness of its style .
One must savour every phrase .
The marriage of quirky eccentricity and psychological authenticity is a Gardam technique , but here her cunning wit , moving deftly between scenes and eras , displays the tragedy of a vintage world forever passing away .
If Old Filth himself is a death 's head in a carnival of vanities , an emotionally crippled remnant of empire , he is not - or not only - the dessicated monster you would expect .
Gardam 's lively sympathy renders Filth vividly alive in his illustrious isolation .
Veneering 's name conjures the hollow arriviste of Dickens 's Our Mutual Friend .
This figure , Filth 's adversary and latterly his close companion , has had a love - affair with Filth 's wife , Betty , giving her the sensual tenderness missing from her Raj orphan husband .
Nothing in this novel is as odd and moving as the childless and aged Betty 's unself - pitying burial of the " guilty pearls " , Veneering 's gift , while planting tulips for a spring she will never see .
" Who shall have you when I am gone ? " she asks the pearls .
No one .
Seizing the moment ( she is kneeling and finds it hard to get up ) , she plants them in a bulb - hole .
Much later a new child from next door annoys the widower Filth by landing " at his feet like a football " : " What 's that in your hand ? "
Sir Edward asks .
" Just some old beads , " says the spontaneous lad .
" I found them in that flower - bed . "
Then , Gardam writes , " He vanished . "
So the seed came up .
The barren Betty 's pearls ( identical to those her husband gave her , and she is sure he never noticed the substitution ) are inherited by a child she never had .
The beauty of this focused , crisp and understated writing lies in a complex irony that allows the reader insights denied to Edward .
In this drama of last things , the mystery of mortal transience combines with a principle of immortal surprise .
An aged man is a babe - in - arms ; his childhood is still quick within him and he remains capable of flashes of insight , quirks of impulse .
Filth ( a name that never ceases to cause the reader a queasy , surprised pang with each recurrence ) dies on a final journey " to Malaysia , then up to Borneo .
Kotakinakula .
Where I was born . "
As his exequies are tolled by the bell at Temple Bar , Filth 's epitaph is given - he is written off - by one of the judges .
They are looking at the inscription on a monument in the Inner Temple Garden in London that serves as an epigram for the novel : " Lawyers , I suppose , were children once . "
The pair of them agree that he was no one very much , deserved no more than a brief epitaph : " Laughable ...
Good judge ...
Travelling alone .
Quite alone . "
According to a new review of neuroscientific research , coercive interrogation techniques used during the Bush administration to extract information from terrorist suspects are likely to have been unsuccessful and may have had many unintended negative effects on the suspect ’s memory and brain functions .
A new article , published by Cell Press on September 21st in the journal , Trends in Cognitive Science , reviews scientific evidence demonstrating that repeated and extreme stress and anxiety have a detrimental influence on brain functions related to memory .
Memos released by the US Department of Justice in April of 2009 detailing coercive interrogation techniques suggest that prolonged periods of shock , stress , anxiety , disorientation and lack of control are more effective than standard interrogatory techniques in making subjects reveal truthful information from memory .
“ This is based on the assumption that subjects will be motivated to reveal veridical information to end interrogation , and that extreme stress , shock and anxiety do not impact memory ” says review author , Professor Shane O’Mara from the Institute of Neuroscience at Trinity College in Dublin , Ireland .
“ However , this model of the impact of extreme stress on memory and the brain is utterly unsupported by scientific evidence . ”
Psychological studies suggest that during extreme stress and anxiety , the captive will be conditioned to associate speaking with periods of safety .
For the captor , when the captive speaks , the objective of gaining information will have been obtained and there will be relief from the unsavory task of administering these conditions of stress .
Therefore , it is difficult or impossible to determine during the interrogation whether the captive is revealing truthful information or just talking to escape the torture .
Research has also shown that extreme stress has a deleterious effect on the frontal lobe and is associated with the production of false memories .
Neurochemical studies have revealed that the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex , brain regions integral to the process of memory , are rich in receptors for hormones that are activated by stress and sleep deprivation and which have been shown to have deleterious effects on memory .
“ To briefly summarize a vast , complex literature , prolonged and extreme stress inhibits the biological processes believed to support memory in the brain , ” says O’Mara .
“ For example , studies of extreme stress with Special Forces Soldiers have found that recall of previously - learned information was impaired after stress occurred . ”
Waterboarding in particular is an extreme stressor and has the potential to elicit widespread stress - induced changes in the brain .
“ Given our current cognitive neurobiological knowledge , it is unlikely that coercive interrogations involving extreme stress will facilitate release of truthful information from long term memory , ” concludes Professor O’Mara .
“ On the contrary , these techniques cause severe , repeated and prolonged stress , which compromises brain tissue supporting both memory and decision making . ”

On the folk psychology and folk neurobiology motivating ‘ enhanced and coercive interrogation techniques . ' ”

Iran has the largest Jewish community in the Middle East aside from Israel itself .
In the 19th century there were forced conversions of Jews to Shiism in the eastern city of Mashhad .

One genetic study found that some 20 % of the Spanish had Jewish haplotypes and 10 % had an Arab ancestry .
The revelation in Iran does n’t change anything ; Ahmadinejad does not make his critiques of Israel with reference to his own heritage but on the basis of a radical interpretation of Khomeinist ideology .
The latter in its full form is only a little over 40 years old , so for everyone in Ahmadinejad ’s age cohort , it is an adopted ideology for those who adhere to it , not an inherited one .

View Full Version : [ ubuntu ] wallpaper - tray is n't working without nautilus
ifreecarve
i'm using wmii , and i am trying to set up wallpaper - tray to manage my desktop background .
because wmii does n't have the gnome system tray , i'm using trayer ( tried stalonetray too ) .
the problem i'm seeing is that , although wallpaper - tray properly scans my images directory and creates a thumbnail for the tray icon , it does not actually SET the background in wmii .
wallpaper - tray works fine in gnome .
also , if i load up nautilus in wmii , wallpaper - tray will properly set and cycle the images -- but when i close nautilus , that functionality stops ( it keeps the existing wallpaper but does n't change it to new ones ) .
one last thing , when i pick a wallpaper while in wmii ( whose thumbnail i see in the trayer icon ) , that wallpaper will be the one i see if i switch to gnome .
to me , this suggests that running nautilus sets up some process that actually performs the wallpaper configuration when wallpaper - tray requests it .
the only problem is that i can't figure out how to set that up in a non -gnome window manager .
has anyone been able to set up wallpaper - tray without the nautilus desktop ?

Robert D. Maxwell
Details
Rank : Technician Fifth Grade
Conflict / Era : World War II
Unit / Command :
Wire Section , Communications Platoon , Headquarters Company , 3d Battalion , 7th Infantry Regiment ,
3d Infantry Division
Military Service Branch : U.S. Army
Medal of Honor Action Date : September 7 , 1944

Citation
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty on 7 September 1944 , near Besancon , France .
Technician 5th Grade Maxwell and three other soldiers , armed only with .45 - caliber automatic pistols , defended the battalion observation post against an overwhelming onslaught by enemy infantrymen in approximately platoon strength , supported by 20 - mm flak and machine - gun fire , who had infiltrated through the battalion 's forward companies and were attacking the observation post with machine - gun , machine pistol , and grenade fire at ranges as close as 10 yards .
Despite a hail of fire from automatic weapons and grenade launchers , Technician 5th Grade Maxwell aggressively fought off advancing enemy elements and , by his calmness , tenacity , and fortitude , inspired his fellows to continue the unequal struggle .
When an enemy hand grenade was thrown in the midst of his squad , Technician 5th Grade Maxwell unhesitatingly hurled himself squarely upon it , using his blanket and his unprotected body to absorb the full force of the explosion .
This act of instantaneous heroism permanently maimed Technican 5th Grade Maxwell , but saved the lives of his comrades in arms and facilitated maintenance of vital military communications during the temporary withdrawal of the battalion 's forward headquarters .
Models need to be fit to keep still for so long
By Jo-Anne Rowney
BBC News Magazine
Television viewers are getting a taste of how artists go about drawing life models with a series of classes on Channel 4 .
But what is it like to pose naked for art ?
It 's cold , all eyes are on you , and you 're naked .
It sounds like a recurring nightmare , but this was an everyday occurrence for life model Sarah Snee .
The artists do n't view you sexually - they see the body as a series of lines and shadows , a piece of art
Sarah Snee
Life model From Leonardo da Vinci to Lucian Freud , artists have always taken their inspiration from the human body by turning to life drawing to understand the naked form .
While the painter may get all the attention , on the other side of the canvas is the lesser - known life model .
Sarah started modelling when studying at Slade School of Fine Art , University College London .
As a student strapped for cash the allure of making money modelling for art was too much to resist .
But there was another motivation - self exploration .
" I was intrigued by the idea of being naked in front of strangers , " says Sarah .
" Especially at the age of 20 when you 're still getting to know your own body and developing your own sexuality .
It was a very romantic idea , a bohemian idea . "
Artist 's gaze Sarah can recall the first time she modelled , as she met the eyes of the students posed to draw her , she felt self - conscious .
Her mind raced with questions .
" My first time was daunting .
I was wondering what people thought of my body .
Was I attractive enough ?
Did my bum look big ?
The things most people would be concerned with .
The art world is littered with famous nudes " I had just got back from holiday and I felt like I 'd put on lots of weight .
I thought I can't do this , what had I been thinking ?
But then I realised what I felt was only natural .
From then I relaxed and it was easier . "
Despite being under the intense scrutiny of a room full of pupils , male and female , Sarah found she quickly became used to being under the artist 's gaze .
" It made me feel more confident about my body .
I felt liberated .
I feel more self - conscious wearing a bikini on holiday with friends than I did when I was naked in front of strangers .
" For me it was a means to channel that exhibitionism .
I quite liked getting naked in front of strangers .
I find it quite exhilarating , you 're the centre of attention and you 're enabling people to be creative . "
When Sarah decided to become a life model people were intrigued .
" I think some guys liked it .
It was a good line to use as a student meeting people in bars .
It got people interested and I definitely got a few boyfriends from it . "
HISTORY OF LIFE DRAWING 1st Century AD : Roman philosopher Pliny tells of Zeuxis viewing women naked and selecting five to combine to paint an ideal image 1487 : Leonardo da Vinci 's Vitruvian Man , depicts naked male form as proportionate 1580s : Carraci's art school in Bologna focuses on life drawing 1700s : Students in Jacques - Louis David 's studio must master drawing Some artists see drawing from observation as the pinnacle of the practice , allowing a chance to capture the essence of the form , recreating it in a way that copying a photograph just cannot compare to .
According to artist Alan Kane , life drawing has become less fashionable .
Kane , the man behind the Channel 4 series , Life Class : Today 's Nude , says life modelling should be viewed as " educational and non-sexualised nudity " .
However , life modelling has gained some dodgy associations , Sarah explains .
" People say to me is n't life modelling really weird ?
Is n't it a bit sexual ?
Of course there are men who have this idea they 're all going to draw these naked women and it 's going to be thrilling .
" But the artists do n't view you sexually .
They see the body as a series of lines and shadows , a piece of art . "
Depicting anatomy has been a valued skill for centuries Perhaps a more pressing issue for the typical life model is the cold .
" There 's a heater normally , but the worst place was the freezing Canvas Gallery in Islington [ in north London ] , " says Sarah .
" They had a gas burner and it blew towards you , it was a little scary .
I was paranoid about it blowing up . "
As if catching a chill was n't enough , posing can also be physically challenging .
You have to be very fit to remain motionless .
" I think I 've got thread veins [ small blood vessels near the surface of the skin ] prematurely from modelling because you are cutting off the blood supply over long lengths of time .
" I used to get extreme pain , some poses were just agonising .
Imagine sitting down and resting on your hand , twisting slightly to the right .
There 's pain in your wrist , pain in your buttocks and the lower back from the pressure . "
There are always bad experiences , but life as a model can also be rewarding .
One artist sold paintings of Sarah in a Paris show .
A painting was bought by a top buyer , and is currently displayed alongside a Vermeer in the French capital .
With her image holding pride of place in Paris , Sarah feels part of her will live on beyond her years .
" It 's nice to think there 's a little bit of me that will survive out there somewhere .
It 's lovely to think my image is out there bringing people happiness . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
I modelled myself some years ago , but as a man I was asked to wear a thong .
I thought this was to keep my bits out of view of the female students .
But no .
It was to keep the bits under control .
You see , posing generally leads the mind to wander and to daydream , and in that situation arousal is all too common .
Ian , Fleetwood
When I went to see my future wife 's mother she took me into the sitting room and served coffee on a glass top coffee table .
Under the glass was a life drawing of my future mother - in - law who used to be a model .
I did n't know where to put my biscuits .
At least I got to see into the future .
Paul , Hampshire
Many years ago I did three months life modelling , as well as - over ten years - collating information about the human rights records of other countries .
From these two experiences , let me assure you that an ill - considered pose is an unwitting act of torture .
Oh my lower leg muscles just ache at the memory .
Nic , London
We had a young model who was a bit of a poser .
She lasted about three weeks .
She could n't hack the clinical detachment that you have to have for analytical drawing .
I agree with Adam from Brighton , big fat women are great to draw .
One lady was wonderful and in her breaks she used to tear our drawings apart .
Big boobs and bellies and reach for the 4B .
Colin Bibby , Lima , Peru I did a lot of life classes while studying art .
The worst part is when the model takes a break and wanders round to have a look at people 's work ... you feel self - conscious of your representation of their nude body .
Older , plumper people are the best to draw , they have much more interesting bodies .
Curves and creases .
Adam Kidd , Brighton
Trust the media to find a young , attractive blonde to illustrate the story .
When I was at art college in the early 80s most of our models were middle - aged and wrinkly , which actually makes for a much more interesting study .
However there was one " extra- mature " model " Old Dave " , and we were all very grateful indeed that he always kept his baggy grey Y - fronts firmly on .
Graeme , Bristol , UK I 've never modelled myself - for the good of human kind - but I did draw people , both male & female and there 's something magical about the naked human body .
Martín Alejandro Carmona Selva , Barcelona , Spain Has n't Sarah achieved something we would all love ?
Immortality without suffering the ageing process .
Excellent .
David , Lancashire , Burnley
It 's good to see such an " alternative " job getting the recognition and respect it deserves .
I 've been a life model for a couple of years now and although the work is sometimes hard ( I find yoga helps ! ) and jobs can be sporadic , I love being a part of the creative process and the students are always professional and respectful .
I have a degree in History of Art and Design , but have learned so much about drawing since I began modelling that I now want to go back and do an Art Foundation course .
Claire Hill , Manchester , UK
The human form should be celebrated as an interesting form of natural engineering and an aesthetic piece of art .
We are all naked underneath our clothes .
Julia Brydon , Brighton , UK
While I imagine it 's quite exciting to do , I do n't think I would ever become a life model myself .
I think I 've still got too much of that Victorian prudishness inside me .
Ed , York I was a model throughout college for various art courses .
It was mostly a very positive experience and it did pay well .
The downside was that male models were paid at a significantly higher rate ( apparently women are much more likely to model for classes , leaving the instructors desperate to find men willing to pose for their students ) .
Who would 've thought the glass ceiling exists in nude modelling , too ?
Sara , Dallas , TX , USA I 've modelled since I was 21 and have done it through two pregnancies and into my late 30s .
I love it , find the artists a fascinating bunch and now find the enforced inactivity complete bliss .
Personally I 'm not an exhibitionist , just happy in my own skin and enjoying doing something a bit different .
Mrs HD , Herefordshire
Why do the English have such trouble separating nudity from sexuality ?
There is a time for titillation and there is a time to admire the scientific wonder and artistic beauty of human anatomy .
Ross Brown , London , UK Ross , I really do n't think there 's " time to admire the scientific wonder and artistic beauty of human anatomy " , at least not in this time and age .
If you notice , most of the renaissance models we 've seen are unfit and out of shape , my guess is people bank then were able to see the beauty in the human body , but in this time and age there 's simply no time for it , and those who claim to be are only interested to sit and stare at a physically attractive and fit model .
Otherwise , a human body does n't interest them ; when was the last time someone was interested in painting an out - of - shape wrinkled old fat lady ?
Ash , Dubai , UAE
When I was student in Aberdeen , I posed for classes at Gray 's Art School .
I agree it's a liberating experience and gives you time to do nothing but think .
Normally the classes were art students or adults where it was a hobby .
However , one night , I walked in to find that half the class were Art GCSE girls .
As I got into my pose , one of them stage - whispered " Not as big as I expected . "
Tony Romanis , Carlisle I 've done life drawing and I view the female models sexually .
Sorry , prudes , but that is human nature and is perfectly acceptable thing to do .
I have no personal issues like most repressed people in society who look down their noses on other people .
Mikey , Australia
To look at a nude as lines and shadows is to reduce it to level of a vase .
A good nude picture communicates the sensuality of the model .
After all that is the real beauty of a woman .
People who fret about sexuality should play safe and draw fruit .
Tony Fekete , Bucharest
For the average person even in the Western world , I guess being naked in public would be very difficult and embarrassing .
However I would consider it a brave and liberating experience to do so ; you are overcoming all those deeply rooted inhibitions you have acquired since early childhood .
There is nothing shameful about the naked human body , well proportioned or otherwise .
Rajiv , Trivandrum , India
As an artist who has taken many life drawing classes I can vouch for the fact that it is not sexual .
However , it can be uncomfortable for the artist at first as well as the model .
Actually , it 's difficult to draw the body correctly and you really have to pay attention to the various little shapes .
The one thing I did learn is that there are all sorts of bodies out there so mine is n't that horrible .
I could never pose nude though .
Kathleen , Boston , USA
As an amateur artist who has been on the drawing side in life classes , I have to agree with Sarah that I entirely saw the human form as a series of curves and shadows and a real challenge to capture well .
It definitely helps you see it as an absolute work of art in its own right .

Jewish World Review Atheists in Bubbleland By Rabbi Yonason Goldson
Jen McCleary
jenccleary.com
Did you miss it ?
Last month the country celebrated national Blasphemy Day !
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com |
According to NPR.com , atheists marked Blasphemy Day last month at gatherings around the world , celebrating the freedom to denigrate and insult religion .
Activities included de-baptizing people with hair dryers and an art exhibit in Washington , D.C. , which showed , among other titles , Jesus Paints His Nails , in which " an effeminate Jesus after the crucifixion [ applies ] polish to the nails that attach his hands to the cross . "
The atheist group Center for Inquiry hosted the exhibit .
Addressing a capacity crowd at the University of Toronto , columnist Christopher Hitchens elicited enthusiastic cheers by commenting , " I think religion should be treated with ridicule , hatred and contempt , and I claim that right . "
He told NPR that religion is " sinister , dangerous and ridiculous , " because it can prompt people to fly airplanes into buildings , and it promotes ignorance .
Hitchens defended atheist incivility this way : " If I said to a Protestant or Quaker or Muslim , ' Hey , at least I respect your belief , ' I would be telling a lie . "
THE IRRELIGIOUS DIVIDE
However , not all atheists should be painted with the same brush .
Stuart Jordan , who advises the Center for Inquiry on policy issues , explain to NPR that Blasphemy Day is symptomatic of a debate among traditional atheists and " new atheists " over whether people of faith should be treated with respect or derision .
Paul Kurtz , who founded the Center for Inquiry three decades ago , was ousted in a " palace coup " last year .
" I consider them atheist fundamentalists , " he says .
" Merely to critically attack religious beliefs is not sufficient .
It leaves a vacuum .
What are you for ?
We know what you 're against , but what do you want to defend ? "
The new atheists counter that they believe in reason , science and freedom from religious myth .
And , as Ronald Lindsay , who replaced Kurtz , puts it : " We take the high road , the low road , country roads , interstates , highways , byways , - whatever it takes to reach people . "
Truly , it must be a cold day in the infernal regions if atheism can now boast its own ideological schism .
Officials from the Center for Inquiry were unavailable for comment , having hastily cancelled all interviews in the wake of the controversy .
Even NPR could n't escape the irony of stonewalling by a group that defines itself as an advocate of free speech .
Then again , maybe it should n't come as a surprise .
Any group that worships exclusively at the altar of science and empirical evidence will quickly find itself caught it its own tangled web of faith .
BEHIND THE FACADE OF RATIONALISM
I 'll let Professor Bob Berman , columnist for Astronomy Magazine , explain :
[ W ] hat existed before the Big Bang ?
I get that question a lot from students , and I 'll admit to being guilty of reciting the standard speech .
" The Big Bang , " I explain grandly , " created time as well as space .
Since there was no time before the Big Bang , your question is meaningless . "
The student is silenced .
The class continues .
The professor obviously knows something wonderfully profound .
But I can't do it any more .
The next time some one asks , I 'll tell the truth : " Nobody has the foggiest idea what happened the Tuesday before the Big Bang .
That whole domain is part of Bubbleland . "
Then the class will nod , and really understand .
Ah , yes , Bubbleland .
The realm beyond the present reach of science .
Anyone attending a cosmology lecture can tell when the speaker arrives at Bubbleland .
" It 's not galaxy clusters that travel outward , " he 'll say pedantically , " but space itself that grows larger .
The galaxies do n't actually move . "
So here I am thinking , wait a minute .
Are we at a Daffy Duck convention ?
The late Carl Sagan , whom I love and admire , nonetheless said " Now that we 've explained how life began , there 's no place for G0d . "
Well , let 's leave G0d out of this and just address science 's explanation of life 's genesis .
The prevailing account posits a mixing of organic molecules , the arrival of amino acids on comets from space , some accidental combinations , and then the great denouement : " and somehow life arose . "
Beep !
Hold it !
That " somehow " may be only one little word embedded among the thousands comprising the " explanation , " but it changes the whole thing to : " We have n't a clue . "
How consciousness or self - awareness can arise from amino acids remains as deep a mystery as it ever was .
But since we do not want our experts to stand mute and nonplussed , we have now supplied an out .
They do not have to utter the dreaded " I do n't know . "
Finally they can explain our origins .
We come from Bubbleland .
EXTREMISM , FANATICISM , AND OBSCURANTISM
It 's as refreshing as it is uncommon to hear a scientist concede the limits of scientific understanding .
But why ?
Why such dogmatic passion , intensity , and fervor among atheists ?
Why the overzealous insistence that belief in science is based in undiluted logic where belief and G0d is based in indefensible whimsy ?
The great Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik summed it up like this : " All extremism , fanaticism and obscurantism come from a lack of security .
A person who is secure cannot be an extremist . "
The so - called " new atheists " are really no different from any other fundamentalist ideologues .
They are driven by an irrational compulsion to " prove " that they are right by asserting in the most uncompromising terms that others are wrong .
But truth be told , they are haunted by the inescapable reality that ultimate certitude is beyond the reach of human beings .
They have taken up permanent residence in Bubbleland , and they will fight to the death anyone who threatens their homegrown fantasy .
Compare their fanatic inflexibility with the medieval Talmudist Maimonides , who wrote that the rise of Christianity and Islam have benefited mankind by spreading monotheistic belief throughout the world .
Had the revered sage accepted the absolute truth of either of those movements , he would have recanted his Judaism and proclaimed himself a true believer .
But his conviction in the veracity of Torah Judaism did not prevent him from acknowledging their value and the sincerity of their practitioners .
Civility makes it possible for people of radically different beliefs to live in harmony and foster peace throughout the world .
The religious community has often fallen short of this ideal , but the world before monotheism failed far more consistently and dramatically .
When all is said and done , those who deride others in the name of tolerance are invariably the most intolerant of all .
May they enjoy a long and happy residence within the intellectual borders of Bubbleland .

This artist 's concept shows the Stardust spacecraft beginning its flight through gas and dust around comet Wild 2 .
( The white area represents the comet .
The sample collector is the tennis - racket - shaped object extending out from the back of the spacecraft . )
Afundamental ingredient for life has been discovered in a comet sample , supporting the idea that such icy objects seeded early Earth with the stuffneeded to whip up living organisms .
Newresearch firms up past suggestions of glycine , the simplest amino acid used tomake proteins , inside samples from the cometWild 2 ( pronounced " Vilt 2 " ) .
" Thisis the first time an amino acid has been found in a comet , " said leadresearcher Jamie Elsila of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " Our discovery supports the theory that some of life 's ingredientsformed in space and were delivered to Earth long ago by meteorite and cometimpacts . "
How lifearose on Earth has long puzzled scientists and philosophers alike , withpossible evidence for such building blocks showing up floatingabout in the cosmos and even inside the mouthsof volcanoes .
The newfinding , which has been accepted for publication in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science , also has implications for finding alien life .?
" Thediscovery of glycine in a comet supports the idea that the fundamental buildingblocks of life are prevalent in space , and strengthens the argument that lifein the universe may be common rather than rare , " said Carl Pilcher , directorof the NASA Astrobiology Institute , which co-funded the research .
NASA 's Stardustspacecraft captured samples of gas and dust from Wild 2 in 2004 .
The materialparachuted to Earth in 2006 .
Since then , scientists around the world have beenanalyzing the samples to learn the secrets of comet formation and our solarsystem 's history .
Preliminarytesting had suggested glycine was present in the samples .
But since glycine isused by terrestrial life , the team could n't rule out contamination from Earthlysources , according to a NASA statement released today .
" Itwas possible that the glycine we found originated from handling or manufactureof the Stardust spacecraft itself , " Elsila said . ?
To teaseapart contamination from the real McCoy , the researchers recently analyzed thesamples for different carbon isotopes , which are versions of the same elementwith different masses .
Glycinemolecules from space tend to have more of the heavier Carbon 13 atoms thanglycine from Earth .
That 's exactly what the team found .
" Wediscovered that the Stardust - returned glycine has an extraterrestrial carbonisotope signature , indicating that it originated on the comet , " Elsilasaid .
APART FROM THE FACT THAT THEY CAN HATCH WITHIN MINUTES AFTER contact with water , brine shrimp are unappealing creatures .
They ’re ant - sized and translucent and bear a striking resemblance to sperm .
Yet brine shrimp packaged as “ Sea Monkeys ” are currently sold as children ’s companions , and portrayed on their boxes as pink , pear - shaped simian creatures with spindly legs , paunches and coy smiles .
They are one of the most impressive achievements in the annals of marketing .
Harold von Braunhut , a former manager of novelty acts , first packaged his patented hybrids in 1960 , transforming the Sea Monkeys into American icons via millions of comic book ads .
Von Braunhut also wrote the 32 - page handbook that is included in most Sea Monkey kits to this day , which states that the creatures can be hypnotized , play baseball and rise from the dead .
The tone of the handbook is florid and huckstery : “ It seems that at mating time in the Animal Kingdom , the males engage in combat to win the fin , paw , flipper , hoof , wing or what - have - you , of their ‘ lady love . ’ ”
In 1999 , the Sea Monkeys were in line for an overhaul :
The freeze - dried creatures were , and still are , licensed to Educational Insights Inc. , a Carson - based company whose ExploraToy division handles production development and sales of the Sea Monkeys .
According to then - art director Gregory Bevington , the classic ‘ 70s naked monkeys lounging on a seaweed bank in front of a castle are too “ lame ” for today ’s children .
Hoping that a new look and some razzle - dazzle would parlay Sea Monkeys from an undisclosed - but - " significant ” portion of their $ 40 million in annual sales to a $ 25 - million - a - year line , Educational Insights brought in Alan Fine , who spent the majority of his adult life in Mattel ’s marketing department .
“ I have a lot of background on what is attractive to kids , what works and what does n’t work , ” said Fine , who is no longer with the company .
Before leaving in August , Fine helped wage a multimillion - dollar media blitz in honor of the Sea Monkeys ’ 40th anniversary .
Five new products were being unveiled , including a Sea Monkeys speedway and an LCD watch that houses up to two Sea Monkeys for up to 24 hours .
But the linchpin of Fine ’s campaign was a brand new television commercial featuring greatly altered Sea Monkeys , which has yet to air .

Months before I saw this commercial , I drove down to Educational Insights , hoping to see the new Sea Monkeys .
Having hatched more than my share as a child , I was curious about the kind of concessions needed to entice the Game Boy - loving children of today .
I had no idea this would turn into a story about a white supremacist inventor and the nice men who were marketing his invention to children .

ANTICIPATING MY ARRIVAL , BEVINGTON SET UP A PICTORIAL history of Sea Monkey packages on a conference - room table at ExploraToy .
On one side were classic ads featuring the nuclear Sea Monkey family , virtually unchanged since the ‘ 70s .
“ There ’s a dad , the mom and a couple kids , ” Bevington explained in a droll voice .
“ The mom has a little flip hairdo , and , basically , they look like naked people with webbed tails and feet and hands and three prongs sticking out of their heads .
They have potbellies and skinny arms and legs so they ’re not really physically fit . ”
On the other side of the table , Bevington arranged artists ’ submissions for the updated Sea Monkeys .
A radical departure from their sweet , potbellied predecessors , the new models had enormous torsos and tree - trunk legs .
Some wore scaly breast plates ; others sported capes .
“ If we really want them to appeal to kids of today , they need to look like superheroes or action figures , ” Bevington said .

Any decision regarding the appearance of the Sea Monkeys must be vetted by Harold von Braunhut .
The 75 - year - old inventor currently lives on a nature preserve in Bryans Road , Md. , and drives a red Corvette .
“ Harold , ” as he is known at Educational Insights , is notoriously protective of his patented Sea Monkeys .
ExploraToy Vice President George C. Atamian says Von Braunhut once refused to do business with a company desiring to make Sea Monkey refrigerator magnets after he discovered risque magnets in its catalog .
Atamian , a round - faced scientist , met Von Braunhut via phone in 1990 , when he called to congratulate Atamian on an underwater microscope he ’d invented .
A few days later , some Sea Monkeys arrived in the mail .
Atamian did n’t know what they were .
“ When people were reading comic books , I was in the Marine Corps , ” he says .
When he opened the boxes , he thought they were junk .
But Atamian eventually came around , and in 1995 , he brought Von Braunhut to ExploraToy .
The two men talk Sea Monkeys “ every day , every night and every weekend , ” and Atamian has become a great receptacle of Von Braunhut lore , which he imparts at lightning speed .
“ As far as I ’m concerned , he ’s an absolute legend .
He ’s got 193 patents and he invented X - Ray Spex [ another huge success , advertised in the back pages of comic books ] , which is a phenomenal thing .
He ’s a master of marketing and a great word crafter and he ’s done all kinds of strange stuff .
He used to race cars and motorcycles .
And he used to manage a mentalist called the Great Dunninger , who he says put Uri Geller and all the other mentalists to shame . ”
But Atamian says it is Von Braunhut ’s scientific achievement that impresses him most of all .
“ Sea Monkeys , as you know , are hybrid brine shrimp eggs that are immersed in a medium that nobody ’s been able to knock off , ” he says .
The Sea Monkey eggs remain in a sort of suspended animation until they are poured into water that ’s been mixed with this top - secret formula , whereupon they hatch .
“ There ’s something in the powder [ Harold ] formulates that does something to those eggs that nature can’t do , ” Atamian says .
Von Braunhut and his wife , Yolanda , are said to be the only two people who know the formula , with which Von Braunhut is constantly tinkering .
“ It used to be [ that ] only one Sea Monkey lived and that [ same ] one died .
Now the formulation of the chemistry , the vigor of the Sea Monkeys themselves , is better than ever , ” rhapsodizes Atamian .

I ask Atamian for Von Braunhut ’s unlisted number .
Atamian says he would prefer that I not speak to Harold .
Each time I ask , Atamian puts me off with a series of excuses , ranging from Von Braunhut ’s reclusiveness to his poor health - - a few years ago Harold fell off a balcony , then his “ gallbladder exploded . ”
Atamian also mentions that whenever Von Braunhut gives interviews , there ’s “ fallout . ”
Curious as to what this “ fallout ” could be , I do a database search on Harold von Braunhut .

AMONG VON BRAUNHUT’S MANY INVENTIONS , WHICH RANGE FROM bulletproof garb to an insect observation kit , is a pen-sized weapon called the Kiyoga Agent M5 , which telescopes into a metal whip at a flick of the wrist .
The M5 caused an uproar in 1988 after it was revealed , in a fund - raising letter for the Aryan Nations , that a portion of the sales proceeds was going to Richard Butler , founder and leader of the organization .
( This is the same Richard Butler who , along with the Aryan Nations , was recently found negligent and ordered to pay $ 5.1 million after two security guards assaulted a mother and son outside the Nations compound in Idaho in 1998 . )
Butler was on trial for sedition and needed help with his legal bills .
Shortly after the M5 story broke , the Washington Post ran a lengthy article about Von Braunhut , revealing his involvement with “ some of the most extreme racist and anti-Semitic organizations in the country . ”
The article quoted an official with the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith as saying : “ He has a reputation of being a generous contributor . ”
Von Braunhut has vehemently denied the accusations in various news reports .
Yet in a 1988 interview with the Seattle Times , he referred to the “ inscrutable , slanty Korean eyes ” of Korean shop owners and was quoted as saying , “ You know what side I ’m on .
I do n’t make any bones about it . ”
At my request , the ADL , which has tracked Von Braunhut for years , sends me a rather hefty package .
In it is a picture of the inventor , who resembles Lenny Bruce , posing in a priest ’s collar in front of a Nazi flag .
News clippings track his frequent attendance at the Aryan Nations Congresses held every July in Hayden Lake , Idaho , where he appeared as recently as 1995 - - sometimes as a featured speaker , sometimes as the lighter of the burning cross .
And there are newsletters from an organization called the National Anti-Zionist Institute , headed by “ Hendrik von Braun , ” whose return address , P.O. Box 809 , Bryans Road , Md. , is the same place one sends away for Sea Monkey paraphernalia such as baseball kits .

Floyd Cochran , spokesman for the Aryan Nations until 1992 and a reformed racist , recalls Von Braunhut as a slight , balding man with “ a rather large nose for a person of the Aryan Nations . ”
He says Von Braunhut was something of a misfit .
“ He ’d give long speeches about numerology and he ’d make references to the pyramids , ” Cochran says .
“ It just did n’t play very well . ”
If Von Braunhut is underwhelming in public , the Anti-Zionist newsletters written by Hendrik von Braun are quite lively .
“ In the world of jewels and precious metals , only that which is pure , rare and unalloyed is of the highest value , ” begins a newsletter dated 1993 .
For a full two pages , readers are urged to unite against “ wogs ” and “ mud people , ” even if it means giving up their own lives .
“ No one ( except for Jesus Christ Himself ) has ever managed to live forever , ” Von Braun writes .
“ Even if you could , what a bore it would be to hang around for a few hundred years , not doing much of anything except watching the niggers make basketballs and sneakers out of Jew skins . ”
As it turns out , Von Braunhut is Jewish .
According to the 1988 Washington Post article , he was born to Jeannette Cohen and Edward Braunhut in New York City on March 31 , 1926 , as Harold Nathan Braunhut .
A cousin was quoted in the Post as saying he “ probably ” attended Von Braunhut ’s bar mitzvah .
Gail Gans , director of the Civil Rights Information Center of the ADL , says Von Braunhut may have been allowed to remain in the Aryan Nations even after the startling revelation partly because he is wealthy .
“ If he ’d been a practicing Jew or they thought he was informing , then surely he ’d have been kicked out , ” she says -- and Cochran , who lectures for the ADL , concurs .
He says rumors about Von Braunhut ’s ethnicity had been circulating for years and that members of the Aryan Nations were “ disappointed ” when the Post article appeared with its reference to a bar mitzvah , but that Richard Butler liked Von Braunhut ’s money .
Cochran does not know the extent of Von Braunhut ’s contributions to the Aryan Nations , but says the organization called upon him often .
When the Von Braunhut headlines appeared in 1988 , New Jersey - based Larami Limited held the Sea Monkeys license .
Atamian says Von Braunhut took the company ’s license away because Larami had neglected Sea Monkeys after the enormous success of their Super Soaker water gun .
But Al Davis , executive vice president of Larami , tells a different story .
He says that he received a flurry of phone calls from retailers , wholesalers and distributors concerned that Sea Monkey dollars were going to unsavory places .
“ When I called Harold on this , ” Davis says , “ he said something to me I find hard to believe to this day .
‘ Al , ’ he said .
‘ Hitler was n’t a bad guy .
He just received bad press . ’ ”

In 1994 , Von Braunhut found another licensee , Basic Fun , a Philadelphia - based company that specializes in novelty key chains , to market Sea Monkeys .
Alan Dorfman , president of Basic Fun , says Von Braunhut assured him that the allegations were false and that the bad press had been generated by an enemy with whom he was involved in a property dispute .
But less than a year later , Dorfman , who is Jewish , severed his relationship with Von Braunhut after the New York Times identified Von Braunhut as a featured speaker at the July 1995 Aryan Nations Congress .
It was there that Butler called Jews “ the bacillus of the decomposition of our society . ”
While Basic Fun was in the process of severing its contract , Dorfman says he was approached by Educational Insights , which wanted to take over the Sea Monkeys license .
Dorfman says that the company , whose founder and chairman , Burt Cutler , is Jewish , was aware of Von Braunhut ’s past .
“ We knew through the turn and content of the conversation that they knew what they were getting into , ” Dorfman says .
“ We wished them luck and that was the extent of it . ”

NINE MONTHS AFTER MY FIRST visit to ExploraToy , I drive to Carson again , this time to view the new TV commercial featuring the revamped Sea Monkeys -- which are no longer naked .
“ Having been involved in the marketing to kids , ” Fine said in one of our initial interviews , “ you do n’t want to introduce that as an area of controversy . ”

The specter of Sea Monkey dollars funding hate groups seems to be less controversial .
When I broach the topic with Fine and Atamian , Atamian confirms that all of the higher - ups at Educational Insights know about Von Braunhut ’s past .
He says that everyone in the toy industry knows about him , that people had sent them the articles , but that the Sea Monkeys should n’t be tainted by their inventor .
“ Is this any different than the U.S. government having normal relations with Germany three , four , five , six years after World War II ? ” Atamian asks .
“ We ’re doing business with him on a business basis with a wonderful product called Sea Monkeys , and we do n’t see where it ’s relevant .
I ’ve never seen evidence of his alleged past behavior . ”
Says Fine : “ This has absolutely nothing to do with Harold as a person .
It ’s more to do with who Sea Monkeys are and what they can mean in terms of fun and fantasy for kids and adults of all ages . ”
Cutler agrees .
“ Do you listen to Wagner ?
The Israelis would n’t listen to his music for all those years .
But now they do . ”
Prior to signing their contract , Atamian says he warned Von Braunhut that he ’d heard the allegations , and that if Educational Insights saw any evidence that they were true , Atamian would sever the deal .
But Atamian never asked if the allegations were true .
It seems no one at Educational Insights has ever confronted Von Braunhut about his past -- not even to inquire about the possibility of Sea Monkey profits going to white - supremacist hate groups .
“ I certainly do n’t want to confront him with something like that , ” says Fine .

I leave Atamian and Fine with copies of the National Anti-Zionist newsletter , and they promise to confront Von Braunhut once and for all and ask if he ’s funneling money to hate groups .
Then they ’ll get back to me .
In the meantime , I track down Von Braunhut ’s number and call him myself .
Harold von Braunhut is almost deaf , but loquacious , and his voice is high - pitched .
He says he knows nothing about ExploraToy ’s desire to clothe Sea Monkeys , and as far as he knows , they will remain naked until “ fish wear pants . ”
Then he launches into a story about the Wham - O Instant Fish debacle of the early 1960s , a seminal event in the marketing of Sea Monkeys .
“ Wham - O was flying higher than a kite with the Superball and the Hula Hoop , and they took a risk on an instant fish .
But the fish did n’t work .
The buyer at Sears , Roebuck almost got fired because of it .
So when I took my Sea Monkeys around after that , you ’d think another Ice Age had happened .
The doors that were n’t open to begin with slammed shut in my face .
So I went to comic books .
I did 303 million pages of advertising per year . ”
When I ask Harold about his past , he becomes furious .
He tells me the news reports are lies .
He does n’t take the opportunity to set the record straight , though .
“ I do n’t have to defend myself to you or anyone else .
I ’m hanging up . ”
A few days later , Atamian calls to say he has good news .
He ’s faxed Von Braunhut a copy of the Anti-Zionist newsletter written by Hendrik von Braun , and Von Braunhut has faxed him a note categorically denying that he ’d written it or that he is involved in any such groups .
I ask Atamian if he believes Von Braunhut .
“ All I know is I have to believe him , ” Atamian tells me .
“ Or else how could I live with myself ? ”
He promises to fax me a copy of Von Braunhut ’s letter when he can .
“ The fax machine ’s out of paper now , ” he says .

The fax never comes .
Later that day , Fine calls .
When we had parted a few days earlier , he ’d seemed rattled .
As a Jew , Fine had said , he would have to walk away from Sea Monkeys if it turned out monies were being diverted to anti-Semitic causes .
But he ’s extremely relieved when he calls , telling me that Harold has enemies who wish to see him caught in a vice .
“ Then you believe him ? ” I ask .
Fine pauses a moment .
“ There ’s one thing that makes me feel he did n’t , ” he says .
“ Harold ’s a great writer .
I mean he ’s very articulate and he prides himself on writing great copy .
And that thing you sent me -- it ’s really poorly written . ”
*
IN DECEMBER 1995 , ONE MONTH AFTER SIGNING ON WITH Educational Insights , Von Braunhut officiated at the funeral of Betty Butler , Richard Butler ’s wife .
Since then , Harold von Braunhut has n’t been seen by either the Anti-Defamation League or the Southern Poverty Law Center , both of which have tracked him for years .
“ Once you get past a certain age , ” Floyd Cochran says , “ running around the bushes playing paramilitary games does n’t happen .
That ’s true of a lot of things in life . ”

And if Sea Monkey dollars have been going to hate groups ?
Cutler says he ’ll increase his donations to Morris Dees , co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center .
“ I ’m a major contributor to the center , ” he adds .
If Von Braunhut ’s past is n’t relevant to Sea Monkey sales , ExploraToy ’s new TV commercial certainly may be .
In it , the Sea Monkeys are dressed like rock stars and sing songs that Von Braunhut clearly did not write .
“ Pour us into water , ” they wail .
“ You wo n’t believe your eyes .
We eat .
We grow .
We race .
We ’re into outer space .
We ’re wet and we ’re wild .
‘ Cause you make us come alive . ”
The new Sea Monkey lyrics and attire are startling , but the unexpected cutaways to live brine shrimp are even more so .
They ’re hideous creatures .
Magnified thousands of times , they look like blind white centipedes , and each time they fill the screen , it is a new decimation of fancy , an annihilation of 40 years of Harold ’s own brand of huckstery Americana .
Educational Insights has returned to the Sea Monkeys ’ retro -'70s image for packaging .
Harold ’s vision is intact , at least for now .
A strange , lonely and troubling death . . .
Dead at 33 : Stephen Gately
The news of Stephen Gately 's death was deeply shocking .
It was not just that another young star had died pointlessly .
Through the recent travails and sad ends of Michael Jackson , Heath Ledger and many others , fans know to expect the unexpected of their heroes - particularly if those idols live a life that is shadowed by dark appetites or fractured by private vice .
There are dozens of household names out there with secret and not - so - secret troubles , or damaging habits both past and present .
Robbie , Amy , Kate , Whitney , Britney ; we all know who they are .
And we are not being ghoulish to anticipate , or to be mentally braced for , their bad end : a long night , a mysterious stranger , an odd set of circumstances that herald a sudden death .
In the morning , a body has already turned cold before the first concerned hand reaches out to touch an icy celebrity shoulder .
It is not exactly a new storyline , is it ?
In fact , it is rather depressingly familiar .
But somehow we never expected it of him .
Never him .
Not Stephen Gately .
In the cheerful environs of Boyzone , Gately was always charming , cute , polite and funny .
A founder member of Ireland 's first boy band , he was the group 's co-lead singer , even though he could barely carry a tune in a Louis Vuitton trunk .
He was the Posh Spice of Boyzone , a popular but largely decorous addition .
Gately came out as gay in 1999 after discovering that someone was planning to sell a story revealing his sexuality to a newspaper .
Although he was effectively smoked out of the closet , he has been hailed as a champion of gay rights , albeit a reluctant one .
At the time , Gately worried that the revelations might end his ultra-mainstream career as a pin-up , but he received an overwhelmingly positive response from fans .
In fact , it only made them love him more .
In 2006 , Gately entered into a civil union with internet businessman Andrew Cowles , who had been introduced to him by mutual friends Elton John and David Furnish .
Last week , the couple were enjoying a holiday together in their apartment in Mallorca before their world was capsized .
Boyzone : Gately and his bandmates had a hugely successful career and had recently reformed
All the official reports point to a natural death , with no suspicious circumstances .
The Gately family are - perhaps understandably - keen to register their boy 's demise on the national consciousness as nothing more than a tragic accident .
Even before the post- mortem and toxicology reports were released by the Spanish authorities , the Gatelys ' lawyer reiterated that they believed his sudden death was due to natural causes .
But , hang on a minute .
Something is terribly wrong with the way this incident has been shaped and spun into nothing more than an unfortunate mishap on a holiday weekend , like a broken teacup in the rented cottage .
Consider the way it has been largely reported , as if Gately had gently keeled over at the age of 90 in the grounds of the Bide - a - Wee rest home while hoeing the sweet pea patch .
The sugar coating on this fatality is so saccharine - thick that it obscures whatever bitter truth lies beneath .
Healthy and fit 33 - year - old men do not just climb into their pyjamas and go to sleep on the sofa , never to wake up again .
Whatever the cause of death is , it is not , by any yardstick , a natural one .
Let us be absolutely clear about this .
All that has been established so far is that Stephen Gately was not murdered .
And I think if we are going to be honest , we would have to admit that the circumstances surrounding his death are more than a little sleazy .
After a night of clubbing , Cowles and Gately took a young Bulgarian man back to their apartment .
It is not disrespectful to assume that a game of canasta with 25 - year - old Georgi Dochev was not what was on the cards .
Cowles and Dochev went to the bedroom together while Stephen remained alone in the living room .
Gately 's civil partner , Andrew Cowles , left , and Bulgarian student Georgi Dochev , right , were at the apartment on the night of the singer 's death
What happened before they parted is known only to the two men still alive .
What happened afterwards is anyone 's guess .
A post -mortem revealed Stephen died from acute pulmonary oedema , a build - up of fluid on his lungs .
Gately 's family have always maintained that drugs were not involved in the singer 's death , but it has just been revealed that he at least smoked cannabis on the night he died .
Nevertheless , his mother is still insisting that her son died from a previously undetected heart condition that has plagued the family .
Another real sadness about Gately 's death is that it strikes another blow to the happy - ever - after myth of civil partnerships .
Gay activists are always calling for tolerance and understanding about same - sex relationships , arguing that they are just the same as heterosexual marriages .
Not everyone , they say , is like George Michael .
Of course , in many cases this may be true .
Yet the recent death of Kevin McGee , the former husband of Little Britain star Matt Lucas , and now the dubious events of Gately 's last night raise troubling questions about what happened .
It is important that the truth comes out about the exact circumstances of his strange and lonely death .
As a gay rights champion , I am sure he would want to set an example to any impressionable young men who may want to emulate what they might see as his glamorous routine .
For once again , under the carapace of glittering , hedonistic celebrity , the ooze of a very different and more dangerous lifestyle has seeped out for all to see .
Badly dressed : Tara Palmer - Tomkinson
Tara 's sheer audacity
The dress code for Tatler magazine 's 300th birthday celebrations was Very Tatler .
Socialite Tara Palmer - Tomkinson chose to interpret this by wearing sheer lilac voile up top and boy - shorts down below , complete with matching curtains .
Good grief !
As blouses go , hers seems to have got up and gone .
It is certainly much more yoo - hoo !
than peek - a- boo , would n't you agree ?
Surely the only creature allowed to flash that much nipple in public is a nursing chihuahua ?
Tara , I hate to be the one to break it to you , but you are too old for that look .
In fact , everyone is too old for that look , unless you happen to be Timmy the Tranny , the hat - check personage down at the My - Oh - My supper club in Brighton .
I 'm in the mood for spanx pants
Heave - ho , me hearties !
If we all pull together , we might just manage to get the Nolan Sisters into their matching girdles by curtain - up tonight .
Age has not withered the singing sisters , who have just reformed and embarked on a nationwide tour .
This week , Coleen , 44 , Linda , 50 , Maureen , 45 , and Bernie , 48 , were pictured squeezed into unfortunate , high - waisted matador pants and bulging sparkly tops at one of the first shows in Manchester .
Age has not withered them :
The new - look Nolan sisters
A change of outfit featured black jackets with a white panel down the front which gave the illusion of the girls being nipped in at the waist .
Or , in some cases , of actually having a waist .
While their comeback tour is a giant triumph of spirit over depleted oestrogen , all is not fun on the Nolan front .
Elder sisters Anne , 58 , and Denise , 57 , are fuming at being left out of the new line - up , but be fair , girls , please !
There is only so much glittery fabric a nation 's textile industry can supply at one time .
Still , it is fabulous to have them back and hear their music again .
The Nolans ' big hit , I'm In The Mood ( For Dancing ) , has been reissued as I'm In The Mood ( For A Nice Big Lunch ) , closely followed by And A Nap Afterwards .
The I'm In The Mood Again tour has been billed as the ' ultimate girls ' night out ' and features a combination of the Nolans ' hits and doomed girly anthems such as It 's Raining Men and Holding Out For A Hero .
Oh , my giddy Spanx power panties !
Where can I get a ticket ?
Raise a glass to glorious autumn
In praise of autumn : The season we Brits do best
Thank goodness the cool , crisp days of autumn are here at last .
Do n't complain about the temperature drop , for at heart we are an autumn nation .
We are not summer people .
No way .
We do n't know quite what to do with ourselves in the still , dead heat of a long hot summer .
Not that we ever get a real scorcher , of course .
Yet if we did , we would just carry on cremating barbecue sausages , leaving dogs and babies to sweat in locked cars and moaning about the heat while dressing very , very badly and burning our pale , northern European skins in the noon sun .
Come October , however , and we know exactly what to do .
Now the shortening days have an invigorating chill , but the afternoons are still lit up by a lemon sun .
This is the season for freshly cracked - open books , rough - skinned English apples and woodsmoke ; for piles of russet leaves and the smack of your big soled boots on a city pavement .
' Tis the time for a shot of whisky in a sparkling glass , the blip of venison stew on a low flame and cold , fresh air pouring through the bedroom window at midnight .
It is also time to celebrate the non arrival of the swine flu pandemic , which was supposed to gather strength and take hold in September .
No , our barbecue summer never did materialise .
But neither did swine flu .
I reckon we are quits .
Pumpkin scones ?
Ugh !
I 've just returned from a girls ' weekend in Scotland .
In years gone by , we would have been up to the Plimsoll Line in chilled white wine by 3 pm and have terrorised every eligible bachelor within a ten - mile radius of our rented cottage .
Now it 's all bobble hats , hearty walks and as many teashop stops and scone - eating opportunities as possible .
However , I am shocked at new developments in the scone world .
For decades in the sconeland of my youth , there were only the Big Four : the plain , the sultana , the treacle and the cheese ( the drop and the girdle are just different ways of cooking a basic scone ) .
Yet now there are myriad arriviste scones such as pumpkin , chocolate chip , blueberry , apple and even saffron .
Ugh !
Appalling .
That kind of desecration should be restricted to that mongrel upstart , the muffin .
Incidentally , a Scottish muffin is very different from an English muffin , while the one Americans call an English Muffin is what the Scots call a crumpet .
Elsewhere , Americans call a scone a biscuit , while our biscuits are their cookies .
Perhaps this baked goods confusion is what Lady Gaga is referring to in her her song Poker Face , when she sings about ' bluffin ' with my muffin ' .
Just a Highland thought .
Excessive maternity leave hampers women in the workplace
Why has it taken so long for Labour 's equal rights laws to blow up in their face ?
It is clear to anyone with three brain cells that excessive amounts of maternity leave and gigantic sex discrimination payouts - of the kind shepherded through by Sir Harriet Harman - have not strengthened the position of women in the workplace .
If anything , they have hampered the prospects of many , particularly in a credit - crunched marketplace .
If you are a young , ambitious woman of child - bearing years , any employer is going to think once , twice , three times about you , lady .
Particularly small businesses , who are hammered out of all existence by discriminatory legislation and given no help to thrive .
This government , desperate to appease working mothers at any cost , has alienated employers , not encouraged them .
It goes on and on , but what is clear is that that great citadel of gender gelding , the Government Equalities Office , is doing more harm than good .
So netball and football are to be replaced as school sports by pastimes such as skateboarding and cheerleading .
Pathetic .
When are children going to learn that school sports are something to be endured , not enjoyed ?
He said he supported the new deployments “ in principle ” , saying that before the troops could be sent , certain conditions must be met .
Those terms were that soldiers were properly equipped , that the Afghan government promised more forces to Helmand and that Nato allies bore more of the burden in Afghanistan .

In 1952 , Stanley Miller filled two flasks with chemicals assumed to be present on the primitive Earth , connected the flasks with rubber tubes and introduced some electrical sparks as a stand - in for lightning .
The now famous experiment showed what amino acids , the building blocks of proteins , could easily be generated from this primordial stew .
But despite that seminal experiment , neither he nor others were able to take the next step : that of showing how life ’s code could come from such humble beginnings .
By working with the simplest amino acids and elementary RNAs , physicists led by Rockefeller University ’s Albert J. Libchaber , head of the Laboratory of Experimental Condensed Matter Physics , have now generated the first theoretical model that shows how a coded genetic system can emerge from an ancestral broth of simple molecules .
“ All these molecules have different properties and these properties define their interactions , ” says first author Jean Lehmann , a postdoctoral fellow in the lab , whose work appears in the June issue of PLoS One .
“ What are the constraints that allow these molecules to self - organize into a code ?
We can play with that . ”
The genetic code is a triplet code such that every triplet sequence of letters on messenger RNA corresponds to one of the 20 amino acids that make up proteins .
Molecular adapters called transfer RNAs ( tRNAs ) then convert this information into proteins that can achieve some specific tasks in the organism .
Let ’s say that each triplet sequence on messenger RNA , known as a codon , represents an outlet that can only accept a tRNA with a complementary anticodon .
Translation works because each codon - anticodon match corresponds with an amino acid .
As each tRNA is plugged in , a chain of amino acids is formed in the same order as the codons until translation is complete .
However , primitive tRNAs were not as finicky as tRNAs are today and could load any amino acid known to exist during the time of prebiotic Earth .
Without the ability of tRNAs to discriminate between various amino acids , such a random system might not be able to self - assemble into a highly organized code capable of supporting life .
To find out if it could , Libchaber and Lehmann , together with Michel Cibils at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( EPFL ) in Lausanne , Switzerland , worked with a simple theoretical system .
They took two of the simplest amino acids thought to exist billions of years ago , two primitive tRNAs and an RNA template with two complementary codons , and then developed an algorithm to incrementally change the concentration of each molecule .
Their goal was to see which conditions , if any , could coax the system to specifically translate codons in a nonrandom fashion .
They found that the properties of the molecules set the concentrations at which the molecules needed to exist for a coded regime to emerge .
At these concentrations , the scientists found that a vetting process began to unfold whereby tRNA and amino acid began to seek each other out .
All in all , an elementary translation process depended on two timescales : the time during which a tRNA remains bound to its codon ( hybridization ) and the time it takes for the amino acid on that tRNA to form a new chemical bond with the amino acid next to it ( polymerization ) .
“ It takes a lifetime for the tRNA to dissociate from its codon , ” says Libchaber , who is also Detlev W. Bronk Professor at Rockefeller .
“ If it takes the amino acid loaded on the RNA longer than a lifetime to polymerize to an amino acid nearby , the selection of tRNA and amino acid does n’t occur .
But when the two lifetimes are comparable , even when there is nonspecific loading of an amino acid , a selection process begins to take hold because some amino acids would be more adaptive during that time span — and start what would be the beginning of a code . ”
Although Libchaber and Lehmann point out that the analysis certainly does not provide a full picture of the problem , the work nonetheless brings us one step closer to understanding how life first began .
“ The dream of physicists is to create elementary life , ” Libchaber says .
“ Then we would know that we understand something . ”
A Mugging on Lake Street FROM SEPTEMBER 2009 : A veteran investigative reporter looks into his own beating and finds himself confronting harsh and lingering questions of race
( page 1 of 6 )
“ In my next conscious moment , I was dimly aware that I was facedown on the pavement .
There was blood in my mouth . ”
I was ambushed on the West Side last year , an attack that on its face made no sense .
I ’d never seen my assailant before ; he ’d never seen me ; no words were exchanged ; nothing was taken .
Like many crime victims , I wanted the incident , which changed my life for the worse , to have some meaning .
I ’m white , he is black , and in time it was hard not to wonder if race had something to do with it .
The attack came at about 4:15 on May 9th , a sunny Friday afternoon .
I had ridden my bike to the Loop for a meeting , and on my way back I took my usual route — Fulton west to the Garfield Park Conservatory , then over to Lake Street .
As I neared the intersection of Lake and Laramie , I noticed a group of perhaps six teenagers on a corner .
Pedestrians on Lake Street are low on a cyclist ’s list of potential hazards .
The trestles supporting the Green Line , the behavior they inspire among drivers , and the condition of the pavement command more attention .
The street here passes through an industrial strip , not an area where people hang out , and there was nothing sinister about this group .
One kid with long hair looked my way , smiling broadly .
Another stepped off the curb and paused , as if he had changed his mind about crossing the street in the heavy traffic , his body angled away from me as though he might now head back to the curb .
I kept pedaling .
In my next conscious moment , I was dimly aware that I was facedown on the street .
There was blood in my mouth .
Someone was holding my arm , helping me up .
I looked up to see that I was near the curb and my Good Samaritan was a middle - aged African American man .
“ Sit in my car , ” he said .
“ I ’ll get blood in it , ” I said .
I was now on my feet , not feeling pain or any great emotion — on the planet , but not aware of my place in it yet .
I bent over , resting my hands on my knees , and spat .
A second Samaritan appeared , a white man , middle - aged , with an athlete ’s build .
He had me straighten up so he could better assess the damage to my head .
One of the two men speculated that I ’d been hit with a pipe , and the white man told me that my front teeth had cut clean through my upper lip .
Police cars arrived .
I was of little help .
All I could recall was passing a group of teenagers and one stepping off the sidewalk , but I did n’t think he was close enough to reach me .
A fire truck pulled up , and a group of firemen gathered around .
One with a first - aid kit began cleaning my face , starting around my right eye socket , where the skin had been ripped open .
“ What month is it ? ” he asked .
“ March , ” I said , but then caught myself .
“ May . ”
“ Say that they called you ‘ honky , ’ ” a fireman told me .
If my attackers had indeed said that , they might be charged with a hate crime and face harsher punishments .
The fireman called to the reporting officers , who were now about 15 feet away .
“ They called him ‘ honky , ’ ” he said .
But I must have signaled differently , because nobody leaped at the bait .
One of the plainclothesmen offered to load my bike into the trunk of his unmarked car and deliver it to my house .
The bike is nothing special : a black 12 - speed , modest when I bought it in 1982 , now dented and well chipped , worth perhaps $ 20 on the open market .
But I like the bike , and I was grateful for the officer ’s offer .
Around this time , paramedics arrived , and the African American Samaritan indicated he was going to leave .
I shook his hand .
“ I ca n’t thank you enough for stopping , ” I said .
“ I ’m a Christian , ” he replied .
I was in the ambulance a second later and never got to thank my white Samaritan .
I was taken to West Suburban Medical Center in Oak Park , where the emergency room doctor ordered CT scans to see if I ’d suffered brain damage or fractures of the skull or face .
I had n’t ( I ’d been wearing a helmet ) .
She stitched the cut below my nose and glued the jagged lacerations near my eye .
“ You ’ve got road burn , ” she told me , explaining that parts of the pavement were embedded in my face and would work their way out over the next week or two .
My knee ached and my jaw hurt , but she assured me that no bones were broken .
She gave me a prescription for a painkiller , and about six hours after leaving the Loop , I was sent home .
My daughter took one look at my face and suggested that come Monday , she could walk to school by herself .

This blog is intended to contain a series of tutorials and posts about using a concurrency library for Haskell : Communicating Haskell Processes , or CHP for short .
CHP is a message - passing library that is a bit like MVars and so on in Haskell ( but I hope to show that CHP is more powerful ) and also has some similarity to Erlang .
I ’m going to be assuming that you , the reader , know Haskell already and are looking for ways to write concurrent programs .
There is often confusion around concurrency , parallelism and the difference between the two .
Peyton Jones says in his “ Awkward Squad ” paper that parallelism is about performance and is deterministic ( will always produce the same results ) , whereas concurrency is about design and is non-deterministic .
As an example , consider the stock market .
On any given day there are thousands of traders buying and selling from each other .
Each trader is acting broadly sequentially , but the group of them put together are an interacting concurrent system .
If you took the same set of traders and the same stock levels and re-ran the system , you would not be surprised to get a different set of trades during the day .
The traders are a concurrent system .
In contrast , consider the matter of producing statistics about a day ’s trading .
There might be millions of trades to process , so you may consider splitting the work between several computers .
But you would expect that no matter how you divided up the work , you should always get the same result — anything else would indicate a bug !
The challenge is how to divide up the work to get it done fastest .
This is a parallel processing problem .
CHP actually somewhat blurs the line between the two .
It supports concurrent programming , but if you design your concurrent system well , you can usually get parallel speed - up when the program is executed on a multicore machine .
Anyone who has played with parallel programming will know that getting such a speed - up is not always easy , and often a program designed to go faster on multiple cores or multiple machines may actually go slower than it did on one core !
So you may wonder why it is worth bothering with a concurrent programming library — why not just try for parallel speed - up later on , if and when you need it , but program sequentially until then .
The answer is important :
It is much easier to sequentialise parallel code than it is to parallelise sequential code .
So logically , it is best to start by writing your code as concurrently as possible , and if that turns out to slow your program down , you can sequentialise the concurrent code .
If you started with sequential code , bolting on parallelism later is not very viable .
The functional programming community have been trying to automatically parallelise their programs since the 1980s , and it does not yet seem to have paid off .
When I say that you should start off programming concurrently , this does not mean counting the number of cores you ’re likely to have available ( 2–8 , at the time of writing ) and trying to split your program into roughly that many concurrent processes .
I mean you should write your program with tens , hundreds , thousands , maybe even millions of concurrnet processes ( depending on what fits your program ) .
If it turns out to be too concurrent , you can sequentialise parts .
Write your program with as much concurrency as you can find , then worry about performance later .
I hope to induct you into this concurrent mindset with this blog , using CHP in Haskell .
The figure shown below represents the best measurement of the top quark mass ever obtained by a single experiment , and it is a determination with atotal uncertainty .
It has been approved last week by the CDF experiment at Fermilab .
The CDF experiments collects proton - antiproton collisions delivered by the Tevatron collider , which imparts the projectiles with 1 TeV of energy each , for a center - of - mass energy of 2 TeV .
This is still the highest energy ever achieved by a collider , although the record is going to be soon stripped off Fermilab by the Large Hadron Collider , which is due to start colliding protons with other protons at 7 TeV of energy this coming fall .
CDF collected 630 top pair candidates from 4.3 inverse femtobarns of collisions ( about 300 trillions of them ) in the " single lepton " decay topology : events must have a leptonic W boson decay ( or , id est with an energetic electron or muon decay ) , plus four hadronic jets .
The reconstruction fit for the top quark mass uses a matrix element technique which determines both the most likely top quark mass and the offset from a perfect calibration of the jet energy , the so - called " jet energy scale " factor .
Jet energies are the least well determined quantities in the top decay , and an imprecise calibration is the largest source of systematic uncertainty : by fitting for both quantities together the uncertainty in the top quark mass is minimized , through the use of a two - dimensional likelihood function .
The figure shows the two quantities determined together as contours of equal probability .
The top mass is measured as ( the first uncertainty is statistical , the second is the residual one due to the jet energy scale systematics , and the third one is due to other systematical sources of error ) , orThis is a less than percent uncertainty , and the best result in the World .
Kudos to my colleagues in CDF for this new stellar result !
And kudos to old members of CDF like me , who using merely 7 candidates measured the top mass for the first time back in 1994 as , a measurement which is amazingly still less than one standard deviation away from the most credited numbers !
Now that teenage unemployment has reached 25 percent among those still actively seeking work ( source ) , it seems like a good time to look at regulations that might discourage companies from hiring teenagers .
Economists have traditionally said that the minimum wage law is the primary weapon wielded by older workers against the young .
With a high minimum wage , companies wo n’t want to hire the inexperienced so the next generation will be hobbled in their attempts to build a sufficiently strong resume to unseat the current generation of workers .
At a party here in Massachusetts , I asked a group of comfortable middle - aged folks how they felt about the minimum wage .
All were strongly in favor of a minimum wage law and thought that it benefited entry - level workers .
I asked “ Would n’t a minimum wage , of whatever amount , cause companies to refrain from hiring any worker that was n’t worth the mandated wage ? ”
Absolutely not , the group agreed .
A restaurant would need burger flippers and they would pay whatever the government told them to pay .
I observed that it would be pretty tough to live on the current $ 8 per hour minimum wage here in Massachusetts .
Would n’t it be better to set it at $ 50 per hour ?
If $ 8 is good , surely $ 50 would be better .
“ Maybe that is too high , ” one person said .
They accepted that a $ 50 per hour minimum wage would discourage hiring , but believed that an $ 8 one would not .
What about in their own households ?
Nearly all of these folks employed cleaners , landscapers , babysitters and nannies .
Suppose that the government mandated that they pay their helpers more than they were currently paying .
“ We ’d clean the house ourselves , ” one couple said .
“ I ’d let the weeds grow , ” said another .
“ We would stay home and watch TV instead of hiring a sitter and going out , ” said a parent .
Would a business faced with a minimum wage law behave similarly ?
“ Absolutely not , companies are completely different from consumers , ” was the response .
Why was it more common in California for households to employ helpers than here in Massachusetts ?
Was it because immigrant labor is available at much lower prices than here in Massachusetts ?
That a gardener at $ 10 per hour is appealing to a homeowner than a $ 30 per hour gardener ?
“ No , it is mostly because there are more people available and it is easier to find someone . ”
“ We need the minimum wage for social stability , ” one guest asserted .
I asked if they considered Norway , Singapore , Switzerland , and Sweden to be unstable , as those countries had no minimum wage law .
Then I asked if they thought it made our society more stable to have 25 percent of the young workforce out on the street instead of working at a job .
Not a single person changed his or her mind as a result of my questioning .
Support for the minimum wage remained solid at 100 percent .
WASHINGTON , Oct 21 ( Reuters ) - Oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens told Congress on Wednesday that U.S. energy companies are “ entitled ” to some of Iraq ’s crude because of the large number of American troops that lost their lives fighting in the country and the U.S. taxpayer money spent in Iraq .
Boone , speaking to the newly formed Congressional Natural Gas Caucus , complained that the Iraqi government has awarded contracts to foreign companies , particularly Chinese firms , to develop Iraq ’s vast reserves while American companies have mostly been shut out .
“ They ’re opening them ( oil fields ) up to other companies all over the world ...
We ’re entitled to it , ” Pickens said of Iraq ’s oil .
“ Heck , we even lost 5,000 of our people , 65,000 injured and a trillion , five hundred billion dollars . ”
President Barack Obama has pledged to withdraw U.S. troops in Iraq .
“ We leave there with the Chinese getting the oil , ” Pickens said .
Iraq ’s Oil Minister Hussain al - Shahristani told a Washington conference on Wednesday that his government was happy with the energy auction it held earlier this year .
The auction was the first chance for foreign oil firms to compete for Iraqi oil since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
“ We ’re pleased with scale and participation of the IOC ( International Oil Companies ) and the transparent and public competition , ” Shahristani said at a U.S. - Iraq business and investment conference .
BP and the Chinese oil company CNPC were the only firms to win a contract in Iraq ’s bid round this summer , the first chance for foreign oil firms to compete for Iraqi oil since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
Seven other oil and gas fields failed to attract bidders on the terms Iraq offered .
But a consortium headed by Italy 's ENI ENI .
MI said last week it signed a deal to develop the giant Zubair field for a remuneration fee of $ 2 a barrel .
At Iraq 's oilfield auction in June , the consortium refused to go below $ 4.40 a barrel .
Two consortiums are still competing for a deal to develop the even larger West Quran oilfield .
They are Russia 's LUKOIL LKOH.MM and ConocoPhillips COP.N and another consortium headed by Exxon Mobil XOM.N. ( Reporting by Tom Doggett , additional reporting by Simon Webb ; editing by Jim Marshall )
Twelve people accused of promoting satanism have been arrested in northwest Iran , a newspaper reported today .
" A number of people in the city of Orumiyeh who engaged in the promotion of satanism through underground music and the production of blasphemous video clips were arrested , " the daily Resalat quoted senior police official Kheibar Tiba as saying .
The socially conservative Islamic Republic said last year it would crack down on " indecent Western - inspired movements " such as rappers and satanists .

That move signalled a widening of a clampdown on " immoral " conduct launched in 2007 against women flouting rules dictating that they cover their heads and disguise the shape of their bodies in public , in line with Iran 's Islamic system .
In May , security forces arrested 104 " devil worshippers " and seized drugs and alcohol during a party in a southern city .
Alcohol and narcotics are illegal in Iran .

" LO VEDI , stanno iniziando ad abbandonarci .
Lo sapevo " .
Così il mio caposcorta mi ha salutato ieri mattina .
Il dolore per la protezione che cercano di farmi pesare , di farci pesare , era inevitabile .
La sensazione di solitudine dei sette uomini che da tre anni mi proteggono mi ha commosso .
Dopo le dichiarazioni del capo della mobile di Napoli che gettano discredito sul loro sacrificio , che mettono in dubbio le indagini della Dda di Napoli e dei Carabinieri , la sensazione che nella lotta ai clan si sia prodotta una frattura è forte .
Non credo sia salutare spaccare in due o in più parti un fronte che dovrebbe mostrarsi , e soprattutto sentirsi , coeso .
Società civile , forze dell ' ordine , magistratura .
Ognuno con i suoi ruoli e compiti .
Ma uniti .
Purtroppo riscontro che non è così .
So bene che non è lo Stato nel suo complesso , né le figure istituzionali che stanno al suo vertice a voler far mancare tale impegno unitario .
Sono grato a chi mi ha difeso in questi anni : all 'arma dei Carabinieri che in questi giorni ha mantenuto il silenzio per rispetto istituzionale ma mi ha fatto sentire un calore enorme dicendomi " noi ci saremo sempre " .
Mi ha difeso l'Antimafia napoletana attraverso le dichiarazioni dei pm Federico Cafiero De Raho , Franco Roberti , Raffaele Cantone .
Mi ha difeso il capo della Polizia Antonio Manganelli con le sue rassicurazioni e la netta smentita di ciò che era stato detto da un funzionario .
Mi ha difeso il mio giornale .
Mi hanno difeso i miei lettori .
Ma uno sgretolamento di questa compattezza è malgrado tutto avvenuto e un grande quotidiano se ne è fatto portavoce .
Ciò che dico e scrivo è il risultato spesso di diversi soggetti , di cui le mie parole si fanno portavoce .
Ma si cerca di rompere questa nostra alleanza , insinuando " tanti lavorano nell ' ombra senza riconoscimento mentre tu invece ... " .
Chi fa questo discorso ha un unico scopo , cercare di isolare , di interrompere il rapporto che ha permesso in questi anni di portare alla ribalta nazionale e internazionale molte inchieste e realtà costrette solo alla cronaca locale .
Sento di essere antipatico ad una parte di Napoli e ad una parte del Paese , per ciò che dico per come lo dico per lo spazio mediatico che cerco di ottenere .
Sono fiero di essere antipatico a questa parte di campani , a questa parte di italiani e a molta parte dei loro politici di riferimento .
Sono fiero di star antipatico a chi in questi giorni ha chiamato le radio , ha scritto sui social forum " finalmente qualcuno che sputa su questo buffone " .
Sono fiero di star antipatico a queste persone , sono fiero di sentire in loro bruciare lo stomaco quando mi vedono e ascoltano , quando si sentono messi in ombra .
Non cercherò mai i loro favori , né la loro approvazione .
Sono sempre stato fiero di essere antipatico a chi dice che la lotta alla criminalità è una storia che riguarda solo pochi gendarmi e qualche giudice , spesso lasciandoli soli .
Sono sempre stato fiero di essere antipatico a quella Napoli che si nasconde dietro i musei , i quadri , la musica in piazza , per far precipitare il decantato rinascimento napoletano in un medioevo napoletano saturo di monnezza e in mano alle imprenditorie criminali più spietate .
Sono sempre stato antipatico a quella parte di Napoli che vota politici corrotti fingendo di credere che siano innocui simpaticoni che parlano in dialetto .
Sono sempre stato fiero di risultare antipatico a chi dice : " Si uccidono tra di loro " , perché contiamo troppe vittime innocenti per poter continuare a ripetere questa vuota cantilena .
Perché così permettiamo all '
Italia e al resto del mondo di chiamarci razzisti e vigliacchi se non prestiamo soccorso a chi tragicamente intercetta proiettili non destinati a lui .
Come è accaduto a Petru Birladeanu , il musicista ucciso il 26 maggio scorso nella stazione della metropolitana di Montesanto che non è stato soccorso non per vigliaccheria , ma per paura .
Sono sempre stato fiero di risultare antipatico a chi mal sopporta che vada in televisione o sulle copertine dei giornali , perché ho l'ambizione di credere che le mie parole possano cambiare le cose se arrivano a molti .
E serve l'attenzione per aggregare persone .
Sarò sempre fiero di avere questo genere di avversari .
I più disparati , uniti però dal desiderio che nulla cambi , che chi alza la testa e la voce resti isolato e venga spazzato via com'è successo già troppe volte .
Che chi " opera " sulle vicende legate alla criminalità organizzata e all ' illegalità in generale , continui a farlo , ma in silenzio , concedendo giusto quell ' attenzione momentanea che sappia sempre un po ' di folklore .
E se percorriamo a ritroso gli ultimi trent ' anni del nostro Paese , come non ricordare che Peppino Impastato , Giuseppe Fava e Giancarlo Siani - esposti molto più di me e che prima di me hanno detto verità ora alla portata di tutti - hanno pagato con la vita la loro solitudine .
E la volontà di volerli ridurre , in vita , al silenzio .
Sono sempre stato fiero , invece , di essere stato vicino a un'altra parte di Napoli e del Sud.
Quella che in questi anni ha approfittato della notorietà di qualcuno emerso dalle sue fila per dar voce al proprio malessere , al proprio impegno , alle proprie speranze .
Molti di loro mi hanno accolto con diffidenza , una diffidenza che a volte ha lasciato il posto a stima , altre a critiche , ma leali e costruttive .
Sono fiero che a starmi vicino siano stati i padri gesuiti che mi hanno accolto , le associazioni che operano sul territorio con cui abbiamo fatto fronte comune e tante , tantissime persone singole .
Sono fiero che a starmi vicino sia soprattutto chi , ferocemente deluso dal quindicennio bassoliniano , cerca risposte altrove , sapendo che dalla politica campana di entrambe le parti c'è poco da aspettarsi .
Sono sempre stato fiero che vicino a me ci siano tutti quei campani che non ne possono più di morire di cancro e vedere che a governare siano arrivati politici che negli anni hanno sempre spartito i propri affari con le cosche .
Facendo , loro sì , soldi e carriera con i rifiuti e col cemento , creando intorno a sé un consenso acquistato con biglietti da cento euro .
È stato doloroso vedere infrangersi un fronte unico , costruito in questi anni di costante impegno , che aveva permesso di mantenere alta l'attenzione sui fatti di camorra .
È stato sconcertante vedere persone del tutto estranee alla mia vicenda esprimere giudizi sulla legittimità della mia scorta .
La protezione si basa su notizie note e riservate che , deontologia vuole , non vengano rese pubbliche .
Sono stato costretto a mostrare le ferite , a chiedere a chi ha indagato di poter rendere pubblico un documento in cui si parla esplicitamente di " condanna a morte " .
Cose che a un uomo non dovrebbero mai essere chieste .
Ho dovuto esibire le prove dell ' inferno in cui vivo .
Ho esibito , come richiesto , la giusta causa delle minacce .
Sento profondamente incattivito il territorio , incarognito .
Gli uni con gli altri pronti a ringhiarsi dietro le spalle .
Molti hanno iniziato a esprimere la propria opinione non conoscendo fatti , non sapendo nulla .
Vomitando bile , opinioni qualcuno addirittura ha detto " c'è una sentenza del Tribunale che si è espressa contro la scorta " .
I tribunali non decidono delle scorte , perché tante bugie , idiozie , falsità ?
Addirittura i sondaggi online che chiedevano se era giusto o meno darmi la scorta .
Quanto piacere hanno avuto i camorristi , il loro mondo , lì ad osservare questo sputare ognuno nel bicchiere dell ' altro ?
Dal momento in cui mi è stata assegnata una protezione , della mia vita ha legittimamente e letteralmente deciso lo Stato Italiano .
Non in mio nome , ma nel nome proprio : per difendere se stesso e i suoi principi fondamentali .
Tutte le persone che lavorano con la parola e sono scortate in Italia , sono protette per difendere un principio costituzionale : la libertà di parola .
Lo Stato impone la difesa a chi lotta quotidianamente in strada contro le organizzazioni criminali .
Lo Stato impone la difesa a magistrati perché possano svolgere il loro lavoro sapendo che la loro incolumità fa una grande differenza .
Lo Stato impone la difesa a chi fa inchieste , a chi scrive , a chi racconta perché non può permettere che le organizzazioni criminali facciano censura .
In questi anni , attaccarmi come diffamatore della mia terra , cercare di espormi sempre di più parlando della mia sicurezza , è un colpo inferto non a me , ma allo stato di salute della nostra democrazia e a tutte le persone che vivono la mia condizione .
Sento questo odio silenzioso che monta intorno a me crea consenso in molte partiSta cercando il consenso di certa classe dirigente del
Sud che con il solito cinismo bilioso considera qualunque tentativo di voler rendere se non migliore , almeno consapevole la propria terra , una strategia per fare soldi o carriera .
Ma mi viene chiesta anche l'adesione a un " codice deontologico " , come ha detto il capo della Mobile di Napoli , il rispetto delle regole .
Quali regole ?
Io non sono un poliziotto , né un carabiniere , né un magistrato .
Le mie parole raccontano , non vogliono arrestare , semmai sognano di trasformare .
E non avrò mai " bon ton " nei confronti delle organizzazioni criminali , non accetterò mai la vecchia logica del gioco delle parti fra guardie e ladri .
I camorristi sanno che alcuni di loro verranno arrestati , le forze dell ' ordine sanno in che modo gestire gli arresti che devono fare .
Lo hanno sempre detto a me , ora sono io a ribadirlo : a ognuno il suo ruolo .
La battaglia che porto avanti come scrittore è un'altra .
È fondata sul cambiamento culturale della percezione del fenomeno , non nel rubricarlo in qualche casellario giudiziario o considerarlo principalmente un problema di ordine pubblico .
Continuare a vivere in una situazione così è difficile , ma diviene impossibile se iniziano a frapporsi persone che tentano di indebolire ciò che sino a ieri era un'alleanza importante , giusta e necessaria .
So che è molto difficile vivere la realtà campana , ma c'è qualcuno che ci riesce con tranquillità .
Io non ho mai avuto detenuti che mi salutassero dalle celle , né me ne sarei mai vantato , anzi , pur facendo lo scrittore , ho ricevuto solo insulti .
Qualcuno dice a Napoli che è riuscito a fare il poliziotto riuscendo a passeggiare liberamente con moglie e figli senza conseguenze .
Buon per lui che ci sia riuscito .
Io non sono riuscito a fare lo scrittore riuscendo a passeggiare liberamente con la mia famiglia .
Un giorno ci riuscirò lo giuro .
The Federal Flow of Funds report was released on Thursday with an expected jump in household net worth .
When we did our last report , we stated that with the $ 13.89 trillion in wealth that evaporated to the trough , we would expect a jump in net worth to come from the massive stock market rally .
The report shows this paper wealth gain that started at the end of Q1 .
Household net worth increased by $ 2 trillion from the first quarter to the end of the second quarter of 2009 .
Much of the increase came from the $ 1.36 trillion increase in corporate equities and mutual funds .
Real estate grew by $ 139 billion .
Yet this increase is merely a reflection of all the liquidity being flushed into the equity markets by the Federal Reserve .
Below is a chart of household net worth :
Keep in mind that American households are still down by $ 12 trillion from the peak reached in 2007 .
This quarterly move would be more significant if unemployment and government funds were less of a short - term mover .
If anything , what this report tells us is that the only thing that is rallying from the bottom is equities .
It is gathering massive steam and price / earnings ratios are not being reflected in the real world .
What we see in the current report is merely the reflection of the 60 percent stock market rally .
From April to June , the market rallied significantly :
Since then , the third quarter has also seen another increase in the trend upward .
So we should expect that when the Q3 report is released that household net worth will increase again driven by equities again .
As you can tell , real estate is no longer the driving force even though it is the largest line item for U.S. households .
Current U.S. household net worth : $ 53 trillion
U.S. household real estate : $ 20 trillion
So real estate makes up nearly 40 percent of household net worth .
Keep in mind that $ 20 trillion in real estate is secured by $ 10.4 trillion in mortgages many that are now going bad .
Interestingly enough , if you look at the mortgage data it peaks around $ 10.54 trillion and has fallen to $ 10.4 trillion .
Do we really think that only a few hundred billion in mortgages have gone bad ?
This is simply a reflection of banks not writing down option ARMs and other questionable assets .
The commercial real estate debt is going to hit and cause more losses in the years to come .
Yet this is part of the trend that we will not be seeing in the Q3 report .
And if you really want to see something frightening in the report , just look at total debt outstanding :
If you add it up , American households have $ 13.74 trillion in debt .
But look at what American business have in debt .
That is another $ 11.2 trillion and you can rest assured much of that commercial real estate is sitting there .
State and local governments are saddled with $ 2.2 trillion in debt and we all know how tough things are for state governments .
Unlike the Federal government , states do not have access to the printing press known as the U.S. Treasury so they have to operate in a financial reality that the Federal government seems to ignore .
The debt is coming out of everywhere .
Much of this debt is secured by real estate and commercial properties that are still being valued at peak prices .
Stocks reflect optimistic scenarios .
So we will see another leg down in 2010 possibly as early as Q4 of 2009 since we are starting to see already some weakness of the $ 13 trillion in financial bailouts and backstops .
And if anyone thinks that we will ever payoff some $ 33 trillion in debt they are out of their minds .
I ’ll let you run the math on that one so you can see how laughable this is .
Think about it .
If our GDP is $ 14 trillion or so , it would take us over 2 years of full U.S. productivity to pay off this debt .
That will never happen because we are spending along the way .
This is like a household making $ 30,000 a year needing to pay off a $ 3 million loan .
As long as the monthly payment is low , not a big deal right ?
But we ’ll be paying this stuff off for centuries .

The crowd at Mountaineer Field gave UConn a lengthy ovation as the players took the field .
West Virginia coach Bill Stewart gave Connecticut 's Randy Edsall a hug and the teams exchanged handshakes before kickoff .
Howard was stabbed to death early last Sunday outside a university - sponsored dance .
No one has been charged in his death .
The funeral is Monday in his hometown of Miami .
" It 's been a tough week , but what this game does is provide some normalcy to the kids , " said Scott Edwards , whose son , Matt , is a redshirt freshman defensive back for Connecticut .
" It 's been a really terrible week , but it gets them back to what they know and love and it's important for them to be back on the field , " he said .
" By playing these guys today , they 're honoring Jasper Howard .
It 's important for their healing and our healing as well . "
UConn running back Andre Dixon and wide receiver Kashif Moore carried Howard 's helmet and No. 6 jersey from the lockerroom before kickoff .
Players from both teams wore stickers on their helmets during the game , won by West Virginia 28 - 24 .

80's music fans might remember him from his appearances in many Cyndi Lauper music videos , including " Girls Just Want To Have Fun " , " She Bop " , " Time After Time " and " The Goonies ' R ' Good Enough . "
As gamers , we of course remember him as the best live - action Mario of all time .
That 's not saying much when your chief competition is Bob Hoskins , but at least he was Italian .
The Super Mario Bros. Super Show !
might have only run a grand total of 52 episodes , but that was more than enough to cement Captain Lou 's place in gaming history .

Breaking News : WWE Hall Of Famer Passes Away [ PWMania.com - Thanks Matt ]
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Major world central banks announced on Thursday that they planned to scale back massive injections of U.S. dollars into their banking systems as financial markets stabilize after a devastating crisis .

The U.S. Federal Reserve said it would begin to scale back short - term cash auctions in early 2010 , while the European Central Bank , the Swiss National Bank , and the Bank of England announced they would curtail steps taken to ensure dollar liquidity .
The joint actions signaled a gradual removal of extraordinary measures central banks around the world have taken to prop up banks and financial systems during the worst period of instability since the Great Depression in the 1930s .
“ These emergency financing programs have done their jobs to stabilize credit markets , ” said Alex Roever , a strategist for J.P. Morgan Securities in New York .
The joint move comes as leaders of the world ’s 20 major economies gather in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania to discuss the aftermath of the financial crisis .
They are expected to pledge to coordinate their withdrawal of government support for economies that are beginning to stabilize after the meltdown .
Analysts said the move shows central banks see less pressure on banks for short - term cash , but should not be seen as a move to begin to withdraw the monetary policy stimulus to economies that remain fragile .
“ This is n’t part of the exit strategy per se , ” said Chris Rupkey , an economist for Bank of Tokyo / Mitsubishi UFJ in New York .
“ It just recognizes that banks have less need for liquidity . ”
The Fed said it will trim the sizes and maturity lengths of auctions , while continuing Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) short - term cash auctions at least through January .
“ These schedules are consistent with the intention ... to gradually scale back these facilities in response to continued improvements in financial markets , ” the Fed said in a statement .
The U.S. central bank said it has adjusted the auctions to take into account anticipated heightened market pressures at year end .
It said it would cut the size of 84 - day auctions to $ 50 billion in October and $ 25 billion in November and December , while reducing the maturities of those auctions .
It also said it will consider putting in place some type of permanent auction facility for short - term funds .
The ECB said it would scale back its provision of U.S. dollar liquidity to just one - week funds .
It said it would keep providing U.S. dollar funds until January , but would stop 84 - day operations after the operation on October 6 , although they could be restarted in the future if needed .
The Bank of England announced plans to suspend its three - month dollar repurchase operations after the last one on October 6 but will continue to offer 7 day funds until January .
The Swiss National Bank said it will stop 84 - day dollar liquidity operations .

It ’s not unusual in California to see from 1,500 to 2,000 sea lion deaths on our beaches each year .
But this year is off – way off – and no one can figure out why .
Starting in May and continuing through September , an unexpected onslaught of emaciated , young sea lions has been beached along the coast , requiring a tremendously heightened response among the marine mammal rescue networks throughout the state .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , which coordinates these networks , is just as concerned about what is happening offshore at sea lion breeding colonies in California ’s Channel Islands : Unusually high levels of mortality among the 59,000 pups born in this past spring .
“ In one study area , 6,000 pup mortalities were observed where the average had been 1,000 to 1,500 , ” said Jeff Lake of NOAA ’S National Marine Mammal Lab ( NMML ) .
Beach goers have seen – and smelled – the signs that something is amiss .
I ’ve spotted many carcasses myself throughout the summer months and was surprised to encounter so many visitors soaking up surf and sand and picnicking on rocks amid rotting , decomposing mammals .
The rank smell just about knocked me out while exploring Costanoa with my husband .
And in recent days , I ’ve passed several rotting sea lions on the beach at Fort Funston , where I run .
Naughty dogs go wild , barking and sniffing those sad decaying bodies with empty , hallowed - out eyes .
“ We refer to marine mammals as a sentinel species that is like us and can provide a barometer of what is happening to our own ecosystem , ” Trevor Spradlin of NOAA ’s Washington D.C. office tells me .
“ The sea lions have tapped out with a record number of cases of the mammals starving and since it cannot be linked to an El NiÃ±o , folks are scratching their heads . ”
Perhaps puzzling now , the deaths are typical during an El NiÃ±o , such as the one experienced in 1997 - 1998 , due to changes in water surface temperatures and a lack of upwelling .
Ocean upwelling is the mixing of deep cold water at the bottom of the ocean with warm water at the surface so that the cold water and nutrients that fertilize aquatic plants that form the food web can rise to the surface layers while warm water travels to the mid to deep depths .
Such areas are very rich along the coast and that is where you find the anchovies , squid and sardines pinnipeds feed on .
While this is n’t the time for such a cycle , scientists are still seeing the oceanographic changes caused by the dying of winds in late April and June .
There was no way to pull the vital nutrient - filled waters to the surface .
This has been a large contributor to the starvation .
“ A huge number of pups were born this year in the Channel Islands and the breakdown in the upwelling may have resulted in the fish moving to other areas inaccessible to young sea lions looking for food for the first time , ” observes Joe Cordaro , a wildlife biologist and marine mammal strandings coordinator at NOAA National Marines Fisheries Southwest Regional Office in Long Beach , CA .
“ Unlike the older animals , the young pups cannot follow the fish wherever they go . ”
Cordaro says scientists also are considering the theory that upwelling has been so great , it has acted like a conveyor belt transporting nutrients to other areas .
Either way , he agrees , nature is acting just like it does in an El NiÃ±o .
“ We do have one developing in the Tropics , and if it continues to develop , it will be nothing compared to what we are now seeing in strandings and deaths , ” says Cordaro .
“ It will pretty much wipe out the reproductive year , slowing down the rate of increase in the population . ”
He adds that there is no way it will make a huge dent in the population , itself , because the sea lions have been increasing since the last El NiÃ±o with the current population of California sea lions at about 239,000 .
The big mystery is why the lack of upwelling has occurred in some areas while not in others .
An investigation into the mystery is being led by Dr. Frances Gulland , Director of Veterinary Science at the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito .
No one knows yet if any of this can be attributed to climate change .
They do know that nothing like this occurred last year .
Meantime , beach visitors are asked to continue reporting sea lion strandings to the Sausalito center ( 415)298-SEAL rather than trying to coax mammals back into the water .
Also , always stay back from the dead mammals found on the beach and keep your dogs away , as well .
For animal removal , you should contact the beach maintenance service in your city .
Some have policies of removing the carcasses , while others allow them to remain , despite the ghastly smell .
While the dead animals provide food for sea birds and fowl , the sea lions are usually contaminated from pesticides and other toxins dumped into our oceans over time .
Cordaro says it is n’t in the best interest of scavengers to feed on the carcasses .
“ They do n’t die from eating contaminants but their eggs become thin and crack before hatching , ” he says .
“ It effects the reproduction of the next generation . ”

An international coalition of citrus farming and agriculture officials is launching a cross - border plan to suppress the march of a tiny insect that threatens California ’s $ 1.6 - billion citrus industry .
The insect often carries a disease that kills citrus trees and has ravaged orchards in Florida as well as overseas .
After a series of meetings this week in Monterrey , Mexico , the coalition said Friday that the nations had agreed to work together to develop strategies to hold down the population of the insect , impose quarantines on the movements of plants and conduct more tests to see how the disease is spreading .
In addition to the U.S. and Mexico , others participating in the plan include Belize , Costa Rica , the Dominican Republic , El Salvador , Guatemala , Nicaragua and Panama .
They are trying to limit the spread of the Asian citrus psyllid , which is starting to populate Southern California .
The insect often is a carrier of citrus greening disease , also called Huanglongbing , or HLB .
So far , the nearest outbreaks of citrus greening have been in Louisiana and Mexico ’s Yucatan peninsula .

“ HLB is like a wildfire with unlimited fuel , and all of our respective countries have to be prepared for when the wind starts blowing in our direction , ” said Jim Cranney , president of the California Citrus Quality Council in Auburn .
“ We are sharing information within this group and learning from each other in the process . ”
In August , citrus greening disease was discovered in six citrus trees in the Yucatan peninsula city of El Cuyo .
In July , officials found a psyllid that carried the disease in Belize , several hundred miles to the south .
Cranney said the psyllid is present in large numbers in Mexico and could spread HLB quickly unless steps are taken to control its progress .
The plan agreed to at the meeting is designed to prevent that scenario , he said .
“ Mexico is a critical battlefield for fighting HLB , ” Cranney said .
He believes the disease is working its way toward the heart of Mexico ’s commercial citrus - producing regions in Veracruz .

“ By helping Mexico and others , we are helping ourselves .
HLB is a death sentence delivered by the Asian citrus psyllid , ” he said .
A pilot program in Tijuana that traps for the psyllid and then applies pesticides to the neighboring trees in an attempt to knock down the population is part of the effort by the coalition , Cranney said .
“ We also will be working with Mexico on research projects on how to better control the spread of the insect .
The research will focus on areas with the same climate conditions that exist in California ’s citrus - growing regions , ” he said .
The group is also stepping up testing of psyllids in Mexico to see whether they are carriers of the disease .

“ Each of the respective countries are looking at their budgets and assessing where there are gaps .
Mexico , for example , is helping to fund what ’s going on in Belize , and the program in Tijuana is being paid for by the U.S. Department of Agriculture , ” Cranney said .
Over the last year , California has developed its own population of psyllids that migrated from Mexico , but none so far has proved to carry citrus greening .
However , if the bugs feed on an infected tree , they probably would spread the disease around the state , agriculture officials said .
So far , officials have trapped uninfected psyllids in Los Angeles , Orange , Imperial and San Diego counties .
Entomologists expect the bug to make its way up to the prime citrus - growing regions of Ventura , Kern , Tulare and Fresno counties over the next year or two .
They say it ’s only a matter of time before the Huanglongbing disease finds its way to California from Mexico or elsewhere .
In July , the California Department of Food and Agriculture said that a detection dog working with inspectors at a FedEx depot in Fresno discovered luggage that contained curry leaves shipped from India .
The leaves were infested with juvenile psyllids that were carriers of the disease .
The insects were destroyed .

The disease does not affect humans , but it does ruin the taste of citrus fruit and juice before killing the plants .
There is no known cure .
Most experts believe the first spotting of the disease will be on a backyard tree rather than a commercial orange grove .
That ’s why they are urging homeowners to learn what to look for at www.california citrusthreat.orgor by calling the California Department of Food and Agriculture hotline at ( 800 ) 491-1899 .

Featherstitch : Killing fsync( ) softly
This article brought to you by LWN subscribers Subscribers to LWN .
net made this article — and everything that surrounds it — possible .
If you appreciate our content , please buy a subscription and make the next set of articles possible .
Soft updates , a method of maintaining on - disk file system consistency through carefully ordering writes to disk , have only been implemented once in a production operating system ( FreeBSD ) .
You can argue about exactly why they have not been implemented elsewhere , and in Linux in particular , but my theory is that not enough file systems geniuses exist in the world to write and maintain more than one instance of soft updates .
Chris Frost , a graduate student at UCLA , agrees with the too - complicated - for - mere - mortals theory .
That 's why in 2006 , he and several co-conspirators at UCLA wrote the Featherstitch system for keeping on - disk data consistent .
Featherstitch is a generalization of the soft updates system of write dependencies and rollback data .
The resulting system is general enough that most ( possibly all ) other file system consistency strategies ( e.g. , journaling ) can be efficiently implemented on top of the Featherstitch interface .
What makes Featherstitch unique among file systems consistency techniques is that it exports a safe , efficient , non-blocking mechanism to userland applications that lets them group and order writes without using fsync ( ) or relying on file system - specific behavior ( like ext3 data=ordered mode ) .
Featherstitch basics : patches , dependencies , and undo data
What is Featherstitch , other than something file system aficionados throw in your face whenever you complain about soft updates being too complicated ?
Featherstitch grew out of soft updates and has a lot in common with that approach architecturally .
The main difference between Featherstitch and soft updates is that the latter implements each file system operation individually with a different specialized set of data structures specific to the FFS file system , while Featherstitch generalizes the concept of a set of updates to different blocks and creates one data structure and write - handling mechanism shared by all file system operations .
As a result , Featherstitch is easier to understand and implement than soft updates .
Featherstitch records all changes to the file system in " patches " ( the dearth of original terminology in software development strikes again ) .
A patch includes the block number , a linked list of patches that this patch depends on , and the " undo data . "
The undo data is a byte - level diff of the changes made to this block by this patch , including the offset , length , and contents of the range of bytes overwritten by this change .
Another version of a patch is optimized for bit - flip changes , like those made to block bitmaps .
The rule for writing patches out to storage is simple :
If any of the patches this patch depends on - its dependencies - are n't confirmed to be written to disk , this patch can't be written yet .
In other words , patches and dependencies look a lot like a generic directed acyclic graph ( DAG ) , with patches as the circles and dependencies as the arrows .
If you are a programmer , you 've probably drawn hundreds or thousands of these pictures in your life .
Just imagine a little diff hanging off each circle and you 've got a good mental model for thinking about Featherstitch .
The interesting bits are around reducing the number of little circles - in the first implementation , the memory used by Featherstitch undo data was often twice that of the actual changes written to disk .
For example , untarring a 220 MB kernel source tree allocated about 460 MB of undo data .
The acyclic -ness of Featherstitch patch dependencies deserves a little more attention .
It is the caller 's responsibility to avoid creating circular patch dependencies in the first place ; Featherstitch does n't detect or attempt to fix them .
( The simplified interface exported to userspace makes cycles impossible to create in the first place , more about that later . )
However , lack of circular dependencies among patches does not imply a lack of circular dependencies between blocks .
Patches are a record of a change to a block and each block can have multiple outstanding patches against it .
Imagine a patch dependency , patch A depends on patch B , which depends on patch C . That is , A->B->C , where " -> " reads as " depends on . "
If patch A applies to block 1 , and patch B applies to block 2 , and patch C applies to block 1 , then viewing the blocks and their outstanding patches as a whole , you have a circular dependency where block 1 must be written before block 2 , but block 2 must also be written before block 1 .
This is called a " block - level cycle " and it causes most of the headaches in a system based on write ordering .
The way both soft updates and Featherstitch resolve block level cycles is by keeping enough information about each change to roll it back .
When it comes time to write a block , any applied patches which can't be written yet ( because their dependencies have n't been written yet ) are rolled back using their undo data .
In our example , with A -> B->C and A and C both applied to block 1 , we would roll back A on block 1 , write block 1 with patch C applied , write B's block , and then write block 1 a second time with both patch A and C applied .
Optimization
The first version of Featherstitch was elegant , general purpose , easy to understand , and extraordinarily inefficient .
On several benchmarks , the original implementation allocated over twice as much memory for patches and undo data as needed for the actual new data itself .
The system became CPU - bound with as few as 128 blocks in the buffer cache .
The first goal was to reduce the number of patches needed to complete an operation .
In many cases , a patch will never be reverted - for example , if we write to a file 's data block when no other writes are outstanding on the file system , then there is no reason we 'd ever have to roll back to the old version of the block .
In this case , Featherstitch creates a " hard patch " - a patch that does n't keep any undo data .
The next optimization is to merge patches when they can always be written together without violating any dependencies .
A third optimization merges overlapping patches in some cases .
All of these patch reduction techniques hinge on the Featherstitch rules for creating patches and dependencies , in particular that a patch 's dependencies must be specified at creation time .
Some opportunities for merging can be detected at patch creation time , others when a patch commits and is removed from the queue .
The second major goal was to efficiently find patches ready for writing .
A normal buffer cache holds several hundred thousand blocks , so any per-block data structures and algorithms must be extremely efficient .
Normally , the buffer cache just has to , in essence , walk a list of dirty blocks and issue writes on them in some reasonably optimal manner .
With Featherstitch , it can find a dirty block , but then it has to walk its list of patches checking to see if there is a subset whose dependencies have been satisfied and are therefore ready for writing .
This list can be long , and it can turn out that none of the patches are ready , in which case it has to give up and go on to the next patch .
Rather than randomly searching in the cache , Featherstitch instead keeps a list of patches that are ready to be written .
When a patch has committed , the list of patches that depended on it is traversed and newly ready patches added to the list .
With these optimizations , the memory overhead of Featherstitch dropped from 200+ % to 4 - 18 % in the set of benchmarks used for evaluation - still high , but in the realm of practicality .
The optimizations described above were only partially implemented in some cases , leaving more room for improvement without any further insight .
Performance
data=writeback
data=full
For head - to - head performance comparisons , the authors implemented several versions of file system consistency using the Featherstitch patch interface and compared them to the ext2 and ext3 equivalents .
Using ext2 as the on - disk file system format , they re-implemented soft updates , metadata - only journaling , and full data / metadata journaling .
Metadata - only journaling corresponds to ext3 ' smode ( file data is written without regard to the state of file system metadata that refers to it ) and full journaling corresponds to ext3 ' smode ( all file data is written directly to the journal along with file system metadata ) .
The benchmarks used were extraction of a ~ 200 MB tar file ( the kernel source code , natch ) , deletion of the results of previous , a Postmark run , and a modified Andrew file system benchmark - in other words , the usually motley crew of terrible , incomplete , unrepresentative file system benchmarks we always run because there 's nothing better available .
The deficiency shows : under this workload , ext3 performed about the same in data=writeback and data=ordered mode ( not usually the case in real - world systems ) , which is one of the reasons the authors did n't implement ordered mode for Featherstitch .
The overall performance result was that the Featherstitch implementations were at par or somewhat better with the comparable ext3 version for elapsed time , but used significantly more CPU time .
Patchgroups : Featherstitch for userspace
So , you can use Featherstitch to re-implement all kinds of file system consistency schemes - soft updates , copy - on - write , journaling of all flavors - and it will go about as fast the old version while using up more of your CPU .
When you have big new features like checksums and snapshots in btrfs , it 's hard to get excited about an under - the - covers re-implementation of file system internals .
It 's cool , but no one but file systems developers will care , right ?
In my opinion , the most exciting application of Featherstitch is not in the kernel , but userland .
In short , Featherstitch exports an interface that applications can use to get the on - disk consistency results they want , AND keep most of the performance benefits that come with re-ordering and delaying writes .
Right now , applications have only two practical choices for controlling the order of changes to the file system :
Wait for all writes to a file to complete using fsync ( ) , or rely on file system - specific implementation details , like ext3 data=ordered mode .
Featherstitch gives you a third option : Describe the exact , minimal ordering relationship between various file system writes and then let the kernel re-order , delay , and otherwise optimize the writes as much possible within those constraints .
The userland interface is called " patchgroups . "
The interface prevents the two major pitfalls that usually accompany exporting a kernel - level consistency mechanism to userspace .
First , it prevents deadlocks caused by dependency cycles ( " Hey , kernel !
Write A depends on write B !
And , oh yeah , write B depends on write A !
Have a nice day ! " ) .
In the kernel , you can define misuse of the interface as a kernel bug , but if an application screws up a dependency , the whole kernel grinds to a halt .
Second , it prevents applications from stalling their own or other writes by opening a transaction and holding it open indefinitely while it adds new changes to the transaction ( or goes off into an infinite loop , or crashes , or otherwise fails to wrap up its changes in a neat little bow ) .
The patchgroups interface simply says that all of those writes over there must be on - disk before any of these writes over here can start being written to disk .
Any other writes that happen to be going on outside of these two sets can go to disk in any order they please , and the writes inside each set are not ordered with respect to each other either .
Here 's a pseudo - code example of using patchgroups :
/* Atomic update of a file using patchgroups */ /*
Create a patch group to track the creation of the new copy of the file */ copy_pg = pg_create ( ) ; /*
Tell it to track all our file systems changes until pg_disengage ( ) */ pg_engage ( copy_pg ) ; /*
Open the source file , get a temporary filename , etc. */ /*
Create the temp file */ temp_fd = creat ( ) ; /*
Copy the original file data to the temp file and make your changes */ /*
All changes done , now wrap up this patchgroup */ pg_disengage ( copy_pg ) ;
The temp file now contains the new version of the file , and all of the related file system changes are part of the current patchgroup .
Now we want to put the following rename ( ) in a separate patchgroup that depends on the patchgroup containing the new version of the file .
/* Start a new patchgroup for the rename ( ) */ rename_pg = pg_create ( ) ; pg_engage ( rename_pg ) ; /* * MAGIC OCCURS HERE :
This is where we tell the system that the * rename ( ) can't hit disk until the temporary file 's changes have * committed .
If you do n't have patchgroups , this is where you would * fsync ( ) instead . fsync( ) can also be thought of as : * * pg_depend ( all previous writes to this file , this_pg ) ; * pg_sync ( this_pg ) ; */ /*
This new patchgroup , rename_pg , depends on the copy_pg patchgroup */ pg_depend ( copy_pg , rename_pg ) ; /* This rename ( ) becomes part of the rename_pg patchgroup */ rename ( ) ; /* All set ! */ pg_disengage ( rename_pg ) ; /* Cleanup. */ pg_close ( copy_pg ) ; pg_close ( rename_pg ) ;
Short version :
No more " Firefox fsync ( ) " bug , O_PONIES for everyone who wants them and very little cost for those who do n't .
Conclusion
fsync ()
Featherstitch is a generalization and simplification of soft updates , with reasonable , but not stellar , performance and overhead .
Featherstitch really shines when it comes to exporting a useful , safe write ordering interface for userspace applications .
It replaces the enormous performance - destroying hammer ofwith a minimal and elegant write grouping and ordering mechanism .
When it comes to the Featherstitch paper itself , I highly recommend reading the entire paper simply for the brief yet accurate summaries of complex storage - related issues .
Sometimes I feel like I 'm reading the distillation of three hours of the Linux Storage and File Systems Workshop plus another couple of weeks of mailing list discussion , all in one paragraph .
For example , section 7 describes , in a most extraordinarily succinct manner , the options for correctly flushing a disk 's write cache , including specific commands , both SCSI and ATA , and a brief summary of the quality of hardware support for these commands .
Many major search engines ( Google , Yahoo , Bing , MSN ) now have the capability to index PDF files and return them in search results .
If you are a Web site owner with PDF files on your site , this is good news .
If you are an SEO , you also know that the new capability presents potential usability problems .
And what exactly is the big deal ?
Let ’s find out .
Searching for “ blessing of a Christmas tree ” on Google returns a link to a PDF file as the first result :
http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=BLESSING+OF+A+CHRISTMAS+TREE
If searchers click on it , the link automatically opens a PDF file with no navigation back to the main site .
Users are trapped !
So , what ’s going on and , more importantly , how to do we fix it ?
Essentially , the PDF format is not the culprit ; the real problem is the author ’s failure to create the files with Web users in mind .
PDF authoring software , such as Adobe Acrobat 5.0 , offers the ability to include both a navigational structure and hyperlinks on a PDF page .
Ideally , the best solution is to create your pages in HTML , rather than PDF format .
Depending on the purpose , however , a PDF format can be preferable .
For example , PDF files offer better functionality for pages that are commonly printed , such as order forms and price lists .
To avoid the PDF USER TRAP , you will have to republish your files , adding some type of navigation structure and / or link back your main Web site .
This is the best option for SEO ’s , because it allows the pages to still be indexed .
If this is not an option , the next best solution is to place all of your PDF files in a single folder and do a robots exclusion .
Eight Years after 9/11 The Bloody Legacy of Cheney 's Failures
After 9/11 , Dick Cheney took the reins in America .
The ' war on terror ' was his idea , and it led to real wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- and to the torture he approved and defends .
While Cheney is writing a memoir to influence how people see his role , the rest of the world would just prefer to get on with cleaning up his mess -- with him out of the picture .
The Big Corporate Media is giving the " Birthers " a second wind of publicity , when they should have been confined to the loony bin after their first wave of press coverage .
That is in large part due to two realities :
1 ) The Big Corporate Media that runs television covers the lunatic fringe right as though they have a legitimate role in news , while ignoring meaningful ideas from progressives that stray from the self - defined " center " ( which is any idea that wo n't upset entrenched wealth and power ) and ; 2 ) the media loves , as Chris Hedges calls it in his brilliant new book on the topic , " spectacle . "
In a society that no longer can distinguish between entertainment , fact , celebritydoom , and politics , " spectacle " boosts ratings .
One of the best articles written on the ubiquitous , disputatatious face of the birther movement , Orly Taitz , is in the Orange County Weekly News , where she practices dentistry ( when not threatening legal action using a law degree that she received over the Internet ) .
The article offers a full picture of Taitz 's peculiar and factually unfounded crusade , but the most telling quote may be from a blogger who critically keeps track of her largely theatrical activity ( no court has upheld any of her legal challenges , or of her rivals for the birther mantle , including attorney Philip Berg -- her nemesis in the movement ) :
Patrick McKinnion of Yes to Democracy puts it a different way : " There 's a certain amount of fascination with unbridled insanity , and that 's what you 're seeing with the birthers : a level of hatred that borders , if not absolutely pole - vaults , into insanity . "
In a sidebar article in the Orange County Weekly News on Taitz ( in which we learn that she claims to have a black belt in Taekwondo ) , McKinnion comments :
Good article .
The sad part is that people like Dr. Orly are so blinded by their hatred that they 're not seeing the things around them - or who they 're associating with .
The day after I was interviewed for this piece , a gunman who turned out to be a Neo - Nazi shot two guards and killed one at the National Holocaust Museum .
Turns out he was posting the same claims and demands that Dr. Orly posts .
She 's freely associating with people fully willing to hate her simply due to her faith , and that 's pretty sad .
( One birther in particular , Andy Martin , is a known anti-semite )
The major flaw with the entire birther cause is that there is not a single piece of credible evidence that supports any of their claims .
No Pakistan travel ban .
No way for a US minor citizen to give up their US citizenship .
No credible proof of forgery ( just the writings of faceless , nameless internet " experts " .
A full recording with Sarah Obama that she says clearly " born in Hawaii " .
Not a single piece of evidence to back up any of their claims .
Instead they demand you take it all on faith - and proclaim any evidence to the contrary to be part of the " conspiracy " .
And the people involved are just as questionable as the evidence .
A dentist [ Taitz ] with a law degree from an on - line unaccredited law school .
But one of the biggest ironies in this tragic farce of a television media -- particularly cable -- that diverts attention from real issues with coverage of such a psychotic " movement , " is that Orly Taitz is herself not born in the U.S.
She was raised in Moldavia , during the Soviet Era , was allowed to emigrate to Israel ( where she met her husband ) , and in turn they moved to the U.S. at a time when the government was allowing former Soviet Jews a large quota to immigrate and proceed on a citizenship track .
We saw the MSNBC interview the other night when Shuster and another reporter questioned Taitz , who was in a studio in Tel Aviv , with an aggressive grilling the likes of which I had n't recalled seeing on corporate media , except on Hannity or Bill O'Reilly when they have a " liberal " rabbit in their sites .
Taitz , who has a heavy accent , kept trying to bully her way out of directly answering questions .
( It reminded me of debating an NRA true believer . )
The birther movement is full of malcontents -- anti-Semites , skinheads , political malcontents , white firsters , and a radical right wing Jew -- in the case of Taitz , I speculate ( as a Jew who knows the landscape of Israeli politics ) -- who fears for Israel ( in the Netanyahu paranoid style ) under Obama .
The birthers are a group of psychos who would be shooting each other if they did n't share a common hatred of Obama and the fear of America becoming a nation where whites are in the minority and our foreign policy is to join as partners in the international community .
Only in America would corporate big media spend such extensive amounts of time covering a foreign - born and raised nutcase challenging the nationality of the president of the United States .

Just Get There
July 30 , 2009 Just Get ThereJuly 30 , 2009
The media is reporting on the governments preparation for a massive vaccination campaign this fall for the hyped up H1N1 hybrid flu virus .
Recently Katherine Sebelius , the Health and Human Services Secretary , granted legal immunity for vaccine manufacturers during the stage 6 pandemic declared by the WHO .
Even more troubling than the new vaccines or antivirals themselves , is the Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) declared by the FDA , which enables the use of expired stockpiles of Tamiflu or Relenza , and non-compliance with label requirements .
The EUA authority will also permit the FDA to allow the use of “ unapproved or uncleared medical products ” during an established emergency .
A large percentage of the public who are informed of these facts will simply refuse the shot , but face government threats of home interventions through provisions in the Health Care bill , compulsory vaccination and quarantine .
The new stock of vaccines the governments purchased , has been fast tracked for approval by the FDA .
Health officials admit that the clinical tests are about dosage amounts , and not safety .
So the new vaccines being approved for the fall campaign , have the potential to cause severe harm or death , due to the lack of safety tests .
The AP reported
The clinical trials are mainly aimed at calibrating the doses to give to patients , not to test if it is safe or not , officials stressed .
“ We are not trying to find some yet unrecognized problem with the vaccine , ” said Michael Osterholm , director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota
This is an appalling statement considering the 1976 mass vaccination campaign for swine flu , that injured hundreds of thousands and resulted in dozens of deaths from Guillain - Barré Syndrome .
It is also a very cryptic statement , unrecognized problems , meaning that they will not explore how the body will react to new vaccines with unapproved adjuvants like Squalene .
Meryl Nass , M.D. , an authority on the anthrax vaccine , stated on her blog :
“ A novel feature of the two H1N1 vaccines being developed by companies Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline is the addition of squalene - containing adjuvants to boost immunogenicity and dramatically reduce the amount of viral antigen needed .
This translates to much faster production of desired vaccine quantities . ”
Dr. Mercola explains the effects of squalene injected into humans in this excerpt from his article on the subject :
The difference between “ good ” and “ bad ” squalene is the route by which it enters your body .
Injection is an abnormal route of entry which incites your immune system to attack all the squalene in your body , not just the vaccine adjuvant .
Your immune system will attempt to destroy the molecule wherever it finds it , including in places where it occurs naturally , and where it is vital to the health of your nervous system .[ viii ]
Gulf War veterans with Gulf War Syndrome ( GWS ) received anthrax vaccines which contained squalene . [ ix ]
MF59 ( the Novartis squalene adjuvant ) was an unapproved ingredient in experimental anthrax vaccines and has since been linked to the devastating autoimmune diseases suffered by countless Gulf War vets . [ x ]
The Department of Defense made every attempt to deny that squalene was indeed an added contaminant in the anthrax vaccine administered to Persian Gulf war military personnel – deployed and non-deployed – as well as participants in the more recent Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program ( AVIP ) .
However , the FDA discovered the presence of squalene in certain lots of AVIP product .
A test was developed to detect anti-squalene antibodies in GWS patients , and a clear link was established between the contaminated product and all the GWS sufferers who had been injected with the vaccine containing squalene .
The WHO even admitted the swine flu vaccine being fast tracked in the EU may be unsafe because it allows firms to bypass large - scale human trials .
So with reduced safety testing , would you trust a vaccine manufacturer whose contaminated vaccine could have potentially caused a pandemic ?
Baxter pharmaceutical , one of the drug firms contracted to produce the H1N1 vaccine , recently sent vaccines that contained the live avian flu virus to 18 countries .
A virologist stated that this could have caused a pandemic if it would have been injected into a human subject .
As published on LifeGen.de
“ Baxter International Inc. in Austria ‘ unintentionally contaminated samples with the bird flu virus that were used in laboratories in 3 neighbouring countries , raising concern about the potential spread of the deadly disease ’ .
Austria , Germany , Slowenia and the Czech Republic – these are the countries in which labs were hit with dangerous viruses .
Not by bioterrorist commandos , but by Baxter .
In other words :
One of the major global pharmaceutical players seems to have lost control over a virus which is considered by many virologists to be one of the components leading some day to a new pandemic . ”
Dr. Mae -Wan Ho and Prof. Joe Cummins from The Institute of Science in Society stated “ the vaccines are far more deadly than the swine flu ; mass vaccinations are a recipe for disaster ”
With this knowledge , there is no excuse for the government to give vaccine manufacturers legal immunity for injuries or deaths caused by these untested cocktails , for a flu that has killed less than 300 hundred people , with most having preexisting health issues .
Given the fact that the FDA has enabled the use of dangerous treatments for the diagnosis of swine flu via the declaration of the EUA , we should n’t be surprised for the lack of safety for new vaccines .
It also makes sense that they would seek to protect themselves and vaccine manufacturers because they have the foreknowledge that these treatments are deadly .
A large percentage of the public who are informed of these facts will simply refuse the shot , but face government threats of home interventions through provisions in the Health Care bill , compulsory vaccination and quarantine .
Overruling individual human rights has been rationalized by the WHO in a 2005 pandemic preparedness document .
The WHO Checklist for Influenza Pandemic has been adopted by several governments as a blueprint for the suspension of individual rights .
Below is an excerpt from the WHO ’s document that promotes overruling legislation and human rights .
1.5 Legal and ethical issues 1.5.1 Legal issues Rationale During a pandemic , it may be necessary to overrule existing legislation or ( individual ) human rights .
Examples are the enforcement of quarantine ( overruling individual freedom of movement ) , use of privately owned buildings for hospitals , off - license use of drugs , compulsory vaccination or implementation of emergency shifts in essential services .
These decisions need a legal framework to ensure transparent assessment and justification of the measures that are being considered , and to ensure coherence with international legislation ( International Health Regulations ) .
Questions to be addressed
Is there a legislative framework in place for the national response plan ?
Does this framework include contingencies for health - care delivery and maintenance of essential services , and for public health measures to be implemented ?
Legal issues that are highlighted in other parts of the checklist are brought together as a separate checklist here .
Other issues are added .
Check *
Identify the advantages and disadvantages of declaring a state of emergency during a pandemic .
* Each jurisdiction needs to assess the legal basis of all public health measures that are likely to be proposed , including : * travel or movement restrictions ( leaving and entering areas where infection is established ) ; * closure of educational institutions ; * prohibition of mass gatherings ; * isolation or quarantine of infected persons , or of persons suspected of being infected , or persons from areas where pandemic strain influenza infection is established .
* Assess standing policy on , and legal basis for , influenza vaccination of health - care workers , workers in essential services ( see sections 5.1 and 5.2 ) or persons at high risk .
Decide if this policy needs refinement to increase uptake during pandemic alert and pandemic periods .
Consider the use of both seasonal and pandemic vaccine for these groups .
* Address liability , insurance and temporary licensing issues for retired health - care workers and volunteers who may be working in areas outside their training and competence in health and emergency services .
* Consider liability for unforeseen adverse events attributed to vaccine and / or antiviral drug use , especially where the licensing process for a pandemic strain vaccine has been expedited .
Liability issues may affect vaccine manufacturers , the licensing authority and those who administer the vaccine .
* Ensure a legislative framework for compliance with the International Health Regulations .
* Consider including influenza or pandemic influenza in national legislation for the prevention of occupational diseases .
1.5.2 Ethical issues Rationale Ethical issues are closely related to legal issues as mentioned above .
They are part of the normative framework that is needed to assess the cultural acceptability of measures such as quarantine or selective vaccination of predefined risk groups .
Questions to be addressed
Have ethical aspects of policy decisions been considered ?
Is there a leading ethical framework that can be used during the response to an outbreak to balance individual and population rights ?
* Consider ethical questions related to limiting the availability of a scarce resource , such as rationed diagnostic laboratory testing , pandemic strain influenza vaccine or antiviral drugs .
* Consider ethical questions related to compulsory vaccination for healthcare workers and workers from essential services .
* Consider the ethical issues related to limiting personal freedom , such as may occur with isolation and quarantine .
* Ensure the establishment of an ethical framework for research , especially when this involves human subjects .
A CBS News report showed that the U.S. went significantly further in regards to limiting individual freedom by assessing punishment and monetary penalties for quarantine non-compliance .
Federal quarantine authority is limited to diseases listed in presidential executive orders ; President Bush added “ novel ” forms of influenza with the potential to create pandemics in Executive Order 13375 .
Anyone violating a quarantine order can be punished by a $ 250,000 fine and a one - year prison term .

This all basically constitutes a martial law takeover using the staged threat of a new flu pandemic that will coincide with the normal flu season .
The CDC recently announced that they will no longer report swine flu cases .
In this environment of pandemic fear , people getting sick and dying from the annual influenza strain could be initially confused for the swine flu .
So it is very clear that the vaccine could be ineffective since the fall strain has n’t emerged yet , and it has the potential for life changing adverse reactions , or death .
Since the swine flu has been relatively harmless , why are we being told to take these potentially unsafe fast tracked vaccines ?
As we reported in May , the pandemic flu is a financial boon for pharmaceutical companies like Roche who projected , in 2008 , a 531 % revenue growth for 2009 due to Tamiflu sales .
Recently , the Daily Mail reported that a scientist who advises the Government on swine flu , is a paid director of a drug firm making hundreds of millions of pounds from the pandemic .
More sinister than financial motivation , is the idea that the mass vaccination campaign is part of a depopulation agenda by the global elite .
Former high level Bush Sr. insider Catherine Austin Fitts writes on her blog :
“ I believe one of the goals of the swine flu vaccine is depopulation .
Perhaps it is the goal of a swine flu epidemic as well , whether bio - warfare or hype around a flu season , ”
This is given credence by recent reports on Infowars about mass graves ordered by FEMA officials before the pandemic flu outbreak .
The UK has also ordered mass graves , inflatable mortuaries , 24 hour crematoriums , and even catacombs that were used during the cholera epidemic in 1832 .
This preparation for massive deaths seems to be an exaggerated response to the recent H1N1 outbreak , unless they know something we do n’t .
It ’s becoming fairly evident that the fast tracked vaccines could cause more deaths than the swine flu itself .
We have to also consider that the vaccines themselves allow for potentially deadly strains to emerge , generating a true pandemic .
Historically , during the first year of a new presidents term , a crisis emerges that threatens the safety of the public , creates fear , and allows for the government to pose as the savior with the solution , that always amounts to more centralized control , and the erosion of civil liberties through draconian legislation .
Society cannot afford to give into fear , and set the precedent for governmental institutions to invade our bodies forcibly with untested , unsafe vaccines , without legal recourse , for a virus that has killed so few .

Researchers have combined two ion-beam analysis techniques to obtain more detailed information about the paints used in Renaissance works of art
Rajendrani Mukhopadhyay / Washington D.C. , US
Researchers have combined two ion-beam analysis techniques to obtain more detailed information about the composition of paints used in Renaissance works of art .
The new approach sheds light on the organic components within the paint , particularly important in informing conservation efforts .
Laurence de Viguerie and colleagues at the Palais du Louvre and Institut National des Sciences et Techniques Nucl?aires in France have devised a new approach that provides quantitative information about both the elemental composition and organic binder proportions in materials used in old Italian oil paintings .
Particle induced x-ray emission spectroscopy ( PIXE ) is a common technique used in cultural heritage analysis , but it can only detect elements present in the materials and does n’t provide any insight into the organic components .
So the investigators combined PIXE with backscattering spectrometry to obtain , for the first time , the ratios between the organic and inorganic components of paint in a single procedure .
In backscattering spectrometry an ion beam is directed at the surface of a target and the energy of the ions that scatter back from the sample is recorded .
This data can then be analysed to provide quantitative information about the composition of the material as well as depth profiles its individual components .
A challenge with the new technique was to produce a highly focused ion beam of less than 20
m in air .
’ It is important to work directly in air because of potential damage [ to the artworks ] in a vacuum , ’ explains Philippe Walter , lead author on the study .
’ It is also important to have a good spatial resolution because of the thinness of the paint layers . ’
The team also kept the beam intensity as low as possible , around 150 pA in runs lasting 100 to 200 seconds , to reduce the risk of damage to the paint samples .
During the Italian Renaissance , pigments were mixed with oils which held the pigment in suspension , allowing it to be applied to a canvas where it then dried .
Tweaking the ingredients and preparation methods helped create different effects in the final painting .
Knowing the proportions of the different ingredients is crucial in understanding the physical and chemical properties of the paint layers , say the researchers , and hence predicting their conservation .
The investigators studied several 15th and 16th century paintings from the school of Leonardo da Vinci .
Focusing on paint layers based on lead white pigment , the researchers determined that the layers all had similar compositions , with the pigment making up 85 to 95 per cent of the paint , and the organic binder - known to be linseed or nut oil - making up 5 to 15 per cent .
The results suggest that in old oil paint recipes , the binder proportion was kept the same for each pigment .
Narayan Khandekar of Harvard Art Museum says the research represents ’a new and interesting way to determine the pigment to binder ratio from a small paint cross-section ’ .
’ It is a significant advance over the thermogravimetric methods developed in the early 1990s which relied on mechanically separating the layers prior to analysis , or on an analysis of all the paint layers at once . ’
Walter explains that their goal is to ’find interesting data concerning the beginning of the use of oil as a binder .
Did the artists immediately master this new mixture ? ’
As this research focused on lead white - based layers , the team suggests it could also be interesting to analyse other samples and look at coloured or organic layers .

Who is the boss of the Democratic White House ?
Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe ( Maine ) .
Who is the boss of the Democratic Senate ?
Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe .
Meanwhile , Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , who one year ago was slandering the Democratic nominee for president while supporting the Republican nominee , chooses this key moment to tell us he opposes even the weak Finance Committee healthcare bill .
The star of this Fellini - esque film we call government controlled by Democrats is the president , who has betrayed his own rhetoric for the public option to try to kill it , surrender it , trade it away , leave it behind , talk it down and throw it out 10 different ways .
Make no mistake , the president has privately surrendered the public option to get a single Republican senator who will allow him to pretend this bill has bipartisan support .
The weaker Democratic senators are using Snowe as their figurehead excuse to kill the public option , while they remain terrified to vote for it , because it offends their insurance company donors , and equally terrified to vote against it , because it offends the majority of their constituents , who support it .
Make no mistake , the president wanted to kill the public option from the beginning , to give it away , notwithstanding his rhetoric for it , to get Republicans to support the bill .
I do n’t know what is worse : that unlike LBJ fighting for Medicare the president would give away the most important provision for a fig leaf of Republican support , or the fact that the president is so focused on image and public relations that he will try to sell himself as getting a bipartisan bill , with only one Republican , a truth in advertising farce .
Make no mistake , healthcare reform has been gutted and stripped by lobbyists from every interest group making a fortune from the current system .
Universal coverage is dead .
A mandate for coverage is dead .
The major reforms to lower healthcare costs are dead .
Backroom deals rule the day .
Healthcare consumers will pay the price .
Premiums will skyrocket and industry profits will shoot to the moon under this so - called reform .
Get ready for a huge battle over the public option .
If the majority of Congress that supports it will fight for it , and refuse to vote for a bill without it , the battle can still be won , though in spite of the president , not because of him , though he will try to claim credit for whatever happens .
As the gathering storm of Afghanistan comes closer , there is a gathering storm of Democrats who thought they had elected a Democratic president who would fight for transforming change , and a Democratic Senate with 60 votes who we learn are overruled by the real boss , one Republican senator , and a lot of special interest money .

Minutes after the jurors and the judge had cleared out of the courtroom today , Mr. Lay 's family members huddled around him .
Elizabeth Vittor , Mr. Lay 's daughter and a lawyer who had worked on his defense team , sobbed uncontrollably .
Two local ministers also leaned in and hugged Mr. Lay , whose family members soon formed a circle in the courtroom , with arms over shoulders , and cried together .
" I know , I know , " Mr. Lay said in a soothing voice to several of them , as they clutched at his suit coat .
Mr. Lay was forced to remain in the courthouse for more than three hours after the verdict was announced for a hearing on securing a $ 5 million bond , which will come from a mix of financial pledges from his children , and to surrender his passport .
Judge Lake will have broad discretion in determining the former executives ' sentences .
He is not known for his leniency .
Two years ago he sentenced Jamie Olis , a former midlevel executive at Dynegy , to 24 years for his role in a scheme to disguise the company 's finances .
An appeals court last year ordered the judge to revise the sentence .
A hearing is set for June 9 .
The guilty verdicts could have limited impact on a spate of civil cases .
" They are not the ones who are going to pay the billions of dollars in additional recoveries that we hope to obtain on top of the $ 7.2 billion we already have from banks in our previous settlements , " said William S. Lerach , the lead lawyer in the largest civil case , set to go to trial in October .

From the beginning , the Enron leaders ' trial was not what many people expected after revelations of secret off - the - books schemes that earned a small fortune for Andrew S. Fastow , Enron 's former chief financial officer , and his cadre of co-conspirators .
Those transactions were used to artificially prop up the company 's profits , but prosecutors never seriously attempted to prove that Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling were responsible for them .
Rather than delve into whether those intricate accounting structures were legitimate , prosecutors focused almost exclusively on what they cited as the false statements Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay made to employees and outside investors .
The " lies and choices " theme transformed the case into a test of credibility between the former chief executives and the more than half a dozen witnesses from inside Enron who testified for the government .
