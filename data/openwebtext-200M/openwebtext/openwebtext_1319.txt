This suggests that what Kiva users are really doing is financing the microfinance institutions themselves and not individual entrepreneurs .
Kiva argues , however , that any confusion disappears come repayment time .
Whether you get your money back later will depend on whether the people to whom you directed your money repay it .
If they do n’t , you ’ll get nothing unless the local microfinance partner makes good on the loan to stay in Kiva and its users ’ good graces .
MICROPLACE
Kiva lenders do n’t collect interest but are supposed to get their principal back .
Individual lenders who use MicroPlace can actually make a small profit .
Like Kiva , MicroPlace draws investors in with stories of ice cream start - ups in Nigeria and such .
But it clearly labels each featured individual as a sample borrower .
“ We do n’t make any claims that you are investing in a person , ” said Ashwini Narayanan , MicroPlace ’s general manager .
“ You ’re investing in a microfinance lender . ”
Those lenders are willing to pay a return for access to capital , and MicroPlace investors can aim at investments that can yield up to 6 percent a year .
Ms. Narayanan said she hoped that more people would eventually see the site not through the lens of philanthropy but as a portal to an entirely new asset class , like stocks or certificates of deposit , that can also do a lot of good .
MicroPlace is n’t a nonprofit , like the other sites I ’ve discussed here .
But it pledges to give away any money it makes , say through eBay ’s foundation .
As for the lack of a direct connection between lenders and entrepreneurs , MicroPlace makes no apologies .
For MicroPlace ( or Kiva ) to fulfill such a promise completely , people would have to collect requests for loans by hand , translate and post those requests on the Web along with any supporting photos or videos , wait to see if lenders finance them , distribute the money to the field partners and then wait for the partners to make loans to the people who requested them , many of whom live far away from one another .
NONGOMA , South Africa 
The bull was badly outnumbered , and while its muscular body , thick black hide and rock - hard horns offered significant advantages , this was not a brawl the animal was likely to win .
Forty Zulu warriors were circling about , there to kill it with their bare hands .
Penned up in the royal kraal , the bull trotted around for a while , looking nervously for an escape .
Then it hesitated , and the warriors  all in their late teens or early twenties  moved in , their hands reaching for anything to grasp , the tail , the legs , those horns .
The killing of the bull is part of Ukweshwama , an annual ceremony that celebrates a new harvest .
It is a day of prayer when Zulus thank their creator and their ancestors .
By tradition , a new regiment of young warriors is asked to confront a bull to prove its courage , inheriting the beast ’s strength as it expires .
It is believed this power then transfers to the Zulu king .

Usually , the Ukweshwama is viewed by outsiders as little more than a curiosity .
King Goodwill Zwelithini is largely a ceremonial figure these days , his monarchy more an emotional bond than a political reality .
But this year , a South African animal rights group took up the cause of the doomed bull , assailing the slaying as unnecessarily cruel .
Fissures were pried open in South African society , and the back - and - forth between the two sides became ugly .
After reading an old article , by Tom Wolfe , about two studies that dealt with animals and overcrowding I felt the need to share the information .
The first was John Calhoun 's study of Norway rats .
The second was John J. Christian 's research on Sika Deer .
At a certain point the results for each population became disastrous as the animals exhibited pathologies and even experienced ‘ unexplainable ' death .
Both made me begin to think about human populations and how much of an influence crowding has on us .
Calhoun 's Study of Norway Rats
The first researcher , John Calhoun , placed 80 Norway rats in a cage with four sections and two walkways that would lead from the outside compartments to the inside compartments .
According to Tom Wolfe , if there are more than 200 of them in one fourth of an acre they will begin to " die off . "
So , what happens when you place 80 in relatively small cage ?
Calhoun made sure that they had enough water , food and shelter necessary to survive but the rest would be up to the rats .
Soon enough , the animals descended into what Calhoun described as a " behavioral sink . "
This term is used to explain the behavior of animals that gather or are forced to live in a space too small to accommodate them .
The rats at first developed a sense of order , but that soon went ‘ haywire . '
At the ends of the cage an alpha male took over and kicked the other males out .
According to Wolfe , the alpha males would take eight to ten females as concubines .
This meant that from 58 to 62 Norway rats would be forced to live in the middle two compartments .
Chaos resulted as no sense of order or balance could come from that many rats being trapped so close together .
The male rats fought constantly and began to ignore rituals and force themselves on female rats .
They also began to perform bisexual and acts .
Some rats would n't even move in the daytime and would wait for the other rats to go to sleep before they would walk around .
No rat was safe from molestation and any attempts to leave the confines of the middle compartments by male rats were checked by the alpha male at either end of the cage .
They were trapped in chaos .
The alpha males , and their concubines , it must be noted , grew much larger than the other rats and maintained their health and vitality .
The female concubines also had free reign and would venture in and out of the middle compartments as they pleased .
John J. Christian's Sika Deer Study
In the next study , John J. Christian studied Sika deer on James Island in the Chesapeake Bay .
These deer required at least three acres per deer in order to thrive .
Yet , during the six - year study , on the 280 acre island , the Sika population reached nearly 300 .
Remember , an individual Sika deer needs at least three acres to prosper .
So the increase in numbers for them turned out to be disastrous .
When their population hit 300 all of a sudden the deer began to drop dead .
The newly deceased deer appeared to have no health maladies .
However , autopsies revealed that they died from enlarged adrenal glands .
The over - populated island proved to be too much for the herd and many died from being ‘ over .'
However , as the population adjusted to a numerical range that would support their three - acre per deer spatial needs , the deaths stopped occurring .
These two studies raised a number of concerns for me because even though we like to separate ourselves from other animals that inhabit the earth , we are n't immune from environmental influences .
Further , we all tend to have ideas or know theories from research about what happens when humans are placed in crowded environments .
But , how often do you ask yourself what happens to you or how do you react when you are in an overpopulated setting ?
Psychological theories such as actor - observer and cite how humans have the tendency to blame the or disposition of the misbehaved when they act a certain way .
The flipside of these two theories is that when we judge our own failings we often assign blame to situations and not to our personalities .
However , even with knowledge of these theories , when we behave out of character due to ‘ overcrowding , ' do we really look to our environment ?
And if we do assign fault to our environs , what do we do to address environmental concerns and our behavior ?

101 Ways to Maximize your Potential !
Check out his page on Twitter .
The ancient Egyptian pyramids , the Parthenon of Athens , Mona Lisa ’s face and the head of George Clooney all have one thing in common .
Their attractiveness is said to be based on the “ golden ratio ” , which is supposed to be the most aesthetically pleasing shape to the human eye .
The golden ratio , also known as the divine proportion , produces a shape similar to a widescreen television or a cinema screen and describes a rectangle with a length roughly one and half times its width .
The proportion is said to pervade art , architecture and nature .
The modernist architect Le Corbusier used the golden ration for conferring harmonius proportions on everything from door handles to high - rise buildings , whereas the surrealist painter Salvadore Dali deliberately incorporated the rule into his painting Sacrament of the Last Supper .
Now a theoretical mathematician has come up with what he believes is a possible reason why the human eye finds shapes in these proportions so particularly appealing .
It comes down to how easy it is for the eye and the brain to scan such an image for important details , based on our evolutionary history .
Professor Adrian Bejan of Duke University in North Carolina said that the golden ratio – which was first identified mathematically by Euclid in 3rd Century BC – just happens to be the most efficient shape for visual scanning , which could explain why it is behind so many works of art and architectural wonders .
“ When you look at what so many people have been drawing and building , you see these proportions everywhere .
It is well known that the eyes take in information more efficiently when they scan side - to - side , as opposed to up and down , ” Professor Bejan said .
“ Scanning left to right is five times faster than scanning up and down and that is largely due to the left or right eye taking over when the opposite eye gives up .
When you scan vertically , it ’s like having just one eye .
The eyes are also arranged on a horizontal axis , which happens to fit in with the landscape , ” he said .
Professor Bejan has applied a mathematically - based law he devised in 1996 to describe how designs in nature , from the flow of water in river deltas to the branching airways in a set of lungs , are geared towards ever - increasing efficiency of movement , such as the faster flow of water , air , blood or even individuals in a crowd .
Vision is also subject to increased efficiency based on the faster flow of information from the eye to the brain .
And the visual scene that is easiest to scan is one where the horizontal axis is wider than the vertical , Professor Bejan said .
This is true for a gazelle scanning the African horizon for predators , or early human hunter gatherers searching their territory for food .
“ Animal vision should be configured in a way that seeing and scanning should be the fastest and the easiest .
And when the proportions allow this to be done , it should be a source of pleasure because of its past evolutionary associations with finding food or a mate , ” Professor Bejan said .
According to the theoretical study published in the International Journal of Design and Nature and Ecodynamics , the most efficient proportions for the human eyes to scan is a rectangular shape where the horizontal is about one and a half times the vertical , which Professor Bejan said approximates to the golden ratio .
“ [ It ] is a consequence of the fact that our perceived world is roughly a horizontal tableau .
Our supply of images reflects the orientation of the landscape .
Danger comes to the animal from the sides and from behind , not from above , and not from below , ” Professor Bejan said .
Perceiving the world through a rectangular box has led to this particular shape becoming aesthetically pleasing and being subconsciously incorporated into works of art .
It may also explain why some faces that approximate more closely than other faces are viewed as being the most attractive .
A recent study by scientists at the University of Toronto found that female faces were judged the most attractive if the vertical distance between the eyes and the mouth was approximately 36 per cent of the face ’s length , and the horizontal distance between the eyes was approximately 46 per cent of the facial width .
This was also the proportions of the average face .

Bet you never thought about it , but Energy - efficient traffic lights can’t melt snow .
Talk about the Law of Unintended Consequences .
You want to save money by buying more energy - efficient traffic lights , but then you end up spending an untold amount of money on traffic light cleaners , or potentially , the EMS / Police who have to deal with the aftermath of stop lights not working after heavy snows .
Then there are the health insurance costs , department of transportation costs to fix the barriers that might get damaged , car insurance costs , etc …
The consequences are complex and far reaching .
But once you see it , it just seems so obvious !
Of course LEDs are n’t going to melt snow , they do n’t produce very much heat at all !
Unfortunately , while using incandescent bulbs , this was n’t a problem .
So it was n’t a problem that they knew needed to be addressed .
Trust me , if incandescent bulbs did n’t melt the snow previously , then you can be guaranteed it would have been at the top of their list to find a solution to this problem .
But they picked a solution based on one factor that brought some other problems along with it .
Does this sound familiar ?
If you are a software developer , it should .
You probably have to deal with some of the most complex systems that have ever been devised by humans .
Thousands of inputs , outputs , moving parts , pieces of business logic , and probably a team of about 5 people to do it all !
Right ?
Of course , companies often do n’t have the resources to bring in dozens of developers to write a really great system , they just need a “ good enough ” system to allow them to function .
So What is a Developer To Do ?
But when you ’re pushed up against constant deadlines , resource issues , feature requests , etc … what do you do ?
Well , you try to do as little work as possible , right ?
You try to find some way to solve parts of your problems so that you do n’t have to write code in order to do it .
Some of these problems , such as data storage , are so commonplace ( and complicated ) that we do n’t even consider building them anymore .
Other problems are n’t so generic and commonplace , but often we can leverage third party products , tools , or libraries in order to get us part of the way there .
Great !
We can just use tool X or library Y and now we just need to plug it into our software at point Z and everything is great , right ?
Not really , there is a big part of the picture that is missing here .
People who have a problem and pick a tool based on features are doing the same thing that the people who picked the LED stoplights probably did .
They said , does this have all of the features that we need to replace the incandescent bulbs ?
Bright enough ?
Check .
Lower energy ?
Check .
Lasts a long time ?
Check .
Sounds good !
And that is the same thing that people will do with third party tools .
They look at their set of problems , look at the set of features that the product offers , but they do n’t look at everything else that the software , library , or tool brings along with it .
Consider a blog post that I read this morning by Jimmy Nilsson , titled “ The Big Picture of Software Development ” .
In this blog post Jimmy takes a very introspective look at what we are , how we do what we do , and why we do it ( go read it , it is a GREAT post ) .
I ’m in a particularly contemplative mindset currently , and this blog post really started me thinking .
Particularly this part :
I find that quite a lot of people strongly believe that products will help a lot .
After 20 + years in this business , I believe that products are more often the problem than the solution so care must be taken .
In the same way there is the comment about companies believing they need expert help from the vendor of the product they are having trouble with .
To me , that ’s a smell regarding that product .
“ We ca n’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them . ”
– Albert Einstein
Care must absolutely be taken .
If you are picking a tool that solves 5 problems , you need to make sure that you are n’t going to get 20 more problems .
One of the biggest problems I see are tools that are n’t isolated .
They are either pervasive in their reach , or require heavy integration at every level of your application .
For example , a database should be a fairly isolated piece of your application .
It has a single purpose and you interact with it in a very particular way .
You can isolate the code to deal with the database into certain key areas , and then you have very little problems .
But have you ever worked in an application where they threw database access code all over the place ?
It became a nightmare , did n’t it ?
Unfortunately , many tools make it hard or impossible for you to isolate them from your code .
And once they are in there , they are rarely going to come out .
And that is a commitment .
A commitment that you are going to have to deal with whether it is good or bad .
Often , by the time you realize it was bad , it is far too late to reverse course .
You have entangled your application in a web of dependencies , and there is no going back .
How Can I Change
This ?
But how do you deal with this ?
We obviously ca n’t expect to build every little piece of our application that we need .
That would be ludicrous in this day and age .
But there are a few key things we can do to mitigate these issues .
You an lean toward externalizing dependencies .
Instead of pulling something into your application , can you just make a call out to it ?
Can you use a hosted service that you do n’t need to worry about ?
There can be other issues here , but this should be a strong consideration .
Pick tools that perform targeted tasks , instead of tools that do a million different things .
The more a tool does , and the more you use it for , the more your application will become shackled .
This leads me to my next point …
Consider how much you can isolate the tool .
Can you keep the library or tool in one small part of your application ?
If so , you are going to be in a much better place .
Especially if the relationship starts to go south .
This might take some research and forethought , but you can usually get a good idea of just how pervasive a tool is going to be .
Consider flexibility .
If it would take twice as long to build a tool than it would to integrate with a third party tool , but you are concerned that the purchased tool might not meet all of your needs , then consider building it .
If you integrate with the third party tool first , then figure out that it does n’t meet your needs , you ’ll likely have to spend time getting the tool out , then spend more time developer the replacement .
If you ca n’t externalize your dependencies , then lean toward libraries .
Instead of buying a software package or tool , look for a library .
They are generally smaller , more flexible , and easy to abstract away from your software .
Libraries are usually written with the mindset of fitting them into your application , whereas with software packages and tools you will often find yourself shoving your application into them .
Look for open source .
If you can find a library , tool , etc… ( whether it be free or commercial ) that fits your needs , make sure it is open source .
You might laugh and say , well , I ’ll never go into the code of a third party product and fix or change anything !
Well , that may or may not be the case , but when you are using a popular open source tool , there are thousands of developers who are in the code .
They have the same problems that you have , and they are solving them .
Good Dependencies
Just to avoid a million different revisions of “ but what about the .NET framework ? ” , “ what about Rails ? ” , “ what about Django ? ” , “ what about < insert required dependency here > ? ” .
You have to take dependencies on something .
Like I said , we ca n’t be expected to write every line in our applications these days .
We are expected to be much more productive than that .
Picking a good framework and libraries which will help us build our applications more effectively is key to success .
Knowing when to leverage third party services , tools , and applications is more of an art than a science .
You ’ll start to get a better feel for it after you have been bitten a few times .
Final Thoughts
So , am I just saying to not heavily integrate with other systems ?
No .
What I am saying is that if you need to heavily integrate with a third party library you need to have a list of Pros and Cons .
There are Cons .
Most people do n’t look for them , but they are there .
You need to think about them , and you need to be objective .
I love NHibernate , but I also know that many .NET developers are n’t familiar with it and there is a learning curve .
So that would be something that I would begrudgingly list in the Cons column .
I honestly believe that most of the pain that we feel in software development today is self inflicted .
But until we start looking at our development practices and really ask ourselves why we are feeling this pain , things will never get any better .
Like the Albert Einstein quote from Jimmy ’s article said , “ We ca n’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them . ”
You realise you 're in trouble when they start talking about what you can see from the moon .
Really ?
That 's interesting , you think , when someone tells you there are pictures from the International Space Station to prove this surreal artificial island shaped like a palm tree is one of the few objects made by man that is visible from outer space .
You know , of course , that what you should be thinking is : that 's insane .
Instead , after a couple of days in Dubai , it seems merely logical .
Well yes , you think .
This Palm island is three miles wide and three miles long .
Seven million tonnes of rock and 94 m cubic metres of sand went into the making of it .
More than 30 five - star hotels stand on it .
It is home to thousands of villas , owned by the likes of Schumacher , Beckham , Pitt and Campbell .
Of course , you can see it from space .
Astonishing , you think , when they say they are planning two more palm trees like this one , only bigger .
( Viewed from above , one will trace out the not spectacularly inspiring words of a poem by the emirate 's leader , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al - Maktoum . )
Plus a whole other 300 - island archipelago representing the countries and continents of the world .
And another one featuring the universe .
Not to forget a whole new luxury development on land twice the size of Hong Kong , with homes for 1.5 million people .
Why not ?
This is , after all , the place where Tiger Woods has driven golf balls off the helipad of the only seven - star hotel in the world .
The world 's tallest building , all 2,300 - plus feet and 162 tapering floors of it , is here , needling into the sky and ready for its official opening on 4 January .
There 's an indoor , real - snow ski resort , with a black run .
In the Marina quarter alone , 200 skyscrapers have risen from the ground in the space of five years .
What 's not possible here ?
And then , in the midday heat out on the end of the first Palm island , a guide tells her tour group that the launch party they threw on this spot last year for the Atlantis , a £ 1bn , 1,539 - room pink - crenellated monstrosity with its own 65,000 - fish aquarium and a top - floor suite that costs £ 13,000 a night , included a fireworks display so big it could be seen from the moon .
And finally you think : what planet are these people on ?
Planet Dubai , obviously .
It is hard , somehow , to keep a hold on reality here .
It 's a place of a myriad immense , gleaming towers ; of 12 - lane freeways packed with Mercs and Lexuses and 4x4s ; malls that hold 1,500 shops and have space for 16,000 cars .
Everywhere , the slogans bombard you , in neon and on over - sized billboards : " Welcome to Everything . "
" Be Unlimited . "
" Anything is Possible . "
" Where Vision Inspires Humanity . "
" Where Shopping is a Lifestyle . "
Everything is the best , the biggest , the first , the tallest , the most .
During the day , the skyline , against a permanently powder - blue sky , is so crowded with jostling glass - and - steel spires it looks like it could only have been generated by computer graphics .
By night , it 's a neon - lit uber - urban fantasia , Blade Runner on steroids .
It 's a monument to excess , a temple of consumerism , an awe - inspiring and often horrifying vision of 21st - century enterprise , a super - sized distillation of present - day capitalism .
And despite everything that has been said over the last few days , I 'm afraid to say it does n't feel like it 's dead quite yet .
Last week Dubai World , the state - backed conglomerate that owns some of Dubai 's largest developers including Nakheel , the company behind the Palm islands and many of the other huge projects , asked for a moratorium on debt repayments while it renegotiated part of the £ 60 bn - odd it reportedly owes .
The news sparked something approaching panic on world stock markets ; although negotiations with the banks are now under way , they 're climbing sharply again .
The finance wizards apparently worried that if Nakheel went under , it would take Dubai World , a sprawling and otherwise profitable conglomerate with worldwide interests from ports to golf courses , with it .
Dubai itself would then promptly go belly - up , triggering global economic and financial mayhem in a system only just recovering from the last crisis .
The media , especially the British media , made much of the imminent demise of the empire built on sand .
That vast , vulgar and unsustainable monument to greed and vanity was about to get its just deserts .
This , I have to say , came as news to Samir , who works in the Burberry outlet at the 450 - store Mall of the Emirates – where " Shopping , " happily , " is Just the Beginning " .
Samir comes from Egypt and has been in Dubai for three years .
Business is picking up nicely after the slump that followed last year 's credit crunch , he says .
" It slowed down a lot , especially in the first half of this year , but now it 's coming back .
Last three or four months , we 're doing fine .
This place disappear ?
You 've got to be joking .
Look around you . "
Behind him , the car park is full .
Blue - overalled Bangladeshi labourers are hard at work on a new 40 - store extension .
German tourists in shorts and T - shirts mingle with sharp - suited Indian businessmen on mobiles and Saudi and Kuwaiti women covered entirely in black , heavily made - up eyes glinting determinedly as they push a trolley down the marble floor towards Harvey Nichols .
The place is packed .
A lot of money is being spent .
At the even more gargantuan Dubai Mall ( Olympic - sized ice - skating rink , the Middle East 's largest aquarium , four Father Christmases playing the saxophone outside Candyland ) , Hadi agrees .
He 's not quite so happy , because he runs an upmarket jewellers in a mall that counts Chopard , Bulgari and Piaget among its tenants .
" What we 've noticed , " he says , " is that people are not buying the really big items .
Up to £ 500 , £ 600 , no problem .
Even £ 1,000 is OK .
It 's the expensive stuff , the diamonds , they 're not buying .
But it 's not a big problem .
There 's been a recession happening everywhere .
We 're doing OK . "
By rights , of course , Dubai should n't exist at all .
It 's a place run through with contradictions : Mecca is a couple of hours away , yet there are hard - drinking bars galore , with gaggles of hard - faced women , mainly from Russia and the former Soviet states , selling their services in some of them .
The city goes to sleep for Ramadan , but ( judging by the streets right now ) celebrates Christmas with more exuberance than much of middle America .
You can't access anything even remotely titillating on the internet , yet all Dubai 's half - dozen mega-malls boast a couple of upmarket lingerie outlets ( Agent Provocateur among them ) .
This is a city that 's considerably more diverse than , say , Poland and ( on the surface at least ) rather more tolerant than , say , parts of the American south .
But the newspapers are laughably pro-government , and there is no parliament or political parties , let alone trade unions .
It 's a disorienting place .
It is also quite small – the size of Kent in fact .
On the Persian Gulf , Dubai is one of the seven United Arab Emirates , which yesterday , with much ado , celebrated their 38th anniversary .
Unlike its neighbour Abu Dhabi , it does n't have a great deal of oil .
So its ruling dynasty , who have run the place ever since it was a sleepy settlement of pearl fishers and spice traders a century and a half ago , set about developing it as something else , something extremely ambitious : a trading , financial and tourism hub for the Middle East .
In the early 1950s , Dubai had a population of about 20,000 .
A big bridge and a port went up in the 1960s , desalination plants and trade centres in the 1970s .
But even 30 years ago , much of Dubai remained desert and scrub , not very different from the waterfront scene observed by explorer Wilfred Thesiger in 1949 : " Naked children romped in the shallows , and rowing boats patrolled the creek to pick up passengers from the mouths of alleys between the high coral houses , " he wrote .
" Behind . . . were the souks , covered passageways where merchants sat in the gloom , cross-legged in narrow alcoves among their piled merchandise . "
Today some 1.4 million people live here , 85 % of them non-nationals ( and around half of those from the Indian sub- continent ) .
Over tea in a shining chrome - and - marble downtown hotel , a cheery British excutive called Derek describes how the place has changed since 1997 , when he arrived .
Like most of the 100,000 - odd Britons living here , he 'd rather not be identified : Dubai 's authorities have never taken particularly kindly to criticism , and although he 's a firm , even a fervent believer in its future , in the present climate no one wants to find themselves on a plane back home , do they ?
" Until 2001 , early 2002 , it was evolving , " Derek says .
" For years , there were only two high - rises in town .
Then , after 9/11 , a lot of the Arab money invested in Europe and the US started looking for a new home .
When you had ' bin ' in your name , you needed to be careful .
At the same time , the oil price was going through the roof – back in 2002 , the Kuwaitis were projecting they'd be selling 800 m barrels a year at $ 40 each , and they ended up selling most of them at $ 80 .
That 's an awful lot of extra cash .
And how much more appealing to invest it in an emerging market , close to home , than in stuffy old Europe . "
The year after 9/11 , then , marked the start of Dubai 's transformation into Bling Central : the most extravagant orgy of construction , in the shortest space of time , the world has ever seen .
Western investors soon started taking serious notice : this , surely , was the new Shangri - la , a buzzing , brand - new , hot - hot - hot tourist destination with top- quality hotels , guaranteed sunshine , great ( well , reasonable ) beaches and enough retail opportunities to exhaust Paris Hilton .
What 's more , there was no income tax , and companies could take their profits home with them .
So the money rained down , and the buildings sprouted .
Forty - storey skyscrapers took two years , drawing board to delivery .
" I used to go with my wife on Fridays , our day off , to the Beach Club , down by Dubai Marina , " recalls Derek .
" On the way back , the skyline would always look different somehow .
We used to joke : ' Did they build that one today , then ? ' "
All this work was , and still is , perfomed by armies of mainly Bangladeshi labourers , who work under a boiling sun in the temperatures that in summer can reach 50C for weekly salaries as low as $ 30 a week .
Often they had to pay a large signing - on fee that effectively yoked them to their job for several years .
Equally often , their passports were confiscated .
They are housed in " labour camps " an hour or so out of town where living conditions are spartan at best , foul at worst .
At one stage , working conditions were no better : in one year alone , 2005 , the Indian consulate reported that 971 of its nationals died .
Following an outcry in the international press , a severely embarrassed Dubai government has since , it assures all who ask , got tough .
Abuses are now rare , a spokesman promises : a dozen construction companies have been stripped of their permits for breaches of a raft of new workers ' welfare laws .
I do n't know the truth of that , but there are plenty here to object that in any event , while Dubai 's legions of imported workers may earn a pittance , they 're sending funds home to some very poor families who would otherwise be living in misery .
" You do n't feel great paying your maid £ 300 a month , of course you do n't , " says Hanneke , a Dutch woman picnicking with her two children in the kids ' playground at the Jumeirah Beach park .
" But her parents would n't survive without it .
And I think that , in general , foreign labourers here are treated better now .
Certainly since all the building slowed down .
A lot have had to leave , though .
You never know , but they were saying at one time that maybe 5,000 were leaving every week . "
Because , of course , the building has slowed down .
Stopped , even , for the most part .
All over town , major construction sites lie still , and cranes are unmanned .
Some 400 different projects worth a total of maybe £ 300bn , including those insane artificial archipelagos , have been put on hold since late last year , when the global credit crunch began to bite .
In the building business and its allied trades , things are , says Paul , who runs a mid-sized interior design company , " looking a bit grey " .
" It 's very unclear what 's going to happen , " he continues .
" Personally , we 've had plenty of inquiries coming in , there 's a real feeling the market 's picking up .
But all the interest is from sensible , long - term , existing investors , people who 've been here for years .
And we do n't work with Nakheel . "
The credit crunch has hit Dubai harder than probably anywhere else .
As long as investment money ( at least some of it , according to the British taxman , of distinctly dubious origin ) was plentiful and cheap , it found a way here ; once it no longer was , the property market collapsed .
" There was such huge demand that the supply pipeline was opened to levels that were completely unsustainable , " is how Don Bradley , Middle East CEO of estate agents Knight Frank , puts it .
" Plus , it was a market built on speculation , not occupation – people were flipping as a matter of course , buying off - plan then selling for a quick profit before completion .
There was such huge interest from everywhere , from the Middle East , Europe , India , that there was massive over - exuberance , massive over - development .
We went in a very short space of time from a market where prices were basically construction costs plus a bit of margin , to one that was the equivalent of any leading western market . "
The plunge has certainly been dramatic .
Office rents are down 44 % on last year , and around 40 % currently lie empty .
After surging by 48 % from May 2007 to May 2008 , Dubai house prices have since fallen by about as much .
For some of the emirate 's expats , that has caused problems .
Six months ago , there were horror stories of cars abandoned at the airport and people being thrown into jail for not keeping up with their mortgage payments ( unauthorised debt is , essentially , illegal in Dubai ) .
Sitting outside the Double Decker pub , surrounded by a red telephone box and an unexpected abundance of London bus stop signs , Joseph , a graphic designer from Wimbledon , reckons all that was " wildly exaggerated .
Yes , quite a few people left .
But they were the idiots , the people who came out here to turn a fast buck , the people who were n't prepared to do a real job in a proper business . "
Outside the stricken property sector , though , Dubai does n't look like it 's ailing .
Which is why the furore over last week 's news has n't gone down very well here .
" I got this phone call from my mum , " says Dave , the Double Decker 's jovial Chester - born landlord .
" ' Are you all right ? ' she says .
' Course I am , why d'you ask ? '
I say .
' Cause it says on the TV Dubai's about to collapse , ' she says .
' Do n't you think you ought to come home ? '
Absolutely ridiculous , it was .
Rubbish . "
There are , it 's true , two ways of looking at Dubai .
You can see it as an utterly unsustainable abomination of greed and excess , built in the middle of an inhospitable and bone - dry desert with what amounts to slave labour at who knows what cost to the environment ( one golf course alone consumes 4 m gallons of desalinated water a day ; the carbon footprint of the average Dubai resident is more than double even the average American's ) .
And you can see it as somewhere fairly unique in the Arab world , a peaceful , relatively liberal melting pot that 's trying hard – sometimes a bit too hard – to make a living for itself without any oil revenue to speak of .
Perhaps understandably , those who live here know how they see it .
" There 's been a lot of talk back home , " says Derek , sharply , " about a lack of transparency , and a mountain of unsustainable debt .
I do n't know why that is .
Envy , maybe ?
Hypocrisy , certainly .
I do n't think what went on at Enron and Northern Rock and Lehman 's was very transparent . "
As for the debt , Dubai 's is n't in as much trouble as Britain , which is currently in hock for 400 % - plus of its GDP .
" If you want to talk about crippling debts , " says Derek , " go and talk to Mr Darling . "
Like everyone else I spoke to here , Derek has not a shadow of doubt about Dubai 's future ( although , I suppose , they would say that ) .
Its economy , they note , is set to grow by at least 1 % this year , which is more than Britain's .
It has an ultra -modern infrastructure that is fast turning it into a major , if not the major , commercial centre for the entire Gulf , whose collective economy is worth a trillion dollars a year .
It has the world 's third - biggest port and fastest - growing airport .
" I 've got the utmost faith in the place , " Derek says .
" Even if it stops building now , it 's a fantastic trade and business hub , and the playground for a lot of very wealthy people .
It 's a great tourist destination – top - class , good value hotels and an airport that can handle 60 million people .
It 's safe , it 's clean .
It 's a very new city that 's still finding its way , yes , but is it about to go under ?
Do n't be silly .
There 'll be a bit less bling , that 's all . "
Downtown near the Creek , Dubai still feels like a town , with recognisable streets and a few fly - blown shops and some normal - looking apartment buildings .
I 'm not sure what Kassim is doing there ; he part - owns a car concession and the franchise for a well - known American high - street brand .
But he 's the first Emirati who is happy to speak to me .
I read him a couple of headlines .
" Our grandparents shared a well with other families for water , " he almost shouts .
" Our grandparents !
You realise that ?
Do you really think we 're likely to let this " – he gestures around him at a glittering skyline – " go now ?
No one understands that . "
For his part , Joseph reckons last week 's fuss amounted to little more than " growing pains .
Everyone had been expecting something like it for months .
Everyone knew property guys had gone over the top .
But Dubai 's not just about property speculation .
Those of us who are staying – which is most of us – are looking forward to the next few years .
Things will be a bit more serious , a bit less Las - Vegas - on - Sea .
The country 's growing up . "
So who do we go with , the prophets of doom or the Dubai faithful ?
The international moneymen , or the people who have made this their home ?
It 's a gamble and we wo n't know the answer , I 'd say , for another few decades .
But if Lt R Colgan 's 1822 view of the city , titled Plan of the Backwater of Debai and now on display in the city museum , seems rather far - fetched , so too , one suspects , are islands shaped like poems .
Or firework displays you can see from the moon .

At the height of their power , the Nasca had mastered the craft of weaving elaborate textiles and the art of painting fine , multicoloured pottery .
They etched giant figures in the desert that only made sense if seen from the air , and they irrigated their crops with a network of underground aqueducts .
For more than eight centuries , the Nasca culture prospered in the coastal valleys of Peru until its sudden downfall around 600 AD , which many experts put down to the torrential rains and dramatic flooding brought on by one of the worst El Nino events in a millennium .
But a team of archaeologists has now found convincing evidence that this was only part of the story .
The researchers believe the decline was self - inflicted and began with the cutting down of a tree that could have protected them from devastating climate change .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Nasca , one of the most important of the pre-Inca civilisations of South America , are most famous for the " Nasca Lines " , a series of elaborate geoglyphs etched into the desert covering huge areas , depicting animals , deities and geometric shapes .
After the Nasca Lines were discovered by the first passenger flights over the region , some pseudoscience authors suggested that since they could only be seen frome above , they must have been made with the help of space aliens .
It is now accepted that the geoglyphs were created mundanely with long ropes tied to stakes in the ground , rather like present - day crop circles .
The Nasca survived in the semi-arid region by building irrigation canals to grow crops such as maize , squash , sweet potato and manioc .
This reliable food supply enabled them to build a relatively sophisticated civilisation based on art and ritual , which nevertheless included the unpleasant practice of collecting severed heads as trophies .
All this came to an abrupt end , according to a new study , because the Nasca made the mistake of cutting down the huarango tree which would have protected them from the El Nino flooding and subsequent soil erosion and drought that turned the lush agricultural land into desert .
" The huarango is a remarkable nitrogen - fixing tree and it was an important source of food , forage , timber and fuel for the people , " said David Beresford - Jones , an archaeologist and Nasca expert at the University of Cambridge .
" It is the ecological keystone species in the desert zone , enhancing soil fertility and moisture , ameliorating desert extremes in the microclimate beneath its canopy and underpinning the floodplain with one of the deepest root systems of any tree known . "
The researchers have excavated the lower Ica Valley of the Nasca domain and found clear evidence that vast swathes of huarango trees had been cut down to make way for crops .
Dr Beresford - Jones believes that the Nasca eventually changed the landscape forever .
" In time , gradual woodland clearance crossed an ecological threshold , which is sharply defined in such desert environments , exposing the landscape to the region 's extraordinary desert winds and the effects of El Nino floods . "
The huarango tree plays a " profound role " in preserving the sort of semi-arid environments where the Nasca lived , the scientists say in their study .
" Successful agriculture is just not possible here without the protection afforded by trees .
Indeed , these findings have undoubted contemporary resonance . "

When the El Nino struck , the river cut into its floodplain , washed away the soil and destroyed the Nasca irrigation systems , making the farmland unworkable .
The generations of Nasca that followed suffered higher infant mortalities and lower adult life expectancy .
Eventually , the Nasca capital of Cahuachi was abandoned and all that was left of the culture were archaeological artifacts .
Lost civilisations : Destroyed by nature
* Easter Island
It is thought that the native people felled the majority of the island 's trees between 1200 AD and 1500 AD .
The loss of palm trees upset the eco-system , driving away wildlife and drying up water supplies .
* Maya
Mayan civilisation stretched across the Yucatan Peninsula until 900 AD when cities were mysteriously abandoned .
It is believed that the culture was wiped out by a series of droughts .

Thanks to Matt , who once wrestled a shark to death with his bare hands .
That was a nurse shark , Matt , and you outta be ashamed .
In his first class , 13 of the some 220 students had been shot  two of them twice .
“ They do n’t graduate , ” he said .
“ It ’s tough . ”
He taught for seven grueling and rewarding years that showed him the flip side of his life as a cop , “ being with kids and seeing the problem from a different perspective , ” he said , “ trying to understand the drug culture , the impact of the drug culture and our responsibility for creating this culture . ”

But then Mr. Simon swooped in again , this time with the idea for “ The Wire , ” and Mr. Burns left teaching to sign on as a story editor .
( “ For somebody who never made money , it was like , ‘ Whoa , I can have a few dollars , ’ ” he said about getting his first paycheck for the series . )
“ How did he learn it ? ” Mr. Simon recalled .
“ I gave him a bunch of scripts .
‘ Homicide ’ scripts , ‘ Corner ’ scripts , showed him the dynamic .
One thing about Ed is you do n’t have to show him anything twice .
This is a guy who devours any idea he encounters . ”
For Mr. Burns , who believes most Americans think starting a wiretap is as simple as one guy in a cop show saying as much to another , “ The Wire ” was an opportunity to “ get it right , ” he said .
He conceived the morbid arc for the fourth season , in which killers working under the drug dealer Marlo Stanfield dump bodies in boarded - up row houses .
“ Police work has come to be about numbers , ” he said .
“ This was a twist on it .
This was Marlo doing his part .
‘ If I do n’t have murders , then they wo n’t come . ’ ”
Mr. Burns also came up with a mystifying split second in a third - season episode : a shot of William A. Rawls ( John Doman ) , a hard - line deputy commissioner , during a scene that takes place in a gay bar .
The moment was never revisited or explained .
“ It would have been a nice twist to have Daniels , who is in line to be commissioner , have him discover Rawls ’s fatal flaw and choose to ignore it , ” he said .
“ And have Rawls cut him down .
We laid the mine .
We just never stepped on it . ”
And yet for all the praise “ The Wire ” garnered , Mr. Simon said , Mr. Burns finished every season “ absolutely frustrated and convinced we had ruined the show . ”
But then he would come around .
“ He would put the tape in , in the end , and I ’d hear from him a month afterward .
‘ No , actually , that was really good in the end . ’ ”
This is a good sign : disastrous US commercial real estate market is finally getting low enough to attract Chinese " bottom feeders . "
Of course , there will be plenty of bottom feeders or vultures looking for opportunity , both foreign and domestic .
But cash - flush Chinese are natural buyers .
And you 'd hope that the presence of bottom feeders means we 're near a bottom .
FT : Market participants warn that the activity represents “ bottom - feeding ” by opportunistic investors whose strategies could be derailed by rising interest rates .
Also , sums are tiny compared with the debts that need refinancing .
Nevertheless , the growing interest from investors is a sign of stabilisation , making it less likely that worsening commercial real estate conditions will sink banks and choke off a US recovery .
“ We believe the real story is that capital is ready to buy , even though it may not be so visible today , ” said Bob Steers , co-chairman of Cohen & Steers , a real estate investment firm .
Recently , state - owned China Investment Corporation has enlisted Cohen & Steers , Angelo Gordon and Morgan Stanley to identify commercial real estate opportunities , people familiar with the matter say .

In colonial North America there were two currencies : coins of precious metal and wampum .
I would have guessed that a more advanced society would have simpler and more efficient payment and exchange systems , but it does n’t seem to have worked that way .
Let ’s look at a person who travels for business up and down the East Coast .
He or she will need the following :
traditional U.S. cash , the only acceptable form of payment in many small businesses
a credit card , the only acceptable form of payment for many things , e.g. , rental cars , airline food and entertainment
a cash - equivalent card for paying for subway rides on Boston ’s MBTA ( they spent so much putting in the electronic fare machines that they had to raise the price of a ride from $ 1.25 to $ 2 , but the new system cannot take a credit or debit card directly )
a cash - equivalent card for riding the New York City subway and buses
a smarter cash - equivalent card for riding the Washington , D.C. subway ( charges a variable fare depending on distance and time of day )
various cash - equivalent cards that pay for parking meters in more advanced towns
an EZ - Pass for paying car tolls in the Northeast ( this and other RFID - based toll collection systems are currently optional , as our business traveler could elect to wait in line and pay with cash , but proposals are on the table for making them mandatory ( toll collectors can earn more than $ 150,000 per year , including the value of pension obligations , so there is some pressure to eliminate their jobs )
an E - PASS for paying car tolls in Orlando
probably a few more electronic toll payment systems for the states in between
Can anyone think of some more ?
Is this proliferation of currency hurting U.S. economic efficiency ?
[ The New York Times yesterday ran a story about running nearly $ 1 trillion in taxpayer money around in circles through AIG , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and GMAC .
I wonder if we ’re doing the same thing on an individual basis , i.e. , running our money around in circles through various cash - like payment schemes , each time losing about 5 percent . ]
An enormous television screen showing a pornographic film has caused a midnight traffic jam in central Moscow as stunned motorists slammed on the brakes to gawk at the writhing naked bodies .
The owner of the advertising screen , which sits atop a main road about two kilometres south of the Kremlin , told the state - run RIA news agency that hackers had broken into the screen 's computer system and turned on the porn .
" They were either acting out of hooliganism or were from a rival company , " Viktor Laptev , commercial director of advertising firm Panno.ru , told RIA .
A short clip showing cars slowing to a halt to look at the screen sprung up on YouTube and internet sites on Friday ( local time ) across Russia , a country which banned nudity on television before the Soviet Union fell in 1991 .
Authorities said they are investigating , RIA added .

If only we could get the legal threesome to bring their wisdom similarly to bear on crucial issues of the day such as who is in charge of the television remote control , reversing into a parking space and the definition of the word flu , then surely the world would be a less fraught place .
Chinooks form the backbone of the UK's helicopter fleet in Afghanistan
The government is to buy 22 new Chinook helicopters and other equipment for Afghanistan but is making cuts to fund them , citing " acute cost pressures " .
Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth said RAF Cottesmore in Rutland would be closed and defence jobs cut , to allow £ 900 m more to be spent on the mission .
Other planned cuts will be brought forward , and some projects delayed .
Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox warned the cuts were the result of " catastrophic economic management " .
The money is coming from the Ministry of Defence 's existing budget , which is already overspent , and more cuts could yet be made .
We like to support the British defence industry - but when it comes to the crunch , we have to buy the best equipment that money can buy for our armed services
Defence Minister Quentin Davies
RAF Kinloss hit by defence cuts MoD accused of ' buy now pay later ' MP attacks Cottesmore closure plan Mr Fox said the country was in debt and was now " having our national security cut as a consequence " .
" Who is paying for [ the government 's ] incompetence ?
Our brave armed forces , " he said .
Mr Ainsworth told the House of Commons that there was no overall cut in the £ 35.4bn defence budget , but that they needed to make " tough choices " to reprioritise spending .
" Acute cost pressures remain , " he said .
Mr Ainsworth said the pressure on public finances meant they had to match the defence programme to available resources .
The cuts announced include : • Closure of RAF Cottesmore in Rutland - the biggest employer in the county - and immediate loss of one squadron of Harrier jets , with the rest moving to RAF Wittering before being phased out earlier than the previously planned withdrawal date of 2018 .
• 2,500 job cuts in armed forces personnel the MoD says " are not critical to current operations " .
To be done by slowing recruitment and preventing extensions to service , rather than redundancies • Independent review to look into cutting more civilian defence jobs • Withdrawal of the Nimrod MR2 in March 2010 , one year earlier than expected , and the slowing of the introduction of the Nimrod MRA4 to 2012 - which will hit RAF Kinloss in Moray • Plan to reduce the RAF Tornado and Harrier force by a further one or two squadrons , with final decisions to be taken in the defence review due next year .
RAF Lossiemouth , in Moray , is the RAF 's largest Tornado GR4s base • Temporary reduction in some aspects of army training • Earlier than planned removal from service of one Royal Navy survey ship and one mine - hunter .
Navy 's Lynx and Merlin Mk1 helicopters also to be " retired " sooner than planned .
Mr Ainsworth said the changes would ensure that " those who put themselves in harm 's way on our behalf remain properly supported and resourced " .

But BBC political correspondent Reeta Chakrabarti said opposition politicians wanted more detail about exactly where the cuts would come and voiced scepticism about much each would save .
Mr Ainsworth said the new three - year £ 900 m spending plans included : • Twenty two new Chinook helicopters - the first 10 due to be ready by 2012 / 13 .
Takes the total fleet from 48 to 70 •
An improved " close combat equipment package " with " state of the art " body armour and night vision goggles being made available to 50 % more troops • More Bowman tactical radios for troops and £ 80 m for special forces communications •
One additional C17 transport aircraft •
The number of Reaper drones - unmanned surveillance aircraft - to be doubled as part of a increased funding to improve intelligence and surveillance • Improvements to the defensive and support arrangements for the RAF Hercules heavy - lift fleet Mr Ainsworth said the money announced on Tuesday was on top of £ 280 m coming from the Treasury reserve to increase the number of Husky and Jackal vehicles , and kit to tackle roadside bombs - announced by the prime minister on Monday .
This was separate again to money being spent by the Treasury on urgent operational requirements ( UORs ) , the MoD said .
The defence secretary said the core defence budget had come under pressure from rising fuel and utility prices , pay and pension costs , and the growth in the price of equipment programmes - some of which had doubled in cost since original estimates .
As part of the cuts the Harrier jets based at RAF Cottesmore will move to RAF Wittering before being phased out of service altogether - earlier than the planned withdrawal date of 2018 .
The base - which opened in 1938 - holds about 3,000 people and has been home to Harriers since 1999 .
It currently houses the UK's four operational Harrier squadrons .
Mr Ainsworth 's announcement came after months of criticism over the number of helicopters in operation in Afghanistan 's Helmand province .
ANALYSIS By Caroline Wyatt , BBC defence correspondent
The renewed focus on the frontline will be welcomed by those serving in Helmand .
However , the first of the new Chinooks wo n't start coming into service until 2012 at the earliest .
That is when British troops could be looking to start a phased withdrawal from Helmand .
Although 22 Chinooks have been ordered , only around a quarter would be likely to go out to Afghanistan , with the rest needed for training in the UK and others in maintenance .
The new C17 transport plane to strengthen the strained air - bridge between the UK and Afghanistan is also much needed , while the counter - IED measures are crucial .
However , the difficulty some will have with the budget re-shuffling is that it prioritises fighting today 's war over preparing for tomorrow's .
Nor do the cuts appear to result from a carefully - targeted strategy .
Cynics might accuse the MoD of again being ready for the last war by the time it 's almost over .
Much worse is still to come .
The procurement budget is disastrously over - committed , while the squeeze on public spending means more cuts are inevitable .
However , those even tougher decisions have been left until after the general election .
The Chinooks will be manufactured in the US by Boeing , but maintenance and repairs will provide " a lot of work " at Vector Aerospace in Gosport , Hampshire , said Defence Minister Quentin Davies .
He was criticised on Tuesday by Defence Select Committee MPs for not giving the full contract to a British firm .
He told them : " We have to buy the best equipment that money can buy for our armed services .
We are buying Chinook because Chinook is simply an incomparable aircraft . "
Commander Joint Helicopter Command , Rear Admiral Tony Johnstone - Burt , said Chinooks had proved " invaluable " on operations .
Explosive devices
With the recession meaning UK public finances now show a deficit of £ 178bn , some cost - saving measures have been announced and more huge cuts are expected .
After Chancellor Alistair Darling 's pre-Budget report last week the Institute of Fiscal Studies predicted that defence , higher education , transport and housing were most likely to be hit , in order to protect schools and hospitals .
Mr Davies told the BBC decisions always had to be made about what the government wanted and what it could afford .
Asked about the possibility of RAF airbase closures , he said : " If we can get by with fewer bases that will be a very good thing to do .
We do n't have bases for the sake of having bases ; they are not an end in themselves . "
Director of the Royal United Services Institute Professor Michael Clarke said the decisions were being made in the absence of a defence review , which had not happened for 12 years and was not due until after the general election .
The announcement came as a report by the National Audit Office accused the MoD of driving up projects ' overall budgets through short - term cost-cutting .
On Monday , Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced £ 150 m would be spent on tackling improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan - which have killed 122 of the 237 British service personnel to have died there .
The body of the soldier who became the 100th British fatality in Afghanistan this year , Lance Corporal Adam Drane , has been returned to the UK .
Meanwhile , the first of 500 extra British troops to be deployed to Afghanistan have arrived in the country .

Two of the world 's largest car firms kicked off trials of their flagship electric vehicles this weekend as part of a nationwide pilot scheme backed by the Technology Strategy Board ( TSB ) .
Mitsubishi's electric i-MiEVs and BMW 's electric Mini were both distributed to participants in the trial , which is intended to inform both the development of the yet - to - be- released vehicles and the government 's wider electric car strategy .
Mini 's electric car trial began in Oxford where 40 customers picked up their cars as part of a pilot scheme that has seen a special charging points fitted at the homes of the successful applicants and data collection devices fitted to each of the Mini Es .
The company said that the six - month project was intended to evaluate the psychological , social and technical aspects of living with an electric car .
The information will be collected by Oxford Brookes University and then made publicly available .
The Mini E is based on the Mini hatchback , but the back seat is converted to store batteries .
The 35 kWh lithium - ion battery powers a 201 bhp electric motor , which provides similar acceleration to a standard mini .
BMW – which owns Mini – says the overall CO2 emissions from the car equates to roughly 68g / km , which is around half the CO2 emitted by a 1.25l Ford Fiesta .
It added that the emissions related to the vehicle would fall over time as more renewable energy plays a greater role in the UK 's energy mix .
The trial has been part - subsidised by the TSB with participants in the trial paying £ 330 a month , excluding charging costs , for use of the vehicles .
BMW estimates a full charge will cost £ 1.50 at night and £ 4.00 during the day .
It added that each full charge will give the vehicle a range of about 150 miles .
Meanwhile , Mitsubishi's pilot scheme has seen 25 i-MiEVs , the electric version of its compact four - seat , four - door , rear - engined " i " city car , distributed to customers in the midlands .
The cars were distributed as part of the £ 15 m Coventry and Birmingham Low Emission Vehicle Demonstrators ( Cabled ) project , which will ultimately see 110 vehicles trialled in Birmingham and Coventry .
Under the scheme , Indian auto giant Tata will contribute 25 electric Indicas , Microlab will provide 10 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles , Land Rover is to supply five Range_e plug - in hybrids and LTI will provide five electric taxis .
E.ON , Birmingham City Council and Coventry City Council will also install electrical charging points for the vehicles and arrange access to the University of Birmingham 's hydrogen refuelling station .
The launch of the trials came as business secretary Lord Mandelson announced plans for a new £ 19 m competition to help accelerate the development of electric vehicles .
More details of the competition are expected to be announced in February .

Editor ’s Note :
For a different take on body scanners , check out Kevin Drum ’s post on the subject .
Scan , baby , scan .
That ’s the mantra among politicians at all levels in the wake of the thwarted terrorist attack aboard a Detroit - bound passenger jet .
According to conventional wisdom , the would - be “ underwear bomber ” could have been stopped by airport security if he ’d been put through a full - body scanner , which would have revealed the cache of explosives attached to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ’s groin .
Within days or even hours of the bombing attempt , everyone was talking about so - called whole - body imaging as the magic bullet that could stop this type of attack .
In announcing hearings by the Senate Homeland Security Commitee , Joe Lieberman approached the use of scanners as a foregone conclusion , saying one of the “ big , urgent questions that we are holding this hearing to answer ” was “ Why is n’t whole - body - scanning technology that can detect explosives in wider use ? ” Former Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff told the Washington Post , “ You ’ve got to find some way of detecting things in parts of the body that are n’t easy to get at .
It ’s either pat downs or imaging , or otherwise hoping that bad guys have n’t figured it out , and I guess bad guys have figured it out . ”
Since the alternative is being groped by airport screeners , the scanners might sound pretty good .
The Transportation Security Administration has claimed that the images “ are friendly enough to post in a preschool , ” though the pictures themselves tell another story , and numerous organizations have opposed them as a gross invasion of privacy .
Beyond privacy issues , however , are questions about whether these machines really work — and about who stands to benefit most from their use .
As I documented in my book The Five Unanswered Questions About 9/11 , airport security has always been compromised by corporate interests .
When it comes to high - tech screening methods , the TSA has a dismal record of enriching private corporations with failed technologies , and there are signs that the latest miracle device may just bring more of the same .
Known by their opponents as “ digital strip search ” machines , the full - body scanners use one of two technologies — millimeter wave sensors or backscatter x-rays — to see through clothing , producing ghostly images of naked passengers .
Yet critics say that these , too , are highly fallible , and are incapable of revealing explosives hidden in body cavities — an age - old method for smuggling contraband .
If that ’s the case , a terrorist could hide the entire bomb works within his or her body , and breeze through the virtual strip search undetected .
Yesterday , the London Independent reported on “ authoritative claims that officials at the [ UK ]
Department for Transport and the Home Office have already tested the scanners and were not persuaded that they would work comprehensively against terrorist threats to aviation . ”
A British defense - research firm reportedly found the machines unreliable in detecting “ low - density ” materials like plastics , chemicals , and liquids — precisely what the underwear bomber had stuffed in his briefs .
Yet the rush toward full - body scans already seems unstoppable .
They were mandated today as part of the “ enhanced ” screening for travelers from selected countries , and hundreds of the machines are already on order , at a cost of about $ 150,000 apiece .
Within days of the bombing attempt , Reuters was reporting that the “ greater U.S. government shift toward using the high - tech devices could create a boom for makers of security imaging products , and it has already created a speculative spike in share prices in some companies . ”
Which brings us to the money shot .
The body scanner is sure to get a go - ahead because of the illustrious personages hawking them .
Chief among them is former DHS secretary Michael Chertoff , who now heads the Chertoff Group , which represents one of the leading manufacturers of whole - body - imaging machines , Rapiscan Systems .
For days after the attack , Chertoff made the rounds on the media promoting the scanners , calling the bombing attempt “ a very vivid lesson in the value of that machinery ” — all without disclosing his relationship to Rapiscan .
According to the Washington Post :
Chertoff ’s advocacy for the technology dates back to his time in the Bush administration .
In 2005 , Homeland Security ordered the government ’s first batch of the scanners — five from California - based Rapiscan Systems .
Today , 40 body scanners are in use at 19 U.S. airports .
The number is expected to skyrocket at least in part because of the Christmas Day incident .
The Transportation Security Administration this week said it will order 300 more machines .
In the summer , TSA purchased 150 machines from Rapiscan with $ 25 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds .
The Washington Examiner last week ran down an entire list of all the former Washington politicians and staff members who are now part of what it calls the “ full - body scanner lobby ” :
One manufacturer , according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer , is American Science & Engineering , Inc. AS&E has retained the K Street firm Wexler & Walker to lobby for “ federal deployment of security technology by DHS and DOD . ”
Individual lobbyists on this account include former TSA deputy administration Tom Blank , who also worked under House Speaker Newt Gingrich .
Chad Wolf — former assistant administrator for policy at TSA , and a former aide to Kay Bailey Hutchison , R - Tex. , a top Senate appropriator and the ranking Republican on the transportation committee — is also lobbying on AS&E ’s behalf .
Smiths Detection , another screening manufacturer , employs top transportation lobbying firm Van Scoyoc Associates , including Kevin Patrick Kelly , a former top staffer to Sen.
Barbara Mikulski , D - Md. , who sits on the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee .
Smiths also retains former congresswoman Helen Delich Bentley , R- Md. Former Sen. Al D’Amato , R - N.Y. , represents L3 Systems , about which Bloomberg wrote today : “ L - 3 has ‘ developed a more sophisticated system that could prevent smuggling of almost anything on the body , ’ said Howard Rubel , an analyst at Jefferies & Co. , who has a ‘ hold ’ rating on the stock . ”
In forecasting the fate of the full - body scanners , we can turn to recent history , which saw the rapid rise — and decline — of the previous “ miracle ” screening technology .
In the years following 9/11 , dozens of explosive trace portals ( ETPs ) were installed in airports across the country , at a cost of about $ 160,000 each .
These “ puffer ” machines — so called because they blow air on passengers to dislodge explosive particles — were once celebrated as the “ no - touch pat down . ”
But in a Denver test by CBS in 2007 , a network employee was sprayed with explosives and then walked through the airport ’s three puffers without any trouble .
The machines also set off false alarms , and they frequently broke down , leading to sky - high maintenance costs .
After spending more than $ 30 million on the puffer machines — most of them purchased from GE — the TSA announced earlier this year that it was suspending their use .
Only about 25 percent of the machines were ever even deployed at US airports .
A report last month from the Government Accountability Office found that the TSA had not adequately tested the puffers before buying them .
What will happen if the full - body scanner goes the way of the puffer ?
Well , there ’s always the next generation of security equipment : the Body Orifice Security Scanner , or BOSS chair .
This contraption , which has an uncomfortable resemblance to an electric chair , is used in prisons , mostly in the UK , for tracing cell phones , shivs , and other dangerous contraband that ’s been swallowed or inserted into body cavities by inmates .
So far , it only detects metal , but you never know .
Give me a friendly German Shepherd any day .
Michael J. Badnarik , the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2004 elections and a former software engineer and radio talk show host has suffered a heart attack .
Badnarik is also the president of the 2009 Continental Congress .
Badnarik was in Madison , Wisconsin , attending a hearing regarding a raw milk case when he collapsed , according to Gary Franchi , the National Director of Restore the Republic .
“ After the hearing he got in a car to go to lunch with friends , He then slumped over .
His friends attempted CPR and contacted the paramedics .
They attempted to revive him 3 times with no success .
Upon the 4th attempt his heart was revived yet with erratic behavior , ” writes Franchi in an email .
Michael was taken to a local hospital in Wisconsin and fitted with a temporary pacemaker and a balloon pump to ease stress on his heart .
He remains in an unconscious state and his condition is listed as serious .

In November 2009 , Badnarik was elected as one of three delegates from the State of Texas to attend the 2009 Continental Congress sponsored by the We The People Foundation , and subsequently elected parliamentary president of that body .
In October 2008 , he began hosting a talk radio program , Lighting the Fires of Liberty , on the Genesis Communications Network .
Firefox and Safari partially support it , Google 's Wave and Chrome projects are banking on it , and most web developers are ecstatic about what it means .
It 's HTML5 , and if you 're not exactly sure what it is , here 's an explainer .

What is HTML5 ?
Some kind of really fancy link tag ?
HTML5 is a specification for how the web 's core language , HTML , should be formatted and utilized to deliver text , images , multimedia , web apps , search forms , and anything else you see in your browser .
In some ways , it 's mostly a core set of standards that only web developers really need to know .
In other ways , it 's a major revision to how the web is put together .
Not every web site will use it , but those that do will have better support across modern desktop and mobile browsers ( that is , everything except Internet Explorer ) .

What Awesomeness can I expect from HTML5 ?

The big , marquee changes in HTML5 have already made some headlines , thanks to browser makers like Google , Apple , Mozilla , and others picking them up and implementing them .
The shortlist :
Offline storage : Kind of like " Super Cookies , " but with much more space to store both one - time data and persistent app databases , like email .
Actually , you can think of offline storage as something a lot like Google Gears — you just wo n't need to install a plug - in to reap the benefits .

Web application focus :
Without breaking down the hundreds of nuts and bolts , it 's fair to say that HTML5 is aimed at making it easier to build wikis , drag - and - drop tools , discussion boards , real - time chat , search front - ends , and other modern web elements into any site , and have them work the same across browsers .

Neat interactive site that shows tweets from folks who are digging on HTML5 , with streaming background audio and interactive data pieces .
Why is it being pushed ?
Do n't Flash and JavaScript already work ?
Make no mistake , HTML5 has much love for JavaScript and its many relatives — in fact , the new markup standards make it easier for JavaScript - type code to point at , and pull from , pieces of each web page .
As for Flash , and Silverlight , and other browser plug-ins , well , they are artificial solutions for a natural problem that HTML5 is trying to fix : Placing and managing interactive elements on a web page .

Besides being a major source of browser memory leaks and crashes , Flash and its brethren also does n't work on every platform , and has to be re-written and adapted for every new one .
If you 're looking to make a clever application available to as many people as possible , a write once , use everywhere system is ideal .
When more browsers and developers support HTML5 's audio , video , and interaction standards , the idea of the web as the universal app store — for smartphones , for desktops and laptops , Windows , Mac , and Linux — gets closer to reality .

Apple tried to pitch this mentality to developers with their first iPhone release .
That pronouncement was , to put it mildly , roundly mocked .
Since then , webapps have become a lot more powerful and respectable as mainstays of productivity , and enthusiasm for the walled garden model of application markets has waned quite a bit in the minds of an increasing number of developers .
Advertisement
That 's not to say that HTML5 - powered web applications , with their lack of serious local storage , hardware access , and serious offline capabilities , are going to make the iPhone App Store , the Android Market , or the desktop software we 're all used to obsolete .
But look at how Chrome is positioning its Chrome OS for netbooks , which relies on HTML5 for offline storage : A secondary computer , in terms of hard - and - fast capabilities , but one you might use just as often , if not more , for the web - connected convenience .

How will HTML5 makes its way onto my web ?
HTML5 is n't a software release , or a web development law .
It 's a voted - upon and group - edited standard , written in broad fashion to accommodate different styles of development and the different thinking among web browser makers .
Advertisement
Put more simply , it depends on what you 're using to surf .
And what standards your web makers are following .
Advertisement
Firefox , Safari , and Chrome on the desktop support a few of the styles and features outlined in HTML5 's draft specifications , like offline storage , canvas drawing , and , most intriguingly , tags for audio and video that allow sites to stream multimedia files directly into a browser .
Apple 's Safari for iPhone and the Android browser also support elements of HTML5 , as does Opera Mobile .
Want to know the nitty - gritty of where your browser stands on HTML5 ?
Web geeks have put in the time to put it all in a Wikipedia chart .
Those audio and video tags are n't quite as liberating as they may seem .
The writers of the HTML5 standard — Ian Hickson of Google and Davd Hyatt of Apple — wanted to define a single , standardized format for video streaming , but while their employers favor the H.264/ MPEG - 4 standard , open - source firms like Mozilla can't abide by its patent " encumbrance , " and Opera and other web firms do n't particularly love the licensing costs .
Their alternative is Theora , better known ( relatively ) as Ogg Theora .
As it stands , HTML5 simply does n't require or suggest a single container format or codec to use , which could mean browser - by - browser differences down the road .
Ars Technica has a good explainer on the HTML5 video codec debate .

ASTONISHINGLY , “ Monty Python ’s Flying Circus , ” the groundbreaking BBC comedy series , is 40 years old this year , almost as ancient as the Beatles .
As Terry Jones , one of the six - member troupe who created and acted in the show , said recently : “ Time just seems to get quicker .
You look in the mirror in the morning and you think , ‘ I ’m already shaving again ! ’ ”
The principals are all in late middle age now , jowly and graying , and have in some ways become the very sorts of people they used to poke fun at .
Michael Palin makes travel documentaries .
Mr. Jones makes documentaries and writes scholarly books about the Middle Ages , the period the Pythons so memorably sent up in their film “ Monty Python and the Holy Grail . ”
Terry Gilliam , animator turned filmmaker , is still quixotically obsessed with making a movie about Don Quixote .
Eric
Idle , who ’s mostly responsible for the long - running Broadway production of “ Spamalot , ” writes musical shows , many of them recycling Python material .
And John Cleese , who at 70 is the oldest of the group , in addition to appearing in movies and sitcoms and making golf - ball commercials , sometimes turns into a cranky old buffer complaining about cultural decline and Britain ’s tabloids .
He does n’t watch much comedy anymore .
“ As you get older you laugh less , ” he says , “ because you ’ve heard most of the jokes before . "
The show , on the other hand , has n’t aged a bit .
In the United States , “ Flying Circus ” did n’t catch on until 1974 , when it was pretty much off the air in Britain and the members had started to go their separate ways .
Hugh Hefner was an early fan .
Go figure .
But the show has had a surprisingly durable afterlife in this country , giving rise to second and third generations of fans who watch it on DVD and on YouTube , where it ’s so popular it now has its own dedicated channel .
Mr. Cleese said recently that in England he is far better known these days as Basil Fawlty , the title character in his post - Python series “ Fawlty Towers , ” than for his role in “ Flying Circus . ”
But even in American middle schools now , there ’s often a smart aleck or two who can do Mr. Cleese ’s Silly Walk and know the Dead Parrot sketch by heart .
When they get to high school in a few years they will also have mastered the sketch about the man with three buttocks and know all the words to the gay lumberjack song .
This courtroom drawing shows accused Christmas Day Bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in Federal court in Detroit , Michigan .
January 8 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Kabrin
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A senior counterterrorism official said on Wednesday his agency lacks “ Google - like ” search capability that could have identified the suspect in the attempted Christmas Day airline bombing .
The National Counterterrorism Center , the agency charged with reviewing disparate data to protect against attacks , does not have a computer search engine that could have checked for various spellings of the alleged bomber ’s name and his birthplace in Nigeria , the center ’s chief told a Senate hearing on security reform .
“ We do not have that exact capacity , ” said Michael Leiter , adding that the agency is working on solutions that could be in place within weeks .
The State Department has acknowledged it misspelling attacker ’s name , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , when sending an advisory out about him after his father warned the U.S. embassy in Nigeria his son had been attracted by militant ideology .
Google and other common Internet search engines routinely offer alternative spellings for searches , particularly with names .
Abdulmutallab had been flagged beforehand by U.S. embassy staff in Nigeria , but not under his full name .
National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair acknowledged that current search tools used by U.S. spy and counterterror agencies have “ blind spots that do n’t allow the sort of Google - like ” searches civilians can do on their personal computers .
Patrick Kennedy , Undersecretary of State for management , told a second hearing that because of the spelling mistake in his name , the State Department did not add information about Abdulmutallab ’s latest U.S. visa to his file .
Senator Patrick Leahy asked why the State Department lacked the ability found in consumer search engines that automatically ask about different spellings of a name .
Kennedy said that kind of search software had not been installed on its database before the attempted attack , and would only have looked into visa applications , not visas that had already been granted .
Twenty years ago , Theodore Cross traveled 16 time zones , from New York to Moscow , Irkutsk and Yakutsk , and finally to the tundra of the Kolyma Delta , in northeastern Siberia , to catch a coveted glimpse of an Arctic bird , the Ross ’s gull .
Mr. Cross did spot one gull , but its nest was overtaken by a parasitic jaeger before he could return with his blind and his long telephoto lens .
The trip was a failure .
Two weeks later , the unexpected happened : a Ross ’s gull showed up in Baltimore .
Thousands of birders converged on the spot for the rare sighting .
“ They call it the bird that launched 20,000 binoculars , ” Mr. Cross said .
His 344 - page volume , “ Waterbirds ” ( W. W. Norton & Company ) , is part visual encyclopedia , part memoir of a nearly half - century pursuit of birds .
In intimate portraits of birds , like tiny sandpipers and the “ flying boxcar ” of a bar - tailed godwit , and in personal anecdotes of his birding adventures , Mr. Cross , 85 , describes how he spent the first half of his life oblivious to birds only to become one of their most ardent photographers and advocates in the second half .
Now , he writes , “ the memories of them help me accept the brevity of the time that lies ahead . ”
I am trying to use reflection to access some unpublished features of the telephony API .
Currently I am having trouble instantiating a serviceManager object that is needed to get the " phone " service as a binder which I can then use to instantiate a telephony object which is needed to make a call , end call , etc ...
currently when I make the call
serviceManagerObject = tempInterfaceMethod.invoke( null , new Object [ ] { new Binder ( ) } ) ;
it returns a nullPointerException .
I believe this has to do with creating a new Binder instead of sending the appropriate binder ( which I am unsure of which one is appropriate )
Every website has a plethora of links .
These can be classified in different ways , such as form of content that could be text or image or video .
Links can also be categorized as per the purpose they serve .
There are four types of links in the context of purpose .
These are internal and external , incoming and outgoing .
The latter two are also known as inbound and outbound links .
Internal and external links are those that are published on the website and respectively redirect the audience to pages on the website or other websites .
Outbound links are those that specifically redirect users to other websites , which may or may not be owned by the same webmaster or may be used to monetize a blog .
Inbound links , also known as backlinks , are published on other websites where from the target audience is redirected to the linked website or webpage .
A Brief Assessment of Backlinks vs. Inbound Links
Backlinks and inbound links can be deemed to be the same but they are not identical .
All inbound links are effectively backlinks but they are not always intentional .
For instance , if the owner of a website or a company is placing the backlinks or inbound links on different sites at spread across the web , in the form of ads and other contents , then these are intentional and tasked for specific purposes such as search engine optimization or to generate more traffic .
If the inbound links are not published or placed intentionally , then they are not necessarily pleasant backlinks .
These links may have an unpleasant effect .
It is fair to infer that all inbound links that are intentionally placed are desirable backlinks .
All backlinks that are not intentionally placed are inbound links that may or may not be desirable .
This is why it is imperative for you to find out who links to your blog .
You need to know this so you can make the most of the pleasant , desirable or effective links and get rid of the unpleasant or undesirable links .
You may not have to do anything about unintentional but ineffective inbound links since they are not making a difference , unless there is a reason to worry about an adverse effect .
Why you Need to Know Who Links to your Blog
Backlinks are useful when they are placed on trusted , relevant and authoritative websites .
The purpose of such inbound links is to establish trust , to have an expanding presence across the web and to entice more people to check out the blog .
These backlinks have a direct effect on search engine optimization and also the website ranking of a blog .
You do not have to invest additional time and effort to find out how intentionally placed backlinks are appearing on different sites .
You must find out who has linked to your blog without your knowing .
Here are the simple reasons why you must do this .
• You need effective backlinks .
The number of backlinks you have and how all those inbound links are working will determine your strategy .
Link building is at the crux of search engine optimization and website ranking .
Unless you know where all you have links placed redirecting users to your blog or simply citing some of your posts , you cannot review your link building strategy and hence your entire approach to search engine optimization may be ineffective , even inconsequential .
• Just as you must be aware of the ineffective and unwanted inbound links , you should also find out the more effective and hence productive backlinks .
Finding these and learning more about them will enable you to conceive a strategy that further explores similar backlinks .
A strategy that has accidentally or expectedly worked should be continued .
• Finding out who links to your blog is crucial to assess and analyze your success or failure .
The content on your blog may be great or it may be found lacking by some in your target audience .
You may or may not get many organic backlinks .
You may have to work really hard to get some inbound links .
How many people are referring to your blog and actually citing the content on your website using outbound links on their sites will tell you how popular your information is , if it is reliable and if you are emerging as a brand .
• Backlinks or inbound links are brand mentions .
There are organic and inorganic brand mentions .
The average internet user may not always get to segregate one from the other but the search engines , algorithms assigning ranks to websites and other programs crawling the web will easily tell the difference between organic and inorganic brand mentions in due course of time .
Hence , the objective is to find more websites , companies or people who will voluntarily cite your blog as a reference , source or recommendation while publishing their contents .
How to Find Out Who Links to Your Blog
One of the most worrisome consequences of not knowing who links to your blog is getting penalized for no fault of yours .
If a website that is known for spamming and has been a source of phishing attacks or has indulged in prohibited practices as stipulated by search engines and other regulators , then inbound links on such platforms redirecting internet users to your blog can easily dent your reputation .
Your website or blog may be presumed to be an affiliate of that site in odd instances and it is possible your domain will get flagged .
There are free and paid solutions available to find out who links to your blog .
The two largest search engines in the world right now have appropriate tools .
Both Google and Bing could be sufficient for you to know everything about inbound links or backlinks .
You may use a paid solution too if that suits your purpose .
Google Search Console
Whether or not you use any other free or paid tool , you must absolutely use Google Search Console .
Google is the largest search engine on the planet .
It is also the most advanced in more ways than one .
Google Search Console can actually find some links that paid solutions or tools fail to locate and identify .
It is true that Google Search Console does bring out all the inbound links or backlinks , many of which may not exist right now but it is better to be aware of everything than missing out on something that matters .
You can access GSC or Google Search Console just the way you accessed Google Webmaster Tools .
It has a new name since May , 2015 .
Bing Webmaster Tools
Bing is a powerful search engine .
Its presence may be at times dwarfed in many regions of the world but it is relevant and useful .
Bing has its own plethora of Webmaster Tools .
You can access most of these tools for free and using one you will be able to find the links to your blog .
New bloggers or webmasters will have to wait for a week or longer for the relevant data to be amassed by Bing .
You will need a Microsoft account .
You can look for Reports & Data .
There will be an option of Inbound Links .
You can choose Export All and download all the inbound links and associated data .
Free and Paid Tools to Find Links to your Blog
Google and Bing are definitely the default platforms to use for any blogger .
Their webmaster tools are useful and free .
There is absolutely no reason why you should not use them to find links to your blog .
You can also use other free tools such as Majestic and Ahrefs .
Majestic is deemed by many to be better than Ahrefs .
You must have your domain verified and then you can obtain all the data pertaining to inbound links for free .
The advanced report generated by Majestic is quite comprehensive and it is , in most cases , as reliable as the data made available by Google and Bing .
Ahrefs is not as good as Majestic in the context of link metrics but it does have an enormous index of backlinks , actually all kinds of links since inbound links for a blog are actually outbound links for the source website wherefrom users get redirected .
It is possible that you will find more inbound links using Ahrefs than you will with Majestic .
The account with Ahrefs can be created for free .
The verification process for your domain is also free .
There are paid tools such as Monitor Backlinks and Link Explorer .
You may be able to sign up for free if a trial is available .
You will not get all the features available for paying users .
It is entirely up to you whether or not you wish to try paid tools .
With Google and Bing by your side along with other free tools available at your disposal , you can definitely avoid paying for now and get as much relevant data as you want .
Analyze the links and assess the profiles of those who are linking to your blog , review your backlinks strategy and improve your link building tactics .
The History Of Marvel Comics By admin
Some of the most well known comic book characters have come from Marvel Comics .
It is also known to be a huge corporation and is labeled to be Marvel Entertainment .
This corporation is known world wide and has such great influence and revenues .
The history of Marvel Comics is quite an interesting story as it goes back very far to a time when its popularity became a household name , mostly among the younger people .
The beginning of this comic book originally was founded during the year of 1939 and was named only as Timely Comics .
Through Timely Comics came some great and wonderful characters .
These characters were known to be super heroes .
The many characters went on to become quite successful among many young people and gained a lot of popularity in the United States .
One character that seemed to be created during the time of World War Two was Captain America .
This character became a huge hit with Timely Comics .
This character , along with a few others , were known to always be heroes of that time and were continuously battling the enemy , which during that era was the Nazis and a few other men of evil too .
Many styles and interest began to change at the end of the war .
The characters too would go on to change as once costumed super heroes that gained so much attention and popularity were now declining and it was other characters that were taking their place in history .
Also during that time period Timely Comics became known as Atlas Comics .
Atlas changed the theme from the once war time heroes to a variety of other themes such as horror .
After some time had passed the war time heroes returned to battle the communist rather then the Nazis .
However , the industry of Atlas Comics went under the political scrutiny and was then needed to change once again .
The code authority was then formed and went on to be used to serves as the means for regulating the comic books along with their content .
After that period of time the comic book heroes then began to reemerge right back into the comic book scene .
The silver age now began to feature some new and exciting artwork and great story lines to the books .
All of the older super heroes were now transformed into newer versions of themselves and now were with more emotional and personal backgrounds and stories too .
It was then in the year of 1961 that Marvel Comics emerged and with it came the Fantastic Four .
This group of super heroes would go on to become quite popular and stay that way for many years to come .
Over the years comic books would continue to grow in popularity and would create many new characters for all to enjoy .
Not long after many of these comic book heroes would make it into the movie industry too .
This would help to bring the story book charters to life on the big screen .
There are quite a few movies that owe it to Marvel Comics for their success in the movie industry as many of the super heroes that came from the comic books became even more popular through the motion picture industry .
Recommend Builders in Kent
If you have recently had building works done and the job was done professionally to a high standard , why not recommend builders in Kent .
Getting a good builder can be a nightmare , and if you have no connections to the industry and do n’t know anyone that can recommend a good company then where do you begin looking ?
Recommendation sites are springing up all over the internet for many different trades and skills , and if you have a view then it helps those that do n’t !
The process tends to be really simply you just log into the site , select the south east coast and type a recommendation for the builders in Kent you have experience of !
Be honest with your review but also try and be fair – sometimes issues crop up that neither you or the builder could have predicted – the important thing is how professionally they dealt with it .
By all means explain what went wrong but also what the company did to help .
Clearly if it is a bad building firm then people need to know that – the best way to beat the cowboys is to name and shame them so that no one is taken in by their spin .
Basically try and give the sort of information that you would want yourself if you were searching for builders in Kent .
Word of mouth is an excellent form of advertising as well so if you are out and about why not mention the excellent builders in Kent to your friends .
This works equally well when someone comes round and sees your new conservatory or sees the repointing work on the outside of your house , it only takes a couple of minutes to mention the name of the company that did the work – after all who knows when your friend might need a builder themselves !
The thing to remember is that these are tough economy times for everyone , so the last thing anyone wants is to get ripped off by cowboy builders and shoddy workmanship .
If we all take the time to add to review sites we all benefit from better consumer experiences , plus of course genuine reputable builders in Kent are going to be delighted to see that their hard work has been recognised by loyal customers .
More customers coming their way will also benefit them during this stressful financial period so give it a go !
Free advertising is something we can all do for companies that help us out – how many times have you said mentioned that you have a great bank , or that you know where to get the best electrical goods ?
How often have you told a friend not to have their hair cut in a certain salon or told them not to eat at a certain restaurant .
Put like that it seems natural to recommend tradesmen but surprisingly few people do – probably because up to now there was little outlet – apart from word of mouth – for you to do this .
If you do one thing today – recommend builders in Kent !

Updated | 1:12 p.m .
One day before the anniversary of his death , the remains of the late president of Cyprus , Tassos Papadopoulos , were stolen from a graveyard outside Nicosia , the nation ’s capital .
According to the Cypriot police , the theft was discovered on Friday morning by a former bodyguard who visited the tomb where Mr. Papadopoulos was buried last year after he died of lung cancer at the age of 74 .
Reuters reported that the visitor “ found piles of earth by the graveside and an empty casket within . ”
A local news source , The Famagusta Gazette reported that police in the capital city of Nicosia are “ questioning three men ” in connection with their investigation .
The Gazette also cited “ unconfirmed reports ” suggesting that the three men may be “ officers from Greece serving with the Cyprus National Guard . ”
The Web site Cyprus Mail noted : “ The news sent shock waves across Cyprus with several politicians condemning the act .
Police have cordoned off the grave and are scouring the rain - soaked area for clues . ”
Tensions between local Greek and Turkish communities erupted on Cyprus soon after it achieved independence from Britain in 1960 , and the island remains physically divided , with a no man ’s land that also splits the capital in two .
A political leader from the Turkish community on Cyprus said the act may have been a provocation intended to disrupt current peace talks aimed at reunification .
According to an earlier report from The Famagusta Gazette , Rauf Denktash , the former leader of the Turkish Cypriots , said :
We are shocked , not only surprised , whoever has done it , I think has done it for a purpose and that purpose cannot be a good one . [… ]
I understand that it is being circulated amongst the Greek Cypriots that Turks have done it , if this is true then it means it has been done by provocateurs who do not want a settlement but want the two side to be more apart than they are today .
As Voice of America explained on Thursday , there has been some recent momentum in the direction of a settlement that would reunify the Turkish and Greek parts of the island .
This week a group of international statesmen known as “ The Elders , ” which includes former President Jimmy Carter and Desmond Tutu , visited Nicosia for the third time to encourage the talks .
VOA noted “ Their return this week comes as the Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat and his Greek Cypriot counterpart Dimitris Christofias held their 57th meeting in the buffer zone which divides this island . ”
VOA ’s report , filed before the grave - robbing incident , also includes a possible clue as to what people opposed to the reconciliation might hope to achieve by stalling the talks , if indeed that was the reason for the operation : “ There is now an element of urgency to these talks as Mehmet Ali Talat , who favors reunification and membership of the EU for all Cyprus will be facing an election in April 2010 .
A candidate from the opposition National Unity Party , which favors unification with Turkey , is leading in the opinion polls and a win for them could destroy the talks . ”
Cyprus Mail quoted state radio reporting that although the grave had been covered by a heavy granite slab , “ It did not appear that any machinery had been used in the process . ”
The Web site also reported that Mr. Papadopoulos ’s family said a memorial service scheduled for Saturday would go ahead as planned .
As The Associated Press explained , from 2003 until 2008 Mr. Papadopoulos was “ a hard - line president who ushered the ethnically divided island into the European Union after rallying Greek Cypriots to reject a United Nations - brokered peace deal ” in 2004 .
The A.P. added that Mr. Papadopoulos “ was a veteran of Cyprus politics whose career spanned most of the island ’s turbulent history since gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1960 .
He was a leader of the Greek Cypriot guerrilla group EOKA , which waged an anticolonial campaign , and served as the youngest cabinet minister in the island ’s first post - independence government , at the age of 26 . ”
Years later , The A.P. noted he was “ the chief Greek Cypriot negotiator in settlement talks with the breakaway Turkish Cypriots after 1974 , when Turkey invaded the island in response to a coup by supporters of uniting the island with Greece . ”
Mr. Papadopoulos ’s family issued a statement on Friday that said :
It causes ourselves and any object in our vicinity to accelerate downward at 9.8 m/s2 .
Newton has shown that this holds true in a much more general sense : gravity is the acceleration field associated with any massive body .
This gravitational acceleration is attractive , proportional to the mass of the body , and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the body .
Via this universal acceleration , gravity determines the celestial dynamics , it shapes galaxies and determines the ultimate fate of the universe .
We are all familiar with gravity .
Gravity is what makes us earthbound .
But what causes gravity ?
Could there be an underlying layer of reality from which gravity emerges ?
More than three centuries after Newton formulated his laws , we still do n't know .
Enter Dutch theoretical physicist and string theorist Erik Verlinde .
Last Wednesday Verlinde is reported to have presented his latest work at the Spinoza Institute in Utrecht .
In front of an audience that included Nobel Laureate Gerard 't Hooft , Verlinde apparently claimed no less than being able to derive gravity from the ground - up .
Do I hear you mutter the words ' cargo cult science '?
Maybe .
However , you might want to Google “ Verlinde formula ” and search for author “ Erik Verlinde ” on arXiv .
Does this convince you that we are dealing here with a well - respected scientist ?
Good , read on .
Following his presentation in Utrecht , Verlinde gave an interview to the Dutch newspaper “ Volkskrant ” .
This interview appeared in the science section of the Weekend Edition A summary ( in Dutch ) is available here .
Today , a friend e-mailed me the full article .
Unfortunately , the text is in Dutch and , apart from some comments related to the holographic principle , contains little or no details on Verlinde 's derivation of Newtonian gravity .
To make things worse , in the article Verlinde is quoted to be finalizing a publication on his theory .
A quick inspection of arXiv confirms that Verlinde has indeed not yet published a paper on this subject .
So to learn more about Verlinde 's work , it seems we have to exercise some patience .
Well , this might be too pessimistic .
There is a glimmer of hope .
A picture accompanies the newspaper article .
Shown is Verlinde in his office , standing in front of a blackboard .
A blackboard on which some scribbles and equations are vaguely visible .
I have copied the photo below .
Are these scribbles enough to get a basic understanding of Verlinde 's work ?
I think so .
Now , I am going to give you my interpretation of the blackboard scribbles , but I am certainly not going to claim that my interpretation is complete and accurate .
It might , in fact , be completely beside the point .
Anyone who feels to have a better interpretation is invited to put these in a comment to this blog .
This is your chance to discuss a potentially important piece of work even before it is published !
( Photo Credit : Guus Dubbelman / de Volkskrant )
Ok , here we go .
As already mentioned , Verlinde starts from the holographic principle .
Imagine a spherical screen with radius R surrounding a physical system of mass M. According to the holographic principle , all the physics that takes place within the screen can be described by bits of information that can be thought to be located on the screen .
If each bit occupies an area A bit , a total of N = 4 π R2 / A bit bits is available to describe the system surrounded by the spherical screen .
Each bit is associated with a degree of freedom of the system being described .
According to the equipartition theorem , each degree of freedom caries on average an energy ½ kT , with k representing Boltzmann 's constant and T the absolute temperature .
As the screen is assumed to be at rest with respect to the system with mass M , from the perspective of the screen the total energy of the system is given by Einstein 's formula E = M c2 .
It follows that ½ kTN = Mc2 .
Substituting the expression for the number of bits ( N ) into this energy equation , it follows that a temperature T can be associated with the screen according to : ½kT = A bit Mc2 / 4 πR2 .
The holographic screen is not a physical screen but rather a thought construct created to represent the information contained in a physical system .
How can such a non-entity have a temperature ?
The Unruh effect lends us a hand here .
According to this principle , an observer being accelerated in empty space will record a non-zero temperature of that empty space .
This temperature is proportional to the acceleration : ½kT = ћ a / 4 πc ( here ћ denotes the reduced Planck constant [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant] and c represents the speed of light ) .
Reversing this argument , a non-physical entity that has a temperature can be thought of as being accelerated .
Equating the expression for the temperature of the holographic screen with the expression for the Unruh temperature yields : A bit Mc2 / 4 πR2 = ћ a / 4πc , or : a = GM / R2 with G = A bit c3 / ћ.
Et voila : Newton 's law of universal gravitation ...
You get the correct value for the gravitational constant G if you set A bit equal to a Planck area ( 2.6 10-70 m2 ) .
Again : I am just interpreting some scribbles here .
See this as some first impressions without giving the whole idea too much thought .
There is absolutely no guarantee that my interpretations come anywhere close to Verlinde 's thoughts .
We will soon know more .
Watch this space .
--- Postscript ---
Three critical notes to the above interpretation need to be mentioned here :
It seems that somewhere a factor of 4 might have gone astray : according to the holographic principle each bit of information requires an area equal to four Planck units .
At this stage I am not so worried about this .
Provided the concept is right , numerical factors can be dealt with later .
More worrying is the following :

If people were given a pill to make them live longer what would they do with that extra time ?
According to a new study by University of Queensland researchers , they would spend it with their family .
Co-authored by the UQ School of Population Health researchers Associate Professor Jayne Lucke and Professor Wayne Hall , the study interviewed 605 Australians aged 18 to 96 and identified their ethical , social and personal beliefs towards pharmaceutical life extension .
The lead author Dr Brad Partridge , now at the Mayo Clinic in the US , conducted the interviews as part of his PhD .
Dr Lucke said the research , published in the journal Rejuvenation Research recently , was inspired by studies showing the lifespan of animals can be greatly increased in the laboratory .
“ The participants were given a scenario to consider , which involved taking an anti-ageing pill that increased the maximum human lifespan , ” Dr Lucke said .
“ The pill would not be used to cure diseases , but to delay the onset of related health problems which led to an earlier death . ”
She said 63 percent of participants said there would be personal benefits to life extension including spending more time with family ( 36 percent ) ; having more time in life to achieve ambitions ( 31 percent ) ; and better health and quality of life ( 21 percent ) .
“ Eighty percent also envisioned at least one downside , ” she said .
“ These included prolonging a state of poor health ( 34 percent ) ; financial cost of living longer ( 16 percent ) ; and outliving family and friends ( 12 percent ) . "
She said some of the other results were half of the participants believed the benefits to society would include increased collective knowledge ( 26 percent ) ; extended lifespan of ‘ important ' people ( 15 percent ) ; and more time to contribute ( 12 percent ) .
“ More than half ( 52 percent ) of participants thought that life extension would not be beneficial to society though , with seven percent of these participants identifying overpopulation ( 40 percent ) and an increased burden on healthcare and welfare ( 23 percent ) as problems , ” she said .
Dr Lucke said understanding public attitudes towards prolonging the human lifespan was important to consider .
“ It is a known fact that public attitudes toward new technologies , especially one such as the possibly of increasing the lifespan , may foster or impede research progress , ” she said .
“ The study should encourage researchers , bioethicists and policy makers to engage with members of the public about the goals of research surrounding life extension , the expected outcomes of such research and the likely implications for individuals and society . ”

An al - Jazeera journalist in London reported that an arrest warrant was issued in a London court against Opposition Chairwoman Tzipi Livni for war crimes she allegedly committed during Operation Cast Lead .
A British Jewish community website , JC Online , reported that Livni cancelled her visit scheduled for this weekend out of concerns that pro-Palestinian lawyers would try ask for her arrest .
Earlier Monday , London - based newspaper al - Quds al - Arabi also reported that Livni apparently canceled her planned trip due to international pressure to issue an arrest warrant against her .
On Sunday , dozens of demonstrators protested in front of the building where the convention was to be held .
The protesters called Livni a " terrorist " and waived flags condemning her expected visit .
Livni was slated to speak at the Jewish National Fund 's Vision 2010 conference held in Hendon , northwest of London .
According to the report , Livni was also due to meet with Prime Minister Gordon Brown for private talks .
Livni's office denied these reports .
Her office reported to Ynet : " The invitation to the annual JNF conference was turned down by us two weeks ago because the schedule meetings with the government figures in London could not take place close to the conference and would have necessitated a longer - than - planned absence from Israel . "
Livni's office also said , " The opposition chairwoman is proud of all her decisions regarding Operation Cast Lead .
The operation achieved its objectives to protect the citizens of Israel and to reinstate Israel 's deterrence capability .
Livni will continue to present this stance everywhere in the world .
Hamas is not a dialogue partner , and we must therefore take forceful action against them , while engaging in negotiations with moderate elements .
As such , no comparison between IDF soldiers and terrorists can be made .
This is Livni 's position whether or not an arrest warrant was issued , which is something we are as of yet unaware of . "
The Foreign Ministry reported that it did not recommend that Livni cancel a trip to any destination .
Later Monday , officials in the British Ministry of Justice and Foreign Ministry told Israeli ambassador to London Ron Prosor later Monday that they were not aware of an arrest warrant issued against Livni .
Britain most problematic country
Israeli lawyers consider Britain to be the most problematic country in terms of the possibility for the arrest of senior Israeli leaders .
A few months ago , Defense Minister Ehud Barak visited Britain , and was faced with accusations by local lawyers of committing war crimes .
However , Barak was not detained .
In 2005 , Major General ( res. ) Doron Almog arrived in London , but remained on board his plane and was forced to fly back to Israel in fear he will be arrested .
The arrest warrant issued against him was later canceled .
Former IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Yaalon postponed a recent trip to Britian following legal recommendations .
Since operation cast lead , legal teams headed by the Attorney General office have been facing an increased number of international legal cases against Israeli officials .

As of THE INDIAN CITIZENSHP ACT OF 1924 , there are ...
By Savas Abadsidis
On this day that marks the historic contributions of Dr. Martin Luther King , we ’d like to offer you this wonderful heartwarming piece of history that reveals some of the humanity and far reaching impact of Dr. King .
Last week , I interviewed actress and performer Nichelle Nichols for an upcoming new magazine called KISS , which will also feature work by Eric Francis .
Nichelle has an upcoming one woman show called ‘ Reflections ’ , wherein she becomes eight legendary African - American performers including Lena Horne , Mahalia Jackson , Sara Vaughn , Etta James and Lady Day among others .
The show is a tour of American history through their music with brief monologues to put them in context .
Nichelle herself has made history over the years , playing the role of Lt. Commander ( later Commander ) Uhura on the groundbreaking and critically acclaimed Star Trek TV show and series of movies .
Nichols was among the first prominent African American actors to regularly appear on a network TV show in a capacity other than a maid or subservient role to a white character .
Yes , Kirk was in command , but we also know that he had respectful relationships with his crew ; that he viewed them as colleagues and was respected by them as their leader .
Nichols would go on and serve as a spokesperson for NASA and the NAACP , and literally be the inspiration for hundreds of African - Americans to join NASA .
Among these was Mae Jamison , whom Nichols met when Jamison was at Cornell Medical School and who Nichols personally inspired to become an astronaut upon completion of her medical degree .
Halfway through the second year of the series , Nichols was offered her own Broadway Show , something she always dreamed of .
On a Friday in the Fall of 1967 , amidst rumors that the show was going to be canceled , Nichols went to the series ’ creator , Gene Rodenberry , and submitted her resignation .
The following day she was invited to speak on a dais by the NAACP at UCLA .
Following the panel discussion an aide informed Nichols that there was huge fan in the audience who asked to meet her .
Nichols agreed to meet with the fan , whom she expected to be a ‘ Trekkie . ’
But , as the handsome young man approached her she quickly recognized the smiling face of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr .
Herein , is an excerpt from the upcoming article depicting how Dr. King persuaded her to stay on the show .
==
“ I hope you will get the story right this time , because for some reason , no one has ever gotten this story right , ( laughs ) .
I , after the first season , because my heart was still on Broadway and the performing arts part of me , the musical performing arts of me was yearning to leave .
I never intended to be an actress other than in the theater .
So for me , TV and movies , that was something to help me get from here to there .
And so it was a shock for me to be cast in Star Trek .
A shock and a joy .
I was performing in England at the time of the inception of the show and my agent tracked me down in Paris and told me that they were doing a show called Star Trek , assuming that I ’d know what that was .
Because I ’d been in and out of the country for so long .
Now I ’d known Gene Rodenberry since he ’d given me my first TV starring role in a show that he ’d done called the ‘ The Lieutenant ’ .
And he was one of the first people of that stature that gave me encouragement .
He called my agent and said can you find Nichelle , because I need her for a role in this show and wherever she is , get her back here because I want a woman head of a department on the bridge .
He changed the role from a man heading communications on the bridge and he wanted a woman of color .
He wanted me and I came back and got the role .
So the first year went by , and I enjoyed doing the role , to me at that time it was very challenging [ laughs ] but I played my role to the hilt , being the head of communications and all that and by this time the show had aired and I was starting to get notice and on the side I ’m singing at places and people are hearing me and calling and I ’m thinking , “ Oh this is my big break !
I have to leave this little show and go do it !
I was thinking Broadway here I come ! ’
And so I went on a Friday evening shortly before the end of the season to let Gene know that I would n’t be returning to the show , he looked at me like I was crazy , “ YOU CAN ’T LEAVE , ” but he realized how serious I was and he knew I was passionate about singing , and he said , “ I know what your dream is and so forth but do n’t you see what I ’m trying to do ?
He said take the weekend and think about my decision and how important this show is and how it was a first and if I leave , well he did n’t know what to say , but he said take the weekend and that way I could take the time to really think about what we just said and come back Monday and we would talk about it and if you really want to leave then , you ’ll go with my blessings , but realize I want you to know that what we are doing here is really historic .
The next night was Saturday and I was due to be a celebrity guest on a dais at an NAACP fundraiser at UCLA .
One of the organizers came up to me and said that there was someone who wants to meet you ; and he says that he ’s you ’re best , biggest fan and I ’m thinking it ’s a Trekkie ! [ laughs ] and so I said certainly and I got up and turned around and maybe 10 or 15 feet coming towards me I see Dr. Martin Luther King and I remember thinking whoever that little fan is , he ’s going to have to wait , because here ’s Dr. King , who walks straight up to me with this big , magnificent smile on his face and says , “ I ’m the fan ! ” because I ’m sort of looking around for someone else , and he says , “ I am your best fan , I am your biggest fan ! ” and I … I was at a loss for words , and if you know me , I am never at a loss for words .
I just could n’t say a thing and he began to tell me how important my role was , what an inspiration it was .
And you have to understand we were in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement , people were regularly being attacked by dogs , and marchers were being hosed on the television every night , real life things , and here I am in this futuristic thing on TV and he was so complimentary , he told me “ I was so important and the way you have created this role , ” and I am just looking at him and looking at him and I remember I just kept hoping he ’d never stop talking .
Because his voice is just … you know the voice .
And I finally just start saying , thank you so much Dr. King and I am shaking his hand and still shaking from nervousness and I said thank you so much and I am really going to miss my co-stars .
And at this his face totally changed , and he said “ What are you talking about ? ! ” and so I told him I would be leaving the show , because ; and that was as far as he let me go , and he said , “ STOP !
You cannot !
You cannot leave this show !
Do you not understand what you are doing ?!
You are the first non-stereotypical role in television !
Of intelligence , and of a woman and a woman of color ?!
That you are playing a role that is not about your color !
That this role could be played by anyone ?
This is not a black role .
This is not a female role !
A blue eyed blond or a pointed ear green person could take this role ! ”
And I am looking at him and looking at him and buzzing , and he said , “ Nichelle , for the first time , not only our little children and people can look on and see themselves , but people who do n’t look like us , people who do n’t look like us , from all over the world , for the first time , the first time on television , they can see us , as we should be !
As intelligent , brilliant , people !
People in roles other than slick tap dancers , and maids , which are all wonderful in their own ways , but for the first time we have a woman , a WOMAN , who represents us and not in menial jobs , and you PROVE it , this man [ Gene Rodenberry ] proves and establishes a precedent that validates what we are marching for because three hundred years from today there we are , and there you are , in all our glory and all your glory !
And you CANNOT leave ! ”
And I did not leave .
I went back on Monday and told Gene that if he had n’t replaced me and still wanted me to stay that I would and I told him what Dr. King said , and I ’ll never forget him sitting behind that big desk that he had and he said , “ so that ’s your decision ? ”
And I said I ’d like my letter of resignation back please and I told him what had happened while meeting Dr. King , and I do n’t know if you know what Gene looked like , but he was a big guy and was like 6 ’ 3 ” with that hawk nose and a great sense of humor and this brilliant mind and a futurist and –whatever great things you heard about him are just a small part of what that man was .
I looked down at him sitting behind his desk when I told him the story and I finally shut up , and a huge tear is rolling down his cheek .
And he said , “ Thank God someone understands what I am trying to achieve . ”
And he reached down into his drawer and pulled out my letter of resignation and handed it to me , it had already been [ laughs ] torn up .
Washington
Post executive editor Marcus Brauchli found himself in the middle of an altercation Friday evening between Style reporter Manuel Roig - Franzia and editor Henry Allen , but will not say whether the two have been reprimanded by the paper .
“ We take this incident seriously and will address it appropriately , ” Brauchli told POLITICO , declining to comment further .
Reports that Allen punched Roig - Franzia surfaced Monday morning on FishbowlDC , Washingtonian and City Paper ( which reported Brauchli was traveling ) .
Multiple Post sources independently confirmed to POLITICO that Roig - Franzia got hit while defending colleague Monica Hesse from harsh criticism leveled by her editor , Allen .
Allen , according to the Washingtonian , had told Hesse that a piece she had written was “ the second worst story I have seen in Style in 43 years . "
Roig - Franzia , also working a story with Hesse that ran Saturday , told Allen not to be such a “ c—sucker . "
Allen swung twice , with one punch hitting Roig - Franzi , according to sources .
Next , staffers on the 4th floor — including Brauchli , whose office is temporarily across from the Style section — jumped in to break up the altercation .
Allen , a Pulitzer Prize - winning editor who already took a buyout , has just three weeks left on his contract , and was not in the office Monday .
Roig - Franzia is in the office .
A Post spokesperson declined to discuss “ private personnel matters . ”
UPDATE : Allen , following news reports that he punched Roiz - Franzia on Friday night , told POLITICO that he was surprised by the huge reaction in the media world .
In the old days , said the 68 - year - old , Pulitzer Prize - winning editor , the press would n't have been so shocked by an expletive - filled , newsroom scuffle .
In D.C. , reporters and bloggers from Washingtonian , Washington City Paper and FishbowlDC swarmed around the story , while top aggregators like Drudge Report , Huffington Post called attention to the news .
( HuffPo went with a bloodied Brad Pitt pic from Fight Club splashed across the media page , with the headline : " Brawl at the Washington Post " ) .
" Back when I got into journalism , the idea that a fistfight in a newsroom would turn into a news story was unthinkable , " Allen said when reached Monday evening .
" The guys in the sports department at the New York Daily News , they had so many , you would n’t even look up . "
But Post staffers definitely looked up , and several people in the newsroom — including Brauchli — helped break things up after Allen threw a punch .
( Allen 's first thrown , he said , since 1963 . )
Following early reports , City Paper 's Eric Wemple has more details , including some back - and - forth between Roiz - Franzia and Allen that took place before Friday .
While there was chatter in the Post newsroom that Roiz - Franzia had been defending a colleague , the two apparently had issues days before that led up to the altercation .
Allen is n't expected to work out of the newsroom for the remainder of his time at the Post .

In January of 2010 , the 11,000 McDonald 's restaurants in the United States and some in Canada with Wi -Fi service will stop charging customers to get access to the Internet using wireless devices .
In January of 2010 , the 11,000 McDonald 's restaurants in the United States and some in Canada with Wi -Fi service ( another 3,000 locations do n't have it ) will stop charging customers to get access to the Internet using wireless devices .
What used to cost $ 2.95 for two hours will now come
McDonald 's is joining chains like Barnes & Noble and Borders which have café's that used to charge for Wi -Fi and now do n't .
McDonald 's will quickly become the largest provider of free Wi-Fi in the world .
Starbucks does it as well , but only for a couple hours at a time .
The McDonald 's network is run by AT&T ; the chain has had Wi-Fi for about five years , first from Wayport ( which AT&T bought ) , and it 's used not just for customer Internet access but also to run the in - store credit card terminals .
This move might make it just about impossible for any public location to be taken seriously when charging for Wi-Fi in the U.S.
The few stragglers out there trying to squeeze us for cash all need to remember : we can now go down the road for a Big Mac and Fries and check our email for free .
Even if we do n't buy the food !
Though it probably wo n't hurt those Big Mac sales much , either .
Considering the proliferation of 3G , WiFi , in - home broadband , and front - facing cameras on phones , you 'd think that there 'd be far more obvious ways to bridge video calls between phones and PCs -- but alas , it 's virtually impossible , particularly in the States where carriers have a complete aversion to the topic .
Enter Fring -- one of the mobile industry 's VoIP pioneers that has spread its love from Symbian to almost every smartphone platform worth mentioning over the years -- which is stepping out today with a new build for S60 handsets that offers video support through Skype .
The way we see it , this is great news for a couple of reasons : one , Skype is one of the few videoconferencing systems with widespread traction , and two , this suddenly makes front - facing cams useful to a whole swath of Nokia users on networks ( ahem , AT&T and T - Mobile ) that do n't offer video calling themselves .
Whether we actually use it is another story altogether , but hey , it 's cool to have it if we absolutely must see your beautiful faceright now in stunning low fidelity .

Conservative Liberals who backed Opposition Leader Tony Abbott 's anti-emissions trading position have been rewarded in a frontbench reshuffle unveiled today .
Mr Abbott has installed climate change sceptic Nick Minchin in the energy and resources portfolio , while fellow hardliner Eric Abetz will take on workplace relations .
Both men were key supporters of Mr Abbott 's decision to challenge former leader Malcolm Turnbull over climate change .
And Mr Abbott has brought back former Howard government ministers Kevin Andrews , Bronwyn Bishop and Philip Ruddock .
Announcing the changes Mr Abbott acknowledged that Mr Andrews , Ms Bishop and Mr Ruddock had been " controversial " and " polarising " as ministers but said they were " substantial " politicians .
As expected , Nationals Senate Leader Barnaby Joyce will move to the frontbench to go head - to - head with Lindsay Tanner in the finance portfolio .
Mr Abbott acknowledged Senator Joyce was a " colourful character " but praised his talent .
" Barnaby is probably Australia 's most accomplished retail politician , " he said .
Ms Bishop will be spokeswoman for seniors , Mr Andrews spokesman for families and Mr Ruddock secretary to the shadow cabinet .
Tony Smith has been promoted to communications and Sophie Mirabella to science and innovation .
Also promoted to secretary positions are Cory Bernardi , Simon Birmingham , Concetta Fierravanti -Wells and Gary Humphries , while Marise Payne will be spokeswoman for COAG .
Greg
Hunt will stay in environment but will also take up the climate change portfolio which has been renamed to " climate action " .
Ian Macfarlane - who brokered the defunct ETS deal with the Government - has been moved to infrastructure and water .
Mr Abbott said his new line - up was a campaigning team who would give the Government the " fright of its life " .
" Today I am announcing a new team that will be focused on criticising the Government rather than speculating about ourselves , " he said .
" I think the Government is vulnerable .
I 'm confident that this new team is well placed to exploit the Government 's vulnerabilities . "
" It 's a good team , it 's a tough team , it 's an energetic team and it's a team that is determined to take the fight to the Government . "
Although many of Mr Abbott 's supporters have been elevated , Mr Abbott said the team was still balanced .
" Many of Malcolm 's key supporters have been promoted , " he said .
" Inevitably if you 're going to have a new team there does have to be some change . '
Mr Abbott conceded that some changes will not please all MPs , with Sharman Stone demoted from immigration , which has been handed to Scott Morrison .
Ms Stone will now take on childcare .
Michael Keenan has been moved to Customs , with his portfolio going to Senator Abetz , and Steve Ciobo has been moved to arts , with Bruce Billson taking on small business .
Julie Bishop , Joe Hockey , Christopher Pyne , Peter Dutton and George Brandis remain in their respective portfolios of foreign affairs , treasury , education , health and shadow attorney - general .
David Johnston will also stay in defence .
Helen Coonan is not taking on a new position after stepping down on Sunday from the finance portfolio and Andrew Robb - who was serving in emissions trading - remains on leave but has been given the position of chairman of Coalition policy development .
The reshuffle was needed after Mr Abbott last week ousted Mr Turnbull as Liberal leader following a revolt from the hard - right against his support for an emissions trading scheme .
Mr Turnbull ruled out serving on the frontbench under Mr Abbott last week after he lost the leadership .

The article questions why rules differ for men and women under Islam A member of the Egyptian parliament has filed a lawsuit over an article questioning why polygamy is allowed for men in Islam but not for women .
The article in the newspaper Al Masry Al Youm was written by a female Saudi journalist , Nadine al - Bedair .
It has been denounced by some Muslim clerics as inflammatory and anti-Islamic .
But others have said it serves the purpose of highlighting how badly some husbands treat their wives .
The article was clearly meant to cause a big stir and it has .
Published in the independent newspaper Al Masry Al Youm , the article by Nadine al - Bedair suggests that polygamy should either be allowed for both men and women - or else there should be a new concept of marriage where men are not allowed to take a new wife just because they are bored with the old one .
' Promoting vice '
In Islam , men can marry four women at the same time - but only if they can treat them all equally .
In practice , women in more traditional parts of the Arab world can suddenly find themselves after years of marriage with few or no rights if their husband chooses to take a new wife .
The article has drawn predictably strong criticism from some Muslim authorities in Egypt , with one saying the author had no right to attack Islamic traditions and had to be stopped .
An Egyptian MP has taken up that gauntlet , filing a legal complaint against the paper , accusing it of promoting vice .
Other clerics have said male polygamy serves a social purpose , allowing widows , divorcees and unmarried women to find a partner .
But one cleric at least has taken a different tack .
He says the article is clearly not an actual call for female polygamy , but an appeal for people to wake up and see how badly some women are treated by their husbands .

Col. Morris Davis Fired For Speaking Out About Military Commissions
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – The American Civil Liberties Union today filed a lawsuit against the Library of Congress on behalf of Col. Morris Davis , the former chief prosecutor for the Guantánamo military commissions , who was terminated from his job at the Library 's Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) because of opinion pieces he wrote about the military commissions system .
The lawsuit charges that CRS violated Davis 's right to free speech and due process when it fired him for speaking as a private citizen about matters having nothing to do with his responsibilities at CRS .
" Col .
Davis has a constitutional right to speak about issues of which he has expert knowledge , and the public has a right to hear from him , " said Aden Fine , staff attorney with the ACLU First Amendment Working Group .
" Col .
Davis 's firsthand experience is invaluable to the ongoing debate over military commissions , and the public should not be denied the chance to hear from him just because he is a public employee . "
After 25 years in the United States Air Force , Davis resigned from his position as chief prosecutor in the military commissions in October 2007 because of his belief that the system was fundamentally flawed .
He then became a vocal critic of the commissions , writing articles , giving speeches and testifying before Congress .
In December 2008 , Davis began working as the Assistant Director of the Foreign Affairs , Defense and Trade Division at CRS , a position that is not related to the military commissions .
On November 11 , 2009 , the Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece and the Washington Post published a letter to the editor in which Davis argued against having a two - tiered system of justice in which some Guantánamo detainees are tried in military commissions and others in federal courts .
Both pieces were written by Davis in his personal capacity , made clear that he was writing as a private individual and former chief prosecutor of the military commissions and made no mention of CRS .
Davis wrote the pieces on his home computer during non-work hours .
In meetings that followed , Davis 's supervisor at CRS , Daniel Mulhollan , informed Davis that as a result of the pieces his employment would be terminated .
Davis was transferred to a temporary 30 - day position at CRS , which will expire on January 20 .
" My status as the former chief prosecutor for the military commissions at Guantánamo Bay and my opinions on that subject are completely unrelated to my position at CRS and totally separate from my duties there , and they do n't interfere with my ability to do my job , " said Davis .
" The work that CRS does is incredibly valuable and I am proud of the opportunity to continue serving my country after a career in the military .
I hope to be reinstated to my original position so I can continue to support Congress at this critical time in our nation 's history . "
In response to a letter from the ACLU in December , the Library of Congress stated that it would not reinstate Davis to his job at CRS .
Today 's lawsuit seeks to reinstate Davis to his position and to reaffirm that governmental employees , including employees of the Library of Congress , may not be terminated for speaking in their private capacities on matters of great public concern .
The ACLU filed the lawsuit against James Billington , the Librarian of Congress , and Mulhollan in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
Attorneys on the case are Fine , Alexander Abdo and Jameel Jaffer of the national ACLU and Arthur Spitzer and Frederick Mulhauser of the ACLU of the National Capital Area .
The ACLU 's complaint is available online at : www.aclu.org/free-speech/davis-v-billington-complaint
More information about the case is available online at : www.aclu.org/free-speech/davis-v-billington
Just days after declaring the Taliban “ insidious ” and a “ cancer ” on Afghanistan that needs to be eliminated , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates insisted that the group was part of the “ political fabric ” of Afghanistan that needed to be willing to take a legitimate role going forward .
The comments came as Afghan President Hamid Karzai is looking for international funding for a plan to pay Taliban fighters in return for them switching sides and joining the NATO - backed government .
The comments suggest that the Obama Administration does n’t want to undermine Karzai ’s already shaky government by looking like they oppose the president ’s scheme .
Secretary Gates added that the Taliban needed to be “ ready to help build a 21st - century Afghanistan . ”
Though Gates insisted earlier this week that the Taliban were “ unlikely ” to accept any reconciliation plan so long as the momentum continues to be in their favor , some analysts suggest that the Taliban might prefer to negotiate now , from its strongest position since the 2001 US invasion , but that such a move would require the help of Pakistan ’s military .

It 's one thing to criticize Paul Krugman for his views on Austrian economics , but only a brave soul would have the temerity to question Krugman 's discussion of the Keynesian approach to international trade , right ?
Since Krugman is the world 's most famous living Keynesian , and he won the Nobel ( Memorial ) Prize for his work on trade theory , accusing him of a basic error on this score would be akin to telling Madonna she knows nothing of pop music .
Even so , in a recent blog post Krugman 's advocacy for deficit spending leads him to commit a basic fallacy when discussing economic output and trade .
What 's really ironic is that Krugman has previously exposed this particular fallacy when others made it !
That the master Keynesian was vulnerable to such a naïve mistake justifies the Austrian warning that focusing on equations of aggregate variables is the wrong approach in economics .
Krugman 's Goof on Trade Theory
A Washington Post editorial had called for lowering trade barriers as a way to stimulate the US economy and create jobs .
Krugman thought this was a nonsolution :
There are a lot of good things you can say about international trade .
But it does not , repeat not , do anything to alleviate a shortage of overall demand .
Yes , if you liberalize trade countries will export more .
But they will also import more .
If you 're worried about C+I + G+X−M , it 's a wash , because X and M rise equally .
Which makes this WaPo editorial on things Obama should be doing about jobs truly bizarre .
Even if the proposed trade deals with Korea and Colombia were remotely big enough to bear mentioning in the context of the crisis — which they are n't — they would n't be job creation measures .
Now , I am not here to defend or reject so - called " free - trade agreements " that consist of hundreds or even thousands of pages of minute trade regulations .
But Krugman is n't rejecting the WaPo suggestion on that score ; he is accepting the basic premise that the deals truly would liberalize the flow of goods across borders , and he is arguing that the Keynesian " national accounting identity " equation [ Y = C + I + G + ( X − M ) ] shows that freer trade wo n't create jobs .
I have read Krugman 's post a few times to make sure I 'm not missing something , but I must confess I think he is committing a very basic error .
Specifically , he is confusing the Keynesian accounting identity with a causal theory of how changes in one of the variables lead to changes in the other variables .
It is particularly ironic that Krugman has made this mistake , since he shredded it when someone else made the same mistake ( in a different context ) .
A final note before I dissect Krugman 's error :
In this article I am conceding the basic Keynesian framework , just for the sake of argument .
Elsewhere I have shown that the entire notion of trying to artificially " create jobs " through government programs is a bad idea , because recessions are the market 's way of reallocating resources after an unsustainable boom .
But in order to isolate Krugman 's particular mistake , I want to correct him using the standard Keynesian approach .
The Keynesian National Income Accounting Identity
The Keynesian view says that one way to measure total economic output ( Y ) is to add up total spending on consumption ( C ) , investment ( I ) , government purchases ( G ) , and net exports ( X − M ) .
This leads to the equation :
Y = C + I + G + ( X − M )
To repeat , this is not a " theory " of the macroeconomy , it is a truism of accounting .
Because goods are diverse , the only way to aggregate them in order to come up with a figure like " total output " is to add up their money prices .
So if " total output " is just the total amount of money that producers are receiving , then this number must be the same as the total amount of money that purchasers are spending .
That 's why the left side of the equation must equal the right side .
The first three components are straightforward enough , but the " net exports " component is a bit tricky .
The idea here is that domestic consumption and investment expenditures need to be adjusted for international trade , in order to isolate the output that was actually produced domestically .
That 's why imports ( M ) — which are so labeled to avoid confusion with investment — are subtracted on the right side .
It 's not that an import per se destroys output , but rather that if an American buys a TV ( consumption ) or a forklift ( investment ) that was actually produced abroad , then we need to subtract out that expenditure from C or I because it does not reflect output produced in the United States .
On the other hand , if foreigners are spending money on consumption or investment goods produced within the United States , then this spending on US exports ( X ) needs to be added , because the first three components ( C , I , and G ) would n't have already captured it since they only look at domestic expenditures .
Now that we understand the logic behind the Keynesian macroaccounting identity , we can illustrate Krugman 's basic mistake .
Krugman Confuses a Tautology With Causality
The huge danger in focusing on this equation is that it very often misleads people into thinking that the way to increase output is to try to raise one of the variables on the right side .
But this is a fallacy !
It 's correct that the accounting identity must always be true , but it can remain in balance if a different variable on the right side falls .
For example , Keynesians often invoke this equation to argue that increases in government spending are necessary to " fill the gap " when private consumption and investment are below " potential GDP . "
They are naively assuming that boosting G on the right side of the equation will necessarily lead to an increase in Y on the left side .
But that relies on the Keynesian theory of how the macroeconomy works ; it does n't follow from the identity itself .
No , the identity is equally consistent with a Chicago School–type argument that says boosting G will simply lead to a dollar - for - dollar drop in C or I , leaving output Y unchanged .
In our present context , Krugman has argued that lowering trade barriers will ( in general ) raise X and M equally , and so this can't possibly change the left side of the equation .
But that is wrong ; it assumes that domestic consumption and investment spending will not themselves be influenced by the reduced trade barriers .
Since the standard case for free trade restson the demonstration that it will increase per capita income , it is simply amazing that Krugman failed to realize this before firing off his blog post .
So Would Cutting Off All Trade Leave World Output the Same ?!
To make the fallacy crystal clear , we can reverse Krugman 's argument .
Suppose governments around the world proposed to completely seal their borders and eliminate trade altogether .
If Krugman is right , that should have no effect whatsoever on world output , and hence on the amount of workers necessary to produce all those goods and services .
It 's true , every country 's export sector would be devastated , but this fall in X would be exactly counterbalanced by a fall in M .
Or more accurately , the countries with a trade deficit would see their output rise , but the countries with a trade surplus would see their output fall .
There is no trade deficit for the world as a whole , so the two effects would cancel across all countries .
We 'll close with a numerical example to drive home the point , and to show that Krugman is wrong even within the Keynesian framework .
To repeat , I 'm not merely arguing in this article that Krugman 's Keynesian logic " must be crazy , " since it " proves " that liberalizing trade can't help an economy mired in recession .
No , I 'm saying that the standard Keynesian tools do allow us to express that liberalizing trade can in fact help in a recession , but Krugman , in his zeal to attack the WaPo editorial , abused his own tools .
Imagine a small but productive island nation , similar to Hong Kong , which has an enormous export sector .
Its Keynesian parameters have the following values :
C = $ 74 billion I = $ 10 billion G = $ 15 billion X = $ 100 billion ( exports ) M = $ 99 billion ( imports )
Thus the GDP of our island nation is $ 100 billion , which is consumption plus investment plus government spending , plus the $ 1 billion in net exports .
Y = C + I + G + ( X − M ) 100 = 74 + 10 + 15 + ( 100 − 99 )
Now suppose that a rival nation surrounds the island with warships and completely seals it off from international trade .
According to Krugman 's logic , we should expect GDP to fall 1 percent , down to $ 99 billion .
Now some of the islanders might say , " Huh ?!
How the heck are we supposed to even eat if we lose our access to the world economy ?
We have no oil or other natural resources , and we import most of our food .
If we can't trade , our cars and trains will come to a standstill and everyone will have to cut meat out of his diet . "
Krugman would laugh at such medieval , verbal reasoning .
He would patiently explain to the frightened islanders that the numbers do n't lie .
Yes the economy would lose $ 100 billion in exports , throwing all those people out of work , but domestic consumers would have to switch their demands away from the $ 99 billion they previously spent on foreign goods .
Net exports only contributed $ 1 billion to GDP before the blockade , so the complete cessation of trade would n't have much of an impact .
Right ?
No , of course that 's not right .
After the blockade is put into place , we ask macroeconomists ( before they starve ) to tabulate the national accounting identity one last time .
This is what they report :
C = $ 15 billion I = $ 0 billion G = $ 5 billion X = $ 0 billion ( exports ) M = $ 0 billion ( imports )
Rather than the 1 percent drop Krugman had forecasted , GDP actually fell a shocking 80 percent , down to $ 20 billion .
No businessperson in his right mind is investing in this environment ; the government has had to slash its spending because of the collapse in revenues ; and consumers have scaled back their purchases to an extreme austerity budget .
The island is devastated by the naval blockade .
Duh !
Of course it is : that 's why warring countries blockade each other .
In closing , let me reiterate : The Keynesian accounting identity is still true .
Output is now $ 20 billion , and , yep , the math checks out — adding up the new variables yields $ 20 billion .
Y = C + I + G + ( X − M ) 20 = 15 + 0 + 5 + ( 0 − 0 )
Where Krugman 's logic failed was his assumption that changes in trade barriers would only affect X and M , leaving C , I , and G the same .
That assumption is wrong .
In the real world , erecting higher trade barriers will reduce economic output in both countries , whereas reducing trade barriers will lead to greater output .
For a country mired in recession , new trade opportunities raise the productivity of labor and allow unemployed workers to be integrated back into the economy more quickly than they otherwise would be .
If the government wants to stimulate job creation , cutting trade barriers is a good idea .

I ’ll let this bad boy speak for itself :
The JL421 Badonkadonk is a completely unique , extremely rare land vehicle and battle tank .
Designed with versatility in mind , the Donk can transport cargo or a crew of five internally or on the roof , and can be piloted from within the armored shell or from an exposed standing position through the hatch , thanks to special one - way steel mesh armor windows and a control stick that pivots up and down to allow piloting from the standing or seated positions .
Yes , you read that right .
You can buy a freakin’ tank on Amazon .
It goes 40 miles per hour , comes with a public announcement system , and a 400 watt sound system .
I ’m just waiting for the day when they come out with a Bang Bus rip - off featuring this land tank .
Perfect For :
When you take your next vacation in Fallujah or the Afghan / Pakistani border and a body suit made entirely of kevlar is n’t quite enough protection .
Also good for when promoting a cult , as the PA system combined with the alien design form will allow even the most disconnected of zealots to successfully promote their beliefs ( I ’m looking at you , Scientology ! ) . ]

Thousands are injured on the roads each year UK cities should have more 20 mph speed zones , as they have cut road injuries by over 40 % in London , a study claims .
In particular the number of children killed or seriously injured has been halved over the past 15 years , the British Medical Journal reported .
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine study estimates 20 mph zones have the potential to prevent up to 700 casualties in London alone .
At 20 mph , it is estimated only one in 40 pedestrians is killed in a crash .
This compares with a one in five chance for someone hit at 30 mph .
This evidence supports the rationale for 20 mph zones not just in major cities in Britain , but also in similar metropolitan areas elsewhere
Study leader , Chris Grundy
The researchers compared data on road collisions , injuries and deaths in London between 1986 and 2006 , with speed limits on roads .
After adjusting for a general reduction in road injuries in recent years , they found that the introduction of 20 mph zones were associated with a 41.9 % drop in casualties .
The greatest reduction was seen in children under the age of 11 years and in the numbers of all ages killed or seriously injured .
Cyclist injuries fell by 17 % once 20 mph zones came in , and injuries in pedestrians have been cut by almost a third .
There was also no evidence of a higher rate of casualties in areas bordering the 20 mph zones , as in areas adjacent to 20 mph zones casualties fell by an average of 8 % .
Expansion Study leader Dr Chris Grundy , a lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said : " This evidence supports the rationale for 20 mph zones , not just in major cities in Britain , but also in similar metropolitan areas elsewhere .
" Indeed , even within London , there is a case for extending the currently limited provision of such zones to other high casualty roads . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
The drivers who disobeyed the 30 mph limit will still disobey the 20 mph limit Asim , Bradford
He estimated that 20 mph zones in London save 200 lives a year , but this could increase to 700 if plans to extend the zones were implemented .
A spokesman for the Department of Transport said the study backed their own research showing that 20 mph zones help to reduce accidents and casualties .
" Our road safety strategy consultation recommends that local authorities introduce , over time , 20 mph zones or limits into streets around schools , and which are primarily residential in nature , to protect pedestrians and cyclists .
" This will save lives and make people feel more secure in walking and cycling on those streets . "
Kevin Clinton , head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents , said : " This research confirms that one of the most effective ways of protecting vulnerable road users , especially children , is the introduction of 20 mph zones .
" It lends weight to calls for an expansion of 20 mph zones , which RoSPA strongly supports and which we hope will become a crucial part of the new road safety strategy for the next 10 years . "

Googled
The End of the World as We Know It
Ken Auletta
Penguin Press : 400 pp. , $ 27.95
” Google ” has become as common a word as any in the modern vocabulary .
We google phone numbers instead of picking up a phone book ; we google for dirt on potential dates and celebrities ; we google ourselves , to see what trace we ’ve left in the digital ether .
Google has become synonymous with user - friendly efficiency , via its search engine and its many free and easy - to - use offshoots .
But as used in the title of Ken Auletta ’s new book , “ Googled : The End of the World as We Know It , ” the word takes on a more aggressive edge .
“ Googled ” is the sound of old media being outfoxed , slamdunked , left for dead .
Auletta , a columnist for the New Yorker and author of numerous books , steps into a crowded field ; there have been at least six books about Google in the last four years .
And it is a tough moment to write a book such as this , because we ’re in the thick of things :
It is obvious , even to the staunchest naysayers , that the Internet has altered our way of life in fundamental ways .
Not at all clear , however , is what will emerge from this turmoil .
Publishers and bookstores , newspapers and magazines , movie and TV studios , ad agencies -- all are struggling to find a foothold in the future .
As Auletta points out , the sheer velocity of change sets this era apart from others : “ It took telephones seventy - one years to penetrate 50 percent of American homes , electricity fifty - two years , and TV three decades .
The internet reached more than 50 percent of Americans in a mere decade . ”
Google can’t take credit for the technological upheaval , but founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin certainly took advantage of the possibilities .
As Auletta frequently points out , this is a duo with a passion for disruption .
They met while doing PhD studies at Stanford and have since applied their ruthlessly rational mind - set to questioning some of the most basic elements of contemporary life .
Combine this attitude with the utopian spirit of the early Web days -- Auletta frames Brin and Page as the spawn of the free - code , anti- Microsoft generation , mentioning their trips to the techno - anarchic festival Burning Man -- and it ’s easy to see the roots of Google ’s drive to shake up the status quo .
Indeed , the whole Google story stands in opposition to any business - as - usual sensibility .
The company started in a California garage with an innovative idea for a new kind of search engine but did n’t figure out how to make money until 2001 , with the development of a radical new way of charging per click for small ads run next to search results .
As has so often been the case with Google ’s innovations , this would have major ramifications for a long - established industry .
Auletta illustrates that with an anecdote about Viacom Chief Executive Mel Karmazin ’s visit to Google .
The media mogul is aghast at Google ’s ability to precisely track the effectiveness of ads , replacing the intangible qualities of emotion , aura and psychology with metrics and thereby demystifying the traditional ad man ’s sales pitch .
Having transformed the online ad business , Google popularized cloud commuting ( offering free word processing , e-mail and calendar online -- great for Joe Consumer but a huge threat to software companies like Microsoft ) and establishing Google News ( aggregating stories from 25,000 online publications , much to the consternation of the news industry ) .
In his free time -- Google employees get to devote 20 % of their working hours to personal projects --
Page assembled a machine to digitize bound books .
“ We ’re going to scan all the books in the world , ” he proclaimed .
The scale of the ambition is staggering , like a science fiction geek ’s fantasy of a cosmic über - brain .
For Page , the idea is for Google to “ understand everything in the world and give it back to you . ”
Like so many utopians , the Google visionaries have ridden roughshod over assumptions about how the world works and the fair and proper way of doing things .
Intellectual property rights are merrily disregarded .
As Columbia University law professor Tim Wu told Auletta , “ If they had a copyright lawyer among their founders , they never would have started the company .
The basic business of a search engine is to copy everything .
. . .
From day one , Google went out and copied the whole Internet . ”
Putting other companies out of business by beating them at their own game is what capitalism is all about .
Goo- gle ’s founders , though , see themselves as do - gooders ; early on , they concocted a core motto , “ Do n’t be evil . ”
Still , as it ’s become more of a behemoth , Google has accumulated more and more “ frenemies , ” as Auletta incongruously puts it : Companies , as varied as old media and Microsoft , that fear or resent the online giant even as they find it necessary to cooperate .
Reading “ Googled , ” it ’s hard to know whom to root for .
Executives like Karmazin come across as quaint P.T. Barnum - style hucksters whining about having their toys and easy profit margins taken away .
But even though Auletta presents Google as the fearless young turk pulling the rug from under the bloated fat cats , Brin and Page come across as oddball cold fishes taking a geeky delight in dismantling existing structures because they think they can do it all better .
There are occasional hints that Auletta does n’t like them much either :
In the acknowledgments , he snipes , “ Google ’s founders and many of its executives share a zeal to digitize books , but do n’t have much interest in reading them , ” noting that Brin and Page initially thought that participating in his book “ would be an ‘ inefficient ’ use of their time . ”
Auletta suggests that the company runs into trouble because it is so wrapped up in the idea of itself as virtuous that it ca n’t understand others ’ concerns about privacy or monopoly issues .
There is , however , a strong idealistic component to Google :
It provides quality services to the consumer that do n’t cost a dime .
“ You ca n’t beat free ” is a constant refrain here .
And yet , for all that consumers love Google , workers -- especially those employed in the industries they ’ve outmoded -- could be forgiven for being wary .
“ Googled ” functions as a fine primer for anyone looking to get a grip on the company ’s history and its repercussions on the current media landscape .
The prose is workmanlike , and Auletta does n’t have a polemical take , let alone any prophesies .
Mostly he asks questions :
Will consumers happily give up their privacy for free services ?
Will we still be reading books in 20 years , or going to movie theaters ?
Can advertising work on social networks ?
Will the government intervene and rein in the Internet ?
He does n’t have answers but maybe no one does right now .
As Clay Shirky has eloquently noted , “ The old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in its place . ”
And when someone seeks reassurance that the good old media ways will continue , “ they are really demanding to be told that we are not living through a revolution . ”
Press is writer in New York who has worked in both old and new media .
TRENTON 
The battle over same - sex marriage in New Jersey headed toward a legislative showdown Monday night , when a bill that would allow such unions narrowly cleared a key legislative committee and was set for a vote by the full State Senate .
The 7 - to - 6 vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee  which came after years of efforts by gay rights advocates and a day of emotionally charged testimony by dozens of supporters and opponents of the bill  was the first time any legislative body in the state had ever approved a gay marriage bill .
The approval brought cheers from hundreds of supporters who crammed the State House committee room .
But the measure faces an uphill fight when it is put up for a vote on Thursday before the full Senate , where even supporters concede that they do not yet have the 21 votes needed to pass it .
If it does pass , it will go to the Assembly , where passage is considered more likely .
Speaking to jubilant supporters after the vote , Steven Goldstein , executive director of Garden State Equality , said that gay rights advocates had a lot of work to do in the next 72 hours , but said that momentum and history were on their side .
Consumers remember the sounds of numbers in prices and associate certain sounds with value , according to a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research .
Authors Keith S. Coulter ( Clark University ) and Robin A. Coulter ( University of Connecticut ) studied the ability of number - sounds to convey meaning and influence price perceptions .
Previous research has demonstrated that people associate certain vowel and consonant sounds with perceptions of physical size .
For example , front vowels ( like a long a , e , i ) and fricatives ( like the English f , z , and s ) have been shown to convey smallness , while back vowels ( sounds like the /u/ in goose or the sound in foot ) indicate largeness .
" Phonetic symbolism affects price perceptions because consumers typically process , encode , and retain numbers ( and hence prices ) in memory in multiple formats , " the authors write .
Consumers encode what a price looks like and sounds like along with a relative numeric value that the price represents ( such as , " It is inexpensive " ) .
" Thus , sounds associated with the auditory representation can impact the numeric value associated with the analog representation -- that is , small sounds can create the impression of big deals , " the authors write .
The authors found that number - sound effects were more likely to occur when a frame of reference ( a regular price ) was provided .
And sometimes , the sounds of numbers created false impressions of value .
For example , participants perceived a $ 10 item marked down to $ 7.66 to be a greater discount than a $ 10 item discounted to $ 7.22 .
" Number sounds impact price magnitude perceptions only when consumers mentally rehearse a sale price , as they might do when comparing items on a shopping trip , " the authors write .
" Further , mental rehearsal of the same sale prices characterized by small phonemes in one language and large phonemes in another language can yield differential effects . "

Read about Oregon ’s distracted driving laws and the costs of a violation .
Oregon ’s distracted driving law generally bans all text messaging and other mobile electronic device use while driving .
Here ’s an overview of what the law prohibits and the penalties you ’ll face for a violation .
What ’s Prohibited
An Oregon driver commits the offense of “ driving a motor vehicle while using a mobile electronic device ” by driving on a highway or premises open to the public while :
holding a mobile electronic device in a hand , or
using a mobile electronic device for any purpose .
In other words , you can get ticketed for talking on a cellphone , text messaging , or just holding your device .
Driving .
For purposes of the distracted driving law , “ driving ” means operating a motor vehicle on a highway or any other location open to the public .
And this definition is n’t limited to when the vehicle is actually in motion — it also includes momentary stops such as when a driver is waiting in traffic or at a traffic signal .
However , it ’s okay for a driver to use a mobile device after pulling over to a safe spot at the side of or off the road or parking in a designated space .
Mobile electronic devices .
The distracted driving law defines “ mobile electronic device ” as any electronic device that ’s not installed in the vehicle .
This definition includes devices like cellphones and tablets that are capable of text messaging , voice communication , entertainment , navigation , or accessing the Internet or email .
Exempted persons .
Oregon ’s distracted driving law contains a number of exemptions .
Two of the more common exemptions are for persons who :
just activate or deactivate a device or function of the device , or
are employed as a commercial or school bus driver and use a device within the scope of that employment .
Affirmative defenses .
Motorists who are caught using a mobile device can establish a defense by proving they were :
using a hands - free accessory ( and at least 18 years old )
using the device to communicate with emergency services personnel such as police or an ambulance
driving an emergency vehicle ( ambulance , firetrucks , and police cruisers included ) and using the device within the scope of that employment , or
using a medical device .
With all these defenses , it ’s the driver who has the burden of proof .
In other words , the driver must present evidence in court and convince the judge that the defense applies .
Enforcement and Penalties
Oregon ’s distracted driving statute is considered a “ primary ” law — meaning an officer who spots a violation can stop the driver without having another reason for doing so .
The consequences of a violation depend on the circumstances .
But generally , the possible penalties are :
First offense .
A first distracted driving violation is generally a class B traffic violation and carries a presumptive fine of $ 265 ( maximum fine of $ 1,000 ) .
However , a first violation that contributes to an accident is a class A traffic violation , which results in a $ 440 presumptive fine ( maximum fine of $ 2,000 ) .
A first distracted driving violation is generally a class B traffic violation and carries a presumptive fine of $ 265 ( maximum fine of $ 1,000 ) .
However , a first violation that contributes to an accident is a class A traffic violation , which results in a $ 440 presumptive fine ( maximum fine of $ 2,000 ) .
Second offense .
A second distracted driving violation within a ten - year period is a class A traffic violation and carries a $ 440 presumptive fine ( maximum fine of $ 2,000 ) .
.
A second distracted driving violation within a ten - year period is a class A traffic violation and carries a $ 440 presumptive fine ( maximum fine of $ 2,000 ) .
Third offense .
A third or subsequent distracted driving violation within is a ten - year period is a class B misdemeanor .
Convicted motorists face a fine of $ 2,000 to $ 2,500 and up to six months in jail .
For a first violation , a judge has the option of suspending the fine for 120 days and allowing the driver to complete a “ distracted driving avoidance course . ”
Once the driver provides proof of completion , the judge dismisses the fine .
The driver , however , must pay the cost of the course .
How it changed for the better
The quality of club football at the very top level can never have been higher , even if the standard is just starting to dip a little .
Considering the expense incurred in luring outstanding footballers from all over the world the owners were entitled to accept nothing less .
Arsene Wenger also showed what a cosmopolitan approach can achieve even with a comparatively restricted budget .
How it changed for the worse Stadiums and teams , by and large , have been upgraded , but the cost of attending is often excruciating for Premier League fans .
There is little diversity to the competition .
Only four clubs have won the Premier League so far and Blackburn will not be expecting to repeat their feat .
Decade 's top five
1 Barcelona Pep Guardiola 's side is not packed with goliaths , so it was a joy to see that sheer perfection of movement and passing technique could leave even Manchester United powerless to get to grips with them as Barcelona took the Champions League for a second time this decade in 2009 .
2 Spain Though there is an overlap in personnel and style with Barcelona , the Euro 2008 champions differed markedly and had to develop over the course of a tournament that culminated in a polished victory over Germany when they were without the injured David Villa .
3 Arsenal
It would have been uncanny to witness any side go through the League programme unbeaten , but Arsene Wenger 's line - up were all the more remarkable because the durability rested on style as much as steel in the 2003 - 04 campaign .
4 Manchester United
There could hardly have been a greater challenge to a manager but Sir Alex Ferguson , in his mid-sixties , regrouped to shape a side that quelled Chelsea and has now brought three titles in a row and the 2008 Champions League to Old Trafford .
5 Brazil
They are as capable of winning ugly as playing the beautiful game .
In 2002 , the side took the first World Cup to be held in Asia and adaptable Brazil will be favourites to regain the trophy when the tournament comes to Africa .
Match of the decade
It may have been the strangest match on a major occasion rather than the greatest , but the 2005 Champions League final was unique .
Milan generally looked superior , apart from the six - minute spell in which Liverpool scored three times to pull level .
Jerzy Dudek still had to pull off an astonishing double save from Andriy Shevchenko to help Liverpool to a shoot - out in which he settled the final by blocking the Ukrainian 's kick .
Most memorable moment
The spectacle of Zinedine Zidane contorting himself to meet an awkwardly dropping ball from Roberto Carlos and score the winner against Bayer Leverkusen with a supreme volley in the 2002 Champions League final .
2020 vision
It 's more of a wish than a prophecy , but it would be heartening if owners became more subdued after the global recession and tired of throwing away their fortunes .
Outcomes then would not seem quite so dependent on , as Wenger termed it , " financial doping . "

Obama Home Depot Speech " Insulation is Sexy Stuff " VIDEO
President Barack Obama met with labor , manufacturing and small business leaders today at an Alexandria , Virginia Home Depot retailer to discuss energy efficiency and job creation .
He pitched the notion that energy independence is a surefire way to produce jobs .
In his speech , Obama urged Congress to provide additional tax breaks for homeowners who make their homes more energy efficient .
He said , " The simple act of retrofitting homes and office buildings to make them more energy efficient -- installing new windows and doors , insulation , roofing , sealing leaks , modernizing heating and cooling equipment -- is one of the fastest , easiest and cheapest things we can do to put Americans back to work while saving families money and reducing harmful emissions . "
In our gallery photos below , the president poses near a display of energy efficient Andersen Windows .
The window manufacturer was named Home Depot 's Millwork Partner of the Year .
Obama remarked that it is cool to save money .
" I know the idea may not be glamorous .
Someone said insulation is not very sexy .
I disagree .
Here 's what 's sexy about it : saving money . "
He went on to say , " If you saw $ 20 bills just sort of floating through the window up into the atmosphere , you 'd try to figure out how you were going to keep that .
But that 's exactly what 's happening because of the lack of efficiency in our homes . "

ABSTRACT
Three IPCC climate models , recent NASA Aqua satellite data , and a simple 3 - layer climate model are used together to demonstrate that the IPCC climate models are far too sensitive , resulting in their prediction of too much global warming in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions .
The models ’ high sensitivity is probably the result of a confusion between forcing and feedback ( cause and effect ) when researchers have interpreted cloud and temperature variations in the real climate system .
( What follows is a brief summary of research we will be submitting to Journal of Climate in January 2009 for publication .
I challenge any climate researcher to come up with an alternative explanation for the evidence presented below …
I would love to hear it …my e-mail address is at the bottom of the page . )
1. INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND
Since computerized climate models are the main source of concern over manmade global warming , it is imperative that they be tested against real measurements of the climate system .
The amount of warming these models predict for the future in response to rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is anywhere from moderate to catastrophic .
Why is this ?
It is well known that most of that warming is NOT due to the direct warming effect of the CO2 by itself , which is relatively weak .
It is instead due to indirect effects ( positive feedbacks ) that amplify the small amount of direct warming from the CO2 .
The most important warmth - amplifying feedbacks in climate models are clouds and water vapor .
Cloud feedbacks are generally considered to be the most uncertain of feedbacks , although all twenty climate models tracked by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) now suggest cloud feedbacks are positive ( warmth - amplifying ) rather than negative ( warmth - reducing ) .
The only question in the minds of most modelers is just how strong those positive feedbacks really are in nature .
This article deals with how feedbacks are estimated from satellite observations of natural climate variability … and describes a critical error in interpretation which has been made in the process .
Since at this point you are probably dazed and confused about what a ‘ feedback ’ is , let ’s do a simple thought experiment .
Imagine you are out in space , observing the Earth , and feeling the radiant energy it gives off from sunlight reflected off of clouds and from the infrared ( heat ) radiation it emits in proportion to its temperature .
Now imagine that the Earth ’s surface and atmosphere suddenly warm by 1 deg .
C , everywhere .
In this case the Earth would immediately give off an extra 3.3
Watts per square meter of infrared energy ( just as a hot stovetop element gives off more infrared energy than a warm one ) .
This example represents the “ no feedback ” case … only the temperature has changed in the system , resulting in extra infrared energy being given off , at a rate of 3.3
Watts per square meter for every degree C of temperature increase .
But in the real world , any source of warming ( or cooling ) causes other changes in clouds , water vapor , etc. , to occur .
These can cause extra warming if they either increase the amount of absorbed sunlight ( e.g. fewer low clouds ) , or reduce the rate of infrared radiation to outer space ( e.g. more water vapor , our main greenhouse gas ) .
These warmth - amplifying changes are called positive feedbacks .
Alternatively , cloud and water vapor changes could decrease the amount of absorbed sunlight or increase the amount of emitted infrared energy , thus reducing the warming .
This is called negative feedback .
That number ( 3.3 ) thus represents the magic boundary between positive and negative feedback .
If satellites measure more than 3.3 Watts per square meter given off by the Earth per degree of global warming , that is evidence of negative feedback .
If the number is less than 3.3 , that is positive feedback .
If the number reached zero , that would correspond to a borderline unstable climate system .
The 20 climate models tracked by the IPCC have feedbacks ranging from about 0.9 to 1.9 ( all corresponding to positive feedback since they are less than 3.3 ) .
The central importance of feedbacks to the global warming issue can not be overstated .
How the radiant flows of energy in and out of the Earth system change with temperature is THE most critical piece of knowledge we need in order to predict whether manmade global warming will be benign — or catastrophic .
It is obvious that good estimates of feedbacks are needed from our observations of natural climate variability .
This would provide the most important test of climate models : do the models exhibit feedbacks consistent with those we observe in nature ?
Unfortunately , such testing of the models has been surprisingly difficult .
I am now convinced that the main difficulty in diagnosing feedbacks from observations of natural climate variability has been related to the issue of causation when observing cloud behavior .
The best way to introduce what I mean by this is with the following question :
When low cloud cover is observed to decrease with warming , is the cloud change the result of the warming , or is the warming the result of the cloud change ?
Some will claim that the direction of causation does not really matter , and that all we really need to know is the average relationship between temperature and clouds — but I will show that this is incorrect .
Decreasing low cloud cover caused by warming would be a positive feedback , since it would let more sunlight in .
But what if , say , a change in atmospheric circulation patterns caused the decrease in low cloud cover ?
In that case , warming would be the ‘ effect ’ , rather than the ’ cause ’ .
And as we shall see , this can give the illusion of positive feedback — even when negative feedback really exists .
For instance , if the Earth warms by 1 deg C and our satellites measure only 1 watt per square meter of extra radiant energy being given off , since that is less than the magic 3.3 value we might be tempted to say that strong positive feedback is the cause .
But this assumes the change in radiant energy is the RESULT of the warming .
As we will see , the same result can be obtained if the true feedback number is , say , 6 ( strong negative feedback ) , but most of the cloud change was actually the CAUSE of the warming .
The issue I am raising is not a new one , as there have been general concerns previously published about the diagnosis of feedbacks ( e.g. Stephens , 2005 ; Aires and Rossow , 2003 ) .
I am merely getting very specific about what has previously been a more general concern .
In the theoretical analysis by Forster and Gregory ( 2006 ) of the factors impacting feedback estimation , it was claimed that internal natural variability in clouds would not contaminate the estimation of feedbacks …or that it would , at most , only make feedback estimates from satellite measurements “ noisy ” , with a variety of diagnosed feedbacks clustering around the “ true ” feedback value .
But as we showed in Spencer and Braswell ( 2008 ) , something as simple as daily random variations in cloud cover will cause diagnosed feedbacks to not only be ‘ noisy ’ , but also to be biased in the direction of positive feedback .
Here I will show further evidence , from both climate models and satellite data , that this issue is so serious that it might well have caused climate modelers to mistakenly conclude that cloud feedbacks in the climate system are positive when in fact the evidence , when more critically examined , suggests they are negative .
There has also been a persistent concern in the climate research community that feedbacks diagnosed from relatively short satellite datasets , even if they were accurate , might not have anything to do with feedbacks involved in long - term global warming .
Here I will briefly address both of these issues .
Specifically , I will show that :
1 ) the IPCC climate models indicate that short - term and long - term feedbacks in those models are substantially the same , and 2 ) a simple climate model tuned to mimic recent NASA Aqua satellite observations of global radiative imbalance , sea surface temperatures ( SSTs ) , and tropospheric temperature ( Tair ) variations , suggests that short term feedbacks in the real climate system are strongly negative .
Taking ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) together , one must then consider the possibility that current climate models are too sensitive — possibly by a wide margin — and they are therefore forecasting too much global warming and associated climate change in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions .
2. FEEDBACKS IN THE IPCC CLIMATE MODELS
Feedbacks are not explicitly input into climate models .
They are instead the net result of all the different physical processes contained in the models … especially those related to clouds and water vapor .
Feedbacks are diagnosed from model output in much the same way as they are diagnosed from satellite measurements of the Earth : by comparing ( 1 ) global average temperature variations to ( 2 ) global average variations in the radiative balance of the Earth ( variations in the approximate balance between absorbed sunlight and emitted infrared radiation averaged over the whole Earth ) .
The following figure shows yearly - and globally - averaged near - surface ( 2 meter ) air temperature ( T2 m ) variations versus top - of - atmosphere longwave ( LW ) infrared radiative variations from three IPCC climate models .
The yearly averages are plotted every month from the first 60 years of ‘ transient ’ greenhouse gas experiments in which the radiative forcing from extra carbon dioxide is slowly increased over time .
Plotting yearly averages every month in Fig. 1 allows the time - evolution of the model runs to be visualized , which turns out to be a critical step in the physical interpretation of the models ’ behavior .
Fig .
1 . Sixty years of global average variations in near - surface air temperature versus top - of - atmosphere infrared radiative flux in three of the climate models tracked by the IPCC .
See text for details .
We are particularly interested in the linear striations which appear in Fig.
1 . I have previously documented these striations in satellite measurements , and argued that their slope corresponds to the strength of feedback in the climate system .
Unfortunately , two research papers containing evidence of this were both rejected for publication based upon poor reviews from a single reviewer – a rather unusual basis for total rejection by any science journal .
Well , once again the linear striations appear – but this time in the climate models themselves !
And their slopes do indeed correspond to the long term feedbacks ( dashed lines in Fig. 1 ) diagnosed by Forster and Taylor ( 2006 ) from these models ’ response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing .
In addition to the linear striations , we also see evidence of spiral patterns in Fig. 1 .
These spirals were seen , to a lesser or greater extent , in all 18 IPCC models we analyzed .
More examples of these spiral patterns are seen in Fig. 2 for the CNRM - CM3.0 model .
Fig .
2 . As in Fig. 1 , but for the emitted infrared longwave ( LW ) , reflected solar shortwave ( SW ) and total ( LW+SW ) radiative fluxes in the CNRM - CM3.0 model , for various data averaging time intervals .
Note how the raw monthly averages ( the panels on the left side of Fig. 2 ) produce just a ‘ cloud ’ of points on the graph .
Independent yearly averages also produce a cloud of points .
It is only when we plot overlapping averages — e.g. , yearly averages computed every month — that we see these linear and spiral patterns appear .
Next I will show that the linear striations and spiral patterns can only be explained by feedback and radiative forcing , respectively .
In the current ‘ forcing - feedback ’ paradigm of climate variability , those are the only two kinds of radiative variations possible – forcing and feedback ( or , loosely speaking , ’ cause and effect ’ ) — and they have distinctly different signatures in the data .
There are no other physical explanations for such patterns .
As shown by Spencer & Braswell ( 2008 ) radiative feedback can only be accurately diagnosed from satellite data when it is in response to non-radiative forcing of temperature change : primarily variations in evaporation and precipitation .
As shown in Fig. 3 ( on the right ) , a simple model whose temperature is forced with only non-radiative forcing ( panel a ) , produces a perfect feedback signal , with the temperature and radiative flux changes falling neatly along a line , the slope of which is the feedback I specified in the model run ( 2 Watts per sq. meter per degree ) .
But as increasing amounts of randomly varying radiative forcing is mixed in with the non-radiative forcing ( panels b and c ) , spiral patterns begin to appear , decorrelating the data and reducing the slope of a line fit to the data .
Finally , if the forcing is 100 % radiative ( panel d ) , then no ‘ feedback stripes ’ are evident — even though the same feedback ( 2 Watts per sq. meter per degree ) is occurring in all four panels .
In this case , the slope of a line fit to the data is zero .
And since a total feedback parameter of zero corresponds to a borderline unstable ( highly sensitive ) climate system , this represents a potentially serious problem when it comes to diagnosing feedbacks from satellite data .
The importance of this can not be overstated .
To the extent that natural cloud fluctuations are occurring — as evidenced by spiral patterns in the data — the diagnosis of feedbacks by fitting a line to the satellite data will result in a feedback value biased toward zero .
This can be mistakenly interpreted as positive feedback — even if strong negative feedback is operating .
I suppose you can call this a ‘ false positive ’ , as sometimes occurs in the medical diagnosis of disease .
3. FEEDBACKS IN SATELLITE MEASUREMENTS OF NATURAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY
Now let ’s examine what kinds of temperature - radiative flux relationships are seen in the NASA Aqua satellite data .
Plots of the total ( reflected solar plus emitted infrared ) radiative imbalance versus temperature variability are shown in Fig. 4 at various averaging intervals from five years of satellite measurements of global average SST variations ( left panels ) and tropospheric temperature variations ( right panels ) .
The radiative fluxes come from the CERES instrument , the SSTs from the AMSR - E instrument , and the tropospheric temperatures come from the AMSU - A instrument flying on the NOAA - 15 satellite .
Fig .
4 . Aqua satellite - measured total [ LW+SW ] radiative flux versus SST ( left panels ) and versus tropospheric temperature ( right panels ) at averaging times of : ( a , b ) 1 day ; ( c , d ) 31 days ; ( e , f ) 91 days ; and ( g , h ) 365 days .
( Note that the averaging times now vary vertically , while in Fig. 2 they varied horizontally ) .
The slopes of the striations seen in the right panels of Fig. 4 ( relative to atmospheric temperature ) correspond to strongly negative feedback : around 6 Watts per square meter per degree K of temperature change ( 6 W m - 2 K - 1 ) .
In fact , even though we expect feedbacks diagnosed from the data to be biased toward zero , here the lines fitted to all the data have slopes actually approaching that value : 6 W m-2 K - 1 . Translated into a global warming estimate , a feedback of 6 W m - 2 K - 1 would correspond to a rather trivial 0.6 deg .
C of warming in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 .
A couple of the SST plots on the upper left in Fig. 4 , however , have very different slopes … but as averaging times get longer , the line slopes also end up corresponding to negative feedback ( 3.7 W m - 2 K - 1 in Fig. 4g translates to about 1 deg .
C of warming for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 ) .
This very different response for SSTs versus tropospheric temperatures at short time scales is due to the episodic , non-radiative transfers of heat between the surface and atmosphere mentioned earlier ( see Spencer et al. , 2007 , for more evidence of these oscillations ) .
To demonstrate this physical interpretation , I modified the simple climate model of Spencer and Braswell ( 2008 ) to include an atmosphere , an ocean mixed layer , and a deeper ocean layer which slowly exchanges heat with the mixed layer .
( These modifications were added one by one , as necessary , to explain characteristics of the satellite data which could not be expalined without those modifications . )
The model was driven by radiative and non-radiative forcings that varied randomly in time , having a time scale of days to weeks .
The radiative forcing only directly affects the ocean mixed layer , as might be expected with variations in low cloud cover causing varying amounts of absorbed sunlight by the ocean .
In contrast , the non-radiative forcing affects both the mixed layer and the atmosphere , since enhanced evaporative cooling of the ocean surface must be matched by enhanced latent heating of the atmosphere by precipitation systems .
As a result , on short time scales , the ocean surface temperature and atmospheric temperaures will be negatively correlated .
The adjustable parameters in the model were then tuned to mimic the lag correlation and autocorrelation structures computed from the five years of daily satellite satellite measurements of tropospheric temperature , sea surface temperature , and radiative flux ( see Fig. 5 , below , if you are interested in this level of detail ) .
Fig .
5 . Lag-correlation and autocorrelations in the five year time series of daily satellite measurments in global oceanic SST , tropospheric temperature , and total ( solar +IR ) radiative flux .
After this tuning to mimic the satellite measurements , I obtained model behavior ( Fig. 6 ) that looks quite like the satellite data shown in Fig .
4 . ( If you have a fairly large computer display , you can bring this same web page up in another browser , and compare Figs. 4 and 6 side - by - side . )
Fig .
6 . Five years of variability output from a simple 3 - layer climate model tuned to mimic several statistical characteristics of the satellite observations ( see text for details )
The important lesson to take from this model simulation is that a strongly negative feedback ( 6 W m - 2 K - 1 ) had to be specified in the model in order to mimic the satellite data in Fig .
4 . Note that even though the specified feedback was 6 W m - 2 K - 1 , NONE of the lines in Fig. 6 have a slope that large .
What this means is that the line slopes diagnosed from the satellite data in Fig.
4 might actually be an UNDERESTIMATE of the true feedback occurring , which could be 7 W m - 2 K - 1 or more .
4. AND FINALLY , FROM NASA’S TERRA SATELLITE …
The data presented above from NASA ’s Aqua satellite covered the time period from August of 2002 through August of 2007 .
But NASA ’s Terra satellite also carried a CERES instrument for monitoring radiative fluxes , and those data extend back to March of 2000 .
This is of particular interest since global temperatures were just beginning a two year long warming trend at that time .
In Fig. 7 ( below ) I have plotted Terra CERES total radiative flux variations versus NOAA - 15 AMSU channel 5 tropospheric temperatures .
The data points are 91 - day averages plotted every day — just like the Aqua data plotted in Fig. 4g , but now extending back 2.5 years earlier .
What is noteworthy in this figure are the clearly displayed feedback stripes , which have an average slope of about 8 W m - 2 K - 1 .
Fig .
7 . Terra CERES total radiative flux versus NOAA - 15 AMSU tropospheric temperature variations over the global oceans from March 2000 through August 2007 .
Together , the CERES data from two separate satellites thus display evidence of what I have used a simple model to explain theoretically : strong negative feedback is observed to occur on shorter time scales in response to non-radiative forcing events ( evaporation / precipitation ) , which are superimposed upon a more slowly varying background of radiative imbalance , probably due to natural fluctuations in cloud cover changing the rate of solar heating of the ocean mixed layer .
5. CONCLUSIONS & DISCUSSION
What I have presented here is , as far as I know , the most detailed attempt to reconcile satellite observations of the climate system with the behavior of climate models in the context of feedbacks .
Instead of the currently popular practice of building immensely complex and expensive climate models and then making only simple comparisons to satellite data , I have done just the opposite : Examine the satellite data in great detail , and then build the simplest model that can explain the observed behavior of the climate system .
The resulting picture that emerges is of an IN - sensitive climate system , dominated by negative feedback .
And it appears that the reason why most climate models are instead VERY sensitive is due to the illusion of a sensitive climate system that can arise when one is not careful about the physical interpretation of how clouds operate in terms of cause and effect ( forcing and feedback ) .
Indeed , climate researchers seldom ( if ever ) dig into the archives of satellite data and ask the question , “ What are the satellite data telling us about the real climate system ? ”
Instead , most climate research money now is funneled into building expensive climate models which are then expected to provide a basis for formulating public policy .
Given the immense effort that has been invested , one would think that those models would be more rigorously tested .
There is nothing inherently wrong with a model - centric approach to climate research … as long as the modeler continues to use the observations to guide the model development over time .
Unfortunately , as Richard Lindzen at MIT has pointed out , the fact that modelers use the term “ model validation ” rather than “ model testing ” belies their inherent preference of theory over observations .
The allure of models is strong : they are clean , with well - defined equations and mathematical precision .
Observations of the real climate system are dirty , incomplete , and prone to measurement error .
The comparisons modelers make between their models and satellite data are typically rather crude and cursory .
They are not sufficiently detailed to really say anything of substance about feedbacks — in either the models or the satellite data – and yet it is the feedbacks that will determine how serious the manmade global warming problem will be .
And as I have tried to demonstrate here , the main reason for the current inadequacy of such methods of comparison between models and observations is the contaminating effect of clouds causing temperatures to change ( forcing ) when trying to estimate how temperatures cause clouds to change ( feedback ) .
This not a new issue , as it has been addressed by Forster and Gregory ( 2006 , applied to satellite measurements ) and Forster and Taylor ( 2006 , applied to climate model output ) .
I have merely demonstrated that the same contamination occurs from internal fluctuations in clouds in the climate system .
The bottom line from the model and observational evidence presented here is that :
Net feedbacks in the real climate system — on both short and long time scales — are probably negative .
A misinterpretation of cloud behavior has led climate modelers to build models in which cloud feedbacks are instead positive , which has led the models to predict too much global warming in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions .
What climate researcher Bob Cess said in a 1997 interview with Science magazine ’s Richard Kerr seems to be still true today :
“ … the [ models ] may be agreeing now simply because they ’re all tending to do the same thing wrong .
It ’s not clear to me that we have clouds right by any stretch of the imagination . ”
I challenge climate modelers to “ validate ” their models to the level of detail I have in my comparisons here between satellite observations ( Fig. 4 & 5 ) and a simple climate model ( Fig. 5 & 6 ) .
Once their climate models can behave in the same way as the satellite observations suggest the real climate system behaves on a year to year basis , then we can revisit how much global warming those models predict for the future .
Until that happens , I consider the IPCC climate model forecasts of strong global warming in the coming decades to be completely unreliable for basing policy decisions on .

- Proverbs 16 : 18 - 19 , the Bible
My Grandma Delphia used to quote that Bible verse .
I wonder if other folks heard the same from their grandmothers .
I am pretty sure some folks at the highest levels in our government either did n't trust or honor their grandmothers ' teachings or they just flat do n't think rules of common decency and our shared humanity apply .
Many of us knew in 2008 what the Republicans had in store for us in the area of healthcare reform , and we firmly and overwhelmingly rejected those plans .
Instead we took seriously the threat that a John McCain presidency meant taxation of our healthcare benefits and other healthcare horrors , and we overwhelmingly rejected those ideas .
We had great angst about the potential that anyone would look at the suffering embedded in the U.S. healthcare system and allow it to continue and even grow worse .
Our angst moved us in another direction at the polls .
We were promised by the Democrats that no one with an income under $ 250,000 per year would have any increase in taxes at all to cover healthcare reform , and we were also heartened to hear Barack Obama state firmly and without hesitation that healthcare is a basic human right .
Whew .
Finally , we had firm , clear promises that seemed grounded in progressive , fair - minded ideals and common sense along with the vision of our shared humanity .
Healthcare as a human right would not only be on the radar , we thought , but it would serve as the benchmark for any reform under such a leader as Barack Obama - and those elected officials who supported him .
We let down our angst a bit too much it seems .
For within a few short weeks of the start of the healthcare reform discussion , in March of 2009 , President Obama signaled he might consider a health benefits tax to pay for reform .
Our angst was tickled .
Many of us fought through the spring and summer to be heard .
Though the tea party craziness garnered much media attention , others fought as hard and as passionately with little impact .
The history of this healthcare reform struggle in 2009 and 2010 will be recorded by many with varied viewpoints and various degrees of accuracy .
No need to replay all of those torturous details here
And by the time we reached Christmas Eve 2009 , any reference to " healthcare reform " had been replaced by the more politically practical ( so some must have thought ) terms " health insurance reform , " and all reference to healthcare as a basic human right had long since been squelched .
By Christmas , the House had passed its version of reform and the Senate managed its own .
Gone were the visions of equal access to healthcare or equal treatment as patients .
Gone were the visions of a United States where healthcare was accepted as a human right and where policy reflected the granting and protection of that right .
And certainly gone were the promises made upon which so much reliance occurred .
I am sure this President and this Congress understand the legal concept of significant reliance .
Americans worked hard and voted in huge numbers because of what was " sold " to them from both sides of the political aisle .
That contract with voters has been breached .
We have some angst now .
We have a lot more angst than this President and this Congress want to acknowledge .
Hence the pride and the haughty spirits my grandmother might have noticed .
In an NPR story this week , White House aides and Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer summed it up : ( http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122366587)
White House aides believe a lot of the liberal angst about health care will go away once the president actually signs a bill .
And to the extent that the Democrats have a problem motivating their core voters , they 've got time to fix it .
" We 're not overly concerned about these things , first and foremost because there is n't an election tomorrow , not an election the next day , " says Dan Pfeiffer , White House communications director .
Our angst will not go away anytime soon .
When we see our paystubs and our tax returns reflect the collection of our hard - earned money for the huge bail - out of the for - profit , private insurance industry instead of for the guaranteed right to healthcare , we will feel angst .
When we are forced to purchase the defective financial product sold to us as health insurance or face penalties or even criminal charges , we will feel angst .
When we continue to have trouble affording truly comprehensive health coverage that provides a single standard of high quality care for all , we will feel angst .
When we cannot see a doctor without paying a big co-pay or deductible , when we bury a child whose treatment was denied by the insurance company , when we avoid seeking care because we cannot afford our medicines , when our employers cut our benefits to avoid paying the excise tax , when the insurance company CEOs continue to earn mega- salaries , obscene bonuses and retire with huge golden parachutes funded by our tax subsidies , when thousands of our neighbors and friends still go bankrupt because their coverage just was n't good enough to protect them - oh , we will feel angst .
I am sorry , Dan , this is an angst that is loaded down with intense human suffering .
It is n't just political or ethical or intellectual bantering angst .
It is very real human angst caused by those with prideful , haughty attitudes who cared little about promises made and the human right to healthcare so boldly proclaimed .
Oh , we will feel our angst .
And we will act upon it in due time by making sure that we elect those who do support creating a nation where healthcare is truly guaranteed for all .
Leading members of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) are expected to resign over the sacking of its chairman , leaving the service in disarray , one of its leading scientists has warned .
Dr Les King , a respected chemist and former head of the Drugs Intelligence Unit in the Forensic Science Service , said that anger over the " disgraceful " decision by the Home Secretary , Alan Johnson , to remove Professor David Nutt could lead to a meltdown in the 40 - year - old organisation .
He claimed that as many as six of its scientists will resign from the independent organisation , putting further pressure on the Government over its handling of the affair .
Dr King cautioned that the Government 's whole drugs programme could be at risk .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Fuelling the sense of anger in the scientific community over the sacking , Lord Drayson , the Science minister , expressed concern that he had not been informed of the decision .
Professor
Nutt said last night that his own children may have tried drugs .
" I 'm sure my children have tried drugs .
In fact , some have told me they have , " he told The Mail on Sunday .
The row has wider ramifications for the relationship between politicians and scientists , many of whom are concerned at Mr Johnson 's reaction to Professor Nutt 's comments .
Dr King said : " Academics , medics and others are going to ask themselves if they want to serve on these agencies without payment , on their own time and expense , when the advice that they produce is routinely ignored . "
To the anger of scientists , Mr Johnson accused Professor Nutt of " lobbying for a change in policy " .
Professor Nutt 's dismissal , a first for a chairman of the ACMD , came days after he expressed dismay at the Prime Minister 's insistence that cannabis remain a class B drug , and nine months after he said that there was little difference in the dangers of horse riding and taking ecstasy .
Dr King added : " What we say is objective and evidence - based .
Sometimes people do not want to hear that .
The Government has a statutory obligation to consult the council before it makes any changes to the classification of drugs – the Misuse of Drugs Act is clear about that .
If significant figures resign , it cannot function any more , and without a change to the Act of Parliament the Government cannot make any changes . "
Members of the council , which meets twice a year , are due to gather again on 10 November , when discussions will be dominated by Professor Nutt 's sacking .
But the resignations are likely to occur sooner , said Dr King .
Following the sacking , there are now 30 members of the council , fewer than half of whom are scientists .
The Home Office has refused to comment on the possibility of resignations , but Lord Drayson told followers of his Twitter account that he was " looking into " the sacking after hearing the news while in Japan .
The minister , who is likely to have to deal with the anger of scientists , later posted a message saying he would be " asking why I was n't informed " .
The shadow Home Secretary , Chris Grayling , has backed Professor Nutt 's sacking .
Chris Huhne , the Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokesman , said : " The sacking was utterly disgraceful and a serious mistake .
It has much wider implications , not just for the ACMD but for any independent scientific advisory service trying to give a sensible assessment of evidence to policy - makers .
It is absolutely essential that the Government takes impartial , scientific advice .
You cannot question David Nutt 's credentials ; if anyone knows the difference between facts and opinions , it is him . "
Rudi Fortson , a leading criminal barrister and author who specialises in drug cases , said : " If the scientists were to resign en masse a vacuum would be left and that would be a matter of some concern . "
In an open letter to Mr Johnson , Professor Peter Tyrer , the head of the Centre for Mental Health and editor of the British Journal of Psychiatry , said Professor Nutt 's scientific credentials were " impeccable " .
Richard Garside , the director of the Centre for Crime and Justice at King 's College London , accused Mr Johnson of undermining scientific research .
He said : " I 'm shocked and dismayed that [ he ] appears to believe that political calculation trumps honest and informed scientific opinion . "
Today , the yield curve hit a record .
At 380 basis points , which incidentally was the widest spread between the 2 Year and the 30 Year ever , it has never been easier for banks to make money on the short - long interest spread .
Indeed , there are some wacky things happening in bond land .
Recently , just like in the days after Lehman imploded , short - maturity bills traded at negative yields .
While that particular rush for short maturities was at the time explained by a desire for year end window dressing and cash parking , the continued exuberance in bills ( see chart below ) can no longer be explained that simply .
There are a variety of explanations as to this surge in steepness , as well as for a continued preference of the short end of the curve .
Some of these include the desire of foreign buyers to minimize duration , and as we have been pointing out over the past several months by deconstructing TIC data , the bulk of foreign purchasing has been in the Bill sector .
And while there is no shortage of Bill interest , the traditional 30 - Year buyers have shunned the long - end , and instead are opting for corporates for a better duration - risk profile .
This is further coupled with the global doctrine of moral hazard which has made corporate failure essentially a thing of the past .
With Bernanke onboarding private risk to the public balance sheet , the next big blow up will undoubtedly be sovereigns themselves .
This is , in fact , confirmed by a glance at the spread between the SovX and the ITRAXX MAIN ex-FINS : for the first time in history , it is riskier to be a sovereign that it is to be an IG credit ( green line on chart below ) .
So with the sweet spot in governments being exclusively Bills , it is natural to see further steepening , as more and more investors avoid the long end due to increasing sovereign and perceived inflation risk .
Yet there is nothing inherently wrong with steep curves .
The bogeyman in credit land has always been the flat ( or , heaven forbid inverted ) curve .
As CreditSights characterizies the flat curve situation :
A flat yield curve usually occurs when the market is making a transition that emits different but simultaneous indications of what interest rates will do .
In other words , there may be some signals that short - term interest rates will rise and other signals that long - term interest rates will fall .
Investors are uncertain and the margin for error is high .
Tails get fat .
Black Swans fly .
X - Factors propagate .
What are the benefits of steep curve ?
They are numerous for all investor classes : i ) a steep curve allows a wide margin for error , which incentivizes yield seeking lower in the capital structure , primarily equities ; ii ) banks can borrow cheap and lend expensive , which is a green light to " print money " , and iii ) a knee - jerk trading response to a steep curve is to buy equities , which creates a self - referential feedback loop , whereby steepness leads S&P higher , which increases asset prices , and hikes inflation expectations , which leads to an even steeper curve .
The relationship is mapped on the chart below :
Lastly , by pushing yields down , the Fed is naturally trying to encourage the " virtuous cycle " of encouraging consumption and corporate investment .
When inflation expectations are high and rates are low , companies and individuals are encourage to borrow as they should anticipate this debtload will be inflated in the future .
However , judging by the latest consumer credit report and exorbitant excess reserve levels , Bernanke 's plan has failed , as only Goldman et al can borrow at the short end .
In the current environment , in which economic reality is disjointed with the market , the steep curve is a source of concern .
As CreditSight notes :
A steep yield curve can be a good thing .
It should help the economic recovery and debt and equity markets .
One could even argue that the Fed has done its job .
ZIRP - American - style has both helped repair banks balance sheets and forced investors to take on riskier assets .
Steep yield curves are generally seen at the end of a recession , when the economy is about to kick into full - gear .
So why all the worry ?
Well here is the rub : the evidence for economic expansion or the elements that make up an upward sloping yield curve are just not there yet .
While it is a lagging indicator , credit creation has been scant .
A recent survey from the Federal Reserve showed that since peaking in July 2008 , consumer credit is down more than 4.8 percent .
Bank lending is also down more than 8 percent over the past 12 months .
Without a recovery in credit , there can be no self - sustaining economic recovery .
Also , it is interesting that we are seeing inflationary expectations when there is a complete lack of wage or producer price pressure .
Employment ( also a lagging indicator ) has been weak and consumption continues to decline ( though given its historic rise over the past decade , this could be a good thing ) .
None of this seems consistent with a steep yield curve .
One certain outcome of a steep curve is dollar debasement : one of the goal of the Fed all along .
And as Zero Hedge has been noting for almost half a year , the current FX dynamics are such that the dollar has supplanted the Yen to become the funding currency of choice ( much to the chagrin of the BOJ ) .
Logically , the question arises : how big is the carry trade ?
From CreditSights :
The carry trade notably reared its wild and wooly head during the late 90s , when Japan announced a Zero Interest Rate Policy ( sound familiar ) .
Traders sold short the yen and bought just about anything else they could find , because everything was higher yielding .
Indeed , if you were a mortgage trader , chances are you funded trades in yen .
If you traded emerging markets , you crossed in yen .
Baseball cards ?
Sell yen .
Before the last time the world blew up , way back in 2007 , the yen carry trade was estimated to be about $ 1 trillion ( but who knows for sure ) .
When the credit crisis hit , this trade was unwound , quickly .
The dollar was ( is ) still the world ’s reserve and money flocked to safety .
Dollars were needed .
The carry trade was killed and people lost big .
How do we tell there is a dollar carry trade ?
First off , Chairman Bernanke seemed to give the carry trade his blessing during his recent speech at the NY Economic Club , firmly saying that interest rates will not be raised in the short term .
This gives traders license to sell dollars , not fearing that the Fed will raise rates and they will be caught out short .
Second , correlation .
Everything seems to be correlated to everything ( and we know how well that ended in 2007 ) .
As the dollar weakens , investors look to harder or higher - yielding assets to contain some of the depreciation effects , causing asset classes to rise in tandem .
In a recent piece , we pointed out that the correlation between equities and debt had an R - squared of greater than 90 percent .
Dollar - equities , same thing , but inverse .
Indeed , this is the first time since 1938 that we have had zero interest rates , dollar depreciation and equity markets rising .
High yield continues to receive record inflows , despite coupons and current yield falling far short of extraordinary .
Gold is also at record highs .
Zero Hedge has previously discussed why due to a funding mismatch , the globalized economy was on the dollar shortfall hook for a number as large as $ 6.5 trillion , which in turn explained why the Fed has to rush to save all Central Banks by pumping hundreds of billions of FX liquidity lines .
And here comes the first estimate ever attempted at quantifying the Fed sponsored " Dollar Destructive " moral hazard : the upper bound of the total loss in the case of a major liquidity event occurring with the Fed 's complicit bailout on the table would amount to a staggering $ 6.5 trillion from a dollar duration funding mismatch alone !
This is an astounding , unfathomable and untenable number .
Yet it is likely the same now as it was at the onset of the Lehman crisis ... As the H.4.1 discloses weekly , the Fed 's liquidity swaps are now back to almost zero .
This means that foreign Central Banks believe they have the FX swap and dollar maturity situation under control .
They thought the same before Lehman blew up .
And they were wrong .
As the DXY continues tumbling ever lower to fresh 2009 lows , the trade de jour is once again the dollar funding one , although unlike before when the Yen was the carry currency of choice , this time it is the dollar itself , positioning banks for the double whammy of not just a dollar funding shock , but one coupled with a potential massive and historic short squeeze .
If and when an exogenous event occurs , not even $ 6.5 trillion in Fed swap lines will be sufficient to bail out the world economy .
We wrote this in October 2009 , before Roubini et al became dollar carry trade experts .
We would like to highlight that the last time around , the dollar funding risk did not include the incremental need to cover hundreds of billions if not trillions in dollar shorts .
The next time there is a risk flaring scenario , the cost to fund the dollar mismatch will be even greater due to additional rush to cover shorts .
The Minsky Moment
Today we pointed out that the VIX is at multi- year lows : complacency once again reigns supreme .
So if indeed the market is correct , and growth is back , the Fed presumably has the tools required to facilitate and unwind , whether it is rising rates or using reverse repos .
A return to Fed normalcy , however is not in the cards , as Bullard 's presentation earlier highlighted .
In fact , look for more Q.E. , and more ZIRP .
So what happens if the optimists are wrong .
A CreditSights readers makes the following observations :
I think what you are suggesting is a reversal of the high beta compression trade ; we have n’t really seen economic recovery , just return from the precipice , so the markets have probably gone too far too fast .
Of course the brutality of the unwind in the carry trade depends on what moves the Fed off its mark .
If it is inflation concerns , fixed income asset prices are dead and probably equities too , just on the discount factor .
If it is due to real signs of economic recovery , then the carry trade unwind is mitigated by dollars chasing the economic recovery story in credit and equities .
Third possibility is that the Fed intervenes on concerns about dollar weakness , but I really do n’t see that happening .
To which CreditSights responds :
To have a dampening effect on dollar depreciation , the Fed would have to raise interest rates early and dramatically .
Drawing from Chairman Bernanke ’s recent statements , high unemployment and worries about choking off the recovery too soon are of greater concern .
Also , a weak dollar solves a lot of problems for the US — of course , it creates problems for the rest of the world .
But , as long as the US ’s creditors are willing to accept dollar denominated debt , currency devaluation has to dual effect of monetizing the US ’s debt and helping rebalance the trade deficit .
But what happens if the world is no longer willing to accept Uncle Sam ’s IOU ?
Last I checked , the US had some pretty big deficits it needs to finance .
The last is precisely what keeps PIMCO 's Bill Gross at night , and is one of the main reasons why we believe the Fed has no option but to continue with Quantitative Easing ... No option but to perpetuate the status quo which will merely make the ultimate unwind truly unprecedented .
The confluence of all these risk factors implies that there are simply too many variables for the Fed to be able to sustain control over what is an inherenetly chaotic situation :
An overly steep yield curve , combined with run away dollar depreciation generally indicates that authorities have lost control .
There is a legitimate and real risk that the long - end could become “ unstable , ” as supply / inflation fears kick in .
While consumer leverage is declining , leverage in the financial world is on the rise .
And , it does feel like we have been here before : 2002 , 2007 — the so - called Minsky Moment years .
We have come full circle , only this time it took a mere two years .
As Justin Lahart so effectively summarized some years ago :
At its core , the Minsky view was straightforward :
When times are good , investors take on risk ; the longer times stay good , the more risk they take on , until they 've taken on too much .
Eventually , they reach a point where the cash generated by their assets no longer is sufficient to pay off the mountains of debt they took on to acquire them .
Losses on such speculative assets prompt lenders to call in their loans .
" This is likely to lead to a collapse of asset values , " Mr. Minsky wrote .
When investors are forced to sell even their less - speculative positions to make good on their loans , markets spiral lower and create a severe demand for cash .
At that point , the Minsky moment has arrived .
The Minsky moment is , once again , knocking on the door .

Some time ago I ’d done a post about acessing the MODIS near - real time satellite images using Python and the data public available at NASA MODIS , if you are interested in those images , take a look in the post here .
I ’ve created now a Python package called pyearthquake to automatic retrieve any MODIS subset image from the NASA Rapid Response System in a easy way , just by using the subset , satellite and resolution parameters .
The package has a module to get real - time USGS Earthquake data from the USGS website and automatically parse it for you , as well functions to retrieve shakemaps and other products from the USGS .
Retrieving , handling and ploting USGS data
Let ’s start talking about the public available catalogs with real - time Earthquake data from the USGS site ( they are in CSV formats , there are others in XML and KMZ formats if you ’re interested too , but I focused in the CSV format files to create the Python modules :
Note from USGS site : files are not inclusive ( the past day file does not include past hour events , for example ) .
M1 + Earthquakes ( past hour ) – M1 + PAST_HOUR
This is the worldwide catalog with earthquake data from the past hour ;
M1 + Earthquakes ( past day ) – M1 + PAST_DAY
This is the worldwide catalog with earthquake data from the past day ;
M1 + Earthquakes ( past 7 days ) – M1 + PAST_7DAY
This is the worldwide catalog with earthquake data from the past 7 days ;
To get and process data from these catalogs , you can use the pyearthquake package I created , let ’s install it first :
easy_install pyearthquake
This command will use the easy_install to automatic install the package from the PyPI respository , it will automatically resolve the requirements too , but if you face some problem , here is the explicit requirements : matplotlib >= 0.99.0 , numpy >= 1.3.0 , PIL >= 1.1.6 and basemap >= 0.99.4 .
The basemap package is map toolkit for matplotlib .
Let ’s now , for example , get the catalog for the past hour earthquake data , we can do it by using the Python interpreter prompt , like this :
>>> catalog = usgs.retrieve_catalog ( " M1+PAST_HOUR " ) >>> catalog < pyearthquake.usgs.USGSCatalog instance at 0x00BD0FD0 >
All catalogs available are : M1 + PAST_HOUR , M1+PAST_DAY and M1 + PAST_7DAY .
But if you type a wrong catalog name , it will show you the name of all available .
You can now work with the “ catalog ” object to explore the data retrieved from the USGS site :
>>> list ( catalog ) [ {' Src ' : ' ci ' , ' Region ' : ' Central California ' , ' Lon ' : '- 118.2063 ' , ' Datetime ' : ' Saturday , January 16 , 2010 17:12:20 UTC ' , ' Depth ' : ' 6.00 ' , ' Version ' : ' 1 ' , ' Lat ' : ' 36.2061 ' , ' Eqid ' : ' 10530221 ' , ' Magnitude ' : ' 1.9 ' , ' NST ' : ' 27'} , {' Src ' : ' ak ' , ' Region ' : ' Southern Alaska ' , ' Lon ' : '- 150.0829 ' , ' Datetime ' : ' Saturday , January 16 , 2010 16:47:05 UTC ' , ' Depth ' : ' 34.90 ' , ' Version ' : ' 1 ' , ' Lat ' : ' 61 . 4521 ' , ' Eqid ' : ' 10029267 ' , ' Magnitude ' : ' 2.3 ' , ' NST ' : ' 27'} ] >>> for row in catalog : ... print row [ " Magnitude " ] , row [ " Depth " ] , row [ " Datetime " ] , row [ " Depth " ] , row [ " Region " ] ... 1.9 6.00 Saturday , January 16 , 2010 17:12:20 UTC 6.00 Central California 2.3 34.90 Saturday , January 16 , 2010 16:47:05 UTC 34.90 Southern Alaska
As you can see , the “ catalog ” is an interable object where you can get all data from the earthquakes , like the Magnitude , Latitude , Longitude , Depth , Date , Region Name , etc …
Let ’s now get the past 7 days earthquake data :
>>> catalog = usgs.retrieve_catalog ( " M1+PAST_7DAY " ) >>> len( catalog ) 1142
In the past 7 days , there was 1.142 Magnitude 1 + earthquakes on earth , if we want to find the event for the last Haiti tragedy , we can filter the Magnitude of the catalog by 6.0 for example :
>>> magnitude6 = [ event for event in catalog if float ( event [ " Magnitude " ] ) >= 6.0 ] >>> len( magnitude6 ) 3 >>> for row in magnitude6 : ... print row [ " Eqid " ] , row [ " Magnitude " ] , row [ " Depth " ] , row [ " Datetime " ] , row [ " Depth " ] , row [ " Region " ] ...
2010 rla9 6.0 32.40 Thursday , January 14 , 2010 14:03:40 UTC 32.40 south of the Mariana Islands 2010rja6 7.0 13.00 Tuesday , January 12 , 2010 21:53:10 UTC 13.00 Haiti region 71338066 6.5 29.30 Sunday , January 10 , 2010 00:27:39 UTC 29.30 offshore Northern California
As we can see , the Earthquake ID “ 2010 r ja6 ” was the ID used by USGS to identify the 7.0 magnitude Haiti earthquake of the 12 January which has devastated the region and the unfortunate people of Haiti .
USGS also provides a Shakemaps , which are automatic computer generated maps with the potential damage in the region of the earthquake , to get it , let ’s use the pyearthquake package :
>>> haiti_eq = magnitude6 [ 1 ] >>> usgs.retrieve_shakemap( haiti_eq , " INSTUMENTAL_INTENSITY " )
The second argument of the function is the shakemap type , there are other products you can get from USGS too , like the Media Maps , Peak Ground Acceleration .
These maps are available in the package as : INSTRUMENTAL_INTENSITY , BARE , DECORATED , UNCERTAINTY and PEAK_GROUND_ACC .
The packas has functions to plot maps of the earthquakes ( using Matplotlib ) , see how to plot a map of the earthquakes from the past 7 days :
>>> usgs.plot_events(catalog )
<mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap object at 0x01E6BDB0 >
Now a zoom in the Haiti region :
The color of the points are relative to their magnitudes , I ’m using here the JET ( the yellow / red points are earthquakes with higher magnitudes ) color map from Matplotlib , see in this link to use more color maps .
Retrieving last images from MODIS Satellites and ploting earthquakes
Let ’s talk now about the “ modis ” module of the pyearthquake module .
This module can be used to get the most recent or archived images ( up to 250 m resolution ) from MODIS Aqua / Terra satellites .
First of all , you must know what subset you want to retrieve from MODIS website , the subsets are available here in NASA site .
To plot the Haiti region I ’ll use the subset named “ GreaterAntilles ” which covers the Haiti region .
To get the satellite images from today date , we can do like this :
>>> from pyearthquake import modis >>> import datetime >>> now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) >>> bmap = modis.get_modis_subset(now , ... " GreaterAntilles " , ... satellite_name= " terra " , ... resolution = " 250 m " )
This command will get the composite image of the subset “ GreaterAntilles ” taken today from the “ terra ” satellite with a resolution of 250 m ( in fact , this will take a while , since I ’m using a higher resolution here , the maximum is 250 m ) .
And here is the result :
And here is after a zoom into the Haiti region near of Port - au - Prince :
This is the interesting part about MODIS , this photo , is from TODAY .
Now , let ’s merge together the information about the earthquakes from the USGS data and the recent images from the Haiti :
import datetime from pyearthquake import usgs from pyearthquake import modis catalog = usgs.retrieve_catalog ( " M1+PAST_7DAY " ) now = datetime.datetime.now ( ) bmap = modis.get_modis_subset(now , " GreaterAntilles " , satellite_name= " terra " , resolution = " 250m " , show =False ) usgs.plot_events ( catalog , bmap )
And here is the result of the past 7 days earthquakes plot over the today MODIS image from satellite Terra :
That ’s all =) you can use the package to plot earthquakes over other regions of world too , just select another subset from the MODIS Rapid Response System site .

Cor , big gaming news : EA have announced Medal Of Hono( u ) r is to return next year , all up - to - date and modern .
What they ’ve done here , you see , is they ’ve taken a popular WW2 series and updated it to present what I ’m going to call “ modern warfare ” .
And frankly , good .
Because I liked the Medal of Honour games even if they were n’t quite the most cutting edge , and the splendid Medal of Honour : Airborne was lost in the noise of Call of Duty ’s reinvention .
You should buy it .
Although not at that price – cripes – that ’s what it cost new !
But to the new game .
So , what do we know so far ?
The game , named only Medal Of Honor , is planned to arrive some time in the next year , and to be set in the most contemporary of settings , Afghanistan .
Set to be jam - packed with war for the foreseeable future , Afghanistan is 2010 ’s Iraq .
It ’ll be interesting to see how the game handles this , whether with sensitivity or balls - out realism .
It ’s been in development for a while , the secret somewhat blown last month , and EA now explain that “ Tier 1 Operators from the US Special Operations Community ” have been consulting on the game since it was first conceived .
They are , I ’m reliably repeating , super - soldiers who work under the National Command Authority .
They ’re elite types , and so presumably get involved in the more interesting campaigns .
Quoth the press release :
“ Inspired by real events , Medal of Honor reveals the mission of today ’s most elite soldier – his will , his mindset and his uncompromising professionalism .
The Tier 1 Operator is the most disciplined , deliberate and prepared warrior on the battlefield .
He is a living , breathing , precision instrument of war . ”
The single player campaign is being handled by EA LA , while Battlefield developers DICE are taking care of the multiplayer .
Here ’s a bit more press release bumph from EA LA VP Sean Decker :
“ EA has always been an advocate for telling the soldiers ’ story .
The new Medal of Honor follows that tradition .
We felt it was important to tell the story of today ’s war and today ’s elite soldiers via today ’s most relevant medium – videogames .
We are so proud to bring together two powerhouse development teams to make this game a reality ; EA Los Angeles and EA DICE .
Medal of Honor promises to be an unforgettable entry in the modern shooter genre . ”
More details are to be revealed during Spike TV ’s 2009 Video Game Awards on Saturday , 12th December at 8 pm .
For American types , at least .
The official site is here .
And can we all just take a moment to properly appreciate that beard .

There is an erroneous statement by Tom Karl , Director of the National Data Climate Center [ NCDC ] with respect to the role of land use / land cover change on climate .
It is so easy to refute his claim , so I am puzzled why he wants to show this lack of knowledge .
The excellent news article where the erroneous information from Karl appeared is
In e-mails , science of warming is hot debate – Stolen files of ‘ Climate - gate ’ suggest some viewpoints on change are disregarded by David A. Fahrenthold and Juliet Eilperin Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday , December 5 , 2009 .
The relevant text with Tom Karl ’s quote [ which I have highlighted in bold font ] is
These include the familiar kind of climate skeptics , those who think that the climate is n’t changing or that it is n’t a crisis .
But they also include a handful of researchers who think climate change is happening , but — for various reasons — are skeptical that mainstream science fully understands the phenomenon .
“ To me , it ’s unambiguous . . . humans are altering the climate system , ” said Roger Pielke Sr. , a research scientist at the University of Colorado .
“ It ’s just that , it ’s much more than CO2 . ”
Pielke said his research shows that , in addition to carbon dioxide and other factors , Earth ’s warming [ R. Pielke Sr note : to be accurate this should read “ The climate ” ] is affected by how people alter the land .
When a forest becomes a farm , or a farm becomes a suburb , that changes the amount of heat and moisture coming off the ground , he said .
But Pielke said he has seen some papers rejected and has felt so marginalized that he quit a U.S. panel summing up climate change a few years ago .
One of the stolen e-mails seems to confirm the idea that he was being excluded :
In 2005 , Jones wrote to colleagues about some of Pielke ’s complaints , “ Maybe you ’ll be able to ignore them ? ”
“ These individuals , who are very sincere in their beliefs , have presumed that that gives them permission to exclude viewpoints that are different from their own , ” Pielke said .
Mainstream climate scientists say they have kept an open mind but have rejected papers that lack proper evidence .
In Pielke ’s case , “ the literature does n’t show ” his ideas about the importance of land use are correct , said Tom Karl , head of the NOAA ’s National Climatic Data Center . ”
This can easily be refuted in national and international assessments ; e.g .
National Research Council , 2005 : Radiative forcing of climate change : Expanding the concept and addressing uncertainties .
Committee on Radiative Forcing Effects on Climate Change , Climate Research Committee , Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate , Division on Earth and Life Studies , The National Academies Press , Washington , D.C. , 208 pp
where one excerpt reads
“ Several types of forcings — most notably aerosols , land - use and land - cover change , and modifications to biogeochemistry — impact the climate system in nonradiative ways , in particular by modifying the hydrological cycle and vegetation dynamics . …….
Other nonradiative forcings modify the biological components of the climate system by changing the fluxes of trace gases and heat between vegetation , soils , and the atmosphere and by modifying the amount and types of vegetation . ……
Nonradiative forcings have eventual radiative impacts , so one option would be to quantify these radiative impacts .
However , this approach may not convey appropriately the impacts of nonradiative forcings on societally relevant climate variables such as precipitation or ecosystem function . ”
Recent individual research papers also document that land use / land cover changes are important ; e.g .
Stone , B. Jr. , 2009 : Land Use as Climate Change Mitigation .
Environmental Science & Technology .( in press )
Fall , S. , D. Niyogi , A. Gluhovsky , R. A. Pielke Sr. , E. Kalnay , and G. Rochon , 2009 : Impacts of land use land cover on temperature trends over the continental United States : Assessment using the North American Regional Reanalysis .
Int. J. Climatol. , DOI : 10.1002/joc.1996 .
Mahmood , R. , R.A. Pielke Sr. , K.G. Hubbard , D. Niyogi , G. Bonan , P. Lawrence , B. Baker , R. McNider , C. McAlpine , A. Etter , S. Gameda , B. Qian , A. Carleton , A. Beltran - Przekurat , T. Chase , A.I. Quintanar , J.O. Adegoke , S. Vezhapparambu , G. Conner , S. Asefi , E. Sertel , D.R. Legates , Y. Wu , R. Hale , O.W. Frauenfeld , A. Watts , M. Shepherd , C. Mitra , V.G. Anantharaj , S. Fall , R. Lund , A. Nordfelt , P. Blanken , J. Du , H. - I. Chang , R. Leeper , U.S. Nair , S. Dobler , R. Deo , and J. Syktus , 2009 : Impacts of land use land cover change on climate and future research priorities .
Bull .
Amer. Meteor .
Soc. , in press .
We have also shown that land use / land cover change has not been properly assessed in Tom Karl ’s NCDC assessment of global average surface temperature changes [ nor in the CRU and GISS analyses ] ; e.g. see
Pielke Sr. , R.A. , C. Davey , D. Niyogi , S. Fall , J. Steinweg - Woods , K. Hubbard , X. Lin , M. Cai , Y.- K. Lim , H. Li , J. Nielsen - Gammon , K. Gallo , R. Hale , R. Mahmood , S. Foster , R.T. McNider , and P. Blanken , 2007 : Unresolved issues with the assessment of multi-decadal global land surface temperature trends .
J. Geophys .

This documented lack of competence by Tom Karl on his understanding of the role of landscape processes in the climate system , as illustrated by his casual dismissal of this issue in the news quote , further supports the theme expressed in the text in the title of the Washington Post news article that “ some viewpoints on change are disregarded ” .
The biased actions of Tom Karl in his leadership position , which I have already documented ( e.g. see ) is further illustrated by his interview for this news article .

Watch out though , she 'll get you in the showers ... Back of the net ;)
Orlando , FL A transgender teen applying for a job at a McDonalds in Orlando has lodged a formal complaint against the fast food chain claiming the restaurant violated Florida employment law by refusing to hire the plaintiff over gender issues .
A transgender teen applying for a job at a McDonalds in Orlando has lodged a formal complaint against the fast food chain claiming the restaurant violatedby refusing to hire the plaintiff over gender issues .
In July , Zikeria Bellamy filled out an online application for a position as a shift manager or crew leader at a nearby McDonalds , leaving the box indicating the applicant 's gender unchecked .
The gender question is listed as optional on the online form .
However , when interviewed in person , the manager on - staff insisted that Bellamy select a gender on the application .
When Bellamy selected male , the manager abruptly ended the interview .
A second attempt to contact managers resulted in a second rebuke and a profane voicemail in which the McDonalds manager referred to Bellamy with a homophobic slur .
The manager has since been fired .
The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund have taken up Bellamy 's defense , filing an official complaint with the State 's Commission on Human Relations that claims McDonalds has violated the Florida Civil Rights Act .
Under the act , employers are prohibited from discriminating against an applicant based on their race , ethnicity and gender .
Transgendered individuals have been covered by sex and disability provisions within the act in past instances .

Nietzsche was correct : for all of us , and us as a species , a gulf awaits which we must cross to get to the other side .
This gulf is a challenge to our own minds :
Do we accept reality as it is , or do we retreat into a human world where our judgments about it and emotions about it matter more than how it works ?
We moderns labor under schizophrenia because we cannot undertake this passage because it is socially unacceptable .
People like to hear that there are no consequences , that everything will be all right , that we ’re all the same inside and that love is all we need .
Reality suggests a paradox : that to love reality , we have to love it as it is , including its methods of death , conflict , defecation , natural selection , consequences and other ugly truths .
People do not like to hear that reality is exactly as it appears , and we cannot sweeten the bad parts .
Death sucks .
Defeat is horrible .
Not everyone can see the difference in quality between a cheeseburger and a filet mignon , or be aware when a dumb decision is made .
Because individuals can prefer to avoid reality , and can form groups based on that denial of reality , and their votes and consumer dollars give them power , we have created a schizoid reality where truth is optional — people shop for facts and knowledge like they do clothing or movies , looking for things to ( a ) make themselves look good and ( b ) comfort themselves about their relatively small role in the universe .
When people like me say that we do not like humanism , and that we fear the creation of an anthrocentric consensual social reality that denies the ultimate reality in that world out there , we are talking about this schizoid approach .
When we say you live in fantasy , we mean that you read 1984 and then the first time you see a cop on the street using force , you assume it ’s a Big Brother strategy .
You live in a simple , fragile world of yourself and what you know that you have decided about the world — without having applied the same exact inspection to yourself .
Thus you know only the world as it has affected you personally , and your judgments about it , but you know nothing of the world as it is or of yourself as you are .
Modern people consider themselves witty when they reply : “ What one person considers wisdom , another will not . ”
They do not consider that of these people , one is closer to correct , and that is the wisdom that predicts consequences from the world .
They will jauntily tell you that “ Correlation is not causation , ” not seeming to notice that correlation is just one of the points you ’re making , such as that there ’s a causal relationship and you can also see it in the correlation .
But they feel witty , superior and smart for having picked one ( 1 ) detail out of thousand , pretending it was the principle around which other points of fact are arrayed , and therefore by debunking it , they claim , they have smashed the whole organization of all facts against them .
Obviously this is crazy , but only to those with the congenital intelligence and mental clarity to see that .
When we say you invert logic , it means that war requires weapons , so you figure that if you remove the weapons , you can stop the war .
You cannot remove the implements , or pacify the bone of contention .
It must be decided and yes , that will be inconvenient .
When we see you create a human - centric world , this is what we mean .
Just like buying SUVs or taking drugs , this human - centric consensual social reality is an escape from reality itself — with far - off but bad consequences .
The first inkling of that consequence is the simple , observable fact that we have little agreement on any facet of reality .
Such as this week , when some climate - change scientists got in trouble for forging their climate data .
But , if you ’ll bear with me , because I am also tired of articles on this topic , you ’ll see that they are examples of a more widespread phenomenon :
The conspiracy behind the Anthropogenic Global Warming myth ( aka AGW ; aka ManBearPig ) has been suddenly , brutally and quite deliciously exposed after a hacker broke into the computers at the University of East Angliaâ€™s Climate Research Unit ( aka CRU ) and released 61 megabytes of confidential files onto the internet .
But perhaps the most damaging revelations â€ “ the scientific equivalent of the Telegraphâ€™s MPsâ€™ expenses scandal â€ “ are those concerning the way Warmist scientists may variously have manipulated or suppressed evidence in order to support their cause .
The Telegraph
What ’s interesting about this for me is not the particular research that forged , or that research was forged , but that people are surprised about it .
The climate - gate revelations have exposed an unprecedented coordinated attempt by academics to distort research for political ends .
Anyone interested in accurate science should be appalled at the manipulation of data “ to hide the decline [ in temperature ] ” and deletion of e-mail exchanges and data so as not to reveal information that would support global - warming skeptics .
These hacks are not just guilty of bad science .
In the United Kingdom , deleting e-mail messages to prevent their disclosure from a Freedom of Information Act request is a crime .
The story has gotten worse since the global - cooling cover - up was exposed through a treasure trove of leaked e-mails a week ago .
The Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) of the University of East Anglia has been incredibly influential in the global - warming debate .
The CRU claims the world ’s largest temperature data set , and its research and mathematical models form the basis of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s ( IPCC ) 2007 report .
Washington Times
In utilitarian societies , where what most people consider to be good for themselves is the rule of law , there are two vectors of control : institutions and economies .
Both reward producing results that people want to consume in exchange for money , and now that we ’ve got many different groups with enough people in them to be profitable , there are rewards for spinning facts to appear to confirm the opinions of those groups .
In other words , if you want to tell a truth , you need to find someone who wants to pay for it already .
Preferably before you find that truth .
Which means you ’re not going to look for it in unpopular places .
It may be the most effective method of censorship in history .
Instead of directly banning what you do n’t like , indirectly reward everything else and so make it even better than taboo , make it unprofitable .
Sure , there will be a network of diehards who labor in poverty insisting on truth , but they ’ll get treated like UFO researchers .
The remaining 98 % of society will ignore it and thanks to their superior numbers , outvote it not most but all times .
My daughter came home from school re cently with a spring in her step and a song on her lips .
With no foreshadowing — or time to call an exorcist — out came this chilling refrain : ” . . .
You can hear the warning — GLOBAL WARMING . . . ”
By the time her father and I removed our jaws from the floor , we had learned that : A ) All the kids had been coerced into singing this catchy ditty , which we called “ The Warming Song , ” at a concert for parents .
B ) Further song lyrics scolded selfish adults ( that would be us ) for polluting our planet and causing a warming scourge that would , in no short order , kill all the polar bears and threaten the birds and bees .
C )
There was no deprogramming session on the menu .
And no arguing allowed .
The international “ Climategate ” scandal is now moving into its third week .
And reaction from folks on the scientific and political left — or is that redundant ? — who treat global warming as a cult in which naysayers must be crushed has been depressing : NYP
The markets work in parallel with social trends to keep certain items on or off the menu that most people will see , and from which they ’ll pick what items they are willing to act on .
Like monkeys , we cluster in groups , and when there are too many of us we start forming little ingroups .
This is at a level smaller than race or nation or even locality ; it ’s people within a city deciding that fans of the other sports team are fags , declaring yourself a Chevy man or Ford man as far as pickup trucks are concerned , or even making it clear that the Macintosh you own is a superior computer and others should acknowledge that .
With social trends , it ’s the infamous bucket of crabs yet again : make yourself rise by pushing other people down , even if that means you ’ll just be higher up in a deathtrap .
If you want to appear higher than others , and by so doing have them react to you as if you were higher in social status , you can appear more benevolent , altruistic , generous or accepting than others .
This is called passive aggression : you ’re using a very public behavior , being nice , to cover up your private motivations which are exclusively self - serving .
The somewhat surprising answer at which some biologists have arrived is that babies are innately sociable and helpful to others .
Of course every animal must to some extent be selfish to survive .
But the biologists also see in humans a natural willingness to help .
When infants 18 months old see an unrelated adult whose hands are full and who needs assistance opening a door or picking up a dropped clothespin , they will immediately help , Michael Tomasello writes in â€ œ
Why We Cooperate , â€ a book published in October .
As children grow older , they become more selective in their helpfulness .
Starting around age 3 , they will share more generously with a child who was previously nice to them .
Another behavior that emerges at the same age is a sense of social norms .
â€ œMost social norms are about being nice to other people , â€  Dr. Tomasello said in an interview , â€ œso children learn social norms because they want to be part of the group.â€ 
NYT
Herein lies the fundamental problem of human societies : we are torn between knowing what is right or realistic , and knowing what the group wants to hear .
Like the climate change scientists , we often opt for a pragmatic route and change things up a bit so the message we offer — a message that others act on and take as reality — is one that they will accept .
We win in the status game , at the expense of truth .
At this point , people are using social norms to protect their devious behaviors .
The animal kingdom offers us a parallel vision :
So , what happens when you place 80 [ rats ] in relatively small cage ?
Calhoun made sure that they had enough water , food and shelter necessary to survive but the rest would be up to the rats .
Soon enough , the animals descended into what Calhoun described as a “ behavioral sink . ”
This term is used to explain the behavior of animals that gather or are forced to live in a space too small to accommodate them .
The rats at first developed a sense of order , but that soon went â€˜haywire . ’
At the ends of the cage an alpha male took over and kicked the other males out .
According to Wolfe , the alpha males would take eight to ten females as concubines .
This meant that from 58 to 62 Norway rats would be forced to live in the middle two compartments .
Chaos resulted as no sense of order or balance could come from that many rats being trapped so close together .
The male rats fought constantly and began to ignore mating rituals and force themselves on female rats .
They also began to perform bisexual and homosexual acts .
Some rats would n’t even move in the daytime and would wait for the other rats to go to sleep before they would walk around .
No rat was safe from molestation and any attempts to leave the confines of the middle compartments by male rats were checked by the alpha male at either end of the cage .
They were trapped in chaos .
Psychology Today
Like many things in life , we are our own worst enemy .
When we take over from nature , we define success through socialization — mainly because people react to social status and give us what we need .
That in turn creates a false little world , a consensual reality where people agree to think the same things so they feel comfortable , and in doing so , deny reality .
They become slaves to the positive .
It is always sociable to claim the equality of all people , but never sociable to mention how radically untrue that is .
Similarly , it ’s always sociable to want to avoid difficulties and hardships like war , famine , disease , suffering and death , but never sociable to insist they exist for a reason .
It ’s also extremely unsociable to point out to someone that the consequences of their actions will be bad , albeit in a longer - term time frame .
We have created a nightmare out of our greater fear and desire to fit in than to be honest , forthright , and truthful .
The result has engendered a crowd among our society that runs around telling people sociable things , which have negative consequences :
Comment Consequence
“ It ’s not your fault ” Someone else must be to blame ; let ’s kill them .
“ It ’s a misfortune . ”
Your actions were n’t illogical ; life just screwed you , and now you can resent life itself .
“ War is terrible , I wish you and I did n’t have the threat of having to fight over our heads ”
We ’ll back down from every conflict , which will allow maniacs , parasites and predators to rule our world .
“ You do n’t look fat . ”
Feel free to go into denial about how much you ’re eating .
“ People should be more accepting of our individual tendencies , and things they think are perverse or weird should be tolerated . ”
If you make weird the norm , soon people will compete on weird to stay weird , since because weird is the norm , being normally weird is no longer weird .
Get ready for people with an erotic attraction to underage elephant dung painted silver .
Your average human is hopelessly self - obsessed , so is group obsessed , because that ’s where you get estimation for your self in the short term , instead of working toward long - term real - world rewards .
That ’s why we say it ’s a surrogate reality .
It feeds on itself and causes itself , because once self - pity convinces you to hate the world , you start feeling OK about stealing from it to make yourself feel better , because you ’re here and it must be treating you unfairly .
This resentment of life , based in damaged self - esteem , creates a binary state by which we judge all parts of reality : do I accept this or not ?
Is it offensive or is it pleasing ?
Like shoppers , we pick and choose which “ truths ” we desire .
And by doing so , we lay the seeds of greater problems :
The United States is about to lose a key arms - control tool from the closing days of the Cold War — the right to station American observers in Russia to count the long - range missiles leaving its assembly line .
Republicans are worried by the previously undisclosed agreement between the Obama administration and the Kremlin in October , which formalizes the inspectors ’ departure this Saturday .
This , they warn , would cripple Washington ’s ability to police Moscow ’s compliance with agreed reductions in its nuclear arsenal .
Washington Times
While no one likes the thought of getting nuked , the fact of technology is that it spreads .
That means that soon many nations will have the bomb ; do we trust them not to use it just because they ’re nice people , think we ’re nice people , and therefore they would n’t want to ?
Not on your life .
Nice has nothing to do with reality .
Reality is that everyone wants to be the person on top , and are willing to use whatever justification is required — we want autonomy , we ’re not represented , you raped our goats — to compel themselves to use whatever forces they have at their disposal to conquer , rape , pillage , destroy and advance themselves to the top .
The thinking goes that if we hate war , we can get rid of our weapons and it will go away .
The reality is that if you hate war , you will need to be vigilant about smashing problems before they get too big .
The grouchy and therefore less gullible might also be less inclined to buy into the booming self - help industry , which Barbara Ehrenreich takes down in her new book â€ œBright - sided : How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America.â€ 
In her examination of the positive - psychology industry , which she dates back to Norman Vincent Pealeâ€™s 1952 book â€ œThe Power of Positive Thinking , â€ Ehrenreich finds that it bears an alarming resemblance to brainwashing .
â€ œWe have seen the enemy , â€  she writes , â€ œand it is ourselves , or at least our thoughts .
Fortunately , though , thoughts can be monitored and corrected until .
Â¤. Â¤. positive thoughts become â€˜automaticâ€™ and the individual becomes â€˜fully conditioned .
â€ ™Â¤â€ NYP
We like to pretend we are positive people by limiting our focus to the positive , and the socially acceptable , but really by eliminating our ability to pay attention to the negative and to deal with it , we ’ve made ourselves into a zombie state of denial maniacs .
We cannot discuss unpleasant issues — we must think positive instead .
We cannot publicly take into account death , defecation or sadness — think positive !
Really , who needs to think positive so much , except someone who is by default inclined toward the negative ?
And why are we inclined to the negative :
Turns out that I did n’t find any good reason to keep Facebook .
Who cares where I live ?
Which are my favorite movies ?
Which of my friends partied with me last weekend ?
I recalled a term I read on Internet some time ago …
It was about the Ego - Web .
It happens that Web 2.0 is not about fancy Ajax animations , beautiful gradients , and fancy graphics bouncing here & there …
Is about user generated content …
But not any kind of content …
It ’s content that people writes hoping everybody sees and approve of it …
Maybe it ’s the illusion of sharing knowledge .
Maybe reddit , digg or hacker news are the new place where humans share philosophical ideas , something like the ancient greek square , where Plato and big philosophers spread out their ideas , listen to new ones , and if everybody knows about them , and judge them , we will end with a better world , with more informed people , with more objective points of view .
After all , as Churchill once said : “ The biggest argument against democracy is a five minute discussion with the average voter . ” ,
But what really happens is quite disappointing :
The internet has evolved in a Meme- culture , where people use words like “ FAIL ” as full sentences , and eloquent , smart comments are becoming obsolete .
It ’s all about to make the right joke at the right time …
And it get worst , not only people lose interest in sharing ideas and Thoughts :
Now people just want to twit trivial and non-interesting things .
Sebastian Avina
Remember up above , how I said that climate change scientists publish false results because there are rewards for doing so , and no rewards for doing the right thing ?
Our society has become so competitive that we ’re waging a war of memes , but these are n’t memes about reality .
Rather , we ’re fighting for the best distraction — and that means we end up using our own personalities as ammo , which in turn corrupts ourselves by externalizing our vision of ourselves .
“ Am I a good person ?
I do n’t know , I ’d have to ask someone , or run an opinion poll , or take a vote on it . ”
That leads us to a sickening state where we pay attention to how things appear , but never how they are , which defeats our actual aims by replacing them with a never - ending struggle for social supremacy :
His own example of absurdity ( it occurred in his home department ) is a faculty appointment that was derailed when it was discovered that the candidate , then teaching in New Zealand , had written a letter to a newspaper criticizing the practice of going barefoot in public places on the grounds that it promoted the spread of disease .
A department member decided that the letter â€ œwas an attack on the Maori people and thus racist , â€  and even when it was determined that it is not the Maori , but â€ œwhite hippies , who go barefoot in New Zealand , the majority voted against pursuing the candidate in order , says Nelson , to prove â€œthemselves to colleagues of color.â€ 
NYT
We are schizoid and it fails us every day , but we only see those failings once every few months or years , so it ’s easy to blow off .
Not to mention that since our society is neurotic , there are many problems , and we ’re busy working around those !
Any fixes we attempt would be unsociable because they ’d involve telling people that some things are their fault , we ’re not all equal , not everything will be OK , and that if you do stupid things you get a stupid result — and most people do stupid things in most cases because they ’re out of their league .
History tells us that our ancestors exterminated Neanderthals because they were a previous evolutionary branch , and one that was then obsolete .
That took place over thousands of years .
If we survive our technology , any future group of smart people that emerges will most likely enact world genocide on all those below , say , 120 IQ points who also lack the genes for collaborative behavior and paying attention to both logic and reality .
Three thousand years from now , the morality of our time will seem like a childish conceit , a self - mockery made of an infant stamping its food and not eating its broccoli , a mere phantasm of the monkey mind within the human .

The US Coast Guard has released their best videos from 2009 , and this crewman emergency medical rescue mission — using a MH - 60 Jayhawk helicopter over a moving nuclear US Navy submarine — just blew me away .
Check them out in the gallery .

The Coast Guard evacuated the crewman from a unnamed US Navy Los Angeles - class nuclear attack submarine .
The submarine was cruising through an undisclosed location off the the coast of Washington , on September 29 , 2009 .
They called the Coast Guard at 5:50 PM , and the Jayhawk helicopter intercepted the submarine at 7:12 PM , picking up the crewman , and moving him to the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland , Oregon .
Lots of the snow is washed away but long ago we planned to go up to Fløi Mountain and sledge down .
We ended up taking the funicular two times , it was a blast .
Heres on our way up , the windows were a bit dewy :
I ’ve created a stitch of the view up there , always a great view :
Heres a few seconds video of the view . 🙂
I tried to film some on the way down but it was n’t easy . 🙂
If you want you can slide the whole way down , I think might be done in 10 minutes .
Famed PSone RPG Vagrant Story 's going to be re-released on PSN this Tuesday , 22nd December .
The game 's a snip at  5.99 and is playable on both PSP and PS3
Vagrant Story 's a past - master and simply a must - have for fans of the genre .
Vagrant Story 's an iconic solo romp through dungeons ; a mix of crafting , rhythmic action , puzzles and strategy .
Snap it up .
I do n’t want to wait !
I kind of want to enjoy it now , not in a year .
Ahhh … delayed gratification .
No one wants to wait for an iPod .
But you know what , unless it ’s a fridge or something really essential to your daily life and habits .. it can wait .
Even if it ’s a BBQ , and it ’s in the middle of summer , with the steaks sizzling all around you .
If you ca n’t afford to pay for it in cash and still make all of your bills , then do n’t buy it .
Hey , at least I did n’t buy the $ 150 version .
Buying the $ 50 one is like saving $ 100 !
SPAVING , even .
( FYI : Spaving = Spending + Saving or Spending to Save ) I l-o - v-e -d using this justification when I shopped blindly .
It was such f*cked up math and logic , but it worked in my head to let me justify a bad purchase .
Nothing is saved until you put the money in the bank and leave it .
I deserve a treat , it ’s a reward for such a long , hard day at work
You had a bad hair day , someone yelled at you , and you need a pick - me - up .
So you head to the stores and SPEND .
Retail Therapy right ?
Trust me , I know what kind of high it is .
It feels awesome to get the purchase , you feel like a lion who has just scored a big juicy zebra .
But that high does n’t last .
It ’s fleeting .
And afterwards , you kind of feel sick , looking at your unnecessary , probably UNWANTED purchases .
Who really needs another black top in their wardrobe ?
Sure , financial security is n’t as sexy as buying a flashy pair of red patent leather heels .
But without the security , you feel unstable .
Being financially secure and of having solid savings banked to help you weather through tough storms , is a feeling of security , not sexiness , that will last and help you sleep better at night .
Think of it as an investment in sleeping better and de-stressing .
You only live once
We ’re young !
Live once in your life .
Spend .
Money will always come and go .
But when you ’re old , whatever shall you do ?
Eat out of cat food cans ?
Beg for money ?
Wish you had done things differently ?
Regret always leaves a bitter taste in your mouth .
It ’s an investment
The Most Stupid Products of the Decade
THE MOST STUPID AND BIZARRE PRODUCTS OF THE DECADE
The 2000s were a decade of great innovation .
These products were n’t part of it .
Remembering Crocs , the Segway , and other comical wares that will keep us laughing for years to come .
We listed products randomly from 1 to 15 .
1. Windows Vista
It ’s never good to have the phrase “ New Coke ” thrown around after a product launches , but that was the label that stuck to Windows Vista .
Five years in the making , Vista consumers complained about speed , bugs , hardware incompatibility , even a poor selection of built - in games .
Microsoft claims sales were fine and Vista lived up to expectations , but they sure got Windows 7 out quickly .
As the kids say , FAIL .
Some good did come out of the debacle , though .
Vista provided more fodder for John Hodgman as the delightful “ PC ” in the long - running Mac ads that poke fun of Vista .
2. Absurd Burgers
Burgers served between two donuts , burgers topped with foie gras that cost $ 175 dollars , burgers topped with mozzarella sticks , and Hardees ’ hideous 1,320 - calorie 860 - grams - of - fat Monster Thickburger .
Enough .
America ’s greatest contribution to food should be made the In - N - Out way .
Cheap , unadorned , reasonably sized , and not designed to give the eater an instantaneous coronary .
3. Crocs
See what “ Casual Fridays ” hath wrought ?
People who have no problem wearing a glorified sponge o n their feet to the theater .
We hate to see any American company fall on times , but … what ’s the adage about not having anything nice to say about hideous footwear ?
4. Segway
On December 3 2001 , the Segway Personal Transporter and the urban “ revolution ” was underway .
Do you remember where you were when the world , ummm , changed ?
Mall cops , rejoice .
5 . The UroClub
The portable , golf - club - shaped urinal is the “ discrete sanitary way for your urgent relief , ” according to its website .
Right .
That ’s much less problematic than say , going behind some trees — considering you ’re on a golf course .
There is , however , a great Tiger Woods joke in here somewhere .
6. Big Mouth Billy Bass
In a way , the once - popular animatronic musical toy fulfilled its destiny as a gag gift .
It became a minor pop culture sensation and even starred in an episode of The Sopranos .
In many more ways , though , it ’s an insipid rubber singing fish destined for landfills , rummage sales , trivia nights , and of course , its comeback on VH1 ’s inevitable I Love the 2000s .
7. The Tiddy Bear
Even if there were an honest - to - goodness national pandemic of women who “ could hardly breathe ” due to the patriarchal torture device known as the seat belt shoulder harness , we still would n’t encourage anyone to buy a “ Tiddy Bear . ”
The nomenclature is cheesy , and the stuffed animal packaging is downright creepy .
8. Comfort Wipe and Bodysnake
The Comfort Wipe is an anatomically designed toilet paper extender for the germaphobe in your life ( The first technological advance since the 1880s ! ) , while the BodySnake is for folks too rotund to wash their backs .
The only thing dumb about these products is that nobody has combined them into the ComfortSnake .
Get us product development !
9. Nail Mat
In 2009 , nail beds became a hit in Sweden , even though there seems to be no scientific evidence of actual healing powers .
Do n’t let that stop you , though .
As a 46 - year - old yoga instructor told The New York Times , “ It ’s quite painful initially . ”
Suck on that , Sealy Posturepedic !
10 . Weather Modification Office
If it sounds like something straight out of Communist China ( not too mention a Legion of Doom board meeting ) , it ’s because it is .
The technology to control the weather has been in development since the days of Mao , but in the 2000s , Chinese efforts were stepped up .
The office spent more than $ 100 million a year on efforts to make it rain , or in the case of the Beijing Olympics , to keep it dry via airplanes and rocket launchers .
Just last month , thanks to cloud seeding , snow fell in Beijing to combat drought .
The mad scientists are winning , and this just is n’t right .
11 . Pets.com
We almost feel bad for the now - infamous sock puppy , as he ’s become the poster pooch for the ridiculously profligate dot - com era .
Then we were reminded that the company burned through a reported $ 300 million dollars in two years of operation .
They could afford a Super Bowl ad , but not someone whose primary job was to ask questions like , “ Will people really pay a $ 20 shipping fee for sleeves of cat food ? ”
12 . 3 - 1 - 1 Liquids
Someone please explain to us how slowing up the security line — by having some poor woman dig through her suitcase to throw away a tube of half - used toothpaste — will prevent another 9/11 ?
All we ’ve been able to understand is that it will cost us $ 4.95 for bottled water on the other side .
13 . Bluetooth Headset
Fans of the device would say it frees up hands for safer driving and easier mobility .
We say the gizmo ’s best feature is that it ’s a foolproof jackass locator .
14 . CueCat
Remember the CueCat ?
No , we do n’t either .
But in the early days of the decade , the CueCat was going to allow us all the thrill of opening a URL link by scanning a barcode in a magazine ad .
Naturally , it was shaped like a feline .
Years later , a liquidator was reportedly offering two million CueCats at 30 cents apiece , minimum 500,000 .
Act now !
15 . Boyfriend Arm Pillow
Why do we get the sad feeling Jennifer Aniston owns one of these things ?
Oh Rachel Green , will you ever find true love ?

Washington DC — Israeli government is to significantly enlarge the settlement in the West Bank to include New Jersey , a Pro-settlement group Israeli right - wing organization said on Tuesday .
The plan , formulated by Israeli Construction and Housing Ministry officials , is to take over New Jersey and push out all of its residents to neighboring states like Pennsylvania .
Tents and refugee camps are already set up in Philadelphia preparing for the influx of refugees from New Jersey .
New Jersey residents were outraged but they were quickly dismissed as crazy terrorist freaks who were too selfish and did n’t want to share their homes with Jewish immigrants from Argentina .
According to the report , at least 15,000 housing units have already been approved .
The Capitol Hill is already occupied and is not providing sufficient room for German Jewish immigrants .
The plan has gained support from Benjamin Netanyahu of the Likud party who promised that a Likud government would not build new settlements in Gaza , but would allow take over in the US .
“ It is in our holy book , ” said Netanyahu , “ it said that God opened the sea , that could have been the Atlantic Ocean so that we could take over America . ”
The settlement expansion will include a war in New Egypt area , and some military invasions in Lebanon State Forest .
The Jews in Berlin- New Jersey – are already preparing to leave their rentals and land free homes in southern parts of Lebanon State Forest .
Anyone objecting to this plan will be rounded up in Moores Mill with no food or water , and they would wish they were in Gaza .
Fort DIX Military Reservation is to provide all the accurate military support to bomb schools , hospitals , and kill children by mistake ; and the Obama administration is expected to bend over for Israel like all of its predecessors .

PARIS —
The writer David Halberstam , author of a cruel analysis of the people who gave America the Vietnam War , The Best and the Brightest , observed that " no matter how small the initial step , a policy has a life and a thrust of its own , it is an organic thing .
More , its thrust and its drive may not be in any way akin to the desires of the president who initiated it . "
He had a hard time making his Vietnam - era interlocutors agree , as part of being one of the military and civilian best and brightest is that you did n’t need advice from journalists .
It is another characteristic of official life that you are discouraged from applying lessons from experience and history ( in the military case , before that experience has been incorporated into field manuals and regulations placed in front of you ) .
This rumination is motivated by the scarcely believable news that the people who are running the war in Afghanistan are contemplating an air attack on a Pakistan city in order to kill one of the most important figures in Pakistan ’s own foreign and security policy .
Pakistan , as most sensible people know , is in the grip of forces that could tear the country apart if that happened — which would make it the third nation , after Iraq and Afghanistan , to be devastated by the United States since that fateful day in September 2001 when the so - called war on terror began .
The idea is for the United States to bomb Quetta , one of Pakistan ’s principal cities , capital of its largest province , Balochistan , which already experiences separatist forces .
Quetta is a major Pakistan military base , home of the century - old Command and Staff College inherited from the British army .
A reported American threat is not just one of sending drones over this city of 850,000 people , with missiles meant to kill Mullah Omar , leading figure in at least one branch of the Taliban ; senior al - Qaeda figures also supposedly in Quetta ; and Siraj Haqqani , called the most important Taliban leader in the country , whose men are supposed to pose the biggest threat to NATO forces in Afghanistan .
Haqqani is also , as it happens , a major and longstanding Pakistani strategic asset and ally .
He will be a vital factor in the regional reconciliation and strategic settlement that will follow America and NATO ’s defeat .
That is the most important objection to the supposed plan .
The Pakistanis believe that the NATO expedition in Afghanistan is an ill - conceived and futile affair from which , after killing and being killed in large numbers , and accomplishing nothing useful , the Europeans and Americans will depart , just like the U.S. retreated from Lebanon under Ronald Reagan , after the 1983 attack on the troops ’ barracks in Beirut , and Bill Clinton pulled U.S. troops out of Somalia not long after losing the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993 .
After the foreigners leave , Pakistan will find itself once again in the awkward geopolitical and militarily dangerous situation in which nature and the vagaries of man have placed it .
Its avowed great enemy is India , with which Pakistan shares a very long eastern border , with Iran to its west , and Afghanistan on its long northwestern frontier .
A friendly Afghanistan therefore offers strategic depth in case of Indian attack , and access to Central Asia , while Iran is a corridor to the Middle East .
This is the sort of thing they teach at the Quetta Command and General Staff College .
The American generals seem to be saying to Pakistan :
You henceforth will ignore your own national security interests and devote yourself to our interests , whatever the cost to you .
You will hand over all of the Taliban leaders and men in your country , and place your army under our strategic control .
Otherwise , we will bomb your cities .
Why , according to the Los Angeles Times , " senior U.S. officials " think this is a good plan , I cannot for the life of me tell you .
I think it is a way to wreak further havoc in the region and do fundamental damage to the United States itself .

I disagreed with a whole heap of stuff in Ellie Levenson ’s “ The Noughtie Girl ’s Guide to Feminism ” when it came out last year ( see my Mswoman comments under this CiF piece for specific examples ) .
But apart from her odious assertion that “ we do women an injustice when we say that rape is the worst thing that can happen to a woman .
It is , after all , just a penis . ” top of the list was her claim , repeated in the Independent , that in some contexts so - called rape ‘ jokes ’ can not only be deemed to be acceptable , but they can also in fact be funny .
Because they ’re not .
Ever .
They never have been and they never will be .
They ’re not funny when Ricky Gervais tells them , and they ’re not funny when a Tory Councillor tells them either .
Here for example is Eddie Wake , a charming man who , up until Monday evening , was a Conservative councillor at Sunderland City Council ( and who ’s still a school governor at Oxclose Community School ) :
Wake was expelled from the Conservative party on Monday after word got out that a few weeks ago , at the end of a meeting where councillors had been discussing rape prevention measures with police , he decided to crack a rape ‘ joke ’ , to a senior police inspector no less .
A rape joke that was so cutting - edge and side - splittingly fucking hilarious that it led to a female councillor leaving the room in tears .
Interestingly , actually no , not interestingly , more like boringly soddingly predictably , Wake refused to apologise at the time .
Instead , when he was challenged about his comments by Labour Councillor Dianne Snowdon , he whined “ Come on , Dianne , you ca n’t joke about anything these days ” and proceeded to tick off the list of oh - so - funny subjects the pc gawn maaad brigade have banned him from pointing and laughing at : like women and black people for instance .
It ’s only now , now that he ’s suddenly found his name splashed all over the papers and his fellow Conservatives treating him like he ’s just stepped in something really really noxious , that Wake ’s decided to come over all repentant .
Except that he has n’t , not really , not when you look at the actual content of his pathetic apology :
“ I made the remark when the meeting had closed , to a colleague . ”
That ’s not an excuse , as anyone who holds public office should know .
“ It was an old joke and not a very good one and I bitterly regret the offence it has caused . ”
This just comes across as an apology for telling a crap joke , not an apology for the offensive subject matter of the joke .
And if he was really sorry for causing offence , then why did n’t he apologise at the time to the person who clearly was offended , instead of justifying it with all that pc gawn maaad Daily Mail shite ?
“ I am an effective councillor who asks awkward questions and I am not politically correct in any way but this time I have allowed that to cloud my judgment ”
Translation : “ I ’m a bit of a tosser and I do n’t intend to change , but in future I ’ll try to be more careful about who I tell my sexist racist little anecdotes to .
Maybe a council meeting where I ’m likely to be overheard by a humourless femnazi is n’t the best place , but I bet the lads down the pub’ll still appreciate them . ”
Or in other words “ I ’m sorry I was caught out this time ” not “ I ’m sorry to any rape survivors out there who may have been upset by my crassness and complete insensitivity ”
So anyway , to get back to Ellie Levenson and her view that so - called rape ‘ jokes ’ help break down the “ rape taboo ” , and that “ humour is one of the natural ways humans work through their thoughts and feelings about difficult issues ” : as I made clear at the beginning of this piece , I fundamentally disagree .
After all , people like Eddie Wake are n’t interested in breaking down taboos , they ’re only interested in demeaning and insulting women : rape jokes to men like them are just another weapon in an already vast arsenal .
As any survivor of sexual violence will tell you , there ’s nothing funny about being raped .
There ’s also nothing funny about listening to yet another sexist bore trying to make light of it .
And one of the last things we need in this context is alleged feminists giving the green light to such twisted misogynist bullshit .
But anyway , I ’ve got a joke now , stop me if you ’ve heard this one before : a man walks into a council meeting and spouts a load of sexist tripe .
Next thing he knows he ’s been expelled from his party and is being investigated by the council ’s standards committee .
What ?
What do you mean that ’s not funny ?
Personally I think it ’s fucking hilarious !

Chavez : US Weapon Test Caused Haiti Earthquake
Russia Today : Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez has once again accused the United States of playing God .
But this time it 's Haiti 's disastrous earthquake that he thinks the U.S. was behind .
Spanish newspaper ABC quotes Chavez as saying that the U.S. navy launched a weapon capable of inducing a powerful earthquake off the shore of Haiti .
He adds that this time it was only a drill and the final target is ... destroying and taking over Iran .

After shamelessly stalking through your collected posts and comments , I discovered that you had said that your favorite game ever was a three - way tie between Super Mario , Legend of Zelda , and Mega Man 2 .
Therefore , I have taken it upon myself to create a promotional poster for the inevitable day when they must settle their differences through bloodshed , for there can only be one favorite .
Also , Vader has been thrown in for good measure to represent Star Wars ' own past in the fictional rivalry .
Hope you like it .
Have a very happy holiday !

By Economic Forecasts & Opinions
U.S. President Barack Obama has begun a nine - day tour of Asia at a time when the U.S. economy is struggling to emerge from a deep recession .
But nothing looms bigger than China , the largest holder of U.S. debt ( around $ 797.1 billion , up 10 % this year ) , has emerged from the global economic downturn in an ever stronger position .
When Obama sets foot in China for the first time , he will confront a dramatically altered balance of power between the two nations .
Two Decades of Explosive Growth
This seismic shift is driven by China 's astonishing economic growth over the past two decades and has accelerated during the global financial crisis .
Its 9 % to 10 % annualized GDP growth rate in the past two and a half decades is unprecedented in world history .
In 1992 , Chinese gross domestic product ( GDP ) was less than 7 % of America 's GDP .
By 2000 , the figure topped 12 % .
When Obama won the election in 2008 , the Chinese economy had grown to equal more than 30 % of U.S. output .
New data show that China is on track to grow more than 8 % in 2009 , driven by high industrial output and retail sales .
Impressive Stimulus Package …and Working
During this global recession , China 's astonishing growth did slow down , but unlike most developed economies , China never entered a recession .
The Chinese have launched the world 's biggest investment program ( about $ 585 Billion ) after the start of the financial crisis last year .
Beijing 's stimulus program is estimated to amount to about 13 % of Chinese gross domestic product , making it almost twice as large as the U.S. program and close to five times the size of its German equivalent .
The government 's massive economic stimulus program has transformed the country into an enormous construction site .
As a result , China ’s industrial production rose 16.1 % year - over - year in October , the most since March 2008 and a slide in exports eased to 13.8 % the slowest pace this year .
However , behind the impressive economic data , troubles might be lurking .
China Bubble Forming
China ’s purchases of dollars to prevent appreciation gave it foreign - exchange reserves totaling $ 2.3 trillion in the third quarter , the world ’s largest .
Meanwhile , its sale of Yuan to keep it fixed to the dollar contributed to a 29 % jump in its money supply , and the peg helped spur more than $ 150 billion in speculative funds from overseas in the past six months , according to China International Capital Corp .
China 's main index , the Shanghai Composite , has gained 52 % this decade and rallied 75 % this year alone as government stimulus and record lending drove the nation ’s economic recovery .
( Fig. 1 ) State - owned banks have begun issuing new loans , leading to a 150 % increase in lending compared with 2008 .
In addition to playing the stock market , a lot of the money is being diverted into houses and land .
There are also reports of excess capacity created by the aggressive stimulus effort .
Record apartment prices and a high flying stock index this year are prompting warnings against " financial risks " and the development of bubbles in real estate markets .
Yuan - Dollar Peg Angers Many
Beijing has kept the Yuan pegged at about 6.83 per dollar since July 2008 , seeking to help manufacturers battered by the collapse in demand abroad .
The Yuan advanced 21 % in three years from July 2005 .
( Fig. 2 & 3 )
The discontent about China ’s currency peg to the dollar is n’t confined to the U.S. Capitol Hill , corn growers , steelmakers , and textile companies .
From Mumbai to Bangkok , Asian companies also say Chinese rivals have an unfair advantage because of the Yuan - dollar link .
The dollar has declined 14 % in the past year against the currencies of six major trading partners , while other neighboring currencies of China have strengthened .
For instance , South Korea ’s won gained 8 % against the Yuan in the past six months .
Japan ’s yen has risen 6 % , while India ’s rupee gained 6 % and the Thai baht 4 % .
This has prompted Asian central banks this year to increase their holdings of U.S. dollar assets , including Treasuries , to prevent their currencies from appreciating and thus making exports more expensive relative to China ’s , all the while blaming Beijing .
China Quashes Yuan Policy Speculation
Most expect that in Obama ’s meetings at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit and then in Beijing , China ’s fixed - rate policy will likely be part of the discussion .
On that note , investors are seeing a rising Yuan .
Twelve - month non-deliverable forwards for the Yuan in Shanghai are signaling trader bets on a 3.5 % gain from the spot rate of around 6.83 .
Then , in what seems to be an official effort by Chinese authorities to dismiss the renewed speculation of Yuan appreciation in the near term spurred by a recent language change from The People ’s Bank of China , on Saturday , the state - controlled Chinese news agency Xinhua reportedly said that the government would not allow the currency to gain against the dollar in the short term .
Goldman Sachs also just reiterated its three , six and 12 - month forecasts for the Yuan to stay at 6.83 against the dollar .
Yuan to Appreciate … Eventually
China ’s drive to create jobs and maintain social stability through export - led growth means politicians are n’t ready to loosen controls on the currency .
In addition , China ’s trade surplus will probably be half last year ’s level at $ 200 billion , which means a bit less pressure on the Yuan to appreciate .
The U.S. does n’t want a stronger Yuan either because that would cause a collapse in the dollar in the short term .
Over time , China will likely be under pressure to open and let the Yuan appreciate in the next 24 months , and possibly as early as the 2nd half of 2010 , albeit at a very gradual and modest pace , while most likely still pegged to the dollar .
Eventually , the Yuan will appreciate considerably due to China ’s high growth rate and its population ’s high savings rate ( 35 - 50 % range ) .
On Nov 11 , in Singapore , World Bank chief Zoellick calls the dollar 's role as a reserve currency " relatively secure , " but says over the next 10 - 15 years the yuan / renminbi will provide an alternative once it is internationalized .
Strong Growth Prospect
China is a communist country with capitalist power .
Despite China bears ’ prediction of a Chinese size collapse , for a country with such a tremendous resource base and centralized system , busted bubbles in sectors most likely will not derail the country ’s global leadership path started over two decades ago .
In a speech a few days ago at a conference organized by the Monetary Authority of Singapore , International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn called on Asia to play a leading role in guiding the global economy to a new , more sustainable path for global growth .
The IMF expects Asia ’s GDP growth , driven mostly by Chindia , to be 5.75 % next year — almost double the 3 % rate forecast for the global economy .
Specifically , the IMF projects China annual growth to be 8.5 % and 9 % for 2009 and 2010 respectively .
In contrast , advanced economies annual growth in 2010 is projected to be about 1.25 % , following a contraction of 3.5 % in 2009 .
( Fig . 4 )
Chinese Exposure Desirable
China ’s surging asset prices , a dollar collapse and a double - dip global recession are the biggest risks investors face in 2010 .
But many analysts are bullish on China for the long - term as 500 million educated and unemployed Chinese spur greater domestic spending and production .
Yet , Americans are estimated to have only 2 % to 20 % foreign stock exposure .
That means Chinese stocks represent probably a low single - digit percentage , at most , in the average portfolio .
With very few high investment return prospects , China is one market that should be given some serious consideration as part of a long portfolio .
There are many ways to play the Chinese market .
The following are just a brief overview of some that I will discuss in this article .
B Shares
For investors interested in adding some Chinese exposure , B shares are a good bet for those who hold dollars and want to benefit from China ’s fast economic recovery .
The shares traded at an average discount of 49 % to their A - share listings , according to BNP Paribas .
China 's dollar - denominated B shares at the Shanghai Stock Exchange jumped 9.42 % to 251.19 points last Friday , posting an 18 - month high .
The surge mainly resulted from market expectations of Yuan appreciation .
Though it is difficult to pick a good individual B shares stock right now as most are probably fully valued , it is best to avoid stocks of property developers as a way to minimize the risk of a potential real estate bubble .
According to Morgan Stanley , the sector ’s share price has gained about 155 % on average in the past year .
ETFs
An EFT is a convenient way to invest in China .
But it could be a bumpy ride as a three - year measure of volatility for China ETFs is more than double that of the S&P 500 .
The two most popular China ETFs are iShares FTSE / Xinhua China 25 Index ( FXI ) and SPDR S&P China ( GXC ) .
Both of these are very heavily weighted towards financials .
On the other hand , PowerShares Golden Dragon Halter USX China ( PGJ ) has only about 6 % exposure to financials , and has been around since 2004 .
For currency plays , the WisdomTree Dreyfus Chinese Yuan ( CYB ) and Market Vectors Renminbi / USD ETN ( CNY ) are two ETFs specializing in the Yuan .
But a recent WSJ article cautioned investors about the pitfalls of the Yuan ETF because it is in a contango market similar to that of the United States Natural Gas Fund ( UNG ) .
Consumer and Commodity Blue Chips
Since B shares and China ETFs may have more risks and volatility than some might like , blue chip companies with an increasing presence in China could be a less risky way to ride the Red Dragon .
Chinese President Hu Jintao recently said that the government is focused on expanding domestic spending , “ especially consumer demand ” to strengthen the economy .
This could present opportunities for consumer - related stocks .
U.S. blue - chip companies such as Wal - Mart ( WMT ) and McDonalds ( MCD ) are likely to benefit from this trend .
Similarly , with China ’s insatiable appetite for all natural resources , non-U.S. - based producers such as BHP Billiton ( BHP ) , Rio Tinto ( RTP ) , and Vale S.A. ( VALE ) could also provide good portfolio diversification .
Nevertheless , I would advise against commodity futures ETFs due to the intensifying regulatory scrutiny and the potential “ rolling effect ” commonly experienced in a contango market as discussed in my previous article .
Let 's see you stop this one .
~ Pikkoro Jyunia
I was sent the now notorious “ police spotter card ” through the post .
It ’s an official laminated card for “ police eyes only ” and labelled as coming from “ CO11 Public Order Intelligence Unit ” .
The card contained the photographs of 24 anti-arms trade protesters , unnamed but lettered A to X .
My picture appeared as photo H .
You can imagine my reaction at finding I was the subject of a secret police surveillance process … I was delighted .
I phoned my agent and told him I was suspect H . He replied : “ Next year we ’ll get you top billing … suspect A . ”
The Metropolitan police circulated the card specifically for the Docklands biannual arms fair in London to help its officers identify “ people at specific events who may instigate offences or disorder ” .
Which is such a flattering quote I am thinking of having it on my next tour poster .
While being wanted outside the arms fair , I was legitimately inside researching a book on the subject , and uncovered four companies illegally promoting “ banned ” torture equipment .
Questions were later asked in the Commons as to why HM Revenue & Customs and the police did n’t spot it .
Though , in fairness , none of the torture traders featured on the spotter card .
What exactly was I doing that was so awfully wrong as to merit this attention ?
Today ’s Guardian revelations of three secret police units goes some way to explain the targeting of protesters and raises worrying questions .
The job of these units is to spy on protesters , and collate and circulate information about them .
Protesters – or , as the police call them , “ domestic extremists ” – are the new “ reds under the bed ” .
Many of those targeted by the police have committed no crime and are guilty only of non-violent direct action .
So it is worth reminding ourselves that protest is legal .
Sorry if this sounds obvious , but you might have gained the impression that if three police units are spying on and targeting thousands , then those people must be up to something illegal .
The very phrase “ domestic extremist ” defines protesters in the eyes of the police as the problem , the enemy .
Spying on entire groups and organisations , and targeting the innocent , undermines not only our rights but the law – frightfully silly of me to drag this into an argument about policing , I know .
Protest is part of the democratic process .
It was n’t the goodwill of politicians that led them to cancel developing countries ’ debt , but the protests and campaigning of millions of ordinary people around the world .
The political leaders were merely the rubber stamp in the democratic process .
Thus any targeting and treatment of demonstrators ( at the G20 for example ) that creates a “ chilling effect ” – deterring those who may wish to exercise their right to protest – is profoundly undemocratic .
No police , secret or otherwise , should operate without proper accountability .
So how are these three units accountable ?
Who has access to the databases ?
How long does information remain in the system ?
What effect could it have on travel and future employment of those targeted ?
How closely do these units work with corporate private investigators , and does the flow of information go both ways ?
Do the police target strikers ?
A police spokesman has said that anyone who finds themselves on a database “ should not worry at all ” .
When a spokesman for the three secret units will not disclose a breakdown of their budgets , and two of the three will not even name who heads their operations ( even MI6 gave us an initial , for God ’s sake ) , then the words “ should not worry at all ” are meaningless .
Indeed , when the police admit that someone could end up on a secret police database merely for attending a demonstration , it is exactly the time to worry .

Have you ever had trouble expressing your message clearly ?
I certainly have .
What can we do as writers to help our readers understand our message ?
Get rid of “ it , ” for starters .
Not the message , of course , but the word “ it ” itself .
Like the Knights who say Ni , “ it ” is a word that a writer should not use .
“ It ” is perhaps the most ambiguous word in the entire English language .
“ It ” can be a monkey , a skill , a xylophone , or any number of other concepts that can be found in the dictionary .
The next time you write something ( a comment in response to this post ? ) , try looking through your work and replace the word “ it ” with the concept you ’re truly trying to capture .
Alternatively , choose one of your already written works and scan through for instances of “ it ” .
If you ’re like me , when you ’re writing , you tend to naturally use “ it ” in the course of writing stories or articles .
However , by using “ it , ” you are robbing your readers of your true meaning .
Read the following sentence ( borrowed from a story I wrote recently in response to a writing prompt ) :
It was just too early … we ’d barely gotten to know each other , and while we ’d been so similar at first , we could n’t have had more different ideologies in raising a family .
The sentence seems just fine , but there is a way to improve .
Rewording the sentence to eliminate “ it ” results in a clearer message :
The pregnancy had come too early … we ’d barely gotten to know each other , and while we ’d been so similar at first , we could n’t have had more different ideologies in raising a family .
Which of the two sentences is more clear ?
In the first , a reader is left questioning what “ it ” is , even at the end … is “ it ” a marriage ?
Two people moving in together ?
A pregnancy ?
The second sentence is more clear –the reader understands immediately what the author intended .
When editing your work , try to eliminate “ it ” .
I aim to have no usage of the word “ it ” in my writing ( with the exception of this post , of course ! ) .
Other words I look for and try to avoid :
it , thing , stuff — Replace the vague term with a more accurate noun
— Replace the vague term with a more accurate noun very , extremely , really — Eliminate , or , if I want to stress some particular aspect of a verb or noun , choose a more explicit adverb or adjective , or rephrase the sentence .
For example , instead of “ extremely difficult ” , I might say “ difficult ” , “ complex ” or “ laborious ” , depending on what aspect I want to emphasize .
— Eliminate , or , if I want to stress some particular aspect of a verb or noun , choose a more explicit adverb or adjective , or rephrase the sentence .
For example , instead of “ extremely difficult ” , I might say “ difficult ” , “ complex ” or “ laborious ” , depending on what aspect I want to emphasize .
was , am , are — Choose a more specific verb or phrase .
For example , instead of “ I was excited , ” a better choice might be “ Excited , I < performed some action > ”
In general , if I can think of a more specific word that still applies , I use the more specific word instead of a vague one .
Okay , so if “ it ” is such a bad word , why does it exist ?
“ It ” certainly has its place –for example , when an object has no gender ( such as the example in this sentence ) .
In this case , we have to be vague … if there is no term to describe the object , you may have no choice but to use the word “ it . ”
However , in most cases , you can remove “ it ” from your sentences .
Writing clearly is one of the most challenging jobs that a writer has .
Following this simple strategy of eliminating vague terms will help us to write more clearly .
Happy writing !

Update : a number have people have pointed out some small errors and some additional APIs that I should look at .
See my half - hearted followup : Entity Extraction APIs , once again .
As part of a project I ’m working on ( more on that later ) , I wanted to be able to take some text ( probably in the form of a web page ) and get a list of the important entities / keywords / phrases .
It turns out that there are actually quite a few companies that offer a service like this available freely ( at least somewhat ) through an API , so I set out to try them all out and assess their quality and suitability for my project .
Most of these APIs are provided by companies that do various things in the NLP ( natural language processing ) realm and / or work with large semantic datasets .
Many of the APIs provide a variety of information , only some of which is the set of entities that I ’m looking for , so they may have good features that are excluded from my narrow comparison .
Using the APIs
To evaluate the APIs I wrote a script to make use of each one ( scroll to the bottom to see it in action ) .
They were fairly similar but the code to handle each one is slightly different .
In many cases they offered multiple response formats but I opted for XML for each of them which made things simple enough , and I got used to using SimpleXML in PHP .
The main difference between them all is simply the XPath expression needed to pick out the entities .
For each API I grab the entity , any available synonyms ( minus some de-duplication ) , and the self - reported relevance score for that entity , if available .
If not already sorted by that relevance , I sort them .
An additional issue was that although most of the APIs accepted a URL as input , some required the actual content , in either HTML or plain text .
When accepting content from a web page , the service needs to be smart about ignoring web navigation , ads , etc. when determining what is important , and they vary in ability to do that .
Alchemy ( one of the APIs tested here ) also has a web page cleaning API which can be accessed on its own .
Results from the Yahoo API were of such low quality that I actually ran the input web page through the web page cleaning API before sending it to Yahoo , and it is those results which are evaluated here .
Most of the analysis here is based off a sample of eight web pages including Wikipedia articles , news articles , and other pages with a lot of text content from a variety of subjects .
I have not yet done any analysis of how the quality of the response for each API is affected by the length of the input document .
The APIs
The APIs I tested were , roughly in order of increasing quality ,
Comment on this post to let me know if I ’m missing any .
API terms
Most APIs today have limits on both how much they can be called , and what you can use them for .
Here they are ranked roughly by “ most usable terms and limits ” to least :
Evri Currently no API limit ; essentially no requirements AlchemyAPI 30,000 calls per day ( although more may be available ) ; commercial use is definitely okay OpenCalais 50,000 calls per day , 4 calls per second ; one must display their logo as - is ; if you are syndicating the data it needs to preserve their GUIDs ; see details BeliefNetworks 2,000 calls per day , 1 call per second ; essentially no requirements
Yahoo 5,000 calls per IP per day ; non-commercial use only OpenAmplify 1,000 “ transactions ” per day ; note that one call is 1 - 4 transactions depending on the input type and whether you want all or a subset of the output ; commercial use is definitely okay
Please note the standard I - am - not - a - lawyer and that this is just a summary .
Please read the terms of service yourself .
Languages
Although my project is English - only for now , ideally there would be support for other languages .
All the samples I used were in English so that is what is being used to evaluate the quality , but here is the full list of what languages each API claims to handle :
Yahoo English OpenCalais English , French , Spanish BeliefNetworks
A white paper on their website claims that their technology can support multiple languages , but most likely only English is currently supported OpenAmplify English AlchemyAPI English , French , German , Italian , Portuguese , Russian , Spanish , Swedish , however some important features are only available for English Evri English
I have not done any research into similar APIs which are not available for English at all , but if you find one , please let me know and I ’ll make a note of it here .
The response from OpenAmplify and AlchemyAPI will also include the language of the input document .
For AlchemyAPI this includes 97 languages , not just the ones that the API can handle .
If you ’re just looking for good language identification , there are other resources for that , some open source .
My ancient Language Identification page still has some useful links there .
Number of Entities and Relevance Scores
For the purposes of my project , I see the APIs which return more entities from the document to be more useful , all else being equal .
BeliefNetworks allows you to specify the number of entities returned ( supposedly up to 75 but it actually returns 76 ) , and as such always returns that number , which is almost always more than any other API .
Yahoo returns up to 20 entities ( which is n’t documented ) , which is often the least of any API .
Here I list the APIs sorted by number of entities returned from most to least :
BeliefNetworks AlchemyAPI OpenAmplify OpenCalais Yahoo Evri
There are a couple of important caveats here , however .
This is based off of a very small sample , so other than BeliefNetworks returning the most , the list could be off .
Beyond that , OpenCalais has a fairly small limit on text length ( 100,000 characters , presumably including the HTML tags ) and if the input is too long , it returns no entities at all , just an error message .
The ranking above excludes those examples .
OpenAmplify has a limit of 2.5 K , however they just truncate the document instead of failing ( although this counts as an additional “ transaction ” ) .
Oddly , Evri returned an error of “ rejected by content filter ” for this news article and returned no entities .
Evri ’s ranking in the list above is unchanged with or without the inclusion of that example .
Relevance Scores
All of the APIs , with the exception of Yahoo’s , include some metric with each entity rating its relevance to the input document .
This is important as every user of any of these APIs would most likely want to establish a minimum relevance threshold for actually making use of the entities .
The number of entities comparison above is based on no threshold at all ; obviously changing the threshold would affect the comparison .
AlchemyAPI and OpenCalais use scores from zero - to - one , however Evri , OpenAmplify , and BeliefNetworks have their own scale .
I have n’t yet done any work to normalize all these scores and I think that most likely the best practice would be to independently determine your own threshold on a per-api basis depending on your own needs .
Semantic Links
By semantic links I simply mean that the entities returned have some sort of links or references to additional information about those entities .
Although not necessarily required for my project , this may be very useful .
Two of the APIs , Evri and AlchemyAPI include this information when they successfully map a found entity to an entity in their own database .
Evri provides a reference to the entity in Evri ’s own system , whereas AlchemyAPI links to a variety of other sources : the website for the entity , Freebase , MusicBrainz , and others .
In addition to or instead of these semantic links , Evri , AlchemyAPI , and OpenCalais have their own systems of classification and label entities with things like “ Person ” and “ Religion ” .
See Evri’s most popular ‘ facets ’ , AlchemyAPI Entity Types , and OpenCalais : Metadata Element Simple Output Value for specifics of each .
OpenAmplify is even more basic but provides broad categories such as “ Locations ” and “ Proper Nouns ” , and entities may be listed in more than one of these broad categories .
Yahoo and BeliefNetworks provide no additional context .
Additional Information
Some of these APIs provide a wealth of information that I disregard entirely but could be useful to others .
For example Amplify returns a lot of information about the sentiment being expressed about each entity , information about the person who authored the document ( e.g. gender , education ) , the style of the document ( e.g. slang usage ) , and actions expressed within the document .
OpenCalais also extracts events and facts from a document , as well as other details per entity such as the ticker symbol for entities which are public companies .
AlchemyAPI can extract quotations from the document .
Note that this is a summary and not a complete list of all the data that these APIs return .
Synonyms vs. Duplicates
The better APIs here , at least as far as I ’ll be using them , succeed at recognizing that “ Smith ” referred to throughout an article is the same as “ John Smith ” mentioned in the first sentence .
I want duplicates minimized , and for each entity to have as many valid names / synonyms as possible .
The APIs differ here significantly .
Evri is definitely the best , followed by AlchemyAPI .
Unfortunately AlchemyAPI sometimes misdisambiguates ( ooh , no results on Google or Bing for that word yet ) which results in incorrect synonyms , however that is n’t a huge problem for me .
An example is the article I referred to earlier where AlchemyAPI confuses a Canadian military unit for the British monarch it was named after .
Yahoo and OpenCalais fall into the middle .
OpenAmplify and BeliefNetworks have a fair number of unmerged duplicate entities .
For my purposes , I do n’t care if the synonyms come from the input document or an external database , which is what Evri and AlchemyAPI probably use .
Taking a look at each API
Yahoo
This was the only API that I was aware of until recently , and I ’ve blogged about it before .
The input format is plain text , so since I ’m using URLs as input , I have to first extract the text , strip the HTML , and send that .
As I mentioned above , the quality was so poor when using web pages as input that the text must first be scrubbed of web page navigation , etc. , and I used AlchemyAPI to do that .
Even then , the quality was still poor and the API returned things that I would describe more as long phrases than as entities .
Given that , not to mention the maximum of 20 entities , and the non-commercial restriction , I do n’t see myself making use of this API .
OpenCalais
This API also accepted content rather than a URL .
The content format must be specified in the API call .
I simply retrieved the URL , and passed all of its content ( with HTML ) on to OpenCalais .
They suggest making sure to remove web page navigation , but without me doing this , that did n’t present a problem .
What was a problem was the short maximum document length .
To actually use OpenCalais you should make sure to truncate documents before making the request , which is work that I have n’t yet implemented myself .
Even when results were returned , the overall quality was mediocre .
The default output format is RDF , which is very verbose and includes a lot more information than I needed .
I opted for the Text / Simple format which is actually XML .
For free API users sometimes the response comes back as “ server busy ” and I experienced this myself sometimes while trying it out .
BeliefNetworks
This API has a simple output , and is somewhat unusual in its functionality .
Unlike all the other APIs , where the entities are extracted from the input document , with BeliefNetworks it seems they find entities which are related to the document but not necessarily actually in it .
This produces some interesting results that are sometimes good but overall less related than I ’d expect , and in one of my examples , completely unrelated and bizarre .
Given that , and the frequency of duplicate entities , as mentioned , I would describe the overall quality as mediocre , although usually better than OpenCalais .
OpenAmplify
The most notable feature of OpenAmplify is all the additional information they provide , as described above .
They take input either as a URL or the content itself , and “ charge ” an additional transaction if you call them using a URL .
I used URL input but also tried submitting the HTML , submitting the text ( HTML stripped ) , and submitting the text after putting through the AlchemyAPI web page cleaning , and in all cases the results were about the same or worse .
OpenAmplify notes that they may not be able to follow all URL redirects ( although I did n’t test this with any of the APIs ) , but this issue can be avoided by following the redirects yourself before making the request .
As mentioned earlier , they only look at the first 2.5 K of input .
They also accept RSS / Atom as input , which is a nice feature .
Although I ’ve set up my script to remove duplicates it currently misses removing some duplicate entities from OpenAmplify as the entity may be listed several times in the response but with different relevance scores .
One problem I found was that the entities returned usually consisted of a single token ( one word ) which just made them less useful .
Overall , the quality was okay , generally better than BeliefNetworks .
AlchemyAPI
Other than the occasional misdisambiguation , AlchemyAPI is quite good .
Evri
Evri’s API is also quite good , with the biggest flaw being that it does n’t return very many entities .
Overall Quality Summary
Overall , Evri and AlchemyAPI were definitely the best and most suited for my purposes .
The quality of Evri’s was the best across the small sample , although not in all instances , and it did n’t return as many entities as AlchemyAPI .
Interestingly these two APIs are also the two which include semantic links and have the least restrictions and high API limits .
OpenAmplify and BeliefNetworks are the runners up .
OpenCalais fared poorly in my evaluation , but I suspect it would do better when looking at all the rest that their API .
Yahoo’s API unfortunately just was n’t good enough to use when any of the other APIs are available .
I ’m convinced that trying to build a similar service myself is not worth it at all .
One thing that I have n’t tried yet is combining these APIs together in some way , although that could potentially improve the results quite a bit .

The subtle but ongoing pressures of human evolution could explain the seeming rise of disorders such as autism , autoimmune diseases , and reproductive cancers , researchers write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Certain adaptations that once benefited humans may now be helping such ailments persist in spite of -- or perhaps because of -- advancements in modern culture and medicine .
" This work points out linkages within the plethora of new information in human genetics and the implications for human biology and public health , and also illustrates how one could teach these perspectives in medical and premedical curricula , " says author Peter Ellison , John Cowles Professor of Anthropology at Harvard University .
Ellison 's co-authors are Stephen Stearns of Yale University , Randolph Nesse of the University of Michigan , and Diddahally Govindaraju of the Boston University School of Medicine .
The research was first presented at the Arthur M. Sackler Colloquium , co-sponsored by the National Academy of Science and the Institute of Medicine .
Colloquium presentations described in the current paper include research suggesting that :
Autism and schizophrenia may be associated with the over - expression of paternally or maternally derived genes and influences , a hypothesis advanced by Bernard Crespi of Simon Fraser University .
Maternal and paternal genes engage in a subtle tug - of - war well into childhood with consequences for childhood development , as posited by David Haig , George Putnam Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard .
Humans may be susceptible to allergies , asthma , and autoimmune diseases because of increased hygiene , according to Kathleen Barnes of Johns Hopkins University .
Without being exposed to intestinal worms and parasites , as our ancestors were , our immune systems are hypersensitive .
Natural selection still influences our biology , despite advances in modern culture and medicine .
Stearns found that natural selection favors heavier women and reduces the age at which a woman has her first child .
In the final presentation of the colloquium , researchers called for the integration of evolutionary perspectives into medical school curricula , to help future physicians consider health problems from an evolutionary perspective .
" We 're trying to design ways to educate physicians who will have a broader perspective and not think of the human body as a perfectly designed machine , " says Ellison .
" Our biology is the result of many of evolutionary trade - offs , and understanding these histories and conflicts can really help the physician understand why we get sick and what we might do to stay healthy . "
Previous work in evolutionary medicine helped explain why disease is so prevalent and difficult to prevent -- because natural selection favors reproduction over health , biology evolves more slowly than culture , and pathogens evolve more quickly than humans .
" I think that the main take - home point is that evolution and medicine really do have things to say to each other , and some of these insights actually reduce suffering and save lives , " says Stearns .
Washington ( CNN ) --
As House and Senate Democrats try to merge two separate health care reform bills , a new national poll suggests that when it comes to paying for the legislation , Americans favor provisions in the House bill over those in the Senate version .
And a CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday also indicates that most Americans do n't register either a strong negative or positive reaction to the bills .
According to the poll , 61 percent of the public favor the House provision , which taxes people with high incomes regardless of the kind of health insurance they have .
Twenty - nine percent favor the Senate provision , which raises taxes on high - quality health insurance plans , regardless of the amount of money made by the people covered by those plans .
Congressional Democratic negotiators from both chambers and White House officials are trying to find common ground on one of the most divisive issues , the Senate bill 's inclusion of an excise tax on high - end insurance plans .
Liberals in the House and labor unions are particularly upset with the provision , arguing that it would it would hurt union members who traded higher salaries for more generous health benefits .
Proponents of the tax on such " Cadillac " plans argue it's one of the most effective ways to curb medical inflation .
President Obama has made clear he favors the Senate Democrats ' approach .
" A tax on the wealthy is obviously most popular with lower - income Americans , but it is also the preference of people making $ 100,000 a year or more , " says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
" Fifty percent of people in that income level prefer a tax on higher - income Americans to a tax on high - quality health care plans .
Thirty - six percent of them prefer the tax on insurance plans rather than the income - based tax . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would like to pass a compromise bill before the president 's State of the Union address on January 27 , though some Democrats have indicated that timetable could slip .
Another divisive issue is the so - called " public option , " a health insurance option administered by the federal government that would compete with plans offered by private health insurance companies .
The House bill has the public option while the Senate version does not include the provision .
Fifty - four percent of people questioned in the poll support a government - run option , with 46 percent opposed .
According to the survey , only 4 in 10 support the health care bills passed by the House and Senate , with 57 percent opposed .
But only 45 percent oppose the bills because they say they are too liberal .
One in ten suggest the oppose the legislation because it 's not liberal enough .
The poll also indicates that 28 percent say they would be angry if health care legislation passed , with another 23 percent suggesting they'd be displeased .
One in three questioned say they'd be pleased , with only 14 percent saying they 'd enthusiastically support the bills .
" Despite the controversy that has surrounded that legislation since last summer 's contentious town hall meetings , most Americans do n't seem to have an extreme position on health care , " adds Holland .
" This may explain why the Democrats are going full - steam ahead on health care despite majority opposition to their bills .
The number who oppose the bills because they are not liberal enough might also suggest to Democrats that those voters will wind up supporting Democratic candidates by election day . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted January 8 - 10 , with 1,021 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
Attacks against the police marked Friday 4/12 despite the Prime Minister 's public plea for calm .
The tension in the capital city of greece is high with more than 400 high - schools and 30 universities occupied across the country .
The greek Prime Minister 's public plea for calm in the light of the first anniversary of Alexandros Grigoropoulos murder and the subsequent uprising last year was nullified today as the police was attacked three times in a few hours in the city of Athens .
Minutes after 12:00 at noon two police patrols were attacked simultaneously in Exarcheia , the radical enclave of the greek capital .
Radicals attacked the police with sticks and caused serious injuries to the officers , two of which have been hospitalised , one in bad condition .
Following the attack strong riot police forces surrounded the area and several people have been detained but are being currently released .
Two hours later high - school pupils formed a march in the northern suburb of Chalandri to commemorate the assassination of 15 year old Alexandros by cops last year , the first of its kind two days before the actual anniversary .
The pupils marched to the local police station and attacked it with rocks and oranges .
During the melee two banks were also attacked .
There have been no arrests or detentions .
The anti-police attacks come to add to the electrified climate in greece where at the moment 400 high - schools and more than 30 universities are under occupation .
The government has announced a zero tolerance plan , claiming that although the assassination has " scarred the collective memory " of the people , it will not allow Athens to be destroyed again .
Friday 's session in parliament devolved into a brawl between parties concerning the measures taken and last December 's uprising , amidst scaremongering by the extreme - right that " thousands of foreign anarchists " are flooding the country with sinister intentions .
On a more calm note , the President of the Republic has declared the state " guilty towards the youth " , urging once again for peace and reconciliation .
“ They ’re advertising it in the papers as if they ’re actually proud of that , ” said Steven Weisman , a title insurance consultant in New York .
“ It ’s a joke . ”
The advertised rate for the Savings Plus account has expired , according to the bank ’s Web site ; as of Friday , the account paid an interest rate of 0.5 percent .
The bank ’s highest - yield savings account , the Ultimate , was paying 1.01 percent .
The best deal Mr. Weisman has found is 2 percent on a one - year certificate of deposit offered by ING Direct , an online bank that has become a bit of a darling among the fixed - income crowd .
Interest on one - and two - year Treasury notes was just 0.40 percent and 0.89 percent , as of Monday .
Bank of America offers 0.35 percent on a standard money market account with $ 10,000 to $ 25,000 , and Wells Fargo will pay 0.05 percent on a basic savings account .
Indeed , after fees are subtracted , inflation is accounted for and taxes are paid , many investors in C.D. ’s , government bonds and savings and money market accounts are losing money .
In fact , Northern Trust waived some $ 8 million in fees on money market accounts because they would have wiped out all interest , and then some .
“ The unemployment situation and the general downturn in the economy had an impact , but what ’s going to happen now as C.D. ’s mature is that retirees and the elderly are going to take anywhere from a half to three - quarters of a percent cut in their incomes , ” said Joe Parks , a retired accountant in Houston on the advisory board of Better Investing , an organization that works to help people become savvier investors .
“ It ’s a real problem . ”
Experts say risk - averse investors are effectively financing a second bailout of financial institutions , many of which have also raised fees and interest rates on credit cards .
“ What the average citizen does n’t explicitly understand is that a significant part of the government ’s plan to repair the financial system and the economy is to pay savers nothing and allow damaged financial institutions to earn a nice , guaranteed spread , ” said William H. Gross , co-chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company , or Pimco .
“ It ’s capitalism , I guess , but it ’s not to be applauded . ”
Mr. Gross said he read his monthly portfolio statement twice because he could not believe that the line “ Yield on cash ” was 0.01 percent .
At that rate , he said , it would take him 6,932 years to double his money .
Many think the Federal Reserve is fueling a stock market bubble by keeping rates so low that investors decide to bet on stocks instead .
Mr. Parks of Better Investing moved more money into the stock market early this year , when C.D. ’s he held began maturing and he could not nearly recover the income they had generated by rolling them over .
He began investing some of the money in blue chip stocks with a dividend yield of at least 3 percent and even managed to find an oil - and - gas limited partnership that offered 8 percent .
Mr. Parks said , however , that he would not pursue that strategy as more of his C.D. ’s matured .
“ What worked in the first quarter of this year is n’t as relevant , because the market has come up so much , ” he said .
No one is advising a venture into higher - risk investments .
Katie Nixon , chief investment officer for the northeast region at Northern Trust , said that , in general , “ no one should be taking risks with their pillow money . ”
“ What people are paying for is safety and security , ” she said , “ and that ’s probably just right . ”
People who rely on income from such investments for support , however , are being forced to consider new options .
Eileen Lurie , 75 , is taking out a reverse mortgage to help offset the decline in returns on her investments tied to interest rates .
Reverse mortgages have a checkered reputation , but Ms. Lurie said her bank was going out of its way to explain the product to her .
“ These banks do n’t want to be held responsible for thousands of seniors standing in bread lines , ” she said .
Such mortgages allow people who are 62 and older to convert equity in their homes into cash tax - free and without any impact on Social Security or Medicare payments .
The loans are repaid after death .
“ If your assets are n’t appreciating and are n’t producing any income , you ’re getting eaten up in this interest rate environment , ” said Peter Strauss , a lawyer who advises the elderly .
“ A reverse mortgage is one way of making a very large asset produce income . ”
Eve Wilmore , 93 , has watched returns on her C.D. ’s drop to between 1 percent and 2 percent from about 5 percent a year or so ago .
Yet the Social Security Administration recently raised her Medicare Part B premium based on those higher rates she had been earning .
“ I ’m being hit from both sides , ” Mrs. Wilmore said .
“ There ’s some way I can apply for a reconsideration , and I ’m going to fight it .
I have to . ”
She said she was reluctant to redeploy her money into higher - risk investments .
“ I do n’t know what my medical bills will be from here on in , and so I want to keep the money where I can get to it easily if I need it , ” she said .
Peter Gomori , who taught a course on money and investing for Dorot , a nonprofit that offers services for the elderly , did not advise his students on investment strategies but said that if he had , he would probably have told them to sit tight .
“ I know interest rates are very low for Treasury securities and bank products , but that is n’t going to be forever , ” he said .
But investment professionals doubt rates will rise any time soon — or to any level close to those before the crash .
“ What the futures market is telling me , ” Mr. Gross said , “ is that in April 2011 , these savers that are currently earning nothing will be earning 1.25 percent . ”
Scientists are working on synthesizing solar cells from chromophore structures they produced in tobacco plants .
Image credit : US Department of Agriculture .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Over billions of years , plants have evolved very efficient sunlight - collecting systems .
Now , scientists are trying to harness the finely tuned systems in tobacco plants in order to use them as the building blocks of solar cells .
Scientists predict that the technique could lead to the production of inexpensive , biodegradable solar cells .
In a recent study , scientists from UC Berkeley led by Matt Francis have demonstrated how to program tobacco plants to take advantage of the efficient way that they collect sunlight .
Rather than attempt to reprogram all the cells of a mature tobacco plant , the scientists genetically engineered a virus called the tobacco mosaic virus to do the job for them .
The researchers sprayed the modified virus on a crop of tobacco plants , and the virus caused the plant cells to produce lots of artificial chromophores , which turn photons from sunlight into electrons .
In order for the chromophores to work , however , they must be spaced at a precise distance from one another - about two or three nanometers .
A little closer or further apart , and the electric current will either be halted or the electrons will be very difficult to harvest .
Thankfully , tobacco plant cells have evolved to space chromophores at this exact distance , lining them up in a long spiral hundreds of nanometers long .
By exploiting this structure , the researchers could take advantage of billions of years of evolution to grow perfectly spaced strands of chromophores .
" Over billions of years , evolution has established exactly the right distances between chromophores to allow them to collect and use light from the sun with unparalleled efficiency , " said Francis .
Since the modified tobacco plants themselves do n’t generate electricity , the researchers must harvest the plants and extract the chromophore structures .
Then , the scientists can dissolve the structures in a liquid solution , and then spray the solution on a glass or plastic substrate to create a solar cell .
So far , the scientists have not yet demonstrated that the resulting solar cells can turn light into electrical energy .
Compared with traditional solar cells , those made from plants could have several potential advantages .
For instance , they do n’t require the use of toxic chemicals , they ’re biodegradable , and they ’re inexpensive to produce .
On the other hand , bio - based solar cells would likely have a shorter lifetime than silicon solar cells .
In addition to using tobacco , the researchers also demonstrated how to manipulate E. coli bacteria to produce chromophore structures .
In this case , the researchers did n’t use a virus , but modified the bacteria directly .

From the outset of an independent India in 1947 , language provided the rationale for political boundaries , as large states were carved from different linguistic regions .
But as India has evolved into the world ’s second most populous country , with 1.2 billion people , the political map also became focused on improving government efficiency , reducing corruption and ensuring an equitable allocation of resources .
Some analysts note that smaller states have proved more effective , as far as good government , yet India still has several states larger than most countries .
Uttar Pradesh , home to 8 percent of the world ’s poorest people , has more than 160 million people .
Three new states were created in 2000 , raising the national total to 28 states and 7 territories administered by the central government , but in recent years the Congress Party has pledged to convene a special commission to examine national political borders , a pledge that , as yet , remains unfulfilled .
Beyond Telangana , India has a handful of other localized statehood movements , notably in the Gurkha region of the state of West Bengal , and it remains unclear whether these movements will regain momentum .
“ As a nation , we are young , ” said Ramachandra Guha , a historian who has written about India ’s federalist evolution .
“ We are still grappling with how to organize our system of government . ”
The roots of the Telangana movement can be traced to origins of democratic India .
Before independence , Telangana was a princely state that existed outside British control .
Hyderabad , the capital of the region , was a largely Muslim enclave .
With the end of British rule , Telangana existed as a separate state until November 1956 , when it was merged with state of Andhra to create Andhra Pradesh , with Hyderabad as its capital .

In Merriam , Kan. , the Russell Sifers Candy Company produces what must be the messiest candy bar in the United States .
The Valomilk , first introduced in 1931 , is a thin cup of chocolate filled with vanilla syrup .
It is virtually impossible to eat without getting syrup on your face .
For years , the bar came with its own cautionary slogan : " When it runs down your chin , you know it 's a Valomilk . "
The Twin Bing , with a cherry - flavored nougat center , is still being made in Iowa .
Palmer Candy Co .
Farther north , in a low - slung factory in St. Joseph , Mo. , the bright pink gobs rolling down the assembly line are the sweet centers of the Cherry Mash .
They have been the flagship of the Chase Candy Company since they were introduced in 1918 .
A couple of miles east of downtown Nashville , the Standard Candy Company makes the GooGoo Cluster , a disc of caramel and marshmallow covered in milk chocolate , dappled with peanuts , then drenched in more chocolate .
The GooGoo , which lays claim to being one of the oldest bars in America , is considered by most Southerners to be the official candy bar of Dixie .
These companies are the face of what the candy industry in America used to be .
Each city or region had its own factories , and people could actually see and smell the place where their favorite sweets were made .
Coming from a particular town meant that you ate a particular kind of candy bar .
Because there was no refrigeration to speak of , and transportation was expensive , confectioners often used local ingredients .
If you lived in a region that produced cherries or walnuts , chances are those were in your candy bars .
Regional candies are a dying breed .
Today , there are perhaps a dozen such concerns left in America .
The rest have been swallowed up , or put out of business , by the massive consolidation that has shaped the modern confectionery industry .
Earlier this month , the British chocolate giant Cadbury agreed to a $ 19 billion buyout from Kraft , creating a mega - firm that projects $ 50 billion in annual sales .
Thousands of candy bars have disappeared along the road to consolidation , including such recent delicacies as the peanut butter - and - chocolate pods known as Oompahs , the treacherously chewy Bit - o - Choc , the glorious , nougat - and - caramel - filled Milkshake , and the Bar None , an ingenious marriage of peanuts and wafers dipped in chocolate .
Also gone ( but not forgotten ) is the curiously alluring Marathon Bar , a braided rope of chocolate and caramel whose wrapper featured a ruler on the back .
Sweet Survivors
A sampling of candies still in production : Mary Jane , a peanut - butter - flavored chewy candy NECCO ( New England Confectionery Company ) Valomilk , chocolate cups filled with liquid marshmallow Valomilk Abba - Zaba , taffy candy with peanut butter centers Annabelle Candy Co. Cherry Mash , peanuts and chocolate over a cherry fondant center none Idaho Spud , marshmallow center covered with dark chocolate and coconut sprinkles Idaho Candy Co .
Local products ranged from legendary to outright strange .
There was the famous Seven Up , a St. Paul native that included seven different flavors ; the nougat - puffed Minneapolis bar known as the Fat Emma and a creation known as the Vegetable Sandwich , which , regrettably , consisted of dehydrated cabbage , celery and peppers covered in chocolate .
( The Vegetable Sandwich , whose label contained the bizarre boast " Will Not Constipate , " was introduced during the health craze of the ' 20s and died , of natural causes , soon after . )
Other bars included the Dipsy Doodle , the Coffee Dan , the Baby Lobster , the Prairie Schooner , the Fig Pie — the list goes on and on .
Still , a handful of candy makers have resisted the corporate scythe and persevered .
At Palmer Candy in Sioux City , Iowa , fleets of workers with ice cream scoops plop a lump of chocolate - and - peanut hash around a cherry fondant to produce the unexpectedly addictive Twin Bing .
Marty Palmer , the fifth generation of Palmers to run the company , has a framed calfskin pennant behind his desk , branded with the legend " Delicious Chocolates Sold Here . "
It dates back to the turn of the century .
" Back then , we delivered our candies as far as a horse - drawn wagon could go in a day , " Mr. Palmer said .
" That was our distribution system .
Our jobbers would go in to a dry goods store and peg one of these to the wall . "
The Idaho Candy Company in Boise looks more like a museum than a production facility , littered with equipment dating back to the 1900s .
It 's home to the Idaho Spud , a spongy , cocoa - flavored marshmallow covered in dark chocolate and dusted with dried coconut .
It is , shall we say , an acquired taste .
All of these companies are acutely aware of how tenuous their businesses are .
The consolidation of retail outlets has destroyed the network of mom-and - pop grocery stores that sold their products .
And the giant chains that dominated the retail landscape , such as Wal - Mart , charge so - called " slotting fees " — a fee paid by the supplier for desirable shelf space — that are often prohibitive .
There 's no danger of the small manufacturers being bought out by one of the Big Three — Hershey , Mars and Nestle — because the profits generated by their bars simply are n't big enough .
Their most loyal customers — the folks who had grown up eating their bars — are getting older .
And they fret that their companies will eventually have to be shuttered , unless one of their children takes over .
The diminishing presence of certain brands has created a whole new niche business for Web sites like Candydirect.com , a retailer of hard - to - find candies .
The site 's message board is a testament to the fanaticism of candy lovers , all desperately seeking some candy from their youth , which they describe in detail .
Here , you 'll find elegies to dear departed goodies such as Wacky Wafers , the Summit bar , the PB Max , Choco - Lite and the Reggie Bar .
The era of the local candy factory dates back to an ambitious Pennsylvanian named Milton Hershey , a failed vendor of caramels , who recognized in the 1890s that chocolate bars were going to make someone a lot of money .
Up until this point , most confectioners were local , storefront operations .
The candy was cooked up in back , and sold in front .
Hershey mass - produced his bars and chocolate " kisses " and sold them in grocery stores and pushcarts .
Others followed suit .
Before long , America 's major cities had their own candy factories , to go along with the local breweries and bakeries .
Boston — for a time the nation 's capital of candy production — boasted an entire street dubbed " Confectioner 's Row , " along with half a dozen chocolate factories .
On days when the breeze was blowing right , you could smell chocolate for miles .
The Great Depression ushered in a golden age of candy bars .
Back then , they were referred to as " nickel bars " and marketed as a cheap source of quick calories .
This gave rise to bars such as the Club Sandwich and the infamous Chicken Dinner which featured a roasted chicken on its label ( though , alas , no actual chicken in the bar ) .
The late Ray Broekel , author of the " Great American Candy Bar Book " and as close as America comes to an official candy historian , estimated that , in the years between the World Wars , 30,000 different brands were introduced in the United States alone .
It was this very glut that compelled the shrewdest minds in the industry to focus on building brand names and expanding market share .
Hershey and his chief competitor Forrest Mars set about automating factories , establishing a national distribution system , stockpiling ingredients , buying up competitors and advertising .
Over the past 70 years , the so - called Big Three have bought out virtually every competitor of any significance .
They have also set their sights on emerging markets in the developing world .

The consolidation has left behind some beloved confections .
Consider the Caravelle , made by Peter Paul .
The Caravelle was a sublime marriage of soft caramel and crisped rice , enrobed in a thick shell of milk chocolate .
Imagine a 100 Grand bar — only 100 times better .
Then the Caravelle disappeared .
It was discontinued after Peter Paul merged with Cadbury Schweppes in 1978 .
A decade later , Hershey purchased Peter Paul .
The only Peter Paul bars that survive today are the two most profitable , Mounds and Almond Joy .
While it 's true that most regional companies have gone the way of the dinosaurs , the tradition lives on in places like Hayward , Calif .
That 's where Susan Karl , president of Annabelle Candy , oversees the production of the Rocky Road , a gooey chocolate - and - marshmallow confection first made by her grandfather , Sam Altshuler , a Russian immigrant who founded the company 60 years ago .
One of the nation 's oldest confectioners , the New England Confectionery Company , is still around , too .
Necco is under different ownership these days , and the operation has moved to a new factory outside Boston , but it still produces its eponymous wafers , along with other beloved old brands such as Mary Janes , Clark Bars and the Sky Bar .

Corrections & Amplifications :
Milton Hershey built a successful caramel company before entering the chocolate business .
In addition , Wal - Mart Stores Inc. does n't charge slotting fees for desirable shelf space .
This article about regional candies in the Jan. 30 Weekend Journal incorrectly referred to Mr. Hershey as a failed vendor of caramels and incorrectly said that Wal - Mart charges slotting fees .
When it comes to a long - haul flight to New Zealand , the thought of 24 hours in an up - right economy seat is enough to make anyone shudder .
But economy - class passengers will soon have the chance to lie flat like their envied fellow travellers in business and first .
Air New Zealand has unveiled plans to introduce " beds " in economy class , in what it is calling the first major improvement in economy class travel comfort in 20 years .
Extended seat on Air New Zealand
Developed in - house by the airline 's designers and engineers , the 22 " Skycouches " will take up the first 11 rows in the economy cabin of the carrier 's new Boeing 777-300 planes , and will be formed out of three economy seats abreast that fold out to create a lie - flat space ( complete with full size pillows ) stretching right up to the seats in front .
The increased space could also provide a valuable play and sleep area for those travelling with small children .
For two adults travelling , purchasing the Skycouch will be based on buying two seats at standard prices with the third seat at approximately half price .
Full airfare details will be announced when it goes on sale in late April .
" For those who choose , the days of sitting in economy and yearning to lie down and sleep are gone , " Chief Executive Officer Rob Fyfe told reporters .
" The dream is now a reality , one that you can even share with a travelling companion – just keep your clothes on , thanks . "
The first routes to offer travellers the Skycouch will be between Auckland and Los Angeles from December 2010 and Auckland and London from April 2011 .
All other services will feature the seats by around 2012 .
The airline 's Premium Economy Cabin will also be getting an upgrade and will feature " Spaceseats , " set two abreast ( it is currently three abreast ) and designed so that the centre aisle seats can angle together to allow couples to dine at a shared table .
Last week , I bought a PlayStation 3 .
I never thought I would , but this is gaming .
Things change fast .
You 're +pretty .
+Please+don't+break+my+360 .
It started at the Electronic Entertainment Expo , as these things usually do .
I wastwo years back , the one where Duffy bombed her own Lips song and everyone pretended the lack of a new Halo announcement was no big deal .
Goldstein can sleep through anything .
Then , in between laptop battery swap - outs , I heard it .
Final Fantasy XIII would be released on Xbox 360 as well as PlayStation 3 .
It was the announcement I never expected .
The series that – for me – had come to define PlayStation was no longer a Sony exclusive .
As the trailer played on the giant plasma screens , I tried to picture myself playing Square Enix 's upcoming role - playing game on an Xbox 360 .
But I just could n't wrap my brain around it .
As a hardcore 360 player who covered the console as part of IGN's Xbox Team at that time , I was heavily invested in Microsoft 's machine .
The 360 was my sole home console and I had a desk full of them at the office .
I 'd been an early believer , jumping Sony 's ship when the original Xbox was released .
There was something radical and refreshing about Microsoft 's approach to the console biz , and I dove right in .
That bet seemed smart when the Xbox 360 was released a few years later and the great games started rolling in .
But despite my heavy investment in Microsoft 's gaming platform , something about a proper new Final Fantasy game appearing on the Xbox 360 felt horribly wrong , like dropping a Ferrari engine into a Buick body .
Sure , she 'll run , but the soul of the machine would just be off somehow .
In gaming , we deal with hardware and software , absolutes and ones and zeroes .
In all our talk about graphics , versions , specs and framerates , we sometimes forget that so much of gaming is purely emotional .
Why do we respond to some games and not others ?
Why does IGN editor Greg Miller celebrate the PlayStation 2's birthday every year , complete with cake and ice cream ?
It 's because games talk to us , even if we sometimes can't understand what they 're saying .
I was surprised by my reaction to the Final Fantasy XIII
But the same company that gave me an incredible library of games and the most robust online console gaming experience to date also let me down .
With a wink and a nod , it sold me a poorly constructed piece of hardware that consistently failed me .
The Xbox 360 feels cobbled together .
It breaks down and leaves me with a pile of unplayable games for weeks at a time .
It 's clunky and inelegant .
It 's Microsoft Windows all over again .
And it makes me feel like a fool for relying on it .
But even my disappointment with the quality of the Xbox 360 does n't completely explain my reaction to the Final Fantasy XIII announcement .
I 've been playing games long enough that I should n't be emotional about hardware anymore .
Did n't my personal attachment to game consoles die when the Dreamcast did ?
Or did it just go dormant when Microsoft took over the world of hardcore gaming ?
Microsoft is many things , but cool is n't one of them .
There 's a cloud of insecure awkwardness hovering over Microsoft 's Xbox persona , and there are n't enough Kudo Tsunodas and Ryan Paytons on Earth to change that .
Watching Larry " Major Nelson " Hyrb on Inside Xbox is like watching your dad showing off his new propane grill .
" She 's a beaut , ai n't she ?
There 's Fanta in the fridge if you and your friends want some . "
This is what success looks like .

Jack Endino had only been making records professionally for 18 months when he got a call from a kid in Aberdeen who wanted to make a demo with his band that did n’t have a name and did n’t have a drummer .
What transpired were a pair of sessions that ultimately became Nirvana ’s debut .
“ I was excited , ” Endino says .
“ I was like the first Nirvana fan before they had a name . ”
And although the sessions are now looked at through the prism of the Nirvana legend , to Endino , who went on to become the most renowned producer of the grunge era , it really was just another session .
“ There was no particular drama or any weird stories , ” he says .
“ Nobody was drinking , nobody was stoned , I do n’t even remember seeing beer . ”
SW : Did Nirvana bring a spark into the studio ?
Endino : Yeah , of course .
They were hot to go .
The first time they came and recorded with me — which was January 23 , 1988 — they did n’t have a band name , and they just had a borrowed drummer , which was Dale from the Melvins .
But , yeah , they came and recorded 10 songs with me in one afternoon .
I was left going “ God , who are these people ? ”
The cassettes I gave out just said “ Kurt Cobain and Company ” on them , because that ’s all I knew .
I could n’t remember the name of the bass player , and I knew Dale was n’t actually in the band .
And so it was , like , hmmm , this Kurt guy , I wonder who he is .
Pretty good tape , maybe Jonathan [ Poneman , at Sub Pop ] wants to hear it .
Bleach is being reissued with , on the same disc , a 1990 live show in Portland that you ’ve prepared for release .
Tell me why you thought that show was old Nirvana at their best .
Well , to be honest , I did n’t know this was Nirvana at their best until I mixed it down .
I knew the playing was pretty good .
I knew it sounded terrible .
By the time I was done with it , I was thinking “ This is a really good show . ”
At the end of it , [ Cobain ] smashes a guitar , and it ’s recorded in detail .
You actually hear the audience go “ Huh ! ”
If you listen carefully , you can hear the exact moment the guitar dies .
It ’s pretty funny , actually .
So it ’s a very typical early - 1990 Nirvana show .
Probably about as good as they got when Chad Channing was in the band .
Chad plays drums extremely well on this .
I think people will re-evaluate him .
Because of course , you know , with Dave Grohl following after , who ’s one of the best drummers in the world , Chad really has n’t gotten his due .
He ’s much better than most people realize .
Basically it rocks , that ’s all I ’m saying .
How had the band evolved between the Dale Crover sessions you did and the Chad Channing sessions ?
Chad himself approaches things in more of a pop way .
And Kurt , likewise , was figuring out that if he was gonna be able to sing , he was gonna have to write some simpler tunes .
So the songs that are on Bleach , the arrangements are simpler .
The songs are not elaborate constructions , they ’re a more simple sort of riff songs with melodies than the demo stuff that I did when Dale was playing with them in January .
The tunes a year later were more straight - ahead rock tunes , which is more what Bleach is about .
They ’re kind of riff - rock songs with good singing .
And Kurt continued that direction with Nevermind .
Because Nevermind is kind of the same sort of song structures , but the riffs are even less metallic , they ’re even less punky , it ’s a little more overtly pop , and yet the guitars are still , like , not turned down .
You know , the band did n’t turn down .
They never turned down .
But , you know , the songs got simpler and more melodic .
So that was just a steady progression for Kurt .

It is odd that we still do n't take climate change seriously .
Judging from the acres of newsprint being devoted to the subject right now , you might find that remark surprising .
But look at the furore over the University of East Anglia emails : environmentalists hand - wringing as if the end of the world had suddenly been brought forward ; their opponents crowing that the whole of climate science has to start again from scratch .
Can you imagine this kind of response if the subject of the emails had been something we actually care about , such as health or the economy ?
The discovery of the HIV virus involved one of the murkiest incidents in the history of science .
It 's an insult to UEA 's Phil Jones and his colleagues to even suggest the comparison , but it serves to make the point .
Reporters on the HIV affair always scrupulously stressed that although the integrity of some of the individuals involved was called into question , the evidence that HIV causes Aids was unaffected .
People might have died if the public had been misled on that point .
Whereas if it 's only about climate change …
A colleague working in astrophysics was expressing bemusement to me yesterday about why the reputation of British science was apparently under threat , given that no evidence had actually emerged of scientific misconduct .
Her specific question was : " Has anyone found evidence of an error in a published paper or dataset ? "
If they had , then of course the error would need to be corrected , which happens in science all the time .
If it could be proved that figures had been deliberately altered to give a specific result then it would be very serious , but so far no evidence has emerged from these Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) emails of any error in the HadCRUT instrumental temperature record at the centre of the row , never mind proof of deliberate intent to mislead .
How often have you heard that repeated , clearly , by the mainstream press reporting on this incident ?
Even if they were reporting on Berlusconi 's sex life they would be more careful .
Berlusconi can afford better lawyers than Jones can .
Take , for example , the " trick " of combining instrumental data and tree - ring evidence in a single graph to " hide the decline " in temperatures over recent decades that would be suggested by a naive interpretation of the tree -ring record .
The journalists repeating this phrase as an example of " scientists accused of manipulating their data " know perfectly well that the decline in question is a spurious artefact of the tree - ring data that has been documented in the literature for years , and that " trick " does not mean " deceit " .
They also know their readers , listeners and viewers wo n't know this : so why do they keep doing it ?
What is particularly ironic is that a favourite graph in the climate sceptic community a few years ago entitled " Most accurate global average temperature " did precisely this .
It stitched temperatures from the satellite - based temperature record from 1979 onwards together with the surface temperature record before then .
At that time the satellite record showed no evidence of warming , so one might call this a handy trick to hide the recent warming in the surface temperature record .
Did that make it evil ?
I would n't say so : there were concerns about the impact of incomplete coverage and something called the urban heat island effect on the surface temperature record , so combining the two data sources might have been legitimate , provided it was clear what was done and why .
This particular figure has fallen out of favour since an error was discovered in the satellite data processing which , when corrected , revealed the satellites were actually showing warming after all .
Perhaps the most concrete example of journalists claiming to reveal " problems " with the CRU temperature record was a report on Newsnight ( widely redistributed ) in which a software engineer criticised computer code contained in the leaked email package .
Neither of the two pieces of code Newsnight examined were anything to do with the HadCRUT temperature record at all , which is actually maintained at the Met Office .
Newsnight 's response , when I challenged them on this , was : " Our expert 's opinion is that this is climate change code . "
Presumably , then , the quality of the code I use to put together problems for our physics undergraduates shows that we should not trust results from my colleagues who work on the Large Hadron Collider on the grounds that " it is all physics code " .
Newsnight have declined to retract the story .
One can understand the blogosphere reacting as it has done , but why has mainstream journalism collectively decided to treat the story in this way ?
The bottom line is that journalism deals not in facts , but in " narratives " .
And the narrative of the fallen idol is clearly a great way to fill the airwaves – witness the reality television industry .
So the narrative journalists have collectively decided upon is that a few scientists may have manipulated their data , and either ( a ) it does n't matter because the evidence for human influence on climate is so strong or ( b ) this shows the whole edifice is now crumbling , depending on their editor 's predilections .
And George Monbiot laments that the high priests of his climate change religion have let him down .
All without any evidence that any number , anywhere , is actually wrong .
Journalists , who always find numbers irritating , are revelling in the fact that they are back in the driving seat .
By making the story about the individual scientists , rather than scientific results , they can go back to reporting on the story as they see fit without being constrained by scientific evidence .
This is all particularly painful for those of us who know and have the deepest respect for Jones and his colleagues .
Our instinct , of course , is to stand up and defend his integrity .
But we know that if we do so , journalists weave this into their chosen narrative as " scientists circling the wagons to defend their own " .
The Times report accompanying the statement released yesterday by UK climate scientists was a case in point : rather than simply reporting the boring story that scientists agree there is nothing wrong with the data after all , they had to go and hunt out a " human interest " angle of some scientist who claimed that he felt pressured by the Met Office into signing the statement ( ridiculously – many of us who signed spend our professional lives annoying the Met Office ) .
Even the senior figures in the World Meteorological Organisation are letting themselves get swept along , pointing out that even if we leave out the CRU dataset the evidence for human influence on climate is still strong .
While true , this misses the point .
If we allow personal attacks on individual scientists or criticism of irrelevant software to be used as an excuse to discount data that people do n't like , it will be open season .
Presumably they will be hunting through the emails of someone involved in the Nasa temperature series next , and so it will go on .
None of us can imagine what Phil Jones is going through , and all of us know that it might be our turn next .
For all I know someone is already sorting through my emails on a Russian web server .
But for the record , if they do decide to pick on me , I do n't want people out there defending my integrity .
I want people out there defending my results .
Because we are scientists , and this is what we do .
It is being reported by the German press that Michael Schumacher negotiated his Mercedes GP deal without the involvement of his long time manager Willi Weber .
And by doing so he saved roughly € 700,000 per year based on Webers commision of ten percent and Schumachers € 7 M per annum contract .
This would be a first in a partnership that goes back nearly more than two decades .
We 've had the first televised real autopsy and the first on - screen assisted suicide .
The latest wheeze to challenge the British public ’s attitudes to dying comes from Channel 4 , which is appealing to the terminally ill to find someone to donate their body to be mummified for a reality television show – then displayed in a museum for two years .
Among all the sobering possibilities of how to spend your last days is now a new one , offered by a film production company on behalf of Channel 4 .
It is advertising in spirit magazines for volunteers in search of celluloid immortality .
The ad reads : “ We are currently keen to talk to someone who , faced with the knowledge of their own terminal illness and all that it entails , would nonetheless consider undergoing the process of ancient Egyptian embalming . ”
The proposal from production company Fulcrum TV has received development funds from Channel 4 , who hope to go ahead with the project .
Documentary - makers are working with a scientist in the North of England who claims to have unlocked the secrets of the mummification process , which was popular during the reign of the ancient Egyptian dynasty of 3300 BC .
It rendered the body embalmed or “ mummified ” in the belief that it was a necessary requirement for the afterlife .
The Egyptians were able to preserve bodies for longer than any other civilisation .
Fulcrum ’s TV ’s executive producer , Richard Belfield , did not return calls asking for comment , but spoke at length to an undercover reporter posing as a possible volunteer .
“ We would like to film with you over the next few months to understand who you are and what sort of person you are so the viewers get to know you and have a proper emotional response to you , ” he said .
“ It may sound rather macabre but we have mummified a large number of pigs to check that the process worked and it does .
We have lined up scientists to support the project and found a place approved by the Human Tissue Authority where the mummification would take place .
“ Afterwards one thought was – though this is not obligatory – to put the body in an exhibition in a proper museum so people can properly understand the mummification process .
That is something we would be flexible about .
But we would like to keep the body for two or three years to see that the mummification process worked .
Then the normal funeral arrangements could be made . ”
Mr Belfield said that no payment would be made , not even to help relatives after the volunteer ’s death : “ No not as such .
Of course we would cover all costs .
But the advice from our compliance lawyers is that it would be wrong to offer payment . ”
He added : “ The Egyptians were extremely clever organic chemists .
Some of the materials they used came from as far afield as Burma and the Far East .
One resin they used we know only existed in Burma .
One thing we want to explore is how they developed their knowledge of chemistry .
“ If you would like to think about it over the weekend you can call me at any time .
Let me give you my numbers ... ”
Channel 4 confirmed it had contributed a nominal amount of funds to Fulcrum to help with development .
This sum typically pays for a producer to look into the research and assess the programme ’s viability .
Yesterday , a Channel 4 spokesman said the channel was supportive of the project : “ We ’re fascinated by the research that is taking place .
If the scientists are able to find a willing donor we’d be interested in following the process .
And if you were to question why we were interested we ’d say ‘ If the scientists have solved one of the ancient world ’s most enduring mysteries [ the process of mummification ] it would give us a unique insight into science and Egyptian history and may well prove to have other significant benefits for medical science ’ . ”
The concept has drawn some criticism , but it is not the first to do so .
An ITV documentary , called Malcolm and Barbara : Love ’s Farewell , which showed what some classed as the first televised death in Britain .
It involved an Alzheimer ’s sufferer , Malcolm Pointon , in 2007 , and led to huge controversy .
The documentary chronicled Malcolm 's last moments as he slipped into a coma – he died three days later .
The German anatomist Dr Gunther von Hagens has also drawn criticism for his “ plastination ” of dead bodies , which he displays in exhibitions around the world .
In 2002 von Hagens performed the first public autopsy in Britain in 170 years , to a sell - out audience of 500 people in a London theatre .
Prior to the event , von Hagens received a letter from the British government official responsible for regulating the educational use of cadavers , warning him his performance would be a criminal act .
The show was attended by officers from the Metropolitan Police but they did not intervene and the dissection was performed in full .
The autopsy was shown in November 2002 on Channel 4 , resulting in over 130 complaints .
Others – including some from the medical profession – have supported his work and said projects such as these are vital in demystifying death and the human body .
Mummification :
How pharaohs lived on
It took the ancient Egyptians 70 days to mummify a body .
They first washed the corpse in a purification ritual before removing the internal organs – lungs , stomach , liver and intestines – through a slit cut into the left of the abdomen and chest .
The heart was left in situ because it was considered to be the centre of thought and emotion .
The brain was not believed to be important and was removed by a hooked tool – inserted through the nose to minimise damage to the skull – and discarded .
It was important to dry the body fast .
Each organ was packed in natron , a mixture of salt and baking soda , wrapped in linen and placed inside canopic jars guarded by one of four deities .
The body was also covered in natron and placed on an inclined embalming table so that any fluids would drain away .
After 40 days , the natron was removed and the shrunken , dried corpse rubbed with unguents to aid preservation .
The head and body cavity was stuffed with packing and bandaged with strips of linen glued with resin .
Embalmers used 20 layers of bandages and after the final layer would give one last coating of resin .
Agalloch was an American metal band formed in Portland , Oregon , United States in 1995 .
On May 13th , 2016 , Agalloch announced their disbandment .
John Haughm released the following statement regarding the status of Agalloch : " After being inundated by a barrage of responses , I feel that I should clarify some things .
I take full responsibility for the decision to part ways with the other guys .
It was difficult , well thought - out , and something that had been culminating over the past couple of years .

A team at The Scripps Research Institute has made major strides in solving a problem that has been plaguing chemists for many years : how best to break carbon - hydrogen bonds and then to create new bonds to join molecules together .
This problem is of great interest to the pharmaceutical industry , which currently relies on a method to accomplish this feat that is relatively inefficient and sometimes difficult to perform .
The research , led by Scripps Research Associate Professor Jin-Quan Yu , was published November 26 , 2009 , in Science Express , an advance , online edition of the prestigious journal Science .
" This paper is a big jump forward , " said Yu . " Our reaction is as simple as something you 'd do in the kitchen .
There are many fewer steps than the conventional method .
There 's less waste .
In addition , everything you need is inexpensive and off - the - shelf — including common table salt . "
Because carbon - hydrogen bonds are simple and abundant in naturally occurring organic molecules and in commercially available drugs , they are ideal targets for chemists who want to design and manipulate molecules .
An improvement to current methods for working with these bonds has the potential to revolutionize work done in academic and industrial laboratories around the world .
Bread - and - Butter Technology
Currently , to forge carbon - carbon bonds in place of carbon - hydrogen bonds , chemists rely heavily on a method called " Mizoroki - Heck reaction . "
In this reaction , chemists first must install a halide in the molecule of interest as a " handle , " replacing the existing carbon - hydrogen bonds with carbon - halide bonds .
The chemists then join these molecules with other molecules using a metal catalyst , and then remove the " halide handle . "
" Once installed , the halide can stick like glue , " explained Yu , " so you can join one halogenated molecule with another molecule readily with a metal catalyst .
The halide technique is very powerful and many technologies use it , including for the creation of almost any drug .
It 's a bread - and - butter technology . "
But , despite its widespread use , this technique has some downsides .
First , there 's the waste ( both in terms of labor and energy as well as literal waste ) of the steps of adding and removing the halide from the molecules .
Then , perhaps even more problematic , installing the halide into a molecule of interest is n't always so easy .
" To install a halide , you have to install it at the right position , " said Yu . " You ca n't install it just anywhere .
Sometimes that is impossible or difficult , taking many , many steps . "
So the question arose : Can chemists develop a new method to manipulate carbon - hydrogen bonds and join together molecules without the intermediate step of installing a halide ?
The Search for a Better Way
Over the last several years , many laboratories around the world have taken up this challenge .
Early research in this new area of study ( including papers by Yu ) showed that this goal was possible to achieve under specialized conditions .
However , making the reaction economically feasible and practical for the average chemistry laboratory was an elusive goal — until now .
In the new Science Express paper , Yu and colleagues start with a simple and commonly used substrate , a derivative of acetic acid ( which gives vinegar it 's sour taste ) .
" This substrate is used daily in the pharmaceutical industry and in natural product synthesis , " said Yu . " It 's a major class . "
The team then designed ligands ( molecules that bind to a site on a metal catalyst ) out of simple derivatives of amino acids ( protein building blocks ) .
Because of their specific shape , these ligands guide the metal to break a carbon - hydrogen bond at a particular position selectively , and carbon - carbon bond formation with another molecule then takes place .
To demonstrate the utility and versatility of the lab 's technique , for the study the team synthesized several natural product core structures .
These included a complex molecule , a polyketide aromatic , that is an essential component of many antibiotics .
" The Science paper is the first demonstration that we can actually take an acetic acid derivative and then make a very complex molecule , " said Yu .
" And yet in none of the steps do we use anything the layman cannot afford or take off the shelf .
We call it ' layman chemistry . '
We expect that this reaction and others grounded in this philosophy will find many uses . "

The issue of respect puts many high - end betas like me in a quandary .
Presented with the opportunity to either sleep with a girl right away , or to get her number and date her for a while , one must choose between instant gratification or the risky investment in a new relationship – hopefully , one with lots of sex .
However , if the choice presents itself , one must remember that the opportunity to have sex immediately with a new girl was there .
Even if she did not put out the first night , the very fact that she could have would be a hindrance to developing a respectful relationship .
Women can lose the appearance of value without even putting out too soon if a man thinks he ( or any other man ) could have convinced her to do so .
In this sort of case , perception is reality ; women who want respect have to make it clear that she NEVER has sex until she is in a respectful , committed LTR .
From people who followed a pattern of engaging in few , but serious and long - term relationships : eventual success and happiness in all cases .
From people who followed a pattern of indiscriminate , casual , promiscuous or random sex : confusion , abuse - like pathology and happiness in one case .
Any sane nation will focus on two attributes to its value system : innocence and adventure .
Innocence , especially sexual innocence , keeps us loving toward the idea of family and lets us raise people with high , clean , life - embracing ideals .
Adventure is what we need to be motivated , because it makes the struggle endemic to life into a form of play .
Our modern lives are without grace , without innocence and without a sense of adventure , so we are both bored and cheapened .

I could n't agree more .
Having survived the years when people are most likely to be promiscuous , I can say this : Sample size is n't small , either .
Think about it : you would n't give your friendship randomly .
Sex is a symbol of procreation , which is inexorably tied to love , and family .
Do you want to hand that out like junk food at Halloween ?
If you take yourself seriously , which you should unless you want others to walk all over you and treat you like a used condom , you know that making a decision is the biggest power you have .
And by turning down all that indiscriminate stuff , you make a powerful statement -- and are most likely to find someone who cares about you , not quickly passing physical pleasure .
Even more , chastity AND monogamy together -- by chastity we mean a relative unwillingness to hand it out , and by monogamy we mean one other at a time -- one preserves innocence and a sense of adventure to life , and also keeps oneself uncynical and therefore open to future good things :
I like innocence and adventure ; they go hand - in - hand .
So do love , sex , family and chaste monogamy .
I like the good things in life .
I do n't like the cheap and degraded .
I do n't like the insincere .
Does this make me stuck up , or someone who has self - esteem , values himself and wants the best for himself ?
It seems my only critics are the low self - esteem cases who want to cheapen everything so that they feel at home , because they feel cheap and worthless themselves .
Why aim so low ?
Aim for the skies and beyond .
Adventure ueber alles .

The notorious paramilitaries of the past , the Tonton Macoute and FRAPH may be gone today , but the people of Haiti are once again under the threat of the presence of armed groups acting with impunity .
The use of armed gangs by political actors in Haiti ( and many other places , including the U.S. ) to “ keep order ” is hardly a new phenomenon .
However , over the last several years , as protests against the PHTK government have grown , these gangs have been mobilized in what seems a coordinated fashion .
They are heavily armed , and have engaged in multiple attacks on communities .
At the moment , the spotlight is on former police officer Jimmy “ Barbecue ” Cherizier , who now fronts a gang confederation ( the G9 ) that rules the Port - au - Prince neighborhoods of Delmas and Bel Aire .
As a police officer , Cherizier was implicated in massacres at Grand Ravine and La Saline .
At Grand Ravine , in November of 2017 , police attacked community members inside a school – killing 9 people .
Some were killed execution style , and several appeared to have been shot in their homes nearby and then dragged to the school .
The operation was supposedly launched by police in response to gang activity , but was clearly more complicated than that .
UN units were present but did not intervene .
The massacre was largely ignored outside of Haiti .
In U.S. media , only Jake Johnston of Center for Economic and Policy Research covered the story in detail – in a piece published in the Intercept in January of 2018 .
Johnston interviewed , Rovelsond Apollon , an observer with a local human rights organization working in Grand Ravine , who discussed the connection between the police , politicians and local gangs :
It ’s not just that politicians exert control over the police , Apollon said — they are involved with the gangs themselves .
His organization has interviewed young people with heavy weaponry that is not easy to acquire , he explained , and they said the weapons had been provided by politicians .
“ Politicians and authorities are not innocent in what happened , because they , too , play their part in the violence , ” he said .
The politicians , for their part , have not publicly addressed these accusations .
A year later , the neighborhood of La Saline became the sight of another massacre .
As in Grand Ravine , initial reports made the attack seem like an internecine battle between gangs trying to control the area .
But further investigation laid out the role of the police who coordinated with gangs , allegedly operating with the support of Moise allies .
It is now argued that the motivation for the attack on the community was at least in part retaliation for its mobilization in protests against the current government .
According to a report on the attack following a Haiti Action Committee and National Lawyers Guild delegation , Cherizier publicly admitted taking part in the attack , with his police units blocking roads to keep people from leaving the community .
The total number of people killed is not known .
Many bodies were burned , some left in the street where remains were eaten by pigs and dogs .
The Réseau National de Défense des Droits Humains ( RNNHD ) was able to identify at least 71 people murdered based on interviews with community members .
Cherizier was forced out of the police in December of 2018 .
However , rather than end up in jail , Cherizier has re-emerged at the head of the G9 , a confederation assembled with the support of the current government .
Journalist Etant Dupain wrote last week :
During an explosive radio interview on Radio Magik9 , earlier this month , one of the most influential members of President Jovenel Moise ’s commission for disarmament ( known as the CNDDR ) , Jean Rebel Dorcénat , stated that it was his idea for several gang leaders to join together to form a federation , which has now become the gang named G9 .
He later walked back the statement , and clarified to say that he was not responsible for creating the G9 , but he did , however , advise gang leaders to form an alliance in order to make the disarmament commission ’s job easier .
When the alliance was announced , armed groups rallied in Port - au - Prince .
The police were nowhere to be found – but their equipment was on display .
The Washington Post reported , “ When Cherizier ’s men took to the streets in June , witnesses claimed to have seen them ride in the same armored vehicles used by the national police and special security forces .
Justice Minister Lucmane Delile denounced the gangs and ordered the national police to pursue them ; within hours , Moïse fired him . ”
Dupain ’s article was written in the context of the G9 engaging in massive attacks against the community in Bel Air over the last two weeks .
These attacks have displaced thousands of people , many of whom are now living in a soccer field in Solino .
Cherizier is not hiding – indeed , he regularly appears in the streets , and moves freely despite an active arrest warrant .
Meanwhile , members of the national police have violently protested the arrest of police captain Pascal Alexandre , driving through Port - au - Prince setting cars afire , and even torching the office that archives voter registrations .
This so - called Fantom 509 force has become a frightening presence in the capital , and remains unchallenged by Moise and his allies .
For his part , Moise has responded to the moment by trying to consolidate his position .
Ruling by decree since January – there are only 11 elected officials serving in office in Haiti right now – he has pressed forward with an electoral commission and set of constitutional reforms that would strengthen the presidency .
The electoral commission is devoid of the usual representatives of civil society , and has been denounced by the opposition .
Three weeks ago , the head of Haiti ’s Port - au - Prince bar association , Monferrier Dorval , was assassinated in front of his home just hours after giving a radio interview in which he expressed doubts about constitutional reforms being proposed by the government .
Into this setting the U.S. State Department has entered with the kind of patronizing rhetoric and threats we have come to expect .
A State Department official stated “ Frankly , I have to say I ’m a little bit tired of every group , every opposition party in Haiti saying , ‘ Well , I wo n’t appoint my person , ’ or ‘ We wo n’t have an election , ’ or ‘ We wo n’t run in this until you meet all of my political demands …
That ’s not democracy .
And so we are quite insistent on this , and it ’s going to start to have consequences for those who stand in the way of it . ”
So , the U.S. government ’s position is that the opposition must allow the PHTK and Moise to consolidate its power , “ or else . ”
The U.S. government , it is worth noting , is the chief bankroll behind Haiti ’s national police :
Earlier this month , the State Department notified Congress that it was reallocating $ 8 million from last year ’s budget to support the HNP .
Since Trump took office , the US has nearly quadrupled its support to Haiti ’s police — from $ 2.8 million in 2016 to more than $ 12.4 million last year .
With the recent reallocation , the figure this year will likely be even higher .
US funding for the Haitian police constitutes more than 10 percent of the institution ’s overall budget .
So , as thousands come to the street with vision , with hope , and , for some , in desperation , demanding a revolution of political and economic forces , they face not just the local bourgeoisie and their armed defenders , but the U.S. government , with it ’s bankroll , weapons and saccharine imperial pronouncements about good government .
Pierre Esperance of the RNNDH told Etant Dupain , “ The worst part is that the international community continues to support a government that is in bed with gangs and is responsible for nine massacres in the country .
I have not seen anything like it since the departure of Jean Claude Duvalier . ”
Finally , responding to the State Department , Bob Maguire said , “ This thing about ‘ It ’s going to have consequences for those who stand in the way , ’ well , it already has consequences … .
They are getting shot .
They are getting beat up and they ’ve been demonstrating in the streets for years about the lack of any kind of responsible democracy in the country .
These are people who are already suffering the consequences of Haiti ’s failure . ”
This failure is bought and paid for by the U.S. government .
Senate approves $ 626B
Defense bill
Coming in at dawn Saturday in the middle of a snowstorm , the Senate finally caught up with its budget calendar , approving a $ 626 billion bill to fund the Defense Department for the fiscal year that began nearly three months ago .
The lopsided 88 — 10 vote followed a 63 - 35 roll call in which most Republicans stood back and again forced Democrats to come up with the super - majority needed to waive budget rules before passage .
The measure now goes to the White House where President Barack Obama is expected to quickly sign the bill into law to end the impasse .

As an extra — albeit belated — precaution , interim funding for the military through Dec.23rd was also hastily approved by unanimous consent .
Overdue appropriations bills are a modern way of life for Washington , but this one was exceptional given the level of partisan rancor amid two wars and the fact that senators went so far to allow even stop - gap spending authority for the Pentagon to expire at midnight Friday .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , joined by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , made a final appeal Friday , saying prompt action was needed not just for the department but “ our foreign policy and national security priorities , ” But the Senate had tied itself in so many procedural knots that there was no getting out until Saturday morning .
The real culprit was never the substance of the bill but a bitter pre-Christmas Senate brawl over healthcare reform .
Having the two issues side - by - side created its own dynamic : defense slowed down while the military images in the healthcare debate sped up .
By Saturday morning , Republicans leaders were accusing Democrats of being on a “ Kamikaze ” mission to pass their healthcare bill before Christmas .
Democrats countered with images suggesting that troop - funding has become cannon fodder for Republicans allied with insurance companies against health care reform .
“ Has the Republican Party turned on America ’s military ?
I do n’t think so , ” said Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin ( D — Ill . ) .
“ I think they support America ’s military but they are willing to use them — and use their spending bill — as part of ( the Republican ) parliamentary procedure . ”
Included in the measure is $ 128 billion for wars overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Beyond defense , the bill has also been a locomotive for about $ 13.3 billion in additional spending chiefly to extend jobless benefits for the long - term unemployed whose benefits would otherwise expire .
Highway and transit programs as well as major anti-terrorism provisions of the Patriot Act would be extended through Feb 28th as part of the same package , but Democrats must still contend with a year - end bill to expand Treasury ’s borrowing authority and avoid the threat of default next month .
The House has already approved an interim measure raising the federal debt ceiling by $ 290 billion to carry the government into February , and the Senate will have to return after Christmas to deal with the issue prior to New Year’s .
US workplace injuries underreported , study shows
By Tom Eley
18 November 2009
A new Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) survey reveals that the number of workplace accidents and illnesses in the US is underreported , the result of pressure on company doctors and nurses to conceal or minimize injuries , workers fearful of reporting them , and ineffective government workplace safety enforcement .
Among 1,187 company doctors , nurses , and health care professionals surveyed by the GAO , more than one half said that company officials have pressured them to minimize workplace injuries and sicknesses .
Over one third reported that they have been told to curtail medical treatment so that workplace injuries would not have to be reported .
More than two thirds of surveyed medical personnel said they know of employees who feared being fired or otherwise disciplined if they reported their injuries .
” Workers may not report a work - related injury or illness because they fear job loss or other disciplinary action , or fear jeopardizing rewards based on having low injury and illness rates , ” the GAO says .
Also contributing to the underreporting of injuries are company incentive programs that award prizes and bonuses to workers and plants that report few injuries , the GAO points out .
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) , the federal agency tasked with monitoring workplace safety in about half of US states , routinely fails to interview workers to verify employer claims about their injuries , according to the report .
OSHA seldom audits workplaces , conducting only about 250 inspections of the roughly 130,000 work sites for which it has responsibility .
These audits typically come about two years after accidents have occurred — by which time many of the injured workers have switched jobs — and rely heavily on company log books .
“ OSHA does not always require inspectors to interview workers about injuries and illnesses — the only source of data not provided by employers — which could assist them in evaluating the accuracy of the records , ” the report notes .
Law requires companies record in log books any accident that leads to time missed at work or any injury that goes beyond routine first aid .
But the system is based on self - compliance , and employers have an obvious interest in minimizing workplace injuries .
Reporting low injury rates avoids regulatory scrutiny and lessens the costs associated with insurance and workers ’ compensation , while increasing the likelihood of winning production contracts .
Among other methods of limiting their reported injury levels , company health practitioners report responding to serious injuries with first aid — for example , treating cuts that require stitches with only bandages .
In other cases , employers seek additional medical opinions on injuries until they arrive at a non-serious diagnosis .
“ One practitioner said that an injured worker ’s manager took the worker to multiple providers until the manager found one who would certify that treatment of the injury required only first aid , which is not a recordable injury , ” the GAO reported .
The GAO also reports that OSHA does not examine injuries in all industries , among them eight “ high hazard ” injuries , including ski and amusement parks , Great Lakes transportation , and industrial laundries .
Democrats in the US Congress requested the GAO study in response to widespread skepticism over official workplace injury and sickness statistics , which claim a steady decline took place from 1992 to 2007 .
Academic studies have suggested that official federal statistics may overlook as many as 69 percent of all work site injuries and sicknesses .
Officially there were 4 million reported cases in which workers were injured or became sick and 5,600 died as a result of workplace conditions in 2007 , the last year for which statistics are available .
The GAO report makes clear what workers already know well : owners and management are able to trample over safety and environmental regulations with impunity , and employees have little recourse to defend themselves .
Created in 1970 , OSHA ’s regulatory authority has been gutted by successive Republican and Democratic administrations .
Since its creation , it has realized only a handful of convictions in workplace accident and death cases .
KAMPALA , Uganda —
To many non-Ugandans , Uganda conjures up two sustaining images ;
One , a small , beautiful , landlocked east African nation , once called the “ Pearl of Africa ” by her British colonizers .
The other , a country ruled by African strongman Idi Amin , recently immortalized by the 2006 Oscar - winning performance of Forest Whitaker in , “ The Last King of Scotland . ”
A new image could be emerging for Uganda .
One that would eclipse any other notion and one that Ugandans are hotly debating : one of the few countries in the world to implement the death penalty for gays and lesbians .
This potentially powerful new image could be said to be the brain - child of David Bahati .
Bahati , 35 , is a Ugandan member of parliament from the politically inﬂuential western region of Uganda .
Many here say he is an “ up and coming ” politician with a good pedigree and many of the “ right connections . ”
On Sept. 25 , 2009 , Bahati introduced the Anti-Homosexuality Bill 2009 for review and vote by parliament .
The most controversial part of the bill calls for the death penalty for people convicted of " aggravated homosexuality . "
Aggravated homosexuality is a new term that includes : gay sex with someone younger than 18 or someone who has sex and is HIV positive , as well as gay sex in which the offender seduces a person using alcohol or drugs , the offender is a parent / guardian of the person against whom the offense is committed , or victim of the offense is a person with a disability .
The bill is being hotly debated , not only in parliament , but by human rights activists , gay and lesbian activists and many expatriates as well as average Ugandans .
Uganda already has a law , which dates back to British colonial rule , which makes homosexuality a crime .
Many critics charge that the bill confused homosexual acts between consenting adults with pedophilia and rape .
Bahatiʼs own description of the reason for the bill is " there is also a need to protect the children and youths of Uganda , who are vulnerable to sexual abuse and deviation as a result of cultural exchanges , uncensored information technologies ... and increasing attempts by homosexuals to raise children . ”
Those who support the bill say that homosexuality is un-African and imported by Western countries .
Dr. Martin Ssempa , of the Family Policy and Human Rights Center of Uganda , in an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama and popular U.S. Christian minister Rick Warren , asks them to apologize “ for insulting the people of Africa by your very inappropriate use of your church and White House pulpits to coerce us into the evil of Sodomy and Gaymorrah . ”
Religiously , Uganda is a very Christian country .
It has been described as an “ island of Christendom in a sea of Islam . ”
According to statistics compiled by www.nationmaster.com, Ugandans are 84 percent Christian ( 42 percent Protestant and 41.9 percent Roman Catholic ) .
Many Christian ministers preach against homosexuality .
Julian Pepe Omziemo , a lesbian , is the program coordinator of Sexual Minorities Uganda , a Kampala - based LGBT organization .
Omziemo blames an influx of U.S. - based Christian conservatives for fanning the flames against homosexuality .
She says , “ [ American evangelical ]
Scott Lively was preaching in Uganda [ March 2009 ] ... that homosexuality can be cured and that the gays are here in big numbers and out to get the children . ”
Pepe believes that U.S. evangelicals are pouring money in Uganda and may have influenced the bill .
It is easy to find Ugandans in favor of the bill .
Eriya , a 42 - year - old owner of a popular Kampala restaurant and nightclub said , “ I agree that homosexuals should be hung as they rape children and they are abusing their power and authority . ”
Sophie , a 20 - year - old student said , “ How can people have such sex , against nature ?
It is disgusting that they want to do such things to children .
They should be killed . ”
However , there are some ordinary Ugandans who are more critical of the bill .
Stephen , a bank clerk said , “ I donʼt care what goes on in other peopleʼs bedrooms .
We Ugandans have many more important things to worry about , like the roads , and our economy . ”
Beatrice , a businesswoman , goes even further , “ I think this bill is a distraction !
There are almost no gays in Uganda and if there are any , they are too few to be a problem .
I think this is a distraction for us not to look at the sorry state of our country as we prepare for an election . ”
Beatriceʼs point is one that some Ugandans are rallying behind , especially those in opposition to the government .
Despite the ideological camps , there are signs that some Ugandans are willing to try to understand more about the issue .
Recently , there was a proﬁle of a Ugandan lesbian couple on the front page of the weekend edition of a major Kampala newspaper .
Sylvia Tamale , the ﬁrst female dean of law at Ugandaʼs Makerere University has stated that while she agrees with the concerns that Bahati has about strengthening Ugandaʼs capacity to deal with emerging internal and external threats to the family unit ; protecting the culture of Ugandans and especially protecting children from sexual abuse — whether heterosexual or homosexual — she has some serious legal concerns with the bill .
The biggest uproar over this bill is coming from the international community , especially the U.S. and Europe .
The Swedish government has threatened to pull out both their aid and possibly their diplomatic mission to Uganda , if the bill passes .
If they do so , other governments are expected to follow suit , especially by reducing development aid .
The U.S. and European nations have presented a demarche — a formal diplomatic voicing of concern — about the bill , but , they do not yet say what actions they will take should the bill be passed .
Initially , Ugandan ofﬁcials were stridently against Western nations that threatened to cancel aid .
Responding to the Swedish threat , Ugandaʼs Minister of Ethics and National Integrity , James Nsaba Butoro said : “ We wonʼt trade our dignity for money . ”
However , as international threats to decrease or cancel development money are heating up , there is a deﬁnite lowering of the temperature of the debate by the Ugandan government .
During a press conference this week , Nsaba Butoro said , “ Maybe they should consider life sentences instead of death . ”
“ The excitement [ from the international community ] is premature .
Let democracy work .
...
The position of the government is not yet determined because the bill has not passed , ” said Okello Oryem , minister of state for foreign affairs .
Ugandaʼs religious community is also softening its rhetoric .
The Anglican Church is seen as one of the most outspoken critics of homosexuality and a major supporter of the bill .
Yet , recently the Anglican Archbishop Luke Arombi has also issued more moderate statements .
Uganda 's parliament has taken a break until Feb. 15 , but the homosexuality bill is set to be hotly debated at family gatherings throughout the holidays and throughout 2010 .
Enlarge By Steven Senne , AP Russ Conde , of Kingston , N.H. , fills his truck with gas at a fueling station , in Waltham , Mass .
Americans are now paying more for gasoline than a year ago , and pump prices are expected to stay higher for several months as the nation heads into the holiday shopping season .
Retail gasoline prices chugged higher Friday to a new peak for the year , forcing consumers to dig deeper into already - thin wallets to pay for fuel .
At the same time , natural gas prices also were moving up again and have now climbed 16 % in the past two months — just in time for furnace season to kick in .
The worst part : Supplies of oil and gas are plentiful .
In fact , storage points for gas are so jammed , producers are running out of places to put it and crude supplies are well above average levels .
ANALYSTS : Gas prices should n't get too much higher Gasoline prices are now up 17 straight days after climbing 0.4 cents overnight to $ 2.695 a gallon , according to auto club AAA , Wright Express and Oil Price Information Services .
That is the highest price since Oct. 26 , 2008 .
Prices are up 5.9 cents from a week ago and 14.8 cents from a year ago .
The average retail price for gas was $ 1.686 a gallon in December .
Today 's price will tack about $ 50 a month on to the monthly gas cost for the typical customer compared with then .
It comes at a time when unemployment is at a 26 - year high .
" It 's a wet blanket on the consumer .
It 's something visible you see , " said economist Ken Mayland of ClearView Economics .
Oil prices that skyrocketed to $ 147 a barrel a barrel in July 2008 helped push the economy into recession to begin with , he said .
" Can high oil prices shut down the economy ?
Well , clearly the answer is yes , " he said .
The reason for the increase at the pump is because oil prices have been on the rise , going from $ 65 a barrel as recently as August to $ 82 last week .
A $ 17 - per - barrel increase is worth about 40 cents a gallon .
A year ago , gasoline prices were plummeting as the financial crisis and recession took hold , and demand for oil and gasoline tumbled sharply .
Oil has been moving higher on signs that the economy is improving and a weaker dollar .
The Commerce Department said Thursday that the U.S. economy grew at a 3.5 % annual pace in the third quarter , the best showing in two years and breaking four straight quarters of declines .
Still , supplies of gasoline , heating oil and diesel fuel also remain well above normal .
Meanwhile , the dollar has fallen to nearly a 14 - month low against the euro .
Since oil is largely bought and sold in dollars , investors holding stronger currencies can buy more crude for less .
The dollar rose on Friday , and crude fell sharply .
There was also a dour consumer spending report .
Benchmark crude for December delivery fell $ 2.87 to settle at $ 77 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract rose $ 2.41 to settle at $ 79.87 on Thursday and has traded near $ 80 a barrel all week .
Natural gas fell 1.7 cents to settle at $ 5.045 per 1,000 cubic feet .
In other Nymex trading , heating oil fell 7.31 cents to settle at $ 1.9811 a gallon .
Gasoline for November delivery fell 7.6 cents to settle at $ 1.9432 a gallon .
In London , Brent crude for December delivery fell $ 2.84 to settle at $ 75.20 on the ICE Futures exchange .

Jeffrey Howe 's body parts were found dumped in two counties
A man has admitted dismembering a kitchen salesman and disposing of his body parts which were found dumped in Hertfordshire and Leicestershire .
But Stephen Marshall , 38 , of Borehamwood , Hertfordshire , denied murdering 49 - year - old Jeffrey Howe whose body parts were found last March .
Mr Marshall is standing trial at St Albans Crown Court .
Sarah Bush , 21 , of Pickard Close , Southgate London , is also standing trial and denies murder .
She denied dismembering Mr Howe and disposing of his body parts .
The inquiry was launched following the discovery of Mr Howe 's left leg in a lay - by in Cottered , Hertfordshire , on 22 March 2009 .
Police later discovered his head , torso , right leg and arms at different rural spots .
Mr Marshall pleaded guilty to two counts of perverting the course of justice by giving false information about the whereabouts of Mr Howe when police were conducting a missing person investigation and by dismembering his body and disposing of the parts in different places to impede the investigation .
He also pleaded guilty to intending to prevent a coroner from holding an inquest by disposing of the body in various locations across the two counties .
The trial is expected to last four weeks .
New York ( CNN ) -- A 13 - year - old teenager with Asperger 's syndrome spent 11 days in October wandering New York 's vast subway system until a police officer recognized him from a missing persons ' poster , according to police and the youth 's mother .
Francisco Hernandez Jr. , who has Asperger 's , a developmental disorder that affects the ability to socialize and communicate , disappeared on October 15 , after he thought he was in trouble at school , according to his mother , Marsiela Garcia of Brooklyn .
Garcia told CNN that she contacted police when her son went missing , but received little help .
Garcia said she and her husband took matters into their own hands and posted signs and fliers around the neighborhood , in public areas , even in the subway .
" Nobody told me nothing , " she said .
The teen was eventually identified by a transit police officer in the Coney Island section of New York , after the officer recognized him from the fliers that had been posted throughout the subway system .
He was returned home unharmed .
Garcia said her son wore the same clothes for 11 days , slept in subway cars , used bathrooms in stations and spent most of his time over those days underground .
He had $ 11 when he disappeared , she said , and he ate lollipops , potato chips and other food he bought in subway stations .
" He 's never explained ( to ) me what happened in these days , " Garcia said .
Francisco told his mother he did n't ask for help or communicate with anyone , which experts say is not uncommon for people with Asperger 's syndrome .
The New York City Police Department originally treated her son's case as that of a runaway , Garcia said .
After five days , the police department 's missing persons unit paid her a visit and gave her advice on where to look , she said .
Garcia , 38 , a housekeeper who came to the United States from Mexico 16 years ago , said she became so frustrated that she turned to the Mexican consulate in New York for help , and she said the consulate again contacted police .
The youth spoke briefly to CNN , saying that a transit officer approached him and asked whether he was the boy on the missing persons posters .
" I just said that I'm Francisco and that 's it .
I just went with him , " the teen said .
New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly was asked about police actions in the case on Tuesday , during a news conference on other , unrelated subjects .
He said police " waited for a few days , because obviously ( the missing persons unit ) would be overwhelmed if we took every report of a young teenager not home . "
Kelly said proper protocol was followed .
" I believe that all appropriate action was taken to find this young man , " Kelly told reporters .
CNN 's Mary Snow and Shirley Zilberstein contributed to this report .
A few weeks ago , we asked for the OSNews community to help with some questions we were going to ask Aaron Griffin from the Arch Linux team , and the response was glorious and somewhat phenomenal .
We added those questions to our own and sent them on over , and then we were surprised by receiving not only Aaron Griffin ’s responses but answers from various individuals from the team .
My fellow progressives , I would like you to meet Sam Schulman , author of this atrocious article about gay marriage ( found via the Feministing community ) .
Unlike those silly , silly religious folk , Mr. Schulman has a completely rational , not at all ridiculous argument against gay marriage !
You see , according to Sam Schulman , The Worst Thing About Gay Marriage ( that is actually the title of the article .
I am not making this up ) is not that it defies divine law , but that it does n’t perform the essential roles that marriage plays in maintaining the kinship system .
Note to Mr. Schulman : next time you use the kinship system as the foundation of an argument , you might want to ensure that your understanding of kinship is not 2000 years out of date !
Just a suggestion .
In order to defend his argument , Mr. Schulman describes “ four of the most profound effects of marriage within the kinship system ” , which are not at all archaic and creepy .
Observe :
The first is the most important :
It is that marriage is concerned above all with female sexuality .
The very existence of kinship depends on the protection of females from rape , degradation , and concubinage .
This is why marriage between men and women has been necessary in virtually every society ever known .
Marriage , whatever its particular manifestation in a particular culture or epoch , is essentially about who may and who may not have sexual access to a woman when she becomes an adult , and is also about how her adulthood–and sexual accessibility –is defined .
Again , until quite recently , the woman herself had little or nothing to say about this , while her parents and the community to which they answered had total control .
The guardians of a female child or young woman had a duty to protect her virginity until the time came when marriage was permitted or , more frequently , insisted upon . [… ]
This most profound aspect of marriage –protecting and controlling the sexuality of the child - bearing sex–is its only true reason for being , and it has no equivalent in same - sex marriage .
You heard that right .
Same - sex marriage is bad because it will interfere with society ’s ability to control female sexuality !
And we all know that if women ’s bodies cease to be treated as a commodity to be traded , society will collapse .
Well , I guess the intersection of misogyny and homophobia is n’t purely theoretical after all .
But that ’s not all that Mr. Schulman has to say !
Oh no , gay marriage also interferes with society ’s ability to tell us that certain sexual behaviours are superior to others :
Sexual intercourse between a married couple is licit ; sexual intercourse before marriage , or adulterous sex during marriage , is not .
Illicit sex is not necessarily a crime , but licit sexual intercourse enjoys a sanction in the moral universe , however we understand it , from which premarital and extramarital copulation is excluded .
More important , the illicit or licit nature of heterosexual copulation is transmitted to the child , who is deemed legitimate or illegitimate based on the metaphysical category of its parents ’ coition .
Now to live in such a system , in which sexual intercourse can be illicit , is a great nuisance .
Many of us feel that licit sexuality loses , moreover , a bit of its oomph .
Gay lovers live merrily free of this system .
Can we imagine Frank ’s family and friends warning him that “ If Joe were serious , he would put a ring on your finger ” ?
Do we ask Vera to stop stringing Sally along ?
Gay sexual practice is not sortable into these categories –licit - if - married but illicit - if - not ( children adopted by a gay man or hygienically conceived by a lesbian mom can never be regarded as illegitimate ) .
Neither does gay copulation become in any way more permissible , more noble after marriage .
Whatever would we do without social norms shaming us into unhappy marriages , or into feeling guilty about sex between two consenting adults who happen not to have rings on their fingers ?
Society would fall apart , I tell you !
Why , we would n’t even be able to tell children born to unmarried parents that they are “ illegitimate ” and therefore worth less , or something !
( Wait , did n’t the French Revolution do away with that ?
Now I ’m confused . )
Also , maybe my family is really weird or something , but I ’m in a long - term heterosexual relationship , and they do n’t think that my partner is stringing me along , or feel the need to pressure him into making an honest woman out of me .
They ’re mostly just happy for us .
I guess this means the decline of civilization has already started .
I mean , two people in a happy , monogamous but decidedly non-marital relationship ?
Scandalous !
You may think that after this parade of idiocy , Mr. Schulman has run out of completely nonsensical things to say .
Then he hits you with this gem :
But without social disapproval of unmarried sex–what kind of madman would seek marriage ?
Apparently Mr. Schulman has such a low opinion of men that he thinks that , were it not for Victorian - style social pressures , no man would ever wish to express his lifelong commitment to someone he loves .
If that ’s not misandry , I do n’t know what is .
Also , apparently being unmarried means you ’re not an adult , or something :
Marriage usually takes place at the beginning of adulthood ; it changes the status of bride and groom from child in the birth family to adult in a new family .
In many societies , such as village India and Jewish Chicagoland , a new bride becomes no more than an unpaid servant to her mother - and sisters - in - law .
How romantic !
And also sort of racist .
In contrast , gay weddings are rather middle - aged affairs .
My impression is borne out by the one available statistic , from the province of British Columbia , showing that the participants in first - time same - sex weddings are 13 years older , on average , then first - time brides - and - grooms .
This feels about right .
After all , declaring gay marriage legal will not produce the habit of saving oneself for marriage or create a culture which places a value on virginity or chastity ( concepts that are frequently mocked in gay culture precisely because they are so irrelevant to gay romantic life ) .
But virginity and chastity before marriage , license after–these are the burdens of real marriage , honored in spirit if not in letter , creating for women ( women as modern as Beyoncé ) the right to demand a tangible sacrifice from the men who would adore them .
I guess 95 % of the North American population did n’t get the memo about saving oneself for marriage .
Unless when Mr. Schulman says “ in spirit if not in letter ” he means “ not at all , ever ” .
He also apparently never considered the possibility that same - sex couples are getting married later than opposite - sex couples because they were n’t legally allowed to get married for most of their lifetimes .
And personally , I ’d rather see people getting married older , once they ’re really sure that they ’re ready to commit , than as soon as they reach adulthood , in order to prove that they ’re grown - up or something .
He also goes on for a while about how gay people do n’t form kinship ties with their in - laws , and therefore gay marriage leads to incest or something .
And then there ’s this :
Few men would ever bother to enter into a romantic heterosexual marriage–much less three , as I have done–were it not for the iron grip of necessity that falls upon us when we are unwise enough to fall in love with a woman other than our mom .
Oh dear .
I could write a doctoral thesis on everything that is wrong with this sentence .
I guess at least we now know why he ’s so obsessed with the incest taboo .
And here ’s what will happen if those gay people start tainting the “ burden ” of marriage with their gosh - darned egalitarian partnerships :
There is no doubt that women and children have suffered throughout human history from being over - protected and controlled .
The consequences of under- protection and indifference will be immeasurably worse .
In a world without kinship , women will lose their hard - earned status as sexual beings with personal autonomy and physical security .
Children will lose their status as nonsexual beings .
That ’s right , ladies !
Men have been treating your bodies as their personal property for all these years in order to protect you !
In fact , rape results not because men think women are property and they deserve access to our bodies at all times , but because gay people want to get married !
Also : pedophilia .
Nice fear - mongering there , but no .
Overall , Schulman ’s analysis of marriage is pretty grim .
At no point does he portray it as something that people might actually want , as a means for two people to express their commitment and solidify their partnership .
For Schulman , marriage is simply men trading in their “ dream of gratifying [ their ] immediate erotic desires ” ( again , I really am not making this up ) in order to gain full control over one woman ’s body .
It does n’t seem to occur to him that these wonderful kinship structures he goes on about are the things that many of us call patriarchy or kyrarchy or everything that is wrong with society , and are actively working to dismantle through means completely independent of ( though , of course , favourable to ) gay marriage .
If you ask me , a shift in the definition of marriage from an exchange intended to stabilize patriarchal kinship structures to a loving partnership between equals can only be beneficial to everyone .
Except Sam Schulman , but he ’s not invited anyway .
The Big Picture By Howard Katz
Dec 14 2009 1:39 PM www.thegoldspeculator.com
Right now the financial markets are telling us a story which is so incredible , so fantastic and filled with such opportunities for profit that I am in awe .
I can only remember two comparable opportunities in my lifetime , the bottom in gold at $ 35 / oz .
in the summer of 1970 and the bottom in stocks in the summer of 1982 at 780 DJI .
The purpose of a financial market is to value economic goods .
The successful speculator is one who correctly values goods ; the unsuccessful one fails at this crucial task .
All you have to do is to look at history and you can see that the majority of speculators have done very badly at their job .
Why did the speculators of the day sell gold for $ 35 in 1970 ?
Could n’t they see that gold was one of the few economic goods which had failed to triple in price since 1933 ?
A check with the Bureau of Labor Statistics “ Inflation Calculator ” shows that a basket of goods whose average price was $ 1.00 in 1935 had risen to $ 2.83 in 1970 .
And yet gold had first been set at $ 35 in 1935 and was still $ 35 some 35 years later .
Since everything in the country had close to tripled by 1970 , then was n’t that some kind of a clue that gold also should have tripled ?
But their incompetence is our good fortune .
When the majority of speculators wrongly value goods , they create opportunities , sometimes fantastic opportunities , for us to profit .
And since we have truth and truth is good , it is only right that we should profit .
The key is to be sure that one has the truth .
We know that from the summer of 1970 to January of 1980 the price of gold rose by a factor of 25 times .
You could make 25 times your money – without having to use margin .
Again from the summer of 1982 to October 2007 , the DJI rose from 780 to 14,200 .
You could make 18 times your money .
Yet what were speculators doing at that time ?
They had been fanatically bullish on stocks from the mid-1960s all through the long , painful bear market .
They used to say , “ Buy and hold good , sound stocks for the long pull . ”
And so they did .
And then , after 16 years of losing money , they suddenly turned bearish .
Suddenly they pulled a crackpot from out of the refuse which litters Wall Street , a crackpot named Henry Kaufman ( and nicknamed Dr. Doom ) .
Suddenly the entire nation was told that Dr. Doom ( whose name I had never even heard up to that time ) was the greatest economist in the country .
Whatever he said , one must believe .
What Dr. Doom said in 1982 was that interest rates are going up , and stocks are going down .
The prime rate was then 20 % , and the DJI , as noted , was 780 .
That was the exact top in interest rates and the exact bottom in stocks .
What a disaster .
From 1966 to 1982 the value of the U.S. dollar ( related to real goods , not other currencies ) had fallen by 2/3 .
All stock speculators had to triple their money JUST TO STAY EVEN IN REAL TERMS .
Did they do this ?
No .
Their capital shrunk by 22 % in nominal terms AND BY 74 % IN REAL TERMS .
How could the people of America go so badly wrong by listening to “ the greatest economist in the country ? ”
Perhaps we can gain a perspective on this by considering an equal and opposite error .
Let us shift forward in time to the year 2,000 .
Now the DJI is no longer 780 .
Now it is 11,000 .
The people who refused to buy stocks at 780 are screaming to buy them at 11,000 .
Oh , please excuse me .
Most people were not buying the DJI in 2000 .
They were not buying “ good , sound stocks for the long pull . ”
They were buying internet start ups for a short term profit ( they thought ) .
You know what happened in that case my aspiring speculator .
These people bought internet stocks with the NASDAQ composite at 5,000 .
Over the next 2 ½ years it fell to 1,000 .
These NASDAQ stocks had no earnings .
All they had were aspirations .
They were the wave of the future .
They were as progressive as a Democratic politician .
The only difference they had from the Democrats was that they had to pay for their own mistakes .
At that time , the New York Times , which had just published a book predicting that the DJI would go to 36,000 , was so full of itself that it purchased large blocs of its own stock at $ 40 / share .
Earlier this year it got down below 4 .
They had to mortgage their new office building and take a loan from Carlos Slim .
( I am sorry for bringing you into this , Mr. Slim .
You are probably a very nice man , but you got mixed up with some bad characters . )
My point is simply that the New York Times does not know anything about economics , and anybody who takes their advice is likely to lose money .
“ Alright , Mr. Katz , what has this to do with me ?
I do n’t read the New York Times .
I am living peacefully out here in Podunk Hollow .
All I want to do is to make money in the markets . ”
Not so , dear critic .
You may think that you do not read the New York Times .
But the editor of your local Podunk Weekly News does read the New York Times .
He believes every word , and he passes these words on to you without your suspecting their source .
So you think what the New York Times wants you to think even though you do not know that the New York Times exists .
This is the world in which we live , dear people .
Most everyone is running around obeying the orders of …they know not who .
But they all think the same , and they all act the same .
The larger tragedy here is that the New York Times was once a great paper .
That was when Adolph Ochs took it over in 1896 .
At that time the Times was for the gold standard .
In 1896 , supporters of William McKinley were called gold bugs , and Adolph Ochs was a gold bug of his day .
After McKinley ’s election , the gold standard was reaffirmed by the Gold Standard Act of 1900 , which defined the dollar as 25.8 grains of gold , 9/10 fine ( approximately 1/20 of an ounce ) .
This kept the country on the gold standard for ( almost ) the remainder of Ochs ’ life .
In all , America went 140 years ( 1793 - 1933 ) , and prices came out exactly the same at the end of that time as they had been at the beginning .
But Ochs ’ descendents were small men .
They inherited a great paper , and they are in the process of destroying it .
All of the political and economic knowledge which Ochs had back in 1896 has disappeared , and the paper is now operated by socialists and other reactionaries .
One of the prime motives of today ’s Times is to continue F.D.R. ’s policy of robbing from the poor and giving to the paper aristocracy .
This is why they crow so loudly about doing the opposite .
Socialism ( or a far left agenda ) is their cover .
They are not very far to the left , as they claim .
They are very far to the right .
They do n’t want to rob from the rich to give to the poor .
They want to rob from the poor and give to the rich .
Do you know what the economic crisis of 2008 was ?
It was that the Times ’ rich Wall Street friends might go bankrupt .
What was the Times ’ solution to this “ crisis ? ”
It was to rob the average American and give the wealth to Goldman Sachs et al .
How was the average American robbed ?
Not in his role as a taxpayer .
The much discussed taxpayer bailout of Wall Street never occurred .
The money for Wall Street did not come from a tax increase .
It came from massive printing of money by the Federal Reserve .
Prior to the Chrysler bailout of the 1980s there were never any government bailouts of large corporations .
If you could n’t make it on your own , then have some friends take up a collection .
( This quaint custom is still practiced here in New Hampshire to this day . )
You say that the whole system would have collapsed if the government had not bailed out Goldman Sachs ?
Well , in truth , every failing business is in the process of destroying wealth , and destroying wealth makes the country poorer .
( Somebody ought to tell this to Barack Obama . )
If a company is failing , then the best thing one can do for the whole country is to put it out of its misery ASAP .
The longer it struggles on the more wealth it destroys .
Too big to fail ?
That is New York Times thinking .
No .
Too big to be allowed , while failing , to continue in existence .
And do n’t be fooled by the fact that many of the rescued banks are repaying their Government loans .
They were bailed out on two levels : 1 ) a chunk of cash from the ( Democrats in the ) U.S. Congress .
( The Republicans did something right for once . ) 2 ) a second bailout from the Fed when it printed a trillion dollars in the autumn of 2008 .
It is this second bailout which is bringing in the big money and is being used to repay the first .
That is , on an emergency basis the Wall Street banks robbed us from our front pockets .
And now they are robbing us ( big time ) from our back pockets .
And the editor of the Podunk Weekly News does n’t even have a clue .
What fools many people is that this false news hits most people from several different corners .
The Times influences many sources .
It influences many newspapers in the country .
It influences the national TV news .
You read it in your daily paper .
You hear it from a friend ( who read it in his paper ) .
You see it on TV .
All these sources say the same thing .
‘ EVERYTHING IS GOING DOWN ” And then you know what the truth turns out to be ?
EVERYTHING IS GOING UP .
Think about it .
How could everybody be wrong ?
And yet we know from studying the financial markets that everybody is wrong .
Everyone is wrong , and then wrong again , and then wrong yet again .
As Humphrey Neill used to say , “ When everyone thinks alike , everyone is likely to be wrong . ”
And the reason for this is that they all follow the New York Times .
There is really only one guy who is wrong , but the whole rest of our society is following him like a pack of sheep .
And what is the reason for these outrageously wrong predictions at crucial times over and over in our society ?
The reason ( in most cases ) is that the Fed needs cover in order to be able to print money .
The Fed needs a society which is convinced that there is a “ deflationary ” crisis ( which they have to solve by creating an “ inflationary ” crisis ) .
Just in case anyone is interested in what is really happening , for 145 years prior to the time the Fed was given the paper money power prices in the U.S. were stable .
If the Fed is the nation ’s “ inflation fighter , ” then how come “ inflation ” began at the precise time that the Fed acquired the power to print money ?
If the Fed is trying to balance the forces of “ deflation ” vs. economic growth , then how come before the Fed this country had the greatest economic growth in the world ?
How come the most prosperous country in world history had no central bank ?
As one of this country ’s greatest Presidents , co-founder of the Democratic Party , stated in the campaign of 1832 : “ The people can have a [ central ] bank and no Jackson or no bank and Jackson . ”
Andrew Jackson , campaign of 1832 .
So everything you heard last year was a lie , the purpose of which was to generate public support for the printing of money .
The monetary base increased by $ 700 billion in autumn 2008 ; then it paused in the first half of ’09 , and since July it has increased by another $ 400 billion .
Look at the chart above .
Gold is going up because paper currency is going down .
This autumn gold broke above $ 1,000 and raced to $ 1,200 .
Now it may dip to $ 1,000 again , but if it does , this will be a time to buy .
It will be similar to the gold bottom of summer 1970 and the DJI bottom of 1982 .
Once again , the Podunk Weekly News , the New York Times , the TV news , pretty much every newspaper in the country / world and your friends will be wrong and will lose their money .
They do not learn from their mistakes .
This is the difficult part of being a great speculator .
You must stand alone and see reality as it is .
Harder to do than to say .
Hard to do , but very rewarding .
It takes a different kind of courage from the kind which leads you to “ charge that hill . ”

CHINESE people are so desperate for a son that when baby Pingping ( not her real name ) was born it is thought her relatives tried to kill her by jamming a needle into her head .
Her death would have allowed the parents to try again under the strict " one couple , one child " family planning policy .
The little girl did not die .
Now aged 11 , she had surgery this week to remove the needle doctors believe was the cause of her mental deficiency .
The deputy director of the neurosurgery department at the military hospital where the girl was treated said there was a common belief that sticking a needle into the head would result in death .
Scan
The mother of Pingping said that she intended to bring charges against family members who may have been responsible for the attempted murder of her daughter .
Police advised Yang Xiaohui to keep the needle , as well as a scan that showed the object buried in her daughter 's head .
Ms Xiaohui said that she had been under great pressure to give birth to a son when she married Pingping 's father , since he already had a daughter by his first wife .
She aborted her first foetus after it was found to be a girl amid pressure from her mother - in - law .
However , she went ahead and gave birth to Pingping .
She remembered that the baby barely cried after she was born , and then screamed non-stop .
She ran a high temperature and had been troubled by unexplained fevers ever since .
Five years ago the couple took their daughter to hospital for high fever .
It was then doctors told her that they had found a piece of metal in her head .

An anti-Obama bumper - sticker slogan which seems to urge people to pray for an end to the President ’s days ( in office ? ) .
“ There ’s a hilarious new meme in the wingnut sectors of the internet , ” Gawker announced :
Posters to various message boards tell stories of seeing bumper stickers with the message “ Pray for Obama – Psalm 109:8 ” on the highway , only to look up the verse and find , “ Let his days be few ; and let another take his office . ” …
Anyway , now it ’s a real thing : CafePress is selling T - shirts and bumper stickers , the Christian Science Monitor is wondering whether it ’s “ funny or sinister ” to pray for Obama ’s death , and Rachel Maddow referenced it last night on her show .
However , as a number of commentators have noted , the wording that follows this bumper - sticker appeal is somewhat more disturbing :
Let his days be few ; and let another take his office .
Let his children be fatherless , and his wife a widow .
Let his children be continually vagabonds , and beg : let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places .
Let the extortioner catch all that he hath ; and let the strangers spoil his labor .
Let there be none to extend mercy unto him : neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children .
Let his posterity be cut off ; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out .
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD ; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out .
Let them be before the LORD continually , that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth .
Microsoft 's Windows 7 is blowing the doors off , but the company 's online division continues to piss away a fortune .
How much , exactly ?
Nearly $ 2 billion a year .
$ 2 billion a year is actually a lot of money , even for Microsoft .
And it puts the 3 points of market share the company 's search engine Bing has gained since last summer 's launch in perspective .
( That 's $ 750 $ 667 million per point ) .
In case you had any doubt that Microsoft was buying these share gains , by the way , we now have confirmation .
Take a look at this helpful language in the company 's 10Q :
Cost of [ online ] revenue increased $ 171 million or 50 % , primarily driven by higher online traffic acquisition costs .
In other words , Microsoft bought its search traffic gains .
How much did it spend on them ?
Call it $ 150 million ( most of the $ 171 million increase ) .
Ad revenue in Microsoft 's online business , meanwhile , dropped 2 % to $ 516 million .
Search revenue is part of that revenue .
The search portion of the revenue grew , and the display portion shrank .
But it seems highly unlikely that search revenue grew more than $ 150 million year over year .
Which means ...
Microsoft spent more buying traffic to Bing than it generated in new revenue from Bing , even before accounting for all its overhead and marketing costs .
That $ 150 million also does n't include the $ 100 million Microsoft spent on the Bing launch campaign .
We therefore reiterate what we 've been saying for the past three years :
We have seen no indication whatsoever that Microsoft will ever build a successful Internet business .
And we do n't think we ever will .
But in the meantime Microsoft seems intent on flushing billions of those Windows dollars down the drain .

Maybe , null , and boilerplate code
Published on January 4 , 2010 under the tag
An ode to the Maybe type in Haskell , and a comparison with nullPublished on January 4 , 2010 under the tag haskell
A Haskell novice is usually quickly introduced to the Maybe type .
I think there are many good tutorials out there covering the Maybe type , so I wo n’t be explaining it here – instead , I will make a comparison between Maybe and null pointers .
I also briefly use monads in the end – I will not explain them here either , there already are a lot of tutorials about them ( hint : google for “ burritos ” ) .
I have chosen to compare null pointers from Java – I could have chosen nil from Ruby , or None from Python – this does not really matter here .
Why null ?
Why are null pointers present in almost every object - oriented language ?
A first goal they serve is as “ unassigned variables ” .
I will not cover that here , instead I will focus on another use : abnormal return values .
From the Java HashMap documentation :
public Object get( Object key )
Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped in this identity hash map , or null if the map contains no mapping for this key .
So , null is some sort of “ Not found ” error here .
But wait – they could have used an Exception here !
Why not exceptions ?
Well , I see a few reasons why did n’t use exceptions here :
Exceptions are much slower for various reasons .
They have to be caught again , which leads to very verbose code .
Nobody really likes exceptions .
Compatability with the old Hashtable class ?
I realize I ’m not being very complete here – if you think you know the real reason , feel free to comment .
Anyway , if we look at the type signature , we see a similar behavior in the Map type in Haskell .
lookup :: ( Ord k ) => k -> Map k a ->
Maybe a k ) k a
We see a similar behavior here : when the object is found , we get a Just a , and when it is not found , we get Nothing – comparable to a null pointer .
The danger of null
null is very cool and all , but I think this cartoon from Geek and Poke illustrates its danger :
NullPointerException cartoon
So , while we can get a null back from a function , we should never give it to a function .
A simple scenario
On to a simple scenario , based on a problem I recently encountered .
Given a Map , we want to check for a " path " key , which contains a filename in the form of yyyy - mm - dd- title.extension .
We have two functions here :
lookup :: ( Ord k ) => k -> Map k a ->
Maybe a k ) k a parseDate :: String -> Maybe Date
I ’m using an imaginary , simplified parseDate function here for illustration purposes .
The idea is that it returns Nothing when the given string is malformed .
Suppose we have corresponding funtions in Java :
public Object get ( Object key ) key ) public Date parseDate ( String str ) str )
Here , the second value returns null if the argument is malformed .
Of course - the parseDate function crashes if we call parseDate ( null ) ( as is usual in Java ) , so we have to be careful as always here .
We have the following snippet in Haskell :
getPathMonth :: Map String String ->
Maybe Month = getPathMonth m case M.lookup " path " m of M.lookup Nothing ->
Nothing ( Just p ) -> case parseDate p of p) parseDate p Nothing ->
Nothing ( Just d ) ->
Just ( getMonth d ) d)( getMonth d)
Which corresponds to the following Java code :
public Month getPathMonth ( Map < String , String > m) Month > m ) { get ( " path " ) ; p = m. ) ; if ( p == null ) return null ; ( p == parseDate ( p ) ; d =( p ) ; if ( d == null ) return null ; ( d == return d. get Month ( ) ; d. ( ) ; }
As you can see , the two fragments are very similar .
The superiority of Maybe
Now , if you have written a lot of Java code , you know that checking for null is a vital part of the job , and fragments like the one above are pretty common .
In Haskell , however , Maybe is also a monad – and monads can be used to prevent common patterns in code – in other words , they assist you in the D.R.Y.- principle .
We can therefore write the above snippet again using do - notation .
getPathMonth :: Map String String ->
Maybe Month = do p <- lookup " path " m getPathMonth m d <- parseDate p parseDate p return $ getMonth d getMonth d
Now , the whole “ check - for - null - and - short - circuit ” behavior is defined by the Maybe monad – and so , we do n’t have to repeat ourselves .
I have not yet found a similar way of preventing repeated patterns like this in Java .
If you have any ideas , feel free to inform me .
Also , some kudos to the people in #zeus irc for some things on exceptions .

All Is Well
It was January 2008 when I first set foot in Dubai .
It was a land full of grandiose , landmark projects .
Few cities in the world could match the sheer number of high - rise buildings and skyscrapers being built in the emirate ( more than 80 units over 150 meters high are completed or under construction as of this writing ) .
Shopping malls were cropping up everywhere , and the biggest one in the world , Dubai Mall , was then under construction .
Retail and the service sector were booming , not just from the significant increase of population in the last several years but also on account of the boost provided by tourism .
Needless to say , hotels were flooded with tourists ; occupancy rates were over 80 % .
Lastly , the real - estate and construction sectors were just spectacular .
Stories of investors profiting over 20 % in one day by buying and selling off - plan properties were commonplace .
With such a quickly growing economy , the job market could not handle the demand .
Expatriates were encouraged to fly to Dubai , having virtual assurance of employment .
After all , since the whole world was in the midst of great financial crises and growing unemployment , there was nothing more sensible than to try your luck in the only seemingly immune city in the world .
Early Signs
After a few days settled in the city , one could already notice the signs that something was out of place .
If you wanted to rent a flat , it was quite easy .
Just give the real - estate agent one check equal to a whole year of rent .
As absurd as it sounds , the common practice in the rental market was 12 months upfront .
A very skilled negotiator could manage to settle in two checks instead .
But that was not all .
After visiting the potential property , you had to make up your mind in a couple of hours because of the possibility of someone else being quicker and outbidding you .
There were just too many buyers in the market .
This upfront cash disbursement could not be met by many just - landed expatriates .
Thank God we had the banks to provide just the right financing for those eager to rent a place to live .
Many expats could n't afford to pay 12 months in advance .
Credit made it affordable to almost everyone .
Once the place to live was found , you had to get yourself a car , otherwise you risked being trapped in an hour - long queue to get a taxi outside a shopping mall .
There were just too many visitors .
Auto sales were also booming and there were plenty of car dealerships .
It was a simple task to purchase a car ; easy and cheap financing was always there .
You needed to decide quickly because , again , someone else could buy the last piece with just the color you wanted .
If the price seemed a bit high , well , too bad for you , because there were too many people interested in it .
" Credit expansion exerted a drastic force in promoting unviable projects . "
Living and transportation matters aside , one had to start working .
However , with such an increase in demand and higher workload , you needed to hire more staff .
After contacting a recruiting firm , screening CVs , and interviewing a few people , a candidate could be selected .
Well , maybe not , he 'd already been picked by another company .
Not a problem .
You could go with the second best option .
The new employee would start working as agreed .
All seemed well until , after a couple of days on the job , a surprise resignation letter would be waiting on your desk .
He had been offered a bit more by another firm .
Such a process had to be repeated a couple of times , but eventually a new employee would be hired .
Most likely the same employee would then get frustrated a couple of months later , because his recently joined peer was hired with a 25 % higher wage to do the same job .
The same auction - like procedure could be noticed in the cases of office space and the so - called labor camps for blue - collar workers .
In such a scenario , many companies experienced a lot of trouble in managing and planning their operations .
How is a manager expected to plan his business if the expected demand , according to market data , is to increase twofold in six months and threefold in a year ?
Long - term planning in Dubai was 12 months maximum .
No one could risk maintaining a plan unaltered in such a drastically changing environment .
Anyone who worked in Dubai during the boom period will identify himself with the examples described above .
These are just a few of a myriad of personal stories that lead to the same conclusion : something was not right .
It was a market of extremes .
Demand was so high that two - sided competition was virtually nonexistent .
It was like an auction , a one - sided competition of buyers .
Whenever such two - sided competition is not present , market forces cannot weed out weak competitors , such as badly managed companies .
Consumers had practically no say in the market back then , since if one refrained from buying from a given seller , a hundred others were queuing behind him to guarantee zero inventories .
This hindered the process that forces companies to become more efficient and deliver on their promises .
Whenever the bidding processes , the laws of supply and demand , become so unbalanced , one ought to at least reflect on the matter .
The question that few raised was whether all this demand was justified and sustainable .
The Bubble Gets Bigger
The House Price Index rose 78 % from Q1 2007 to Q1 2008 , encouraging even more potential investors to embark on this buying frenzy .
Their appetite for new developments and projects was endless .
One could flip through a newspaper and read articles about new project - release events where all units were sold within hours .
During one event there was even tumult .
Everyone wanted to ensure that an off - plan property could be purchased immediately .
A neighbor who had just purchased a villa recounted to me that his real - estate agent called him three days later to say that she had a potential buyer who would buy the property at a 20 % markup .
After so much trouble in finally finding a place , he had to decline the offer by replying to the agent , " I actually want to live in this house . "
The market sentiment was that prices could just go up .
Dubai 's economy was sound and strong , according to analysts .
The construction sector was booming and attracting more foreign investors each day .
In September 2008 everything was still unshakable , and even celebrities like tennis pro Boris Becker and Indian actor Shah Rukh were announcing projects worth billions of dollars , and the House Price Index reached its peak at a 116 % increase since Q1 2007 .
Despite visibly high vacancy rates in many areas , new residential and commercial projects were appearing every day with promises of even more residential and commercial space .
One had to drive through the city of Dubai to try to grasp how such a thing could happen .
If there were so many empty flats and offices , why were developers still building more and more before the oversupply could actually subside ?
" Resources are scarce .
Printing more money can never alter this fact . "
It seems that the main motive of buying was quick profit .
Flipping real - estate property was becoming a sport .
Obviously , such patterns bear much resemblance with the US housing debacle .
In October 2008 , Cityscape Dubai , the seventh edition of the already - famous real - estate - investment and - development event , opened its doors to the public .
Meraas Development , a then - new , Dubai - based company , unveiled its grand design for Jumeirah Gardens , a $ 95 billion city within a city .
Visitors were able to see the status of the Arabian Canal , a $ 50 billion , 120 - square - kilometer city to be built in 15 years , for up to 2.5 million people .
And lastly , Nakheel , the developer responsible for the Palm Islands project , in an official announcement at the dawn of Cityscape , told the press it would construct a " tower more than a kilometer high , " which would be unrivaled the world over , eclipsing the Burj Dubai tower .
With such megaprojects in the pipeline , Dubai aimed to be the home of roughly 5 million people by 2020 .
Population stood at 1.6 million by the beginning of 2008 .
Symbolically , the Dubai boom reached its height on November 30 , 2008 , at the launch of the landmark hotel , Atlantis , located at the tip of Palm Jumeirah , the first of the Palm projects .
The $ 20 million celebration extravaganza drew top music , movie , and sport celebrities , and a record - breaking $ 3 million in fireworks .
Pricking the Bubble
It is always difficult to identify which precise event caused the chain reaction that led market participants to face reality .
In hindsight , it could be argued that Nakheel 's announcement of its decision to lay off 500 employees in order to cope with " short - term business plans and accommodate to the current global environment " was one such triggering event .
This occurred a few days after the launching of the Atlantis hotel .
On the following day , the Trump Tower luxury project on Palm Jumeirah was suspended , raising even more concerns that the party was indeed over .
These events paved the way for massive speculation among all parties involved in the construction boom .
Suddenly , panic was dominating the market .
Everyone was trying to figure out how they could be affected and which measures they should take .
Further projects were either put on hold , suspended , or delayed .
Additional redundancies ensued .
Cash , which had flowed freely in the sector , suddenly froze .
Developers blocked payments , which had a crippling impact on the whole supply chain .
Several companies were required to operate in a kind of standby mode , barely being able to cover fixed expenses such as payroll .
The House Price Index depicted an even grimmer picture .
By the end of 2008 it had already declined 8 % over the previous quarter .
It plummeted 41 % in the first quarter of the following year , dropping a further 9 % by July .
Due to the impact of the Burj Dubai development , the price index rose 7 % during the Q3 2009 .
If the Burj is left out of the index , an actual additional decline of roughly 10 % can be observed .
During 2009 , the sentiment in the business community was one of solitude .
Without proper information from government and master developers , no one was able to guess where the economy was heading and adjust their operations accordingly .
What took many international investors by surprise was long expected by the local market .
Dubai World , the holding company of Nakheel , finally came forward and declared it needed a standstill on its debt obligations until May 30 , 2010 .
As Mises put it almost a century ago , " every boom must one day come to an end . "
Causes
The narrative and events above vividly depict all the effects , but not clearly the underlying causes , behind the emirate 's boom .
With a currency pegged to the dollar , the United Arab Emirates ' Central Bank pursued the same harmful monetary policies as its American counterpart , the Federal Reserve .
Interest rates in the United Arab Emirates were kept artificially low for too long , following the Fed in every move .
Reckless lending standards obviously helped to give a boost to the damaging credit expansion .
In addition to the aggressive lending by international institutions to Dubai 's enterprises , the UAE Central Bank and the banks operating in the country also played a crucial role in fueling the construction bubble .
The Central Bank balance sheet spiked in 2007 , reaching a staggering 177 % increase over the previous year .
Although the monetary authority trimmed down the money pumping in 2008 , decreasing its balance sheet 32 % at the end of that year ( still double its size in December 2006 ) , the damage had already been done .
Money supply measured by M3 had an annual growth rate of 29.4 % in the period from 2006 to 2008 .
With further scrutiny of the UAE 's key indicators , we can verify the extent of the malinvestments encouraged by the banks operating in the United Arab Emirates .
The aggregate balance sheet of banks operating in the country grew 31.4 % annually in the same timeframe above .
After the UAE Central Bank 's massive monetary pumping into the economy in 2007 , we may infer that the next great damage was orchestrated by the private banks in 2008 .
Loans extended to the construction sector grew 41.7 % annually from 2006 to 2008 .
In 2008 alone such loans increased a whopping 80.7 % over the previous year .
With all this funding , new projects were being launched constantly .
Nevertheless , with all this supply , where was all the demand coming from ?
In this regard , banks also ensured there would be enough demand available through the usual means , credit .
In 2006 , mortgages to residents climbed 80.1 % .
During 2007 , the increase was 82.1 % .
Finally , 2008 ended with $ 18.9 billion worth of additional loans , 122.8 % growth over a year .
It can hardly be argued that this demand was real .
The United Arab Emirates ' population stood at 4.76 million by the end of 2008 , an approximate increase of 277 thousand in comparison to the year before .
Taking into consideration that a disproportionately large part of the population are blue - collar workers ( mainly from the Indian subcontinent ) , of whom the vast majority reside in labor camps , one may conclude that mortgages were concentrated in very few hands , suggesting the demand was indeed due to investment rather than ownership .
If there had been no credit expansion , people would not have been able to buy on this massive scale .
Without the potential buyers , developers would not have been able to launch so many projects .
Likewise , if credit had n't been readily available for developers , they also would n't have been able to fund so many projects .
So did credit to consumers lead to more credit to contractors , or was it the other way around ?
Instead of trying to solve this conundrum , it suffices to conclude that credit expansion exerted a drastic force in promoting unviable projects .
" Following the Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle , one could clearly see that the emirate 's boom had to come to an end . "
Production and saving cannot keep up with the pace of credit expansion , because production takes time and labor .
The creation of additional money out of thin air does not add to the available amount of goods and services in the economy .
If more credit is extended to construction companies , it does not mean there will be enough steel , cement , etc. — certainly not at prices that make the developments profitable .
As soon as each company starts bidding for the same resource , it will tend to increase in price , rendering some projects unviable .
Resources are scarce .
Printing more money can never alter this fact .
With extremely low nominal interest rates and negative real interest rates ( inflation is estimated at over 10 % for 2007 and 2008 ) , the rational behavior was to borrow and invest wherever it is possible .
A booming real - estate market seemed to be the obvious choice most of the time .
Under these conditions , everyone becomes a brilliant businessman .
Entrepreneurial errors seem seldom while credit is abundant .
Psychology clearly plays a role in stimulating a bubble , but only monetary inflation enables it .
It is difficult not to succumb to the temptation of profiting astronomic amounts in a short period of time .
Resistance is even more difficult if the means to engage in the bubble are easily available at the nearest bank .
In the case of the housing sector , people failed to understand that demand for real estate is only sustainable if the ultimate reason for purchasing a property is to actually reside in it .
Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan would suggest that " irrational exuberance " has the power to escalate asset prices .
He could certainly claim exuberance , but there is nothing irrational in investing in higher - yield projects instead of watching your idle savings lose their purchasing power because of inflation .
In addition to the damage caused by the UAE Central Bank and banks operating locally , state - owned and private ventures from the Sheikh were able to cheaply borrow enormous amounts from financial institutions abroad , fueling the malinvestments even further .
Dubai World 's standstill request on its immediate debt obligations only made the emirate 's underlying complications come to surface .
Dubai's false boom , its unreal prosperity , was based on the illusion of cheap money .
It was based on the illusion that credit expansion generates wealth — that money is wealth .
Following the Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle , one could clearly see that the emirate 's boom had to come to an end .
Further Developments
On the wave of Dubai 's opulence , the neighboring emirates also wanted to diversify their economies , embarking in extravagant real - estate projects , many of which were extremely questionable ideas from the outset .
In Ajman , several projects have been canceled as developers have run out of cash , leaving many investors with deposits paid on projects that may never be built .
Led by Dubai , the construction frenzy in the UAE naturally attracted loads of foreign investors looking to diversify .
In a world still trapped in a major crisis wherein investment opportunities were scarce , Dubai seemed rather appealing .
Although credit expansion did indeed play a fundamental role , actual saved resources were also drawn into the UAE market , further fueling the malinvestments .
A significant portion of those savings will unfortunately be lost , since many investment decisions were carried out anticipating a continuation of the economic scenario of the boom period .
What remains to be seen is the extent of the total damage in the economy .
It is still too early to predict the depth of Dubai 's necessary recession , the needed adjustment for its scores of malinvestments .
Dubai 's government companies and local and foreign private developers embarked on many projects that could only be economically viable under the boom conditions of 2008 .
There are two ways to finance a project , through one 's own capital ( personal savings ) or through borrowing .
If the developer uses his own capital , and the project turns sour , he can either consume his own capital and complete the development in spite of the losses he will incur or cancel the development altogether and take the current pain , avoiding an even greater loss after completion .
However , when a company borrows to fund projects that prove unviable , there is another party involved in the mess .
Numerous developers are trapped in a situation where ongoing projects are turning red , and customers who purchased for investment purposes are defaulting in fear of not being able to profit from a resale or in true inability to meet the payments .
This is all the worse if such a developer is leveraged , like Nakheel .
Analyzing from the perspective of a buyer , pulling out is just the sensible attitude .
However , if you have bought an apartment to live in , it matters very little if the expected value of the property declines .
In the end , you want to live in it .
However , it 's quite another story if you have purchased it as an investment , obviously expecting to sell dear , but are caught off guard with a sudden slump in the expected sale value .
Should you fulfill the commitment and face an unknown loss , or take the hit now and cancel the contract outright ?
In the case of developers it might be even more problematic if the buyer is residing abroad and decides to breach the contract .
What is the likelihood of UAE jurisdiction being enforced internationally ?
Dubai World 's acknowledgment of its financial ordeal is the first step in healing the problems caused by the boom .
Once projects finally start being canceled , as some will inevitably have to be , a chain reaction begins that will lead some contractors , subcontractors , and other parties related to the sector to the verge of bankruptcy .
As hurtful as it sounds , many companies need to go out of business so the economy can readjust and leave only the real , profitable companies intact .
The office - space vacancy rate in prime locations is estimated at around 40 % .
Other sources ' estimates arrive at a total 74 % occupancy rate in residential and commercial space .
Due to the lack of accurate statistics in the market , it is a complex job to reach a precise figure .
Ongoing and planned constructions are set to increase real - estate supply even further in 2010 .
Even if these ongoing developments end up being suspended , the current oversupply combined with declining economic activity will exert a substantial downward pressure on real - estate prices , and there is nothing government or any other entity can do to repeal the law of supply and demand .
And " trees do n't grow to the sky , stock markets do n't go up forever , and high prices cut back demand .
With prices high , a million guys pile in to figure out how to take advantage of all that money , bringing in supply and eventually driving down the price .
No one has ever repealed the law of supply and demand , and no one ever will — not Republicans , Democrats , Communists , or capitalists .
It 's a law of nature , a mechanism many governments can't seem to understand or trust to make things right . "
Jim Rogers , Investment Biker , ( Chichester , John Wiley & Sons , 2008 ) , p. 26 .
Nevertheless , the length and depth of the recession also depends on the monetary policies that the UAE Central Bank will pursue .
If it tries to prop up companies that cannot prosper , this readjustment process will just extend itself or even be completely neutralized .
Another piece of the puzzle is the exposure of banks to bad loans .
" Only savings can allow for sustainable economic growth . "
When someone borrows and does n't fulfill his commitment in his own country , he might get into trouble .
However , in Dubai , expatriates can just leave and never repay their debt : banks in the UAE have very few ways of attempting to recover such bad loans .
The abandoned cars in Dubai 's airport illustrate this point .
In fact , local laws end up encouraging flight from the country since one faces incarceration if one fails to honor issued checks on debt .
In addition to the debt issue , the recession and readjustment of business may result in downsizing , meaning redundancies .
Since 90 % of the workforce comes from abroad , chances are that the laid - off employee is a foreigner .
According to UAE law , if a foreign worker loses his job , he has to find a new position or leave the country within 30 days .
Therefore , a recession in Dubai can also cause a decrease in population , which could have broad effects in the retail sector too , although to a lesser extent .
This scenario is very unlikely to occur in the developed countries facing recession , such as the United States or Spain .
Abu Dhabi and International Investors
There are many lessons to learn from Dubai .
Every investor should know by now that he must do his homework and only invest when he 's fully aware of the reality of the underlying investment .
Many just relied on the Dubai government 's backing of debt and if that failed , well , the UAE government in Abu Dhabi would just step in .
Now that the former has failed and the latter 's extent of help is yet unknown , investors are left scratching their heads to figure out an exit plan .
It will be a fresh wake - up call that profit and risk always go hand in hand .
Unlike Dubai , Abu Dhabi derives more than half of its GDP from oil revenues .
It owns substantial income - generating assets as well as an impressive sovereign - wealth fund .
The means to rescue Dubai are certainly there .
However , Abu Dhabi is reluctant to write a blank check and assume all of Dubai 's debt , and rightly so .
The recent extra $ 10 billion granted by the capital to help honor Nakheel 's maturing bond may have calmed some investors .
Nonetheless , the underlying malinvestments are still there .
Instead of owing foreigners , Dubai now has an extra debt with Abu Dhabi ( though the conditions of this emergency loan are still unclear ) .
In 2008 , the last boom year for Dubai , the emirate 's GDP is estimated to have reached $ 80 billion , while Abu Dhabi's was $ 142 billion , according to government statistics .
It is claimed that Dubai 's government debt is well over $ 80 billion .
While the debt - to - GDP ratio truly deserves attention , most important of all is the ability to service the debt .
Dubai 's assets have declined considerably in value and its ongoing operations ' capacity to generate enough income to pay off its debt is severely impaired .
As with any investment decision , the UAE is carefully thinking through Dubai 's rescue .
Reckless lending by international banks to Dubai Inc. was a major stimulus to the emirate 's debacle .
When everything was going fine , few questions were raised .
Now , after the derailing of the economy , many are left unanswered .
The UAE has never experienced such a crisis before .
It is the first severe economic downturn since the federation was formed in the early 1970s .
Bankruptcy laws are underdeveloped , partly because they were never really needed .
The importance of solid institutions is now clear and UAE 's judicial system will be tested to its full extent .
Private companies operating in Dubai may have to seek legal action against developers , which in many cases might be state - owned or - linked enterprises .
The success of Dubai in attracting foreign capital will also depend on how Dubai courts act and are perceived by the international community .
Conclusion
The similarities of the real - estate bubble in Dubai with those in other countries like the United States and Spain are enormous .
Only savings can allow for sustainable economic growth .
Through inflation , credit flows excessively and distorts the production structure , allocating resources to projects that should have never existed in the first place and paving the way for the ensuing recession , that is , the adjustment of all the malinvestments .
Entrepreneurs can and will make mistakes even in the absence of inflation .
But it is only through undue monetary expansion that the distortion occurs on a massive scale throughout the economy .
By midyear 2009 , whoever flew to Dubai with Emirates Airlines could also have been misled into thinking that credit was not a problem , as one of the airline 's video promos before landing read , " Forget the credit crunch … shop . "
Unfortunately , Dubai Inc. took its own words too seriously .
A 29 - year - old man who claimed he was attacked and stabbed by three people – skinheads or Hispanic males – confessed Monday night that he stabbed himself because he did n’t want to go to work , Edgewater Police said today .
The man , Aaron Siebers , walked into his employer , the Blockbuster Video store at 1921 Sheridan about 6:30 p.m. Monday , and reported the attack .
He said the trio was dressed in black .
Siebers , of Denver , had a deep stab wound to the lower leg plus several superficial knife wounds , according to Steve Davis , spokesman for the Edgewater Police Department .
Five police agencies responded to the scene .
In addition to Edgewater police , the Jefferson County Sheriff ’s Department , Mountain View Police , Lakeside Police and Lakewood Police Department officers set up a large perimeter and began a manhunt for the suspects .
K - 9 units were brought into search for the perpetrators .
Siebers was taken to Saint Anthony ’s Hospital where he was treated .
He received numerous stitches to close the leg wound , said Davis .
Davis said detectives went to the hospital and interviewed Siebers and also reviewed videos from a nearby Target store , which had numerous surveillance cameras .
A review of the cameras showed no attack had taken place near the Target store as Siebers claimed , said Davis .
After Siebers was released from the hospital , detectives again questioned him .
They confronted him with the evidence from the surveillance cameras and his changing stories about who attacked him , said Davis .
At that point , Siebers confessed and told them he stabbed himself because he did n’t want to go to work , said the police spokesman .
Davis said Siebers had taken a bus from Denver to the Blockbuster store in Edgewater .
The surveillance video from the Target store showed him walking from the bus stop to the store without any indication he was suffering from a deep stab wound , said Davis .
Siebers was arrested and charged with false reporting and obstructing a police officer , both misdemeanors .
He was taken to the Jefferson County Jail .
“ If you are going to concoct a story about being stabbed , do n’t do it near a Target store , ” said Davis .

Resolving Bankruptcy Claims
Posted March 2005 .
There are surprisingly many approaches to finding ways of distributing money to bankruptcy claimants ...
Joe Malkevitch
York College ( CUNY )

Introduction
New companies are born regularly .
They represent the optimism of their creators that they can market a product or service better than others .
Such companies raise capital and open their doors , or at least as likely these days , their cell phones and computers .
They might hire workers , rent space , and order things from other businesses .
If all goes well these companies thrive and are successful , but all too often things turn sour and the companies suffer a cash flow problem .
They have too many creditors and not enough money in the bank .
So the company goes bust - bankrupt .
This means that while the company may have some assets , the value of these assets is exceeded by the claims against these assets .
This situation is handled by laws in every individual country .
However , this situation also gives rise to very interesting mathematics .
It turns out there are surprisingly many approaches to finding ways of " distributing money " to the claimants which obey a variety of equity and fairness principles .
Here is a two - person example where , unless the problem is carefully chosen , it is common for the different methods to yield the same solutions .
However , with more claimants , different methods are more likely to yield different solutions .
Suppose E ( remaining assets with which to settle claims ) = $ 210
Claimant 1 has verified claims of $ 300
Claimant 2 has verified claims of $ 60 .
How many different seemingly fair ways can you find to solve this problem ?
More specifically , your job is to find two numbers , the amounts to be given to each of the claimants , whose sum is $ 210 .
Basic ideas
In the simplest form of a bankruptcy problem we have a collection of claimants : C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , .... , C n , with verified claims c 1 , c 2 , c 3 , ... , c n .
The remaining assets E have also been verified and are to be distributed by a " wise person " or judge .
( The letter E is used to suggest the word " estate . " )
If someone leaves a will , it may turn out that the estate is not large enough to make the suggested dispersals .
In this case , we have a " bankruptcy " problem where we treat the desired amounts to be dispersed as the claimant amounts and E is to be used to pay off these claims .
( Later , I will mention a variety of ways that other problems can be recast in ways that either resemble bankruptcy problems or where the ideas used in studying bankruptcy problems provide insight into these other questions .
In the recent economics literature , bankruptcy problems are often defined in a narrower way than I am using here . )
Assume that the amount to be distributed is strictly less than the amount which is being claimed .
Thus , c 1 + c 2 + c 3 + .... + c n > E .
We would like to be able to advise the judge about how to distribute the money using the best insights about fairness and equity principles .
We are assuming that the claimants are isolated from each other and do not " bargain " or " negotiate " with each other regarding the amounts they might get from the judge .
One can imagine that one could have a " game " where the claimants would get nothing if they could not agree how to split the estate , but if they could agree to share all of E in some way , they would be collectively allocated this amount .
In this type of situation negotiations among the claimants would be required .
Total equality
Perhaps the first approach to solving equity problems is to treat individuals with " total equality . "
It is this thought that governs the famous dictum with regard to voting : " one person , one vote . "
If we do this in our example , we take the estate E , which amounts to $ 210 and divide by 2 , giving $ 105 .
This amount would be given to each of the claimants .
This may seem strange because we are not taking into account the size of the claims to get this value , only the number of claimants and the value of E being used .
In particular , for the numbers here this means giving Claimant 2 more than he / she claimed !
Can you think of a real world situation where this might actually be reasonable ?
Should we decide that the above method is unreasonable , we might adopt the following second method : Equalize the claims of the claimants as much as possible but never give a claimant more than is requested .
This notation of solving a bankruptcy has very old roots , having been in essence suggested by the great medieval philosopher Moses Maimonides ( 1135 - 1204 ) ( often referred to only as Maimonides or as Rambam ) .
The method of Maimonides
In modern mathematical terminology what we have here is a constrained optimization problem .
Our desire is to make the amount given to each of the claimants as equal as possible but not to have any claimant receive more than his / her claim .
This means in the mathematical formulation that certain inequalities would have to hold for a solution .
Here is a geometrical way to solve this kind of problem easily without converting it to highly symbolic mathematical form .
Imagine that the money in the estate to be distributed is a blue fluid .
We begin to fill up two " bins " or " tanks " of size 300 and 60 ( the claim sizes ) with a small bit of fluid in each , keeping the amounts as equal as possible , as illustrated in Figure 1 below .
Remember that the size of the tanks corresponds to the size of the claims .
Figure 1 Figure 1
We keep filling the two containers equally until we fill up the smaller of the two bins , which amounts to completely filling this claim .
The situation is now as shown in Figure 2 below :
Figure 2 Figure 2
How much of the estate has been used up at this stage ?
The answer is 2 ( 60 ) or $ 120 .
This leaves $ 210 - $ 120 = $ 90 to distribute and this all goes to Claimant 1 since the complete claim of Claimant 2 has been met .
Since $ 60 + $ 90 is $ 150 the final settlement gives Claimant 1 $ 150 and Claimant 2 $ 60 .
Figure 3 shows this solution :
Figure 3 Figure 3
This geometric approach works very well for a large number of claimants .
Typically the claim of the smallest claimant can be fulfilled and then if there is more " estate fluid " to distribute this is done until the next smallest claimant 's claim is fulfilled .
The process continues until all the estate " fluid " is gone .
Loss methods
Are you happy with the Maimonides solution to the bankruptcy problem ?
Unlike the total equality solution , it takes into account the size of the claims .
However , let us look , for example , at how much of what each claimant hoped for , failed to get recovered .
For C 2 this amount is 0 , while for C 1 this amount is $ 150 .
This does not seem to spread the pain of " loss " very fairly .
How much do the claimants collectively lose ?
Since E = $ 210 and the claimants are claiming $ 300 and $ 60 respectively , the loss L = $ 360 - $ 210 = $ 150 .
This notion suggests a new method .
Why not spread the loss equally ?
This would mean assigning a loss of $ 75 to each claimant .
For C 1 this amounts to giving him / her $ 300 - $ 75 or $ 225 , while for C 2 this amounts to giving him / her $ 60 - $ 75 = - $ 15 !
Although $ 225 + ( - $ 15 ) adds to $ 210 , the amount E the judge must distribute , something seems wrong here !
The problem is that Claimant 2 is being asked to " subsidize " the settlement .
The - $ 15 that Claimant 2 coughs up is given to Claimant 1 along with all of the $ 210 available to the judge .
This total of $ 225 makes it possible to cut Claimant 2's loss to $ 75 , which is equal to that of Claimant 1 .
However , many people will consider this unfair because the pain of Claimant 2 is made worse by having to subsidize the settlement .
( Can you think of a real world situation where it might not seem totally unreasonable to ask players to subsidize the settlement of the bankruptcy to achieve some goal ? )
Like the contrast between " total equality " and Maimonides , one can consider the analogue for loss of Maimonides .
The idea is to equalize loss as much as possible without any claimant 's loss becoming negative as a result .
To do this we must reduce the loss of the player with the largest claim to that of the person with the second largest claim , if this is possible .
In this case , if we give C 1 $ 210 this will bring his loss to only $ 90 ; to reduce the loss further requires more money than is available in E .
Thus , we accept the solution of c 1 = $ 210 and c 2 = $ 0 .
Suppose we have three claimants with claims of $ 100 , $ 80 , and $ 60 , and there is an estate E of $ 210 .
We can give $ 20 to the first claimant reducing his / her he " current loss " to $ 80 .
Now we can give $ 20 to each of claimants 1 and 2 which reduces all the claimants to a current loss of $ 60 .
At this point $ 60 of the estate has been used .
This leaves $ 210 - $ 60 = $ 150 .
By giving each claimant $ 50 of this we can equalize the losses .
Thus Claimant 1 gets $ 90 , Claimant 2 gets $ 70 and Claimant 3 gets $ 50 .
These numbers add to $ 210 as required and give each claimant a loss of $ 10 .
Of course , in this problem one can also conceptualize as follows .
Since the claims are $ 240 , and E = $ 210 , each claimant of the three will sustain a loss of $ 10 .
This means that $ 10 less than each claim is given to the claimant .
Proportional methods
Another natural approach to settling a bankruptcy is to award the claimants an amount proportional to their claims .
This would entail in our prime example giving C 1 the amount ( 300/360 ) ( 210 ) = $ 175 and C 2 the amount ( 60/360 ) ( 210 ) = $ 35 .
This seems a very natural approach because it uses the size of the claims to decide how to divide what is given to each claimant .
We might also look at settling the bankruptcy by proportionality of loss .
The loss in this example is $ 150 .
Computing C 1 's loss we get ( 5/6 ) ( 150 ) = $ 125 and C 2 's loss would be ( 1/6 ) ( 150 ) = $ 25 .
Thus , we would have c 1 = $ 300 - $ 125 = $ 175 and c 2 = $ 60 - $ 25 = $ 35 .
This is the same solution as when we assign the gains proportionally .
Is this an accident ?
No !
We can use a bit of algebra to see that this result holds in general .
This is a nice example of how algebra can be used to prove a result which one might intuit is true by examples but requires the algebra to show that it is true in general .
In fact , it turns out that one of the reasons that proportionality is an appealing approach to settling bankruptcy problems is that a variety of different points of view lead to the same solution .
For example , another perspective on solving bankruptcy is to pay each claimant a fixed amount on each dollar for the claimant 's loss .
( Often after a fire destroys property , one hears that the insurance company paid off the losses that were incurred , for a certain amount per dollar . )
For example , one might hear that a settlement involved paying 10 cents on the dollar .
How can one determine the fixed equal percentage that claimants can get for our example ?
Suppose we let x represent that fixed percentage .
Then we have that
Since ( 7/12 ) ( 300 ) = $ 175 , and ( 7/12 ) ( 60 ) = $ 35 we see that the proportional solution gives the same solution as the " fixed percentage on the dollar " solution for this example .
This situation is again not an accident ; it holds in general .
I few years ago I developed what appears to be a new viewpoint which leads to the proportional solution .
Since the amount E is not enough to pay off the bankruptcy , one might adopt the following point of view : Instead of giving the claimants less than they are entitled to now , one can postpone paying them off and wait until the available money E grows , by investing it at the current interest rate until the invested amount plus interest totals the amount being claimed .
The judge at this future point in time would pay off each claimant his / her full amount .
Using the well - known accounting principle of computing the present value of this future asset we can see what amount of money this approach would yield each claimant today .
If one does the algebra involved , one sees that the solution is the same as the proportional solution .
Further insights stem from thinking about the consequences of changing interest rates when one looks at bankruptcy from a time versus money tradeoff viewpoint .
After all , interest rates do not stay constant for long .
More solution concepts
Having seen so many different approaches to settling bankruptcies , it might seem that we had exhausted the intuitively appealing ways to solve such problems .
In fact , this turns out not to be true .
Here are a few more interesting approaches to these questions .
Shapley Value
Another important solution idea for bankruptcy problems is based on a truly central solution concept for n-person games that is due to Lloyd Shapley , and is known as the Shapley Value .
There are various ways to think of the Shapley Value but here I will work out an example which involves three rather than two claimants to make the ideas for one approach clearer .
Assume that the claims are $ 120 , $ 60 , and $ 30 respectively , and the size E of the estate is $ 150 .
Imagine that the judge announces that the claimants should line up to get a share of the funds .
Suppose the claimants form a line in front of the judge in the order C 1 C 2 C 3 .
Now what will the judge do with the line in front of her ?
She gives out the money being claimed for as long as the money that she has lasts .
Thus , for the order above she gives the first claimant $ 120 , the claimant C 2 $ 30 , because this is all of the $ 60 claim that can still be met , and the third claimant gets nothing because the funds are exhausted .
Now it hardly seems fair to reward the particular line which formed in front of the judge , perhaps reflecting the speed with which the claimants mobilized themselves .
However , we can consider all possible lines that might have formed , and use as the settlement the average of the amounts that claimant gets , where the average is taken over all of the line orders that might appear in front of the judge .
Since there are 3 claimants , there are 6 different orders that the claimants might have formed in front of the judge .
The table below shows the results of distributing the money for these 6 orders , and then averaging ( taking the mean ) over all 6 cases .
C 1 C 2 C 3 C 1 C 2 C 3 120 30 0 C 1 C 3 C 2 120 0 30 C 2 C 1 C 3 90 60 0 C 2 C 3 C 1 60 60 30 C 3 C 1 C 2 120 0 30 C 3 C 2 C 1 60 60 30 Mean $ 95 $ 35 $ 20
While the Shapely Value can be found relatively easily for small games , the computational work for large games is considerable .
What solution does the Shapely Value give for the two - person example that we have been using all along ?
The table for this case is shown below :
C 1 C 2 C 1 C 2 210 0 C 2 C 1 150 60 Mean $ 180 $ 30
Finally , let us jump from the relatively recent Shapley Value to a solution concept that goes back hundreds of years .
This solution idea is discussed in a " document " known as the Babylonian Talmud , which initially consisted of oral materials handed down from one generation to another .
( There is also a Jerusalem Talmud . ) .
It was Barry O'Neil who called attention in modern times to the fact that the Babylonian Talmud treats various examples of bankruptcy problems .
In modern accounts the technique described in the Talmud has come to be known as the contested garment rule , since the method was applied to a situation where two individuals claimed portions of a single garment .
How does the contested garment rule work ?
The basic idea is that depending on the amounts of the claims and size of E , sometimes one or both of the claimants can argue that some of the money " belongs " to that claimant .
For example , in our situation Claimant 1 goes to the judge and says , since the only other claimant is only asking for $ 60 and you have $ 210 available , $ 150 of your $ 210 should be awarded to me .
Suppose we refer to this $ 150 as Claimant 1's " uncontested " claim against Claimant 2 .
Claimant 2 might try to argue in a similar vein , but in this case since Claimant 1 is claiming $ 300 , Claimant 2 has no non-zero uncontested claim against Claimant 1 .
Now there remains $ 60 that both are claiming .
Thus , the judge splits this amount equally between them .
Hence , Claimant 1 gets $ 150 + $ 30 = $ 180 and Claimant 2 gets $ 0 + $ 30 = $ 30 .
On first hearing this seems like a strange approach but it also has a certain appeal !
( Suppose Claimant 1 and Claimant 2 claim respectively $ 100 and $ 80 and E = $ 140 .
Claimant 1's uncontested claim against Claimant 2 is $ 60 , while Claimant 2's uncontested claim against Claimant 1 is $ 40 .
Hence , the total of uncontested claims is $ 60 + $ 40 which means there is $ 40 remaining that both claim .
The judge splits this evenly .
Claimant 1 gets $ 60 + $ 20 = $ 80 and Claimant 2 gets $ 40 + $ 20 = $ 60 . )
It may not even be obvious that the sum of the uncontested claims is always less than the amount E but it always will be .
To help understand the contested garment rule better let us use a bit of analytical geometry ( Figure 4 ) .
Suppose we plot along the horizontal axis the amount we might give to Claimant 1 and along the vertical axis the amount we might give to Claimant 2 .
We introduce coordinates with A having the coordinates ( 0 , 0 ) .
There are some obvious rationality constraints that must be imposed .
The amount given Claimant 1 must be less than or equal to $ 300 and the amount given to Claimant 2 must be less than or equal to $ 60 .
These requirements involve the segments FG and GC in our diagram below .
These two conditions are sometimes referred to as " individual rationality " constraints .
There is also an efficiency condition or group rationality condition , namely , that we must give away to the claimants collectively $ 210 .
This is represented by the line segment EB .
The points where both individual rationality below FG and to the left of GC and group rationality hold are indicated by the red segment .
Point J represents the midpoint of the red segment .
This point corresponds to the contested garment solution in this example .
One can prove that this will hold in general .
The points in red are known to game theorists as the core points for when one treats this bankruptcy problem as a " game . "
Figure 4 Figure 4
Notice that the contested garment rule in this two - claimant example gives the same solution as the Shapley Value .
This is not an accident .
The two solutions will always coincide for two claimants .
A mathematical detective story
One of the most interesting episodes in the modern understanding of bankruptcy problems arises from a detective story related to the ideas in the preceeding discussion concerning bankruptcy ideas originating in the Talmud .
Robert Aumann and Michael Maschler , Israeli game theorists , were the mathematical detectives in this case .
Biblical scholars presented them with the issue of explaining the data in the following table .
The source of the data is the Talmud .
Note there are three questions where the size of the claims are held fixed ( columns ) but the size of the estate varies from 100 , to 200 , and then to 300 ( rows ) .
The Talmud offers the numbers in the " body " of the table as the proposed answers .
Claim 100 200 300 Estate 100 33 1/3 33 1/3 33 1/3 200 50 75 75 300 50 100 150
The biblical scholars could make sense of the first and last lines of the table but were puzzled by the middle line .
What was the method being used here ?
Was there a " copying error ? "
Over the years had some data been changed which resulted in the second line 's being erroneous ?
The story is that initially Aumann and Maschler did not see how to explain the second line .
However , to avoid a hasty conclusion they had a game theory package compute different solutions to various games .
To their surprise one of the solution concepts coincided with the second line !
This solution concept is known as the nucleolus .
The original definition of nucleolus was given in 1969 by David Schmeidler , who did his doctoral work at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and now is at Ohio State University .
It grows in a natural way out of solution concepts of n-person games which for general games are rather complex .
It seemed unlikely that early scholars were using these ideas as far back as when the Babylonian Talmud was put together .
Aumann and Maschler realized that perhaps there was an approach to the nucleolus for the special class of games that arose in bankruptcy problems that would have made it possible to solve them with a clever use of arithmetic skills .
Eventually they found a line of reasoning that did just that .
The place they began was in the Middle Ages , when thoughts about bankruptcy centered not around the use of the proportional solution but along the lines of the contested garment rule .
They knew that Maimonides and other scholars were concerned with both the gain and loss that a claimant received .
Aumann and Maschler realized that viewed through a modern perspective , for every solution concept that involved gain there was a " dual " method which involved loss .
What Aumann and Maschler accomplished represented new mathematics in several ways .
First , they discovered a new way to characterize the nucleolus as it applied to bankruptcy games .
Theorem :
The nucleolus of a bankruptcy game divides the estate E among the claimants in such a way that the amount given to any two players can be computed as the contested garment solution of the two - player bankruptcy problem with the original claims of these players and using as an estate the amount given to these two individuals .
Next , Aumann and Maschler found an algorithm that finds the amounts to give each claimant which satisfy the property stated in the theorem .
This method , which was previously unknown , has the property that for bankruptcy games , it computes the nucleolus in a way that could have been carried out by people who posed the bankruptcy problems found in the Babylonian Talmud .
Here is the algorithm found by Aumann and Maschler , which can be applied to the case of any number of claimants .
Step 1 .
Divide each of the claims by two , and use the Maimonides method to fill these ( divided ) claims .
If the estate is exhausted , the algorithm terminates ; otherwise go to step 2 .
Step 2 .
Use the Maimonides loss method and the remaining amount from the estate to pay off the other half of the claims .
Here is an example :
We have three claimants C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 whose claims are $ 180 , $ 90 , and $ 30 respectively .
The value of the estate E is $ 240 .
First , we divide the claims in half , and apply Maimonides ' method .
Since the claims are $ 90 , $ 45 and $ 15 , whose sum is $ 150 , we can meet all of these claims with $ 240 , leaving $ 90 left to try to equalize losses for the amounts of $ 90 , $ 45 , and $ 15 .
To do this we first bring down Claimant 1's loss to $ 45 by giving this claimant $ 45 .
We now must try to bring Claimant 1 and Claimant 2's loss down to the same level as Claimant 3 .
This can not be accomplished but we can reduce the losses further by giving each of Claimant 1 and Claimant 2 an additional $ 22.50 .
Hence , we give Claimant 1 $ 90 + $ 45 + $ 22.50 = $ 157.50 , Claimant 2 $ 45 + $ 22.50 = $ 67.50 and Claimant 3 $ 15 .
This accounts for $ 240 as required .
To check that this result is consistent with the contested garment rule for pairs of claimants we need to check three different problems :
a. Claimant 1 $ 180 , Claimant 2 $ 90 and E = $ 225
b. Claimant 1 $ 180 , Claimant 3 $ 30 and E = $ 172.50
c. Claimant 2 $ 90 , Claimant 3 $ 30 and E = $ 82.50 .
Let us check one of these cases , say , b .
Claimant 1's uncontested claim against Claimant 3 is $ 142.50 and Claimant 3's uncontested claim against Claimant 1 is $ 0 .
Thus , the judge has left $ 30 to split between the two , resulting in the settlement of Claimant 1 getting $ 157.50 and Claimant 2 getting $ 15 .
You should check that , amazingly , the other two cases can be verified as well .
Thus , with this very simple to understand approach , we can find a solution to a bankruptcy situation with any number of claimants , so that the amounts given to pairs of players split as required by the contested garment rule with the original claims of this pair !
To convert a bankruptcy problem to a game it is necessary to represent the game in one of a variety of ways .
One standard way to represent a game is to specify for each coalition of players that might act together , what the payoff would be to that coalition .
This form of representation for a game goes back to John Von Neumann , one of the pioneers with Oskar Morgenstern of the modern form of game theory .
It was in this form that Aumann and Maschler realized the key role that the nucleolus played .
Based on their seminal work of 20 years ago and that of O'Neil , other scholars have significantly extended our insights into bankruptcy games and related problems .
For example , one can think of taxation collection as a bankruptcy problem .
Thus , if the government needs to raise $ E by taxation and there are " income classes " which have wealth to be taxed that have a sum greater than E , the amount of tax to be collected from each class plays the role of the amounts assigned to the claimants in a bankruptcy situation !!
Axiomatics
When people think of the power of axiom systems they invariably think of Euclid 's Elements .
The Elements set in motion a mathematical paradigm where , starting from a few basic undefined terms and rules ( axioms ) , a large system of theorems was deduced using basic ideas of logic .
It was one of the great milestones in intellectual history when Janos Bolyai and N. Lobachevsky independently showed that substituting a different axiom for Euclid 's famous parallel postulate resulted in an alternative geometric world to Euclidean geometry .
Another such milestone was achieved by Kenneth Arrow , educated as an undergraduate mathematics major at City College ( now a part of City University of New York ) .
He went on to study mathematically related areas at Columbia University under the direction of Harold Hoteling and Abraham Wald .
Arrow 's axiomatic work involved voting and election decision systems .
Before Arrow , more or less , scholars had sought appealing election and voting methods which they hoped to show had desirable properties .
Kenneth Arrow turned the situation on its head by writing down appealing fairness axioms and examining which election and voting methods obeyed his axioms .
He showed that based on some reasonable assumptions there was no method that obeyed all the desirable conditions .
Equally important , he inspired other workers to find fairness principles ( axioms ) which were uniquely obeyed by particular methods .
This pattern of moving from intuitively appealing algorithms or techniques for solving fairness problems to finding axioms that characterize individual methods has become standard methodology .
This approach has been followed for apportionment problems , fair division problems , bargaining problems ( game theory solution concepts in general ) , and bankruptcy .
New fairness principles to study are being developed all the time and new characterizations of important methods are being found .
Here are some examples of the kinds of fairness conditions that one might want a method that solves a bankruptcy problem to obey :
a. Symmetry
If two claimants have identical claims , then they should get identical amounts in the settlement of their claims .
Comment :
This means that one is not taking into account , for example , the relative wealth of the claimants .
A poor claimant with a large claim will get treated the same as a wealthy claimant with the same size claim .
b. Estate monotonicity
If a bankruptcy problem is solved for an estate size and a particular set of claims , and another bankruptcy problem is solved where the claims are the same size as in the first case , but the estate is now larger , then the amounts given to each claimant must be at least as large in the second case as in the first .
Comment :
As the estate grows and the claims stay fixed , the amount that a claimant gets should never go down .
It does seem reasonable that a claimant 's settlement might not go up just because the estate increased in size from a small estate .
c. Newly found funds
Suppose we divide the estate E into two parts E ' and E " where E = E ' + E " .
Suppose we use our rule to settle the claims using E ' as the estate , and then we use the same rule to settle these same claims using E " .
We would like the method when applied to E to give the same result as adding the results of applying the rule to E ' and E " separately .
d. Claimant splitting
Suppose we have a pair of partners who collectively claim $ 1000 .
Suppose further that these partners submit separate claims of $ 600 and $ 400 .
We would like the bankruptcy solution not to give the split claimants more than the original claimant would have gotten .
( A similar issue applies if groups of claimants who merge their claims do collectively better . )
Comment :
If this axiom does not apply , it tempts claimants either to form one claimant from a group of claimants or to split into a group of claimants , in the hopes of getting more by this action .
Consider , for example , an estate of 40 to be split among individual claims of 100 , 30 , 10 .
Using Maimonides one sees that these claimants get 15 , 15 , and 10 respectively .
However , if the person claiming 30 can argue that in fact there are separate claims of 20 and 10 , and thus four claimants with 100 , 20 , 10 , and 10 , the " split claimant " gets more .
Thus , Maimonides ' method settles these claims at 10 , 10 , 10 , and 10 and the " split claimant " gets 20 instead of 15 .
William Thomson of the Department of Economics at Rochester University has collected and analyzed a great variety of different axioms that can be applied to bankruptcy problems .
Thomson 's goal , like that of other game theorists , mathematicians , and economists who study bankruptcy problems , has been to get a list of axioms which characterize individual solution methods and families of methods for bankruptcy problems .
Since no method can obey all the fairness axioms for bankruptcy problems that one might like to have satisfied , Thomson 's efforts have gone far in clarifying the tradeoffs between different choices .
At this point quite a few important methods have one or more characterizations .
New models of bankruptcy and new axioms continue to be explored .
Although bankruptcy questions were raised in the Talmud over 1000 years ago , it was only 20 years ago when a " biblical question " resulted in a renaissance of interest in these fascinating problems .

Prominent Republicans are coming out in opposition to President Barack Obama ’s proposal for a $ 90 - billion fee on large banks that took bailout money , a move that political observers say could force the GOP to choose between their traditional anti-tax position and populist anger over the bailout .
On Thursday , GOP Chairman Michael Steele declared that the bank fee — which would be levied only on banks that took bailout money and have more than $ 50 billion in assets — is “ another tax on the American public . ”

“ The fact is this money has already been paid back by the banks and this punitive tax will hurt Americans ’ savings and discourage job creation at the worst of economic times , ” Steele said , as quoted at the Huffington Post .
The issue has percolated its way into the nail - biter Massachusetts Senate race , where Democrat Martha Coakley is in a dead heat with Republican Scott Brown for Ted Kennedy ’s old seat .
The race has the potential to halt the president ’s health care agenda if the seat falls into Republican hands .
On Thursday night , Brown ’s campaign declared that “ Scott Brown is opposed to higher taxes , especially in the midst of a severe recession .
Raising taxes will kill jobs .
Martha Coakley ’s tax - raising policies will make it harder to get our economy back on the right track . ”
If the Democratic strategy is to “ box in ” Republicans on the issue , then “ Brown has taken the bait , ” writes Jonathan Weisman at the Wall Street Journal .
Coakley — who has been accused of running a lackluster campaign — immediately pounced on that statement , issuing a statement that Brown explain exactly where he stands on the fee , which seeks to recoup some of the money taxpayers lost in the bailout .

As Attorney General , I have taken on Wall Street and recovered millions for the taxpayers of Massachusetts .
As Senator , I would support this proposal because it holds the largest Wall Street firms accountable for their abuses that caused millions of people to lose their jobs , as well as it works to recover the hard - earned taxpayer dollars of the middle class .
Now is the time for Scott Brown to tell us what side he ’s on , and who he wants to fight for .
Despite his tea party rhetoric about never supporting a tax hike , the truth is that he has supported more than $ 300 million in new taxes and fees on middle class families .
We ’ll find out if his “ no tax ” pledge only applies to the privileged .
“ To the extent that Coakley has shown any passion in her Senate race , it ’s for cracking down on Wall Street bankers .
So she ’s positioned to play this up .
We ’ll see if she can , ” writes David Dayen at FireDogLake .
The banks themselves are also taking on the proposed bank fee .

“ The money to be collected is capital being pulled out of the banking system that could support ten times the amount in new lending , ” a “ senior industry leader ” told Politico ’s Mike Allen .
“ That ’s because one dollar in capital supports $ 10 or more in lending .
So the tax will pull not $ 90 billion in lending capacity out of the banking system , but $ 1 trillion in potential lending . ”
For some fiscal conservatives , the bank fee presents a moral dilemma .
On the one hand , there is plenty of resentment on the right about the use of $ 700 billion in taxpayer money to bail out banks .
On the other , fiscal conservatives are loathe to accept any form of new taxation .

It ’s precisely that dilemma that Democrats hope to exploit .
“ While the GOP has muddied the waters on financial reform , the Wall Street fee is a bright line : either you are on the side of making taxpayers whole or you want to protect outsized profits at the big Wall Street banks , ” an unnamed administration official said .
“ If the GOP lines up with Goldman and company on the fee , it ’ll make it easier for Dems to demonstrate that they are protecting the ‘ fat cats ’ and opposing real change to Wall Street . ”
Definitely the creepiest product on this list .
Their slogan actually says , ' For the girl who has everything - but hair ' .
Why does your baby need hair at the age of two months ?
If you ask me this product is for the parents .
If God wants your baby bald for the first year of their life then let them be bald , damn it .
What if they have thinning , s** tty hair for the rest of their lives ?
People will look at old pictures and think that your child hit their hair - peak at the toddler stage .

Prominent voices on both sides of the climate change debate today called for an independent inquiry into claims of collusion between climate scientists after it emerged last week that hundreds of their emails and documents had been leaked that allegedly manipulated data and destroyed evidence for Freedom of Information Act requests .
Writing in the Times , Lord Lawson , the former Conservative chancellor and long - time climate change sceptic , said : " The integrity of the scientific evidence on which not merely the British government , but other countries , too , through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , claim to base far - reaching and hugely expensive policy decisions , has been called into question .
And the reputation of British science has been seriously tarnished .
A high - level independent inquiry must be set up without delay . "
Bob Ward , director of policy and communications at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics , said : " Once appropriate action has been taken over the hacking , there has to be some process to assess the substance of the email messages as well .
The selective disclosure and dissemination of the messages has created the impression of impropriety , and the only way of clearing the air now would be through a rigorous investigation .
I have sympathy for the climate researchers at the University of East Anglia and other institutions who have been the target of an aggressive campaign by so - called ' sceptics ' over a number of years .
But I fear that only a thorough investigation could now clear their names . "
He added : " There needs to be an assurance that these email messages have not revealed inappropriate conduct in the preparation of journal articles and in dealing with requests from other researchers for access to data .
This will probably require investigations both by the host institutions and by the relevant journals .
There may also be a role for the UK Research Integrity Office to advise on any investigation . "
A spokesperson for Nature , the science journal mentioned by name in one of the alleged emails that sceptics say provides evidence of data manipulation and collusion , declined to comment .
A spokesperson for the UK Research Integrity Office said it would n't comment on this case , but added : " UKRIO is not a regulatory body and does not have a case investigation role , though we can and do participate in investigations at the request of an employer , regulator or other appropriate body or person .
If a field of research is not governed by statute , it normally devolves to the employer or grant funding body to investigate . "
The Met Office confirmed that none of its own computers has come under attack from hackers and said that it would not call for an inquiry .
A spokesman at the Met Office , which jointly produces global temperature datasets with the Climate Research Unit , said there was no need for an inquiry .
" If you look at the emails , there is n't any evidence that the data was falsified and there 's no evidence that climate change is a hoax .
It 's a shame that some of the sceptics have had to take this rather shallow attempt to discredit robust science undertaken by some of the world 's most respected scientists .
The bottom line is that temperatures continue to rise and humans are responsible for it .
We have every confidence in the science and the various datasets we use .
The peer - review process is as robust as it could possibly be .
It 's no surprise , with the Copenhagen talks just days away , that this has happened now . "
Andy Atkins , Friends of the Earth 's executive director , also dismissed calls for an inquiry .
He said : " Calls for an inquiry look suspiciously like an attempt to cast doubt on the science of climate change ahead of crucial UN negotiations .
The overwhelming majority of climate scientists believe that climate change is happening , that it is man-made , and that it poses a major threat to people across the planet .
We can't afford to be distracted from the need for urgent action to combat global warming – rich countries must lead the way by agreeing to slash their emissions when they meet in Copenhagen next month . "
Peter Moore , the only known survivor from five British hostages in Iraq , has been released in Baghdad .
The computer programmer was captured in the Iraqi capital in 2007 by Shia militants with four other Britons and spent 31 months in captivity .
The bodies of all but one of the others have since been returned to Britain .
Moore , aged 39 , was released to Iraqi officials this morning and then transferred to the British embassy in Baghdad .
A young Shia cleric , Qais al - Ghazali , held by the US military , was being handed over for release to the Iraqi government in exchange , officials said .
The British foreign secretary , David Milliband , said Moore was in good health and " delighted " to be freed .
He was in a " remarkable frame of mind given the two and a half years that he has had .
Real strength , real commitment , a real determination to get back to his life . "
Miilband said the British government had made no substantive concessions to the kidnappers and attributed Moore 's release to the process of reconciliation being carried out by the Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki .
" The process of reconciliation is the foundation of the decision of the kidnappers to release him , " Miliband said .
Moore 's captors called the Iraqi government early this morning and said they were willing to free him in east Baghdad .
The hardline Islamic group known as the Righteous League had insisted on trading Moore for Ghazali , who was captured near Basra by the SAS along with his brother Laith al - Ghazali and a senior member of Lebanese Hezbollah in March 2007 .
Foreign secretary 's statement on release of IT worker taken hostage with four other Britons in Baghdad two years ago Press Association
The others Britons captured with Moore – all security guards – were Alec Maclachlan from Llanelli in Wales , Alan McMenemy from Dumbarton in Scotland , Jason Swindlehurst and Jason Creswell .
The bodies of Swindlehurst and Creswell were identified in June , followed by Maclachlan in September .
McMenemy is also believed dead , though his body has not been returned .
Until today there had been no word on Moore 's fate since a DVD was handed to Iraqi officials a few months ago showing him alive .
Senior Righteous
League members have said Moore did not know the fate of the other four , all of whom were almost certainly killed about 18 months ago , according to forensic science findings .
Moore 's father , Graeme , 60 , from Wigston , Leicestershire , said he was " over the moon " at the news .
" We are so relieved and we just want to get him home , back now to his family and friends .
I 'm breaking down , I 'm just so overjoyed for the lad .
It 's been such a long haul .
I know that there have been one or two people working in the background to get Peter released .
" Peter is a very resilient lad and he always has been because of his background … but I do n't know how close he was to those others who have been shot . "
Graeme Moore said he felt the Foreign Office had been " obstructive " in the effort to secure his son 's safe release .
Gordon Brown said he was " hugely relieved " by the " wonderful news " that Moore had been released and would be reunited with his family .
" They have faced a terrible ordeal and I know that the whole nation will share their joy that he is coming home , " Brown said .
" At this moment of celebration we also remember the families of British hostages who have been killed in Iraq and elsewhere . "
There has been a phased release of Shia prisoners from American custody this year , many of whom had been linked to the Righteous League and to the firebrand cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
Moore 's release had been widely predicted to take place during the Islamic festival of Eid al - Adha , which this year fell in November .
As it drew near Moore 's captors had grown increasingly concerned about his psychological state .
The net of those who knew his whereabouts was so small that the kidnappers would not risk taking him to a doctor to treat a range of ailments he developed over the past six months .
" To an extent the captors had become captive to their hostage , " said one senior Iraqi government negotiator familiar with the negotiations .
" They wanted to hand him back but they were not going to do so before Sheikh Qais was freed .
And the Americans were holding out . "
Moore is being debriefed in Baghdad by embassy officials , medical staff and police attached to the embassy .
He is expected to be flown to Kuwait or Jordan and then home to Britain .
He had been working in Iraq as an IT consultant for the country 's finance ministry , where he had also been helping install financial software .
The five Britons were kidnapped by up to 40 men , many of whom were dressed in Iraqi police uniform , and driven towards Sadr City .
Earlier this month a leading member of the Righteous League confirmed for the first time to the Guardian that the group was holding Moore and expressed frustration at delays over the trade for Ghazali .
" This was due to be completed at the time of Eid al - Adha , " said Salam al - Maliki , a Shia politician who heads the Righteous League 's dialogue committee .
" It was not finalised because the Americans did not honour their pledge to release Sheikh Qais .
" We have discussed this for many months and there has been progress made .
But the sticking point has always been Sheikh Qais . "
A blueprint for the release of Moore was outlined earlier in the year in an interview given by a senior Righteous League figure to a Saudi website .
The interview spelled out a phased series of trades of the five Britons for a large number of Shia Islamist prisoners , culminating in a swap of Moore for Ghazali and Ali Mahmoud al - Dakduk , of Hezbollah .
The US military blames Ghazali , his brother Laith and Dakduk for an ambush in the Shia shrine city of Karbala in January 2007 in which five US soldiers were killed .
The three were captured three months later by the SAS near Basra .
Moore and the four guards were seized in Baghdad in late May the same year to try to secure the militants ' release .
A promising political career beckons for Ghazali , who has been courted by several Shia factions for a senior role .
The former understudy to Moqtada al - Sadr has won favour in Shia Islamic circles in neighbouring Iran .
The British government has been repeatedly criticised for its hands - off role in the hostage negotiations – it had aimed not to legitimise hostage - taking as a political tactic in Iraq .
The recently departed ambassador to Iraq , Christopher Prentice , defended the government 's stance .
Days before leaving Baghdad he said : " It was the proper approach and offered the best chances of making progress .
" The way forward has always been through engagement with the government of Iraq and they have been very supportive , and in my final meeting with the prime minister we again discussed this and he repeated his commitment to try to bring this to a conclusion .
The best opportunity has been to try to persuade the hostage - holders to do the proper and right thing to release [ them … through a process of broader national reconciliation ] .
That is still the best framework for this . "
EGYPT’S top comedian , Adel Imam – widely known across the Arab world as The Leader – has upset “ a celebrated ” Muslim preacher , who has accused him of insulting Muslim clerics in his movies .
According to this report , Khalid Al Guindy , a prominent Muslim televangelist said on Azhari , a private religious TV station :
Imam mocks preachers , including me .
I have asked Imam more than once to stop making fun of Islamic figures , but to no avail .
The posturing ninny added :
He casts Muslims in an unfavourable light by portraying the Muslims wearing the jallabia ( flowing garments ) and sporting beards as terrorists .
He is a mere actor , who calls himself a leader .
Earlier this year , a fatwa – calling for the comedian ’s assassination – was issued in Algeria after Imam had dared to criticise the Palestinian group Hamas .
Ahmad Al Najmi , writing in the pro-government magazine Al Musawwar last week , said :
What strikes attention is that attacks against Adel Imam have picked up pace .
Less than a year after the death fatwa against Imam , Khalid Al Guindy tries to undermine Imam ’s popularity .
According to Al Najmi , Imam , now in his 60s , is targeted by terrorists and corrupt entrepreneurs “ for unmasking them on the screen ” .
Meanwhile , we learn that Saudi journalists , Nadine Al Bdair , and Magdy Al Galad , have been summoned for questioning in Egypt following the publication of Â a “ blasphemous ” article published recently in the Egyptian daily Al Masry Al Youm .
Galad is editor - in - chief of the newspaper .
In the article Bdair called for a new edict that would permit a woman to marry four men .
In her view , if men and women are equals , they should be given the same privileges , but according to this report , many Muslims expressed outrage over the article .
Public Prosecutor , Abdul Majeed Mahmoud , ordered the prosecutor of south Cairo to investigate blasphemy charges against the two .
Prosecution lawyer Khalid Fouad Hafez said that he had been waiting for two weeks for the Public Prosecutor to hear the case .
Since the case was filed , Nadine has been out of the public eye , but a source from Al Hurra TV , her former employer , says she might be in Beirut .
A team at Bristol University hopes to harvest kinetic energy from vibrating household appliances and vehicles in order to use it as a clean source of commercial electricity within five years .
The concept known as ' energy harvesting ' has been around for more than a decade , and commercial devices already exist in specialised areas .
For example , vibrations from industrial pumps are currently employed to power sensors that monitor the pumps ' operational condition .
At the moment , devices can only make use of vibrations within a narrow range of frequencies or number of vibrations per second .
They use a spring with a mass on the end and employ a process called resonance to amplify small vibrations , which enables energy to be extracted .
" Even just a few milliwatts can power small electronic devices like a heart rate monitor or an engine temperature sensor , but it can also be used to recharge power - hungry devices like MP3 players or mobile phones , " said Dr Stephen Burrow , who is leading the project .
But the current problem is that , if such vibration levels are too low , too little electricity is produced to make the device usable .
This situation generates problems in applications such as transport , where the frequency of vibrations changes constantly .
As a result , the Bristol University team is developing a new kind of device based on a non -linear spring and mass .
The new type of spring enables the appliance to resonate over a much wider range of frequencies than a conventional one , which should broaden the number of applications in which it can be used .
The amount of energy produced is similar in scale to a battery , but is more environmentally friendly in that devices do not run the risk of leaking polluting chemicals on disposal .
They also do not need to be regularly replaced .
" There 's a huge amount of free , clean energy out there in the form of vibrations that just can't be tapped at the moment .
Wider - frequency energy harvesters could make a valuable contribution to meeting energy needs more efficiently and sustainably , " said Burrow .
Such devices are particularly suited to applications where hard wiring is impractical , vulnerable to damage or difficult to get at for maintenance purposes .
They are also expected to be used in wireless monitoring and diagnostic sensors that generate data on the amount of stress that engine components and structural elements in buildings are subject to .
The appliances could likewise be used to monitor break temperatures in railway rolling stock or patients ' heart rate , body temperature and blood pressure .

Jay - Z’s
“ On to the Next One ” has many people wondering what ’s the meaning behind the creepy images .
The best way to understand the imagery is to understand the occult context in which they are used .
This article takes a look at the occult meaning of the symbols found in this video in relation to Jay - Z ’s affinities with secret societies .
Shortly after the American continent said goodbye to 2009 , Jay - Z came on TV and said : “ On to the Next One ” .
The video premiered on 01/01/10 , which in Kabbalistic numerology equals 3 ( 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1+ 0 = 3 ) .
The number 3 is an important theme of the video .
The release date also contains three 1’s , which is reminiscent of the three bars representing Jay - Z ’s album The Blueprint 3 .
This is just an example of the occult aura surrounding Jay - Z latest works .
If you have n’t done so already , I strongly suggest you read my first article about Jay - Z ( Jay - Z ’s “ Run This Town ” and the Occult Connections ) .
The article goes through some of Jay - Z ’s occult influences and his affinities with secret societies .
I ’ve noticed an increasing number of people wondering about the “ creepiness ” of some of their favorite artist ’s music videos .
Although some of the imagery is solely there for shock value or artistic aestheticism , an important portion of the symbols found in recent videos are directly related to the music industry ’s peculiar brand of occultism .
As seen in other articles on this site , the same symbols keep reappearing in pop videos , whether we look at Beyonce , Lady Gaga , Rihanna , Jay - Z or whoever else will be “ chosen ” in the future .
Some people who read my first article on Jay - Z claimed that the symbolism I described was the result of coincidences or that I was “ reading too much into it ” .
After viewing
On to the Next One , many of the same people are now saying “ he ’s doing it on purpose , the symbols are too obvious ” .
How did something go from being accidental to being “ too obvious ” ?
It seems those who want to avoid the truth will go to any lengths to rationalize what is happening .
Artists at the top level of the music industry are chosen by the elite ( the common name for them is Illuminati ) .
The initiation of the artists guarantees them success and exposure , at the cost of becoming vessels of Illuminati symbolism and personal sacrifice .
If Jay - Z’s Run This Town left some people wondering if the video truly contained an underlying occult message , On to the Next One confirms Jay - Z ’s affiliation with the occult elite .
Analysis of the Video
The video to On to the Next One does not contain a deep storyline and the lyrics are basically about Jay - Z bragging about how he ’s a step ahead .
So this analysis will mainly focus on the occult meaning of some of the images found in the video .
They often appear for less than a second , I technique I like to call “ semi-subliminals ” .
Some of them are apparently there for aesthetic purposes ( unless I ’ve missed something ) , while others are deeply occult .
Jay - Z the Holy
The background in the scene above incorporates strategically placed lights with Jay - Z standing right in front of them , making it appear as if he has a halo around his head .
The halo is used in iconic imagery to identify holy or sacred figures .
Given the dark occult theme of the video and references to Baphomet ( used by the Church of Satan ) , the halo takes on a sinister meaning .
The one who refers to himself as “ HOV ” or “ Jay - Hova ” ( a reference to Jehovah , the proper name of God in Abrahamic religions ) might be sending the message that he is a god in a LeVeyan satanism kind of way rather than the “ black gods ” of the Five - Percenters .
The Bloody Skull
During the video , a black skull and a silver skull are displayed with liquid pouring on them .
The symbol of the human skull has always been of utmost importance in occult Brotherhoods .
The Knight Templars ( ancestors of the Freemasons ) made new members drink wine ( representative of blo0d ) from a human skull as part of their initiation .
This practice is still found in some rites of Freemasonry .
“ The Knights Templar were inveterate lovers and users of Human Skulls of all sizes and mediums , including both metallic and Crystal Skulls .
The Templar identification with Human Skulls was reflected in one of the Knights ’ preeminent symbols , the “ Jolly Roger , ” which is the recognizable pirate or poison symbol of a human skull surmounting cross bones .
This symbol represented both the Templar ceremonial use of skulls as idolic images and even drinking vessels , as well as their practice of alchemy , one of the stages of which was termed “ Deadhead ” and represented cryptically as a human skull .
Human Skulls were popular among the Templars because they were believed to hold the spiritual power of their original owners – as well as to continually emanate this essence throughout their environment .
The skull of John the Baptist discovered by the Templars during the Fourth Crusade in Constantinople was such a skull .
The Templars claimed that John ’s skull radiated the same kind of Holy Spirit power as it did when attached to the original body of John , and in order to empower their ceremonies and initiations they placed it on their high altars .
Other human skulls particularly esteemed by the Templars were those that had been possessed by Christian saints and past grand masters of their organization .
In order to amplify and conduct the power emanating from these skulls for ceremonial purposes they were often wrapped in a highly conductive metal , such as gold or silver , and then placed in energy - productive reliquaries made into the shapes of sacred geometric formations including tetrahedrons , octagons , and pyramids .
References to Templar skulls wrapped in gold and silver can be found in some of the early Holy Grail legends . ”
– Source
Remnants of this practice are still found in the rituals associated with the 33rd degree of some Masonic rites ( i.e. the Cerneau rite ) where the candidates drink wine from a human skull .
What do they think of Christians drinking the “ blood of Christ ” during mass ?
That ’s a whole other topic .
The Crow ?
Two extras in the video seem to be a mix of Brandon Lee ’s The Crow and Heath Ledger ’s Joker in The Dark Knight .
VS
Disturbing fact : Both Heath Ledger and Brandon Lee died mysteriously during the filming of deeply occult movies .
Ritual sacrifice ?
That is also a whole other topic .
Other references to crows :
Dissing Jesus
Combined with Jay - Z ’s track record of not too Christian - friendly lyrics , this image is not really surprising .
Baphomet Strikes Again
If you ’ve read other articles on this website , you are aware of the usage of the likeness of Baphomet as an unmistakable mark of an “ Illuminati video ” .
Baphomet is the horned idol reportedly worshiped by the Knight Templars and later used by the Church of Satan .
Two separate Baphomet heads make short , almost subliminal appearances during the video .
In Conclusion
As soon as the video came out , I received tons of e-mails from people who have picked up on many of the symbols described here .
This confirms two things :
One , many people are becoming aware of the sinister symbolism inserted in videos and two , these symbols are becoming increasingly blatant .
They are not hiding anymore .
The industry WANTS to reveal its true nature .
I believe there are two types of “ Illuminati artists ” : the willing participants ( I would place Jay - Z and Lady Gaga in this category ) and those who are clueless ( Rihanna seems like the perfect example ) .
Jay - Z , being the smart businessman that he is , knows that controversy sells .
It is thus a win - win situation : Jay - Z gets the publicity he is seeking and the Illuminatus continue their mass indoctrination .
But what will happen when the elites are done using Jay - Z as a vessel for their sinister symbols ?
Will they say ON TO THE NEXT ONE ?
COPENHAGEN ( Reuters ) -
As President Barack Obama labored behind closed doors to break a deadlock over efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions , Republicans from the U.S. Congress were outside those meetings urging him not to bother .

“ We ’re not going to let jobs be destroyed in America for some esoteric environmental benefit 100 years from now , ” U.S. House of Representatives member Joe Barton told Reuters on the sidelines of the U.N. conference on climate change .
Barton , who would take over a powerful House committee that oversees environmental policy if Republicans were to regain majority control of the House , said he does not believe industrial emissions of carbon dioxide contribute to global warming and fears capping them would hobble the economy .
“ If I am chairman two years from now , I ’m going to repeal ” measures such as U.S. funding to help developing countries battle climate change , outlined by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday , the conservative Texas congressman boasted .
In a speech in Copenhagen on Wednesday , Democratic Senator John Kerry , a leading supporter of climate change legislation , called opponents “ nihilists and naysayers . ”
Instead of imposing new pollution controls , which Republicans characterize as a tax , many of them instead call for an energy and environment policy that expands domestic nuclear power and oil production and research into clean - burning coal .
Barton and five of his House colleagues traveled to Copenhagen to publicize their belief that carbon pollution should not be blamed for melting ice , rising sea levels and increasing chances of devastating flooding and drought .
“ We do n’t have an icecap in Texas , ” Barton quipped to reporters .
The Republicans ’ message was a reminder to Obama and his negotiators that anything they agree to in Copenhagen will have to be reviewed by Congress and that a Democratic majority in the House and Senate does not guarantee Obama can have his way .
Representative Fred Upton , whose home state of Michigan is suffering severe unemployment , said that a narrowly - passed House climate change bill would “ lose by 50 votes ” if it were debated now .
A Senate version of that bill has been stalled for months .
U.S. politicians of various stripes are nervous about debating , amid high joblessness , a climate bill that could cause energy prices to rise , even if marginally .
Republicans in the House and Senate launched another offensive during the Copenhagen conference with moves to block Obama ’s Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon emissions if legislation fails .
Barton , who told reporters “ there has really never been an independent assessment of the methodology or of the data ” that underpin U.N. efforts to counter global warming , said he would welcome one and mentioned the U.S. National Academy of Sciences as one possibility .
In June , the academy joined science academies of several other large countries calling on leaders to “ seize all opportunities ” to address global climate change that they said “ is happening even faster than previously estimated . ”
From Jay - Z to Murs to Blitz The Ambassador , emcees have long championed the creativity and artistry of veteran UK band Radiohead .
The group ’s 15 - plus year string of cult followed albums has made them one of the most sought - after live acts , and their “ pay what you want ” business model for last album In Rainbows , was revolutionary to independent musicians .
The band ’s frontman , Thom Yorke , is also a fan of Rap .
Last year , Yorke remixed “ Gazzillion Ear ” from DOOM‘s ( f/k/a MF DOOM ) BORN LIKE THIS album .
The work exclusively appeared on the iTunes edition of the Lex Records release .
On Tuesday of this week , Yorke played co-host to Gilles Peterson ’s BBC radio show , where the duo happened to play a number of records , including recent music from Jay Electronica and Stones Throw ’s Dam - Funk .
Yorke revealed that he has deeper connections to Peanutbutter Wolf ’s California - based label .
The Radiohead singer said there was talks of a project between him and former Lootpack front - man Madlib .
Although the work was halted by time and schedule constraints , Yorke alluded that he and the Oxnard , California - born emcee , producer and Quasimoto , Yesterday ’s New Quintet , Beatkonducta impresario may have future projects together .
Yorke reportedly already has a batch of Madlib beats .
Although the casual conversation between Peterson and Yorke was loose , Yorke did say that there ’s been work done with Madvillain , and a remix will be heard soon .
Radiohead fans will be pleased to know that the band begins a month - long studio session today .
Fun with Morse Code
Wanted : a short and clever morse code decoder in Haskell .
This article presents a series of successively smaller solutions that gradually include computer science concepts like dichotomic search , stack - based languages and finally deforestation , an optimization technique specific to purely functional languages like Haskell .
This article previously appeared in issue 14 of The Monad .
Reader .
Introduction
In a post to reddit , user CharlieDancey presented a challenge to write a short and clever morse code decoder .
Of course , what could be more clever than writing it in Haskell ? ;-)
In the following , I ’ll present a series of solutions that gradually include dichotomic search ( the straightforward generalization of binary search ) , stack - based languages or reverse polish notation , and finally deforestation ( also called fusion ) , an optimization technique specific to purely functional languages like Haskell .
For your convenience , source code for the individual sections is available .
A simple first solution
Morse code was designed to be produced and read , or rather heard by humans , who have to memorize the following table :
To write a program that decodes sequences of dots and dashes like
-- --- .-. ... . -.-. --- -.. .
into letters , we will have to store this table in some form .
For instance , we could store each letter and corresponding morse code in a big association list
type MorseCode = String dict :: [ ( MorseCode , Char ) ] dict = [ ( " . - " , ' A ' ) , ( " -... " , ' B ' ) , ( " -.-. " , ' C ' ) , ...
which we name dict because it ’s a dictionary translating between the latin alphabet and morse code .
To decode a letter , we simply browse through this list to determine whether it contains a given code of dots and dashes
decodeLetter :: MorseCode ->
Char decodeLetter code = maybe ' ' id $ lookup code dict
Decoding a whole sequence of letters is done with
decode = map decodeLetter .
words
so that we have for example
> decode " -- --- .-. ... . -.-. --- -.. . " " MORSECODE "
Of course , association lists are a rather slow data structure .
A binary search tree , trie , or hash table would be a better choice .
But fortunately , it is very easy to change data structures in Haskell .
All you have to do is to a qualified import of a different module , such as Data .
Map , and change the definition of dict to
dict :: Data.Map.Map MorseCode Char dict = Data.Map.fromList $ [ ( " . - " , ' A ' ) , ( " -... " , ' B ' ) , ( " -.-. " , ' C ' ) , ...
and use Data.Map.lookup instead of Data.List.lookup .
Dichotomic search
Faithfully replicating the morse code table is clear and preferable , but makes for quite large source code .
So , let ’s make an exception today and think of something as clever as we can .
The idea is the following : whenever an encoded letter starts with a dash '- ' , we know that it ca n’t be for example an A or E , because those start with a dot '.' .
And if the next symbol is a dot , then it ca n’t be a G or M because their second symbol is a dash .
With each symbol we read , more and more alternatives disappear until we are left with a single alternative .
We can depict this with a binary tree :
At each node , the left subtree contains all the letters that can be obtained by adding a dot to the current letter , while the right subtree contains those letters that can be obtained with a dash .
This is illustrated by means of a dotted line connected to the left subtree and a dashed line connected to the right subtree .
Now , to decode a letter , we simply start at the root of the tree and follow the dotted or dashed lines depending on the symbols read .
For instance , to decode the sequence " -... " , we have to go right once and then left thrice , ending up at the letter B .
This procedure is also called dichotomic search because at each point in our search for the right letter , we ask a yes / no question “ Dot or dash ? ” ( a dichotomy ) that partitions the remaining search space into to disjoint parts .
Let ’s implement this in Haskell .
First , we assume that our dictionary is given as a tree
data Tree a = Leaf | Branch { tag :: a , left ::
Tree a , right ::
Tree a } dict :: Tree Char dict = Branch ' ' ( Branch ' E ' ... ) ( Branch ' T ' ...)
Of course , writing out the dict tree in full is going to be repetitive and boring , but let ’s just imagine we have already done that .
Then , decoding a letter by walking down the tree is simply a left fold over the code word
decodeLetter = tag .
foldl ( flip step ) dict where step '.' = left step '-' = right
In this case , the accumulated value of the fold is the current subtree , although the term “ accumulate ” is a bit misleading in that we do n’t make the dictionary bigger ; we make it smaller by passing to a subtree .
The curious reader may notice that we have actually implemented a trie .
Reverse Polish Notation
Now , let ’s reduce the source code needed for the dictionary tree .
In Haskell , we ’d have to write something like
dict = Branch ' ' ( Branch ' E ' ... ) ( Branch ' T ' ...)
Compared to the association list , we got rid of the dots '.' and dashes ' -' , they have been made implicit in the structure of our tree .
But we still need a lot of parenthesis and applications of the Branch function .
A clever way to get rid of parenthesis is reverse polish notation , commonly used in stack - based languages .
The idea is that a program in such a language is a sequence of instructions that pop and push values from a stack .
For example ,
1 2 +
is a program to calculate 1 plus 2 .
Reading from left to right , the first instruction is 1 which pushes the integer 1 onto the stack .
The second instruction is 2 , pushing 2 onto the stack .
And finally , the instruction + pops the two topmost integers from the stack and pushes their sum onto the stack .
This procedure is visualized as follows :
To see how that eliminates the need for parenthesis , take a look the program
1 2 + 3 4 + +
which calculates the sum ( 1+2 ) + ( 3+4 ) .
To build our dictionary tree , we are going to devise a very similar language .
Instead of integers , the stack will store whole trees .
In analogy to the numerals , there will be an instruction for pushing a Leaf onto the stack ; and in analogy to + , there is going to be an instruction for applying the Branch constructor to the two topmost subtrees .
Here ’s the program for building the tree , stored as a string :
program :: String program = " __5__4H___3VS__F___2 UI__L__+_ R__P___1JWAE " ++ " __6__=B__/_XD__C__YKN__7_Z__QG__8_ __9__0 OMT "
Each character represents one instruction .
The underscore ' _ ' pushes a Leaf onto the stack while all the other character push a Branch tagged with the character in question onto the stack .
The interpreter for this tiny programming language can be written using a simple left fold :
dict = interpret program where interpret = head . foldl exec [ ] exec xs ' _' = Leaf : xs -- push Leaf exec ( x :y:xs ) c = Branch c y x : xs -- combine subtrees
The stack xs is represented as a list of trees .
Deforestation
We have found a concise way to represent the morse code dictionary in source code , but cleverness does not end here .
For instance , how about eliminating the tree entirely ?
Chopping trees
Call graph
More precisely , it seems wasteful to construct the dictionary tree by creating leaves and connecting branches only to deconstruct them again when decoding letters .
Would n’t it be more efficient to interpret the morse code tree as a call graph rather than as a data structure Tree Char ?
In other words , imagine say a function e corresponding to the node labeled ‘ E ’ in the tree , and working as follows :
e :: MorseCode -> Char e ( '.': ds ) = i ds e ( ' - ' : ds ) = a ds e [ ] = 'E '
If the next symbol is a dot or dash , we proceed with the functions i or a corresponding to ' I ' and ' A ' respectively .
And in case we have already reached the end of the code , we know that we have decoded an ' E ' .
The functions i and a work just like e , except that they proceed with other letters ; and the morse code tree becomes their call graph .
A combinator …
Now , writing all these functions by hand would be most error - prone and tedious , they all look the same .
But abstracting repetitive patterns is exactly where functional programming shines ; we are to devise a combinator that automates the boring parts of the code for us .
What does this combinator look like ?
Well , the non-boring parts are the letter it represents and the two follow - up functions , so these will be parameters :
combinator :: Char -- letter -> ( MorseCode -> Char ) -- function for dot -> ( MorseCode -> Char ) -- function for dash -> ( MorseCode -> Char ) -- result function
That ’s all we need ; we can implement
combinator c x y = \code -> case code of '.': ds -> x ds '-': ds -> y ds [ ] -> c
which allows us to write
e = combinator ' E ' i a i = combinator ' I ' s u ... etc ...
… revealed !
But wait , what have we done ?
The type signature of combinator looks exactly like that of
Branch :: Char -- letter ->
Tree Char -- tree for dot ->
Tree Char -- tree for dash ->
Tree Char -- result tree
but with the type Tree Char replaced by ( MorseCode -> Char ) !
In fact , let ’s rename the combinator to lowercase branch
branch c x y = \code -> case code of '.': ds -> x ds '-': ds -> y ds [ ] -> c
and observe that the tree of functions now reads
e = branch ' E ' i a i = branch ' I ' s u ... etc ...
or
e = branch ' E ' ( branch ' I ' ... ) ( branch ' A ' ...)
if we inline the function definitions .
But this is of course just the tree from the section on dichotomic search with each Branch replaced by branch !
In other words , branch is like a drop - in replacement for the constructor Branch .
To implement the morse code tree directly as functions instead of as an algebraic data type , we simply replace every occurrence of Branch with branch in our previous code .
Thus , we have a new implementation
dict :: MorseCode ->
Char dict = interpret program where interpret = head .
foldl exec [ ] exec xs '_' = leaf : xs -- push leaf exec ( x :y:xs ) c = branch c y x : xs -- combine subtrees decodeLetter = dict
where
leaf = undefined
is a trivial replacement for the Leaf constructor .
A chainsaw called ‘ catamorphism ’
Derivation
To further understand how and why the replacement of Branch by branch works , it is instructive to derive it systematically from just the program text .
In particular , consider the implementation of decodeLetter from the earlier section on dichotomic search :
decodeLetter :: MorseCode ->
Char decodeLetter = tag .
foldl ( flip step ) dict where step '.' = left step '-' = right
In this formulation , the focus is on the recursion over the input string performed by foldl , neglecting the recursive descent into the dictionary tree .
Let ’s systematically rewrite this code to highlight the latter .
First , we interpret it as converting the dictionary tree into a function that decodes letters
decodeLetter = decodeWith dict decodeWith :: Tree Char -> ( MorseCode -> Char ) decodeWith dict = tag .
foldl ( flip step ) dict where step '.' = left step '-' = right
Then , we turn the foldl into explicit recursion
decodeWith dict [ ] = tag dict decodeWith dict ( d:ds ) = decodeWith ( step d dict ) ds where step '.' = left step '-' = right
and dissolve the step function into the pattern matching
decodeWith dict [ ] = tag dict decodeWith dict ( '.' : ds ) = decodeWith ( left dict ) ds decodeWith dict ( ' - ' : ds ) = decodeWith ( right dict ) ds
We group the pattern matching on the input code into a case expression
decodeWith dict = \code -> case code of [ ] -> tag dict ( '.': ds ) -> decodeWith ( left dict ) ds ( ' - ' : ds ) -> decodeWith ( right dict ) ds
and finally , we replace the field selectors by pattern matching on the tree , also noting the case of Leaf :
decodeWith Leaf = undefined decodeWith ( Branch c x y ) = \ code -> case code of [ ] -> c ( '.': ds ) -> ( decodeWith x ) ds ( ' - ' : ds ) -> ( decodeWith y ) ds
The recursion on the tree is apparent now , decodeWith simply traverses both subtrees and combines the results .
We can make this even more evident by appealing to the combinator we defined in the previous section :
decodeWith Leaf = leaf decodeWith ( Branch c x y ) = branch c ( decodeWith x ) ( decodeWith y )
In other words , decodeWith takes a tree and simply substitutes each Leaf constructor with leaf and each Branch constructor with branch .
Of course , first using Branch and then replacing it with branch is a waste ; we should rather use branch from the start and thus cut away the intermediate tree .
That ’s exactly what we ’ve done in the previous section !
General pattern
Replacing constructors is a very general pattern , not restricted to binary trees .
For instance , you probably know following function :
foldr f z [ ] = z foldr f z ( x : xs ) = x `f` foldr f z xs
It ’s the good old fold !
And at its heart , it just replaces the constructors of the list data type : z is the substitute for the empty list [ ] , and f is put in lieu of the ( :) constructor .
In its honor , any function that substitutes constructors in such fashion is known as a generalized fold .
A more exotic but commonly used alternative name is “ catamorphism ” .
In other words , decodeWith is a catamorphism .
In this generality , the idea of deforestation is that instead of first constructing a data structure and then chopping it up with a catamorphism , it is more efficient to saw the pieces properly at the time of creation .
For example , creating a list and then adding all elements
sum [ 1..100 ] = foldr (+ ) 0 ( enumFromTo 1 100 )
is less efficient than adding the elements as they are created
sumFromTo a b -- changes to enumFromTo | a > b = 0 -- 0 replaces [ ] | otherwise = a + sumFromTo ( a+1 ) b -- + replaces (:)
Merging two functions in this fashion is also called fusion .
Performing deforestation manually , as we did , sacrifices reusability : the morse code tree only exists as a call graph and cannot be printed out anymore , and sumFromTo is not nearly as useful as are sum and enumFromTo were .
Hence , the goal is to teach the compiler to automatically fuse catamorphisms with their structure creating counterparts , the so called anamorphisms .
That ’s what efforts like a short - cut to deforestation and the recent stream fusion are set out to do , yielding dramatic gains in efficiency while preserving the compositional style .
Where to go from here
I hope you had fun doodling around with morse code ; I certainly did .
If you long for more , here a few suggestions :
Cutting words
While we ’re at it , the intermediate lists created by words in
decode = map decodeLetter .
words
can be deforested as well and fused into the letter decoding .
Try it yourself , or see the example source code .
Polish notation and parsing
Polish notation , the converse of reverse polish notation , puts function symbols before their arguments and is thus closer to the Haskell syntax .
When the arities of the functions are known in advance , like 2 for Branch and 0 for Leaf , this notation does n’t require parenthesis either .
Write a program in polish notation and a corresponding tiny interpreter to create the morse code tree .
Comparing to C
Since deforestation is supposed to make things faster , how about comparing our deforested morse code tree to say an implementation in C ?
But instead of doing benchmarks , let me give two general remarks on the machine representation .
First , one might think that the call graph we ’ve built is compiled to function calls , with e calling i or a and each function having different machine code , just as we originally intended .
But this is actually not the case .
When defined with branch , the functions are represented as closures , sharing the same machine code but carrying different records that store their free variables c , x and y .
This is not very different from storing c , x and y in a Branch constructor .
Template Haskell or some kind of partial evaluation would be needed to hard - code the free variables into the executable .
For more on the Haskell execution model , take a look at the GHC commentary .
Second , all our implementations decipher a letter by follow a chain of pointers : descending a tree means following pointers to deeper nodes , and making procedure calls means repeatedly jumping to different code parts .
This of course raises questions of cache locality , branch prediction or memory requirements for storing all these pointers .
In C , however , there is another technique available : instead of following a chain of pointers to get to the destination , the address of the final stop is calculated directly with pointer arithmetic .
The following example illustrates this :
#include < stdio.h > # include < string.h > char buf [ 99 ] , tree [ ] = " ETIANMSURWDKGOHVF L PJBXCYZQ " ; int main ( ) { while ( scanf ( " %s " , buf ) ) { int n , t=0 ; for ( n=0 ; buf [ n ] !=0 ; n++) t = 2*t + 1 + ( buf [ n ] &1 ) ; /* compute destination */ putchar ( tree[t ] ) ; /* fetch letter */ } }
Here , the tree is represented as an array and paths to nodes are encoded as ( zero - less ) binary numbers .
The program calculates the path t to the proper letter and then fetches it with an O ( 1 ) memory lookup .
Compare also the morse code translator by reddit user kayamon .
Since the number of memory accesses is kept to a minimum , this technique is the most efficient ; but it is impossible to reproduce with algebraic data types alone .
Fortunately , arrays libraries are readily available in Haskell as well .
The main drawback of this approach , and of arrays in general , is the lack of clarity ; indices are notorious for being non-descript and messy .
The raw index arithmetic in the example C code above sure seems like magic !
WASHINGTON  The Energy Department has concluded in an internal audit that it does not properly track whether manufacturers that give their appliances an Energy Star label have met the required specifications for energy efficiency .
Some manufacturers could therefore be putting the stickers on unqualified products , according to the audit , by the Energy Department ’s inspector general , Gregory H. Friedman .
The Energy Star program , jointly managed by the Energy Department and the Environmental Protection Agency , has benefited from a renewed emphasis by the Obama administration , as a mechanism for reducing the waste of energy and curbing resulting greenhouse gas emissions .
Under the federal stimulus bill , $ 300 million will go to rebates for consumers who buy Energy Star products .
Some consumers choose energy - efficient appliances for the same reason they might choose a car with good fuel economy : to save money or reduce the environmental impact .

This movie from Cassini , made possible only as Saturn 's north pole emerged from winter darkness , shows new details of a jet stream that follows a hexagon - shaped path and has long puzzled scientists .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
After waiting years for the sun to illuminate Saturn 's north pole again , cameras aboard NASA 's Cassini spacecraft have captured the most detailed images yet of the intriguing hexagon shape crowning the planet .
The new images of the hexagon , whose shape is the path of a jet stream flowing around the north pole , reveal concentric circles , curlicues , walls and streamers not seen in previous images .
The last visible - light images of the entire hexagon were captured by NASA 's Voyager spacecraft nearly 30 years ago , the last time spring began on Saturn .
After the sunlight faded , darkness shrouded the north pole for 15 years .
Much to the delight and bafflement of Cassini scientists , the location and shape of the hexagon in the latest images match up with what they saw in the Voyager pictures .
" The longevity of the hexagon makes this something special , given that weather on Earth lasts on the order of weeks , " said Kunio Sayanagi , a Cassini imaging team associate at the California Institute of Technology .
" It 's a mystery on par with the strange weather conditions that give rise to the long - lived Great Red Spot of Jupiter . "
The hexagon was originally discovered in images taken by the Voyager spacecraft in the early 1980s .
It encircles Saturn at about 77 degrees north latitude and has been estimated to have a diameter wider than two Earths .
The jet stream is believed to whip along the hexagon at around 100 meters per second ( 220 miles per hour ) .
Early hexagon images from Voyager and ground - based telescopes suffered from poor viewing perspectives .
Cassini , which has been orbiting Saturn since 2004 , has a better angle for viewing the north pole .
But the long darkness of Saturnian winter hid the hexagon from Cassini 's visible - light cameras for years .
Infrared instruments , however , were able to obtain images by using heat patterns .
Those images showed the hexagon is nearly stationary and extends deep into the atmosphere .
They also discovered a hotspot and cyclone in the same region .
The visible - light cameras of Cassini 's imaging science subsystem , which have higher resolution than the infrared instruments and the Voyager cameras , got their long - awaited glimpse of the hexagon in January , as the planet approached equinox .
Imaging team scientists calibrated and stitched together 55 images to create a mosaic and three - frame movie .
The mosaics do not show the region directly around the north pole because it had not yet fully emerged from winter night at that time .
Scientists are still trying to figure out what causes the hexagon , where it gets and expels its energy and how it has stayed so organized for so long .
They plan to search the new images for clues , taking an especially close look at the newly identified waves that radiate from the corners of the hexagon -- where the jet takes its hardest turns -- and the multi-walled structure that extends to the top of Saturn 's cloud layer in each of the hexagon 's six sides .
Scientists are also particularly intrigued by a large dark spot that appeared in a different position in a previous infrared image from Cassini .
In the latest images , the spot appears in the 2 o'clock position .
Because Saturn does not have land masses or oceans on its surface to complicate weather the way Earth does , its conditions should give scientists a more elementary model to study the physics of circulation patterns and atmosphere , said Kevin Baines , an atmospheric scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , who has studied the hexagon with Cassini 's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer .
" Now that we can see undulations and circular features instead of blobs in the hexagon , we can start trying to solve some of the unanswered questions about one of the most bizarre things we 've ever seen in the solar system , " Baines said .
" Solving these unanswered questions about the hexagon will help us answer basic questions about weather that we 're still asking about our own planet . "

According to Oxford University 's professor of evolutionary anthropology , Robin Dunbar , after you have amassed 150 friends on Facebook , any more are meaningless because the human brain can only remember 150 meaningful relationships anyway .
Professor Dunbar says this number applies to different societies and has remained unchanged throughout history .
In the 1990s Professor Dunbar developed a theory that the volume of the neocortex , the part of the brain involved with language and conscious thought , can only manage active relationships with around 150 friends — Dunbar ’s Number — regardless of how many friends a person has either online or offline .
On sites like Facebook , MySpace and Bebo , it is easy to collect 1,500 “ friends ” or more , but Dunbar said that when you examine the traffic , people maintain relationships only with an inner circle of no more than 150 people , as they do outside the online environment .
Dunbar reached the value of Dunbar ’s number by studying a wide range of societies throughout history , including social circles from Neolithic and Roman times , to the modern office , and in non-human primates .
The value of 150 is an approximation and there is no precise value , but Dunbar found that social groups larger than around this number tended to splinter .
Professor Dunbar ’s findings are backed up by Cameron Marlow , a research scientist with Facebook , who said last year he had found Facebook users only communicate regularly with a small core of their listed friends .
In a study to be published later this year , Professor Dunbar applied his theory to Facebook to find out if Dunbar ’s Number was exceeded in the online environment .
To do this , he compared the traffic at the site of people with thousands of friends to those with hundreds or less , and found there was no discernible difference between them .
His findings suggest Dunbar ’s Number is not exceeded , and the brain cannot expand its ability to have meaningful relationships with more people , even in the virtual world .
Dunbar defined a meaningful relationship as one in which you contact people at least annually , and in which you understand the relationships between the person and others in your circle of friends .
Dunbar ’s findings also showed women were better than men at maintaining Facebook relationships , which Dunbar said suggested women could relate to friends just by “ talking ” to each other , while males need to “ do physical stuff together . ”
Psychologists warning that sites like Facebook produce insecurity through encouraging a “ friendship addiction , ” or an urge to amass a large number of friends to prove people are popular , will no doubt welcome Professor Dunbar ’s findings .

Shell has said the future remains uncertain
Anglo -Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell has reported its quarterly profit fell sharply , and warns the outlook remains " very uncertain " .
The company said profit for the three months to September fell 73 % to $ 3bn ( £ 1.8 bn ) from a year earlier .
" We are not expecting a quick recovery , " Shell chief executive Peter Voser said .
BP , its UK rival , this week reported its third - quarter profits were well ahead of expectations .
Oil prices
Global crude prices hit a record $ 147 a barrel last year , before falling back as the world recession took hold .
US light crude is currently at $ 77 after a big drop this week .
Shell said its oil and gas production for the third quarter was 2.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day , similar to the same quarter last year .
" We see some indications that energy demand and pricing are improving , but the outlook remains very uncertain , " Mr Voser said .
The company said it had reduced costs by $ 1bn in the first nine months of the year .
Beating expectations
Europe 's biggest oil firm also said net profit was $ 3.25 bn , compared to $ 8.45 bn in the same quarter a year ago .
That beat analyst predictions of about $ 2.4bn .
Meanwhile , sales fell 43 % to $ 75bn .
Shell said its cost reduction programme - started earlier this year - will see 5,000 employees leave Shell in 2009 , representing a 10 % cut in those divisions .
" Our strategy remains on track , although the near - term industry outlook remains challenging , " Mr Voser added .
US competitors Exxon Mobil , the world 's largest oil company , and Chevron will also report their results this week .

I read an interesting article in the New York Times a while back called “ Beauty and the Bento Box ”
It talks mostly about Japanese culture , and how they as a society have always had to get by on less natural resources so the culture evolved into making do with very little .
John Maeda writes :
The “ more ” is simply the addition of visual or tactile aesthetic features that may range from the subtle to overt .
Have a small block of wood ?
Make it red so that it stands out more .
Or cut out a notch randomly into the block for a curious shape that ’s more interesting to examine with your hands .
Make one side smooth and the others rough so there ’s more contrast .
Create a hollow space in the block to house a bell inside .
This is a natural reflex among artists and designers .
By combining critical thinking with critical making , the humble block of wood transcends its simplicity by the addition of idea of an unexpected nature .
John Maeda is the president of the Rhode Island School of Design and author of “ The Laws of Simplicity . ”
Minimalism craves beauty
And it started me thinking about why we care about design .
We want the little things that we purchase , to be an all - in - one : beautiful , functional , and simple to use .
As a minimalist , I want everything that I buy to be exactly what I want , but also pleasing to look at .
Look at the new Apple Magic
Mouse that released earlier this year for $ 69 :
It ’s beautiful .
I can not think of a more minimalist design .
Sleek , wireless , no buttons , and just a touch pad on the mouse .
If I was in a market for a mouse , I ’d certainly try this one out first .
Having limited resources means a necessity for beauty
If you have very little money , whatever you save up to buy , must be the perfect item .
In my Apple Magic Mouse example above , if I wanted a mouse , I should just buy the Magic Mouse and be done with it .
Sure , it may be $ 59 more expensive than a cheap $ 10 plastic mouse in the Bargain bin , but if I were to go cheap on the ONE mouse I hope to ever own , I would crave for a second , nicer mouse .
Then a third mouse .
And finally , I will eventually end up buying the original Magic Mouse I wanted in the first place .
It is so contrary to being a minimalist , collecting all of these substitutes , that you might as well save up the money to buy what you actually want , rather than to fill your life with knock offs .
You will also waste money along the way , spending $ 10 , then $ 20 , then $ 30 , and finally $ 69 for a grand total of $ 129 when you could have just bought the original item you wanted ( and needed ! ) .
Make less , look like much , much more with aesthetics
You eat with your eyes first .
Beauty does n’t just exist in physical goods , but in food as well .
This is where the Japanese excel , by making bento boxes , or highly decorative food lunches such as the one shown below :
If you were to grab the entire lunch and throw it onto a single plate , all mixed and mashed together , it would seem like a hearty plate of food , but not nearly as satisfying .
Or how about sushi ?
If you look at some decorative sushi , it almost takes your breath away with how delicate and beautiful it is .
Sure , you could just mix cut pieces of fish , slap some rice on top of it , and rip up some seaweed to go over top , but the experience of the meal will not be as satisfying .
Plating the dish and creating a feast for the eyes first , is something all chefs understand .
You can make a small little appetizer look like much more , when it is plated and presented correctly .
And a simple teapot ?
Perhaps it can double as decoration as well .

Looking for aesthetics forces us to consider the choices we make
In today ’s Programming Praxis problem we have to implement John Pollard ’s factorization algorithm .
Our target is 16 lines ( I ’m not counting the code for the primality test , since we did that already ) .
First , we ’re going to need to reuse the code from the Miller - Rabin primality test exercise , since we need to determine whether or not the number is prime :
import Control .
Arrow import Data .
Bits import Data .
List import System .
Random is Prime :: Integer -> StdGen ->
Bool is Prime n g = let ( s , d ) = ( length *** head ) . span even $ iterate ( ` div ` 2 ) ( n - 1 ) xs = map ( expm n d ) .
take 50 $ randomRs ( 2 , n - 2 ) g in all ( \x -> elem x [ 1 , n - 1 ] || any ( == n - 1 ) ( take s $ iterate ( expm n 2 ) x ) ) xs expm :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer ->
Integer expm m e b = foldl ' ( \r ( b ' , _ ) -> mod ( r * b ') m ) 1 . filter ( flip testBit 0 . snd ) . zip ( iterate ( flip mod m . ( ^ 2 ) ) b ) $ takeWhile (> 0 ) $ iterate ( `shiftR` 1 ) e
There ’s not much more to the factor function than simply writing down the algorithm .
It ’s just math with Haskell syntax , really .
The only thing you have to take care of is not to calculate gcd ( x - y ) n when x and y are still 2 , since that will give you an incorrect result .
factor :: Integer -> Integer ->
Integer factor c n = factor ' 2 2 1 where f x = mod ( x * x + c ) n factor ' x y 1 = factor ' x ' y ' ( gcd ( x ' - y ') n ) where ( x ' , y ') = ( f x , f $ f y ) factor ' _ _ d = if d == n then factor ( c + 1 ) n else d
And factors does little more than recursively calling factor , while filtering out factors of two and making sure not to call factor on a prime ( since the algorithm is not designed for that ) .
factors :: Integer -> StdGen -> [
Integer ] factors n g = sort $ fs n where fs x | even x = 2 : fs ( div x 2 ) | is Prime x g = [ x ] | otherwise = f : fs ( div x f ) where f = factor 1 x
And to test :
main :: IO ( ) main = print .
factors ( 2 ^ 98 - 1 ) =<< getStdGen
The end result is 9 lines of code , which was to be expected , given that it ’s just a question of writing math in your language ’s syntax .

Howard Dean : Health Care Bill ' Bigger Bailout for the Insurance Industry Than AIG ' Former Democratic leader urges lawmakers to kill the bill and start over .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 16 , 2009  -- President Obama said he likes the Senate health care compromise and wants it passed by Christmas , but he faces a revolt from some liberals who say the health care bill has been gutted to appease insurance companies .
" This is a bigger bailout for the insurance industry than AIG , " former Democratic National Committee chairman and medical doctor Howard Dean told " Good Morning America 's " George Stephanopoulos today .
" A very small number of people are going to get any insurance at all , until 2014 , if the bill works .
" This is an insurance company 's dream , this bill , " Dean continued .
" This is the Washington scramble , and I think it 's ill - advised . "
Dean sent shockwaves when he said Tuesday in an interview with Vermont Public Radio that the removal of the Medicare buy - in means Democrats should just kill the health care bill and start over .
" This is essentially the collapse of health care reform in the United States Senate , " Dean said .
" Honestly , the best thing to do right now is kill the Senate bill , go back to the House , start the reconciliation process , where you only need 51 votes and it would be a much simpler bill . "
The former Democratic presidential candidate argues that in the rush to pass a health care bill , lawmakers have essentially stripped it of true reforms -- mainly the choices it would give to people -- and given too much to special interest groups and insurance companies , the chief executives of which , Dean says , would get 27 percent of the money Americans contribute .
" We 've gotten to this stage ... in Washington where passing any bill is a victory , and that 's the problem , " Dean said .
" Decisions are being about the long - term future of this country for short - term political reasons , and that 's never a good sign . "
He said he also does n't see cost - control measures but , rather " a whole bunch of bureaucracies and a lot of promises . "
There are some good elements in the current health care bill , Dean said , but " at this point , the bill does more harm than good . "
The former Vermont governor said he would suggest using money allocated for community health centers and wellness and prevention programs to help people buy insurance and that less power be transferred into the hands of the private insurance companies .
Dean , who said he believes the bill will pass the Senate , initially supported health care legislation .
" I 've been involved in this all along .
I put up with a lot of stuff I did n't like because I thought at the end of the day what was good about the bill outweighed what 's bad about the bill , " Dean said .
" I do n't believe that anymore . "
Democratic leaders in the Senate argue that even without the option of expanding Medicare or providing government - run insurance to compete with the private sector , the bill will still cover millions of uninsured Americans and is worth passing .
" I disagree with Howard Dean , " Sen . Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , said Tuesday in an interview with ABC News .
" Howard Dean is a medical doctor .
He has to know what it will mean when 30 million Americans are finally going to have health insurance , that peace of mind and protection for the first time in their lives .
For many of them , that is a dramatic step forward . "
Democrats Divided on Health Care Bill
On Tuesday , following a meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House , Obama urged Democrats to find a consensus , saying the time for bickering is over .
" I am absolutely confident that if the American people know what 's in this bill , and the Senate knows what 's in this bill , it will pass , because it 's right for America , " the president said .
" We simply cannot allow differences over individual elements of this plan to prevent us from meeting our responsibility to solve a longstanding and urgent problem for the American people .
They are waiting for us to act . "
White House officials say Obama made the case to Democrats that this might be the last chance to make progress on health care overhaul before the 2010 elections , and before his political capital possibly diminishes later in his first term .
For congressional Democrats , deep differences remain on the so - called Medicare buy - in , which , if included , would have allowed Americans between the ages of 55 and 64 to buy into Medicare .
However , the central tenets of that compromise reached last week between Democrats were stripped from the bill because of the objections of independent Sen .
Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , who said he would not support the legislation if it contained that option " because it reportedly has some of the same infirmities that the public option did . "
Democratic leaders need Lieberman 's vote to avoid a Republican filibuster , but liberals are unhappy , saying the bill has been gutted to please one senator .
All eyes are also on Sen. Ben Nelson , D - Neb. , whose amendment to impose tighter regulations on abortion coverage was voted down earlier this month .
Democrats are counting on his support to get the needed 60 votes but he has not said how he will vote .
There 's unlikely to be any Republican support .
Even moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine , who had been working with Democrats for months , said she can't support the bill in its current form .
The U.S. Supreme Court , acting on an appeal from conservative defenders of California ’s ban on same - sex marriage , overruled a federal judge in San Francisco today and blocked video coverage of the trial on YouTube .
In a brief order , the justices said they were halting the move by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker “ permitting real - time streaming ” of the trial , “ except as it permits streaming to other rooms within the confines of the courthouse in which the trial is to be held . ”
“ Any additional order permitting broadcast of the proceedings is also stayed pending further order of this court , ” the justices said .
They added that the temporary order “ will remain in effect until Wednesday , Jan. 13 . ”
The high court did not explain its reasoning .
Only Justice Stephen G. Breyer , a San Francisco native , dissented .
“ In my view , the court ’s standard for granting a stay is not met ” in this case , he wrote .
“ In particular , the papers filed , in my view , do not show a likelihood of ‘ irreparable harm . ’ ”
Under the court ’s rules , lawyers can seek an emergency order only if they can show their clients will suffer “ irreparable harm ” if the justices fail to act .
In this case , the defenders of Prop. 8 said their witnesses could be subjected to harassment and intimidation if they testified in favor of the ban on marriage for gay and lesbian couples .
On Sunday , the attorneys challenging Prop. 8 urged the court to turn down the appeal and to allow video coverage .
They said millions of Californians and others are interested in the proceedings and the public had a right to know what was taking place in its courtrooms .
Recently , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals allowed some TV coverage of civil trials .
And based on that move , Judge Walker decided to allow YouTube to post video after each day ’s proceedings .
This is the second time in recent months in which the high court has intervened on behalf of the defenders of “ traditional marriage ” and granted an emergency appeal .
In October , the justices blocked officials in the state of Washington from releasing the names of 138,000 people who signed ballot petitions seeking to overturn a state law giving equal benefits to gay and lesbian couples .
Under Washington law , the names were considered public record .
But attorney James Bopp told the high court that the signers of these petitions could be subjected to harassment if their names were revealed .
And the court granted an order blocking the release .

Tuesday evening ’s debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden failed to draw an audience as big as the presidential debate opener between then - candidate Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , dropping 36 percent , preliminary results reveal .
Tricking GHC into evaluating recursive functions at compile time
Here is a trick I came up with for a project of mine .
Suppose you have a GADT like this very simple one :
data T a where TInt :: Int -> T Int TPair :: T a -> T b -> T ( a , b )
and a function which does something with it :
sumT :: T a ->
Int sumT ( TInt n ) = n sumT ( TPair l r ) = sumT l + sumT r
Now , let ’s use the two :
term = TPair ( TPair ( TInt 1 ) ( TInt 2 ) ) ( TInt 3 ) foo = sumT term
Since foo is constant , we would expect GHC to evaluate it at compile time and just bind it to 6 in the compiled code , right ?
Wrong !
For this to happen , GHC would have to inline sumT .
But sumT is a recursive function and GHC never inlines those because it might get into an infinite loop otherwise .
This means that it wo n’t optimise foo at all which was absolutely unacceptable in my program .
I spent about two days fiddling with inline pragmas , rewrite rules and other unpleasant things until I found a satisfactory solution .
My first attempt was to only inline sumT if it is applied to a constructor .
We could try adding a couple of rewrite rules .
" sumT / TInt " forall n. sumT ( TInt n ) = n " sumT / TPair " forall l r. sumT ( TPair l r ) = sumT l + sumT r
Alas , this does n’t work most of time .
Basically , trying to match on non-trivial constructors in rewrite rules is never a good idea .
We could introduce “ virtual ” constructors , use them everywhere instead of the real ones and match on them .
tInt :: Int ->
T Int {-# NOINLINE CONLIKE tInt #-} tInt = TInt tPair :: T a -> T b -> T ( a , b ) {-# NOINLINE CONLIKE tPair #-} tPair = TPair " sumT / tInt " forall n. sumT ( tInt n ) = n " sumT / tPair " forall l r. sumT ( tPair l r ) = sumT l + sumT r
This works much better but , unfortunately , still fails in my program .
There , I make extensive use of type families so the Core generated by GHC has casts all over the place .
Casts make rule matching highly unreliable because rules do n’t ignore them ( a particularly ugly wart that I keep running into ) .
So what to do ?
The solution I came up with requires adding a unit component to every recursive constructor .
data T a where TInt :: Int -> T Int TPair :: ( ) -> T a -> T b -> T ( a , b )
Where we previously wrote TPair , we will now write TPair ( ) .
In fact , let ’s provide a convenience function for that :
t Pair :: T a -> T b -> T ( a , b ) tPair = TPair ()
Now , we define a non-recursive version of sumT which is parametrised with a function it is supposed to apply to the pair components .
sumT_cont :: ( forall a . ( ) -> T a -> Int ) ->
T a ->
Int {-# INLINE sumT_cont #-} sumT_cont cont ( TInt n ) = n sumT_cont cont ( TPair u l r ) = cont u l + cont u r
Note that since sumT_cont is n’t recursive it can be freely inlined .
Note also that we pass the unit value from the constructor to cont .
This is absolutely essential .
The actual recursive sum is defined via sumT_cont .
Of course , it has to be parametrised with ( ) ( which it ignores ) .
sumT ' :: ( ) -> T a -> Int sumT ' _ = sumT_cont sumT ' sumT :: T a ->
Int {-# INLINE sumT # -} sumT = sumT ' ()
The final missing piece that makes the whole thing work is this simple rewrite rule :
" sumT ' " sumT ' ( ) = sumT_cont sumT '
It “ inlines ” sumT ' but only if it is applied to ( ) .
Why is this useful ?
Let ’s see what happens if we apply sumT to a term which GHC knows nothing about :
sumT x = {inline sumT} sumT ' ( ) x = {apply rule " sumT ' " } sumT_cont sumT ' x = {inline sumT_cont} case x of TInt n -> n TPair u l r -> sumT ' u l + sumT ' u r
Rewriting sumT ' to sumT_cont sumT ’ again would be a disaster as it would put us into an infinite rewriting loop .
This is precisely the reason why GHC wo n’t inline recursive functions .
But our rule does n’t match here because u is not guaranteed to be ( ) !
So what happens if we apply sumT to a term that is at least partially static ?
sumT ( tPair ( tInt 1 ) y ) = {inline sumT and tPair} sumT ' () ( TPair ( ) ( TInt 1 ) y ) = {apply rule " sumT ' " } sumT_cont sumT ' ( TPair ( ) ( TInt 1 ) y ) = {inline sumT_cont} case TPair () ( TInt 1 ) y of TInt n -> n TPair u l r -> sumT ' u l + sumT ' u r = {eliminate case} sumT ' () ( TInt 1 ) + sumT ' ( ) y = {apply rule " sumT ' " twice} sumT_cont sumT ' ( TInt 1 ) + sumT_cont sumT ' y = {inline sumT_cont , eliminate case} 1 + case y of TInt n -> n TPair u l r -> sumT ' u l + sumT ' u r
This looks good !
In effect , GHC executed sumT for the statically known portion of the term at compile time and deferred the rest to run time .
This worked because when it eliminated the case on TPair it bound u in the case alternative to ( ) .
This allowed it to apply the " sumT ' " rule again and thus to get rid of the TInt constructor in the left component .
The right component is unknown , though , so rewriting stops there .
In general , after “ inlining ” ( via the rewrite rule ) sumT ' once , GHC will only apply the rule again if it eliminates the case , thus binding u to ( ) .
This , in turn , is only possible if the head of the term is a known constructor so GHC will continue rewriting and inlining until it consumes all known constructors but will not get into an infinite loop .
For foo from my first example , which is fully constant , it will perform the entire computation at compile time and reduce it to 6 .
A word of warning : it is possible to get GHC into an infinite loop with this approach by constructing infinite but statically known terms .
For instance , we could apply the same technique to this type .
data U = UInt Int | UPair U U
But now , this term gets us into trouble :
x = UPair ( UInt 1 ) x
This technique works best with GADTs like T that do not admit infinite terms .

November 1 , 1959 was , like today , a Sunday .
In those days the NFL was no threat so every Sunday the NHL always scheduled a full slate of three (! ) games , all of them stateside .
( This was so long ago Canadian laws restricted profit - making ventures on Sundays , so the Leafs and Canadiens always played at home against American squads on Saturday , then took a train across the border , frequently for a return engagement against the same opponent . )
On this Sunday it was a fairly typical sked for the old six - team loop : Toronto at Boston , Chicago at Detroit , Montreal at New York .
Seemingly a routine early season contest , the latter was to become one of the most famous , and iconic , games in NHL history .
The Canadiens were the class of the league that fall .
Riding a 7 - game unbeaten run , they were already well on their way to their third straight Prince of Wales Trophy and more importantly , their fifth consecutive Stanley Cup .
Maurice ( Rocket )
Richard 's great career was winding down in style , but the squad was loaded with prime time players in every position : up front snipers Jean Beliveau , Dickie Moore , and Bernie ( Boom Boom ) Geoffrion , who each led the league in goals and points at various stages of their careers ; all - around threat Henri Richard , the Pocket Rocket , who twice led the loop in assists ; checker extraordinaire Claude Provost ; on the blue the great Doug Harvey , the Nick Lidstrom of his day who was in the middle of a run of 7 Norris Trophies in 8 years ; and his partner Tom Johnson , who won the Norris the year Harvey did n't .
Backing them all up was Jacques Plante , perhaps the greatest goaltender of his time and certainly the one blessed with the best team in front of him .
Plante was en route to his fifth consecutive Vezina Trophy to complement those five straight Stanley Cups .
A quirky loner who was thought to be something of a hypochondriac , Plante was one of the most innovative , influential goaltenders in the history of the position .
Think of him as the Dominik Hasek of his era .
He was an early pioneer in wandering from the crease to handle the puck , now an essential tool in every goalie 's kit .
Later he became an outspoken advocate of having a second goalie on every roster .
But in 1959 each club still carried just a single goaltender , a fact which was central to the events that transpired that Sunday evening in MSG .
The Rangers were no match for the mighty Habs .
Destined to finish dead last , 15 long points behind the fifth - place Bruins , the Rangers ' lone star was reigning Hart Trophy winner Andy Bathgate .
On this night , however , Bathgate had more on his mind than scoring .
In a recent candid interview , Bathgate describes being tripped face - first into the boards by Plante a couple of weeks earlier .
He was considerably less than impressed , and decided he would get even when the chance presented itself .
Just 3:06 into the first period , it did .
Bathgate lifted a shot from a bad angle right into the goalie 's bare face , slicing him open and spilling copious amounts of blood over his white road jersey .
Plante was carried from the ice ; with no backup goalie in sight , the game waited for him to return .
21 minutes later Plante was back , sporting a few more stitches and a new piece of equipment : a fibreglass face mask .
He had been trying it out in practice for some time , but Habs coach Toe Blake had refused to allow him to wear it in a game .
Plante , cut yet again , decided to call Blake 's bluff and refused to return to the game without the facial protection .
In an unfriendly city with no other options available , Blake had no choice but to relent .
Already riding a hot roll in which he had allowed just 7 goals the previous 6 games , Plante won that game 3 - 1 .
Still wearing the mask as his face healed , he won the next game 8 - 2 , then tied a third 2 - 2 .
He then proceeded to win 8 more games in a row , allowing just 8 goals in the process .
The masked man posted a record of 10 - 0 - 1 that November -- all regulation wins , mind -- with a minuscule 1.18 GAA .
The questions about the mask , about vision , about comfort , about courage , started to melt away as the Habs ' unbeaten run reached a staggering 18 games , with Plante allowing 2 goals or fewer in the last 17 of those games .
Even when the streak inevitably ended Plante 's stellar play continued .
The great sportswriter Scott Young ( father of Neil ) described the memorable game that ended the winning streak in his classic book of that era , The Leafs I Knew :
December 2
A man on the way out of the Gardens tonight was holding a bug - eyed little boy by the hand and telling him , " You 'll never see as good a game as that one . "
I hope he 's wrong , because the young fellow has a long life ahead , and never is a long , long time .
But it was the sort of game that made conversation go in superlatives .
One other man who has been watching hockey for a long time told me it was the best game he'd ever seen .
When the sound came whooping down the long alive slopes of faces from the greys , high in the eaves , to the mink and camel hair in the reds and rails , there was in the sound the high emotion of the best in the game .
Go , Leafs , Go! they shouted .
When a line went on and another came off , the fans clapped their hands and cheered .
They cheered the goalkeeper , Johnny Bower , when the mighty Canadiens came in and fired and he beat them standing , sitting , sliding and once in a while doing the breast stroke .
They cheered , by refraction , the man in the mask at the other end , Jacques Plante , because when a Toronto player made a great play on the Montreal goal and Plante beat him , it became two great plays in one , and this happened quite often .
If a man missed forty seconds at the beginning of a period ( found himself so weak from excitement he had to hire a caddy to help carry his peanuts ) , he would miss five mighty OH - H -H - Hs !
In short , it was some hockey game .
Canadiens had n't lost a game for forty - six days and it took an especially good team to beat them 1 - 0 , Mahovlich getting the goal from the edge of the crease .
By then the mask was here to stay .
Although Plante was n't the first netminder to experiment with one -- the great Clint Benedict had worn a leather mask for the last few games of his career three decades previously -- he was the first to " buy in " to the concept and stuck to his convictions for the rest of his storied career .
Grudgingly others began to follow suit , although it was three years before another goaltending legend of the day , Terry Sawchuk , donned the headgear in 1962 .
When I started to watch the game in the spring of ' 63 , Plante , Sawchuk , and Leafs reserve goalie Don Simmons were a growing minority who wore facial protection , while other goaltending stars of the era -- Glenn Hall , Johnny Bower , Ed Johnston , Gump Worsley -- remained resolutely bare - faced .
In an era where virtually every skater was also bare - headed , there was no small fascination in watching these masked men ply their trade .
My personal memories of Plante are pretty extensive for a guy who was supposedly on the downside of his career by the time I tuned in .
My first playoff series was his last in Montreal , a comprehensive blowout by the Leafs punctuated by a 5 - 0 finale in Game 5 .
Just one year removed from his Hart Trophy season ( the next goaltender to do so would be Hasek , 35 years later ) , Plante was scapegoated and traded that off - season -- to New York of all places , in a multi-player deal that included the bare - faced Gump Worsley going the other way .
Plante endured two miserable seasons in MSG , and announced his retirement in 1965 .
He was far from done , however ; three years later he made a triumphant return to expansionist St. Louis Blues , where he shared goaltending duties with another aging great , the now - masked Glenn Hall .
The two shared the Vezina Trophy -- Plante 's seventh -- while the man many called Jake the Snake led the NHL with a sparkling 1.96 GAA .
Plante returned to the Stanley Cup Finals in both 1969 and 1970 but the Blues could not break through against the powerhouse Canadiens and Bruins .
In the '70 SCF Plante was beaned by a Phil Esposito shot which knocked him out of the series .
Ever the drama queen , he claimed the mask saved his life on that occasion .
Plante moved on to Toronto , where in 1970 - 71 he again improbably led the NHL with a remarkable 1.88 GAA .
To put that in perspective , his primary backup , Bruce Gamble , was at 3.87 .
Plante therefore led the NHL in GAA with three different teams in three different decades .
Late that season , the Leafs acquired the fine young goaltender Bernie Parent , an avowed Plante disciple who apprenticed under the master for a year and a half .
One interesting event occurred in the 1971 playoffs in ( wait for it ) Madison Square Garden , when Parent refused to complete a game after a brawl in which his mask was thrown into the crowd .
Rather than play bare - faced , Parent deferred to the original masked man to finish up the 4 - 1 Leafs win .
Plante remained a fierce advocate for goaltender safety .
Around 1970 the league was toying with a cockamamie idea to allow a " free face - off " if the defensive team froze the puck .
It was n't a penalty shot , but the goalie was to be confined to his crease while an opponent stepped up and potentially let one rip from the dot .
The savvy Plante called the league 's bluff , saying that if he had to face such a shot from the likes of Bobby Hull , he would simply " step aside rather than be a target in a shooting gallery " .
Faced with the potential embarrassment of such a ( non ) encounter , the league dropped the idea quicker than you can say " hot potato " .
After winding his NHL career down with a few games in Boston late in the 1972 - 73 season , Plante took another year off before being coaxed out of retirement yet again for a swan song with the Edmonton Oilers of the WHA in 1974 - 75 .
He played and won the first ever game played in Edmonton Coliseum ( now Rexall Place ) , 4 - 1 over Cleveland Crusaders and another famously masked man , Gerry Cheevers .
I did n't have the pleasure of attending that sold - out affair , but I did watch the 46 - year - old Plante play a number of games later that season .
He had some sort of sweetheart deal where he played almost all of his games at home and rarely travelled with the team .
The result was the ultimate three - headed monster in goal , where Chris Worthy led the team in Minutes Played , Ken Brown in Games Played , and Jacques Plante in decisions .
I 'd bet good money that has never happened before or since in any league .
One particularly memorable game occurred after the Edmonton Spring Rodeo , a precursor to the Canadian Finals Rodeo which has been held every year of the Coliseum 's existence .
But the first year was an adventure of trial and error .
The dirt was put right over the ice , and removed after the final event on Sunday afternoon for a hockey game that night .
Fans coming to the first game after the Oilers ' outrageous road trip -- it was their 14th game in 21 nights , no two in a row in any one place -- entered to the spectacle of a badly stained ice surface .
We waited and waited as the Zamboni did round after round after endless round of the ice .
The PA guy assured us every few minutes to be patient , " the game will be played this evening " .
About two hours later much of the worst had been cleaned up , and the players finally came out for the pre-game skate to a loud cheer .
But the warm - up lasted only a couple of minutes .
Ever the safety marshall , Jacques Plante was appalled that he could n't properly see the pucks being shot from certain areas of the ice , and informed the referee of his refusal to play under those conditions .
It was close to 10 o'clock that the game was formally postponed to the next night .
Ticket holders could get a refund or use their stubs to see the rescheduled game .
To make matters much , much worse , those of us diehards who chose to come back were subjected to an absolute stinker of a game , as the exhausted Oilers put on a listless performance in a 5 - 2 loss to the mighty San Diego Mariners .
Before the first period was half over , the catcalls had begun : " Can we STILL get our money back ? "
What a fiasco ... but the last person this former goalie was going to blame was Jacques Plante .
Under the ridiculous circumstances , he did the only sane thing .
Safety first .
So , there are two nagging issues surrounding Thermaltake 's awe - inspiring Level 10 enclosure .
First , it 's $ 850 and nearly impossible to find in stock ; second , you best know how to piece together a full - blown rig yourself , ' cause you wo n't find this beast hanging around at infrequently visited corners of Dell or HP .
Somehow or another , however , iBuyPower has managed to swoop in and remedy quandary number two .

Feel free to spec this one out ' til your heart 's content , but be mindful of that already - lofty $ 2,499 starting tag .
Tim Geithner has issued a Code Red on the U.S. dollar , but he does n’t think Americans can handle it .
I believe deeply that it ’s very important to the United States , to the economic health of the United States , that we maintain a strong dollar .
Secretary , I have just one more question .
If you gave an order that the dollar was n’t to be touched and your orders are always followed , then why would the dollar be in danger ?
I want the truth !
You ca n’t handle the truth !
I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom .
You weep for the dollar , you curse the U.S. Government .
You have that luxury .
You have the luxury of not knowing what I know – that the dollar ’s death , while tragic , probably saved lives .
And , my existence , while grotesque and incomprehensible to you , saves lives .
I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it .
Did you order the Code Red ?
You ’re goddamn right I did .

Government axes family violence initiatives
15 December 2009
Media Statement
Government axes family violence initiatives
The Government today appeared to confirm it is axing two widely heralded family violence initiatives , which is a pretty tragic Christmas present for those working to reduce violence in our homes , says Labour Social Development spokesperson Annette King .
“ Social Development Minister Paula Bennett confirmed that funding set aside last year for Independent Victim Advocates in all Family Courts has been canned .
“ This is a terrible , backwards step .
The Chief Family Court Judge Peter Boshier has repeatedly stressed the importance of such advocates in these courts , labelling them ‘ vital ingredients ’ .
“ The advocate positions were created in response to research identifying they would help improve the effectiveness of domestic violence protection orders .
They would provide support and assistance to victims of domestic violence and help to reduce their chances of re-victimisation , ” says Annette King .
“ Paula Bennett also appeared to confirm that the Government is to axe funding for the hugely successful “ It ’s Not OK ” family violence campaign .
“ This too is a tragedy .
Figures highlighted by the Families Commission in April this year show the campaign has been one of the most successful ever mounted in New Zealand .
“ They showed that a recent survey found that 99 per cent of Maori , and 90 per cent of Pacific Peoples recalled the campaign , and the overall retention rate was 90 per cent .
This was a great result .
“ The research also showed there has been increased reporting of family violence as a result , which also shows the impact of the campaign , designed to tackle one of our most serious social issues , ” Annette King says .
“ What on Earth is this Government up to ?
We ’re heading into Christmas , where incidents of family violence typically increase significantly and this is the Government ’s response ? ”

The crew were on their way to take part in the Dubai - Muscat yacht race Five British yachtsmen held by Iran 's Revolutionary Guard for a week have been released , the UK has confirmed .
The crew are said to have drifted into Iranian waters mistakenly while sailing from Bahrain to Dubai for a race .
Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the men had left the island of Siri and were heading for international waters .
A statement by the Revolutionary Guard said interrogations had revealed their " illegal entry " had been " a mistake " .
Relatives have told of their relief .
Luke Porter , 21 , from Weston - super - Mare , Somerset , Oliver Smith , 31 , from Southampton , Oliver Young , 21 , from Saltash , Cornwall , Sam Usher , 26 , from Scarborough , North Yorkshire , and Bahrain - based David Bloomer , who is believed to be in his 60s , were held on 25 November .
A Foreign Office statement said : " We understand that they are being towed to international waters and will be met by a representative from the sailing company . "
The BBC has spoken to Nick Crabtree , the Sail Bahrain team leader , who is on - board the yacht with the sailors .
He said they are currently being towed to Dubai on their yacht and that all are well and safe and in good condition .

Iranian radio said the five had been freed at 0730 local time ( 0400 GMT ) .
Iran 's official IRNA news agency said they had been released after an interrogation by authorities established that their yacht had entered Iranian waters accidentally .
A statement by Iran 's Revolutionary Guard said : " After carrying out an investigation and interrogation of the five British sailors , it became clear that their illegal entry was a mistake .
" After obtaining necessary guarantees , it was decided to release them . "
Mr Miliband told reporters it had been " a purely consular case " and said he was pleased that the matter had been dealt with in a " professional and straightforward way " by the Iranian authorities .
ANALYSIS By Jon Leyne , BBC Tehran correspondent
At the best of times , the Iranian government suspects the outside world is preoccupied with trying to undermine it .
That obsession has come close to paranoia , as Iran takes on the West over its nuclear programme .
Within the Iranian government , there is also likely to have been some discussion over whether the captured British yachtsmen could be exploited for propaganda purposes , as the Royal Navy sailors and Marines were when they were held two years ago .
Iran must have decided not .

He added : " Obviously there 's been a real ordeal for the young men and for their families , and I 'm really delighted that it 's over for them and we can call the matter closed . "
The Prime Minister 's spokesman said Gordon Brown had been kept closely informed of developments and was " pleased " that the yachtsmen had been released .
" It was dealt with in a quiet , diplomatic way , which is entirely right , and the result is that the yachtsmen are free , " the spokesman added .
Beverley Porter , Luke 's mother , praised the hard work of the Foreign Office and offered " grateful thanks to Iran for seeing it as it was - just human error " .
She added : " The boys never meant to be there in the first place .
" Thankfully , Iran have seen it that way . "
Her husband Charles said he believed his son " will have done very well , he will have held it together and been very strong " .
David Young , Oliver 's father , said he was " very relieved , obviously " .
He added : " We thought this would be over quickly , and this is what we were hoping for . "
Sam Usher 's fiancee , Nicola Drayton , said the hardest part of the ordeal had been " not knowing where they are , not having contact with them " .
She added : " We 'll be very , very glad to get them home . "
Sam 's mum Sue Stroud added that " there will be some tears of joy " when the crew return to the UK .
In a statement , Oliver Smith 's father , Edwin , of Walton - on - Thames , Surrey , said he was " tremendously relieved that this whole affair has been dealt with properly " .
' Lightning - fast '
The news comes hours after Mr Miliband spoke by phone to his Iranian counterpart .
The five were detained after the Revolutionary Guard stopped their Volvo 60 yacht , called The Kingdom of Bahrain , in the Gulf on 25 November .
The BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne said the investigation had been " lightning - fast " by Iranian standards .
Bahrain - based yachtsman David Bloomer is among those released The Team Pindar - backed yacht was sailing from Bahrain to Dubai to take part in the Dubai - Muscat Offshore Race .
The 360 - nautical mile Dubai- Muscat Offshore Sailing Race began on 26 November and ended two days later in the Omani capital 's Bandar Al - Rawdah marina .
Race organisers said the five could have been " drifting " as a result of propeller problems .
The Kingdom of Bahrain yacht is owned by the Sail Bahrain project , which aims to promote the island as a yachting destination and was recently launched by Team Pindar .
Team Pindar is owned by G A Pindar & Son Ltd , a family owned print and publishing business based in Scarborough .
It is not the first time British sailors have been detained after being accused of straying into Iranian waters .
In March 2007 there was a prolonged stand - off between the UK and Iran after a 15 - strong Royal Navy crew was detained by Iran 's Revolutionary Guard .
And in 2004 , eight British servicemen were held in Iran after being seized in the Shatt al - Arab waterway , where they were training the Iraqi river patrol service .

Having junk in your trunk is healthier than a spare tire around the gut , new research suggests .
The extra padding on the backside and thighs could even help to protect against disease .
The results come from a review that summarizes various studies on the health effects of different fat stores in the body , particularly around the hips and thighs .
" The fact that body fat 's distribution is quite important for your health has been known for some time now , " said lead researcher Konstantinos Manolopoulos of the University of Oxford in England .
But this new article summarizes a body of research showing that such hip and thigh fat can help to reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease .
The review also suggests a mechanism for conveying those benefits .
The next step is to figure out how our bodies decide where to store fat , say , in the stomach versus the butt .
" Once this is understood then one could think about therapeutic approaches to make use of that , " Manolopoulos told LiveScience .
" Maybe to make use [ of it ] in a preventive way by redistributing the fat . "
Manolopoulos and his colleagues detail their findings this week in the International Journal of Obesity .
Fat not created equal
When looking through the studies , the researchers found that not all fat is created equal .
Stomach fat is considered more metabolically active than lower body fat .
While that may sound good , as this fat breaks down easily , the result is a release of substances called cytokines , which have been linked to cardiovascular disease , insulin resistance and diabetes .
In fact , research on mice reported in 2008 revealed that belly fat boosts inflammation and is linked with hardening of the arteries – known to increase the risk of heart attacks .
But scientists think lower body fat , like that around the hips and thighs , produces beneficial hormones that protect against these diseases , though more research is needed to firm up this expectation .
In addition , this lower body fat also traps fatty acids .
While this long - term storage can make it tricky to slim down your butt and thighs , it 's healthier for you if some fat stays put .
" If fatty acids are not stored in fat but are stored in other organs like the liver or the arteries this makes you prone to develop diabetes and heart disease , " Manolopoulos said .
He added , " One moment on the lips , forever on the hips .
It really is exactly this phenomenon ; the fat that goes there stays there , " on the hips and thighs .
Evidence of healthy butt fat
He says the most compelling evidence for the link comes from population studies showing the more fat individuals have in this hind area the less likely they are to develop diabetes and heart disease later in life .
Other evidence includes instances of Cushing 's syndrome , in which patients lose their hip and thigh fat while gaining stomach fat .
These patients are known to have an increased risk for diabetes and heart disease .
The scientists are n't sure how the body decides where to store fat , but it 's partially genetic .
That genetic force can be seen in the gender differences in how fat gets stored , with women having much more of the healthy , lower body fat than men .
And females have a much lower risk for heart disease , Manolopoulos said .
" As long as you are female and your hormones are female hormones you are protected from cardiovascular disease , " Manolopoulos said .
" The moment you go into menopause and your hormones change , you lose your typical female appearance and you gain stomach fat and at the same time your risk for heart disease and diabetes becomes comparable to men of the same age . "
When Amazon " sells " you a Kindle ebook , they do n't really sell it to you .
If you read the fine - print , you 'll see that they 're waving their hands furiously and declaring that you are n't " buying " the book , but rather " taking a license to a limited set of uses " for the book .
Whereas a book that you buy comes with all kinds of rights , such as the right to sell or give the book away ( Jeff Bezos : " [ W ] hen someone buys a book , they are also buying the right to resell that book , to loan it out , or to even give it away if they want .
Everyone understands this . " ) a book that you license from Amazon comes with a very small subset of those rights , as defined by a lengthy and difficult - to - grasp " license agreement . "
Despite all the fine print , most of us know that this is a scam .
Declaring a sale to be a license is ridiculous on its face ( imagine this : you finish a bowl of soup at the deli and when you get to the bottom of it , you find a EULA that says , " By eating this soup , you agree not to attempt to season your own soups in a similar fashion , nor to share this soup with any other person " ) .
It 's such a silly notion that even Amazon can't keep its story straight .
Take this press - release in which Amazon trumpets that its " customers purchased more Kindle books than physical books . "
Purchased , not " licensed . "
Or consider this ad ( courtesy of Elix ) : " Kindle publications are sold by Amazon Digital Services , Inc . "
Again , sold , not " licensed . "
( Yes , you can purchase a license .
But that 's not what the copy says .
It does n't say , " Amazon customers purchased limited licenses to more Kindle books … " )
It 's a rip - off , pure and simple .
And Amazon 's digital divisions wo n't let copyright owners get out from under it .
When I tried to negotiate the distribution of the Random House Audio edition of my novel Makers through Amazon 's Audible store , they refused to allow me to add legal text to the recording telling users that they could make any use of the audiobook that was permissible under copyright , negating their EULA .
In other words , Amazon is n't doing this because the publishers insist on it : even when my publisher , Random House , the largest publisher in the world , told them that they did n't want the crazy EULA , Amazon insisted .
Do n't get me wrong .
Amazon's " hard goods " business is the best ecommerce system in the world .
I did half my Christmas shopping there .
I buy everything from books to box - files from them .
They are customer - focused , efficient , and smart .
But I wo n't buy any of Amazon 's digital offerings until they clean up their act and deliver the same customer rights to e-goods buyers as they do to hard - goods buyers .
Quorn is made from mycoprotein and is a popular alternative to meat for many vegetarians or people who 're simply trying to cut down on their meat consumption .
However , unfortunately , this admittedly delicious and varied alternative to meat contains milk and eggs - this makes it unsuitable for vegans .
The dairy and egg industries contain just as much cruelty as the meat industry does , and dairy and eggs are just as bad for you as meat is ( fattening , linked to causes diseases , cancers etc. ) .
For more information on veganism please visit : http://www.vegansociety.com/Become-a-Vegan/Why.aspx
We , the undersigned , believe that it is a great shame that you choose include milk and eggs in your " Quorn " products .
The dairy and egg industries contain the same amount of cruelty as the meat industry does , and it has been proven that dairy and egg products are also as unhealthy as meat is .
By using milk and egg alternatives in your products , you will not only make your delicious products suitable for a wider range of people , you will be making them healthier .
In addition to this , you will also be reducing the amount of animal cruelty in the world .
We , the undersigned , urge you to use a cruelty - free , vegan alternative to the milk and eggs that you use in your products , for an ethical , suitable , delicious and healthy alternative to meat , which is appropriate for everyone .
Thank you for your time .
Sue Sylvester calls it like she sees it , and so does Jane Lynch in a new interview with the UK Guardian .
Says Lynch of this year 's gay rights battles : " Should n't there be safeguards against the majority voting on the rights of a minority ?
If people voted on civil rights in the 60s , it would have never happened .
It took somebody like [ President ] Lyndon Johnson going , 'F all of you !
I 'm going to do this . '
Obama wo n't do it .
He 's a huge disappointment to me . "
Lynch also talks about growing up :
" I did n't know what ' gay ' was in high school .
We used the
word ' queer ' when someone was weird – when I finally heard what it
really meant , my heart sank , and I thought , ' Oh God , that 's me . ' "
And gay actors being out in Hollywood :
" I think if I were an ingénue – if I were Kate Winslet – it probably
would hurt my career , but because I'm Jane Lynch and I'm a character
actor , the world is n't projecting their romantic fantasies on me . "
Love her .
The major international airport of the Netherlands will begin using full - body scanners on passengers flying to the United States to prevent a recurrence of the security breach that allowed a would - be bomber to smuggle explosives onto a flight to Detroit from Amsterdam on Christmas Day , the Dutch authorities said Wednesday .
Although Dutch officials said they would deploy the scanners “ immediately , ” a spokesman for the country ’s counterterrorism office said that only 7 of the 15 full - body scanners at the airport , Schiphol , were ready for use .
The rest are to be deployed within three weeks after receiving software upgrades .
The interior minister , Guusje ter Horst , said the United States had previously not wanted Amsterdam to use the full - body scanners , which look through clothing and show the outlines of the body , because of privacy concerns .
But Ms. ter Horst said there was now agreement with Washington that “ all possible measures will be used on flights to the U.S. ”
Judith Sluiter , spokeswoman for the Dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism , said Sunday that the “ Dutch authorities have not been given permission to use them on passengers for U.S. - bound flights . ”
Viewers wo n’t remember but one thing about this interview : that a UEA scientist called a skeptic an “ assh*le ” on live television .
It reveals just how rattled they are there at UEA / CRU .
NOTE : Updated to the full length version which was put online about 5 hours after this story was first posted – better video quality in addition to the full context of the interview – readers may wish to watch a second time .
Thanks to WUWT commenter “ adamskirving ” – Anthony
Professor Andrew Watson ( whose emails are in the Climategate emails ) also adds a nice touch when he rolls his eyes , see if you can spot it .
Marc Morano explains :
A professor who is accusing global warming skeptics of engaging in “ tabloid - style character assassination ” of scientists , called an American climate skeptic “ an assh*le ” on the December 4 , 2009 live broadcast of BBC ’s Newsnight program .
“ What an assh*le ! ” declared Professor Watson at the end of the contentious debate with Climate Depot ’s executive editor Marc Morano .
A clearly agitated Watson had earlier shouted to Morano “ will you shut up . ”
Video of BBC “ Asshole ” clip is here .
( short ) and here ( full length – best quality )
Full one - on - one BBC debate segment between Prof. Watson and Climate Depot ’s Morano is here in two parts .
The remark was broadcast live on BBC and prompted an on -air apology to viewers from the BBC later in the program for the offensive language .
Watson ( Email : a.watson@uea.ac.uk ) is a professor at the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia , which was the source of the disclosed files .
Watson ’s emails appear in the hacked Climategate files .
During the live debate , Morano challenged Professor Watson for being in “ denial ” over the importance of Climategate and noted that “ you have to feel sorry for Professor Watson . ”
“ [ Watson ’s ] colleague , [ Professor ]
Mike Hulme at the University of East Anglia is saying this is authoritarian science , he is suggesting the [ UN ] IPCC should be disbanded based on what Climategate reveals , ” Morano said .
“ [ UK environmentalist ]
George Monbiot is saying many of his friend in the environmental and the climate fear promoting business — as Professor Watson is part of — are in denial .
You have to feel sorry for Professor Watson in many ways here , ” Morano explained .
A clearly agitated Watson called Morano his “ psychic colleague ” and blurted out “ Will you shut up just a second ! ? ”
Morano summed up his views on what ClimateGate reveals during the debate .
“ It exposes the manufactured consensus .
Your fellow colleagues are saying this , ” Morano said to Watson .
Morano also noted that President “ Obama is probably attending [ the UN Conference ] because they are circling the wagons because of the magnitude of this scandal . ”
( See : ‘ Welcome to the delayers ’ : Obama ’s ‘ half - hearted climate efforts ’ welcomed by skeptics – Nov.17 , 2009 )
“ You have UN scientists turning on UN scientists .
This is the upper echelon of the UN and it has been exposed as the best science that politics and activism can manufacture .
Prof.
Watson ’s whole argument is ‘ trust me , take my word for it , ’ ” Morano added .
Professor Phil Jones , Watson ’s colleague , has temporally stepped down pending an investigation into the Climategate scandal , which many observers say exposes data manipulation , suppression of peer - review process , blacklisting , data destruction , willful violation of Freedom of Information Act requests .
[ Editor ’s Note : Climate Depot ’s Morano , who BBC described as “ one of America ’s leading climate change skeptics , ” is also cited in the released Climategate files .
On July 23 , 2009 , AP reporter Seth Borenstein asked the Climategate scientist about a “ a paper in JGR ( Journal of Geophysical Research ) today that Marc Morano is hyping wildly . ”
Penn State Professor Michael Mann ( who is now under investigation ) apparently wrote back to Borenstein : “ The aptly named Marc ‘ Morano ’ has fallen for it ! ” ]
Professor Andrew Watson of the University of East Anglia , the University at the center of the Climategate controversy , has come to the defense of his colleagues this week and is claiming that the whole email and data release is much ado about nothing .
But other scientists disagree .
One of Watson ’s colleagues at the University of East Anglia , Professor Mike Hulme , declared Climategate reveals climate science had become ‘ too partisan , too centralized . ”
Hulme , a climate scientist who was listed as “ the 10th most cited author in the world in the field of climate change , does not mince words on the magnitude of the scandal .
Hulme has even suggested that the UN IPCC has run its course . ”
“ It is possible that climate science has become too partisan , too centralized .
The tribalism that some of the leaked emails display is something more usually associated with social organization within primitive cultures , ” Hulme wrote on November 27 , 2009 .
“ It is also possible that the institutional innovation that has been the [ UN ] I.P.C.C. has run its course .
“ The I.P.C.C. itself , through its structural tendency to politicize climate change science , has perhaps helped to foster a more authoritarian and exclusive form of knowledge production , ” Hulme explained .

Yitzhak Ganon avoided doctors for 65 years .
But when he became sick recently , his wife insisted that he visit one .
Stents were implanted to help his heart in a procedure made more risky because he was missing a kidney .
What happened to his other kidney explained his aversion to doctors , according to an account he gave Spiegel Online .
While held at the Auschwitz concentration camp , the 85 - year - old Mr. Gannon told his doctors , he was the subject of an experiment by Joseph Mengele , the Nazi physician known as “ the Angel of Death . ”
Mr. Ganon was tied down on a table , and , without anesthesia , cut open by Mengele , who then removed his kidney .
“ I saw the kidney pulsing in his hand and cried like a crazy man , ” Mr. Ganon said .
WASHINGTON - One of Congress ' leading immigrant - rights advocates introduced a bill Tuesday to allow millions of illegal immigrants to become U.S. citizens and end a controversial program that enlists local police to enforce immigration laws .
But the 700 - page bill by Rep. Luis Gutierrez , D - Ill. , is widely viewed as too liberal to pass .
" I do n't think that even Congressman Gutierrez expects his bill to pass , " said Harry Pachon , president of the Tom�s Rivera Policy Institute at the University of Southern California .
" He 's showing a willingness to fight .
And he 's putting pressure on the Obama administration to act . "
Administration officials have said they are working on a more moderate , bipartisan , immigration - reform bill to be introduced in the Senate early next year by Sens.
Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , and Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that the House will defer to the Senate on immigration reform .
Still , Gutierrez made it clear that he and his allies expect a seat at the negotiating table as lawmakers and the White House seek middle ground on the polarizing issue .
His bill , endorsed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus , Black Caucus and Asian Pacific American Caucus , also lets Democrats assure Latino voters that reform remains a top priority , despite being sidelined this year by the economy and the push for health - care reform .
Congress watchers say that could go a long way to motivating Hispanic voters during next year 's midterm elections .
Gutierrez 's bill would allow immigrants who are in the country illegally to stay while they apply to become legal residents or citizens .
Undocumented immigrants would have to pay a $ 500 fine and show that they have made a contribution to the country through their work , education , military or community service .
The legislation also calls for the repeal of the controversial 287 ( g ) program , which enlists local police and sheriff 's deputies to enforce federal immigration laws .
The bill says that only the federal government has the authority to enforce those laws .
" As a candidate for president , Barack Obama promised comprehensive immigration reform , and we have brought him the bill to accomplish this , " Gutierrez said Tuesday .
Hispanic voters helped propel Obama into the White House :
He won two - thirds of the Hispanic vote in the 2008 presidential race , according to an analysis of exit polls by the Pew Hispanic Center .
He beat Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , overwhelmingly among Hispanic voters despite McCain 's generally moderate stance on immigration issues .
" People feel shocked and completely betrayed that any elected official would propose legalizing illegal immigrants , stopping local police from enforcing immigration law , and stopping increased border security when we have over 15 million Americans out of work , " said William Gheen of Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee .
Rep. Jeff Flake , R - Ariz. , who has co-sponsored immigration - reform bills with Gutierrez in the past , criticized the bill for watering down the penalties that illegal immigrants would face before they could become legal residents .
Previous bills have called for a $ 2,000 fine and required undocumented workers to return to their home countries before returning to the United States .
Although the Senate bill is still being written , it is expected to be far more moderate and impose tougher penalties for illegal immigrants seeking legal status .
It also will emphasize border security and could address the issue of how workers flow into and out of the country .
In a meeting last week with The Arizona Republic , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the Obama administration wants a bill that would require illegal immigrants to register with the government , undergo criminal - background checks , pay taxes and learn English , among other requirements .
The bill also would include " some process by which , after that , they could apply for naturalization and to citizenship .
But not in advance of people who are already waiting , " she said .
Rep. Jerry Lewis , R - Calif. , said he believes Gutierrez 's bill is going nowhere .
" Congressman Gutierrez is an ardent supporter of immigrant rights and has introduced at least 20 major immigration bills in the past 10 years , but none has been cleared by a committee for a vote on the House floor , " Lewis said .
But Rep. Raul Grijalva , D - Ariz. , said the Gutierrez bill is the right path to reform .
" Immigration policy must deal fairly and intelligently with the millions of hard - working , responsible , undocumented workers already in the country , " Grijalva said .
" Declaring war on the border is not an option . "
Republic reporter Dan Nowicki contributed to this article .
The Mini Car Company made it look as if their small cars were delivered in a cardboard box , like a fridge or tv .
After the holidays , these boxes were put out on the street to get picked up by garbage men .

Is Max Baucus drunk with power ?
Or just plain stinkin’ drunk ?
Watch Senator Max Baucus ( D - Montana ) debating ObamaCare on the floor of the senate .
Then make up your own mind .
We can’t actually verify that he ’s drunk , but it ’s been reported that he began chanting ” Toga , toga , toga ” immediately after his speech .
We ’d guess that Baucus checked the bill and discovered that rehab is covered .

But it would remain in force longer if all losses to the bailout fund , the Troubled Asset Relief Program , were not recovered after a decade .
The Treasury now projects that the losses from the $ 700 billion loan program , which was created in October 2008 , could reach $ 117 billion , about a third of the loss that it projected last summer  an improved forecast that reflected the renewed strength on Wall Street .
The White House said that collecting $ 117 billion would take about 12 years , but Treasury officials said losses were likely to be smaller .
Still , with postrecession deficits at levels unseen since World War II and Wall Street never broadly popular , the pressure on a future president and Congress to keep the tax in place is likely to be substantial .
Administration officials did not outline any provision for having the tax expire once all the money is recouped .
Big banks object that most of them already have repaid the government with interest .
The administration , anticipating that argument , called its tax a “ financial crisis responsibility fee ” aimed at those institutions whose risk - taking caused the problem in the first place .
The losses from the bailout fund are expected from money paid to rescue Chrysler and General Motors and the insurance giant American International Group , and from a program to help homeowners avert foreclosures .
But big banks shared in the A.I.G. bailout , splitting about $ 60 billion to receive full repayment for their financial trades with the company .
Mr. Obama ’s economic team began seeking a bank fee last August , even as the administration  and in particular the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner  was being attacked by critics on the left and right as too cozy with Wall Street .
Criticism picked up last year after Mr. Geithner opposed an effort by the European Union to impose a global tax on financial transactions .
Mr. Geithner said such a tax would be passed through to customers .
The administration now argues that big banks will not be able to pass on the costs of its levy without risking a loss of market share to rivals that are not subject to the tax .
Mr Vanunu 's lawyer says his arrest was for meeting his Norwegian girlfriend
Israeli police have arrested Mordechai Vanunu , a technician who spent 18 years in prison for revealing details of Israel 's clandestine nuclear programme .
He is being held on suspicion that he met foreigners , violating conditions of his 2004 release from jail , police say .
At a Jerusalem court hearing , Mr Vanunu was placed under house arrest for three days until the case proceeds .
His lawyer said his arrest was because of his relationship with his Norwegian girlfriend , not for revealing secrets .
' Romance '
" Vanunu was arrested [ for ] a relationship between a man and a woman , with a Norwegian citizen , " Avigdor Feldman told reporters .
" She is not interested in nuclear business - she 's interested in Mordechai Vanunu [ and he ] is probably interested in her . "
But police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said Mr Vanunu had met " a number of foreigners " , something he had been banned from doing .
From the data Mr Vanunu leaked to a UK newspaper in 1986 , experts concluded that Israel had nuclear arms .
Israel neither confirms nor denies this .
After his release from prison in 2004 , the Israeli authorities banned Mr Vanunu from speaking to foreign media and travelling abroad .
They said he could divulge more classified information about Israel 's Dimona nuclear plant , where he had worked before the arrest .
Mr Vanunu - an anti-nuclear campaigner - has rejected the claim , saying he only wants to be free to leave Israel .
In 2007 , Mr Vanunu , a Jewish convert to Christianity , was sentenced to six months in prison for breaking the conditions of his parole .

Here 's what to expect
The giant retail and entertainment complex in the Meadowlands shut down in March because of the COVID pandemic .
Some features wo n't be ready until 2021 .
Google is rarely publicity - shy and they ’ve been promoting their new fade - in effect on the search home page .
You may have seen it .
Although it ’s possible you have n’t —
Google are testing the system and not everyone can view it .
It works like this :
When you visit Google.com , only the logo , search box , search and “ I ’m Feeling Lucky ” buttons are shown .
You can now type a term and hit return to perform a search .
However , if your mouse cursor moves anywhere within the browser viewport , the normal links and options fade into view .
( Note that Google has used progressive enhancement , so users without JavaScript will see the standard page . )
Here ’s a short animation which demonstrates the action :
According to the Google blog , the company has tested 10 variants of the fade - in and the company employees “ really like it ” .
Sorry Google , but I do n’t get it ?
What benefit does the fade - in actually serve ?
Hiding advanced or little - used functionality from the user can be a good thing .
For example , many people have learned to love the ribbon in Microsoft Office .
However , in this case , what ’s the point in hiding a handful of options for a few milliseconds ?
I ca n’t believe many users are overwhelmed by the links — most people ignore them .
If the fade - in is aimed at new computer users , I suspect few will notice the effect .
In my experience , novices tend to over - use the mouse in preference to their keyboard .
For example , rather than hitting return , many will switch to the mouse to click an “ OK ” button .
Those users will see the fade - in as soon as the page has loaded .
I initially wondered whether the fade - in would assist touch - screen or mobile users , but activating an on - screen keyboard would show the links too ?
In addition , the effect requires several lines of JavaScript .
That ’s not a problem for most of us , but the extra page weight could dramatically increase Google ’s hosting and bandwidth costs .
This is a company that does n’t add closing body and html tags to save a few precious bytes !
Ultimately , I can only think of one reason why Google has introduced the fade - in … competition from Bing .
Bing is prettier and offers nicer animations but Google ’s effect is hardly going to bring deserters back .
Whatever the reason , many people are asking how to disable the fade - in and a number of Greasemonkey scripts have already appeared .
I ’d be surprised if Google keep the effect .
What do you think of Google ’s fade - in effect ?
Is it useful or should Google stick to basic search without the gimmicks ?
Sand is everywhere in the world , so it makes sense that people all over are making art from sand and other materials .
Sand art is particularly popular at the beach and people make sand art of all shapes and sizes .
It does n’t matter how old you are , making sand art sculptures can be fun and exciting .
At almost any time of the year you can go for a walk down the beach and find someone that is making a sand castle or some other sand sculpture on the beach .
In the past people only used a combination of sand and water to make the forms they would use for their sand sculptures , but there are many more things that are used now to make sand sculptures .
Many beaches and organizations have sand sculpting competitions that offer cash rewards and people work on their designs for months before they begin .
People have made sculptures of incredible castles , cars , and people or animals .
The possibilities are almost unlimited .
If you want to make sand art sculptures , here is some pictures to help how to create sand sculptures .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia will join any consensus on more sanctions against Iran , a senior Russian diplomatic source said on Tuesday after Tehran declared it would expand nuclear activity in defiance of a U.N. rebuke .

It was a thinly veiled Russian warning to Iran of waning patience with its failure to allay fears it aims to develop atom bombs in secret , and hinted that Iran could no longer rely on Russia to stop tougher world action against it .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad voiced defiance on Tuesday , saying sanctions would have no effect and that no more talks on the nuclear dispute were needed with the West .
Speaking on state television , he also criticized Russian action .
Governors of the U.N. nuclear agency passed a resolution on Friday censuring Iran for covertly constructing a second enrichment plant near the holy city of Qom , in addition to its IAEA - monitored one at Natanz , and demanding a construction halt .
Tehran said on Sunday it would build 10 more uranium enrichment sites -- a pledge that Ahmadinejad said on Tuesday was “ not a bluff ” .
Iran ’s announcement had been in retaliation for the 25 - 3 vote by the International Atomic Energy Agency ’s 35 - nation Board of Governors , which sailed through with unusual Russian and Chinese support .
“ If there is a consensus on Iran sanctions , we will not stand aside , ” said the Russian diplomatic source , who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation .
By referring to “ consensus ” , Russia could be leaving itself an escape hatch since China has been the most resistant to punitive steps against Iran among the six world powers .
The source made clear Moscow would not move so fast to embrace harsher sanctions as the United States and EU powers , who want to act early next year if Tehran has not begun fulfilling IAEA demands for nuclear restraint and transparency by then .
“ We will be thinking about sanctions but this is not an issue of the next few hours or weeks , ” he said .
Russia did not want to complicate the situation with threats against Iran .
“ We would rather have Iran cooperating more openly and consistently with the IAEA and showing clear steps to lift concerns -- which are gaining greater foundation -- than introducing sanctions against Iran , ” the source said .
AHMADINEJAD RESPONSE
In his televised comments , Ahmadinejad dismissed the threat of sanctions and warned any “ aggressor ” against Iran .
“ Sanctions will have no effect .
Aggressors will regret their action as soon as they put their finger on the trigger , ” he said .
Israel has hinted at the possibility of attacking Iranian facilities if it deems diplomacy at a dead end .
Ahmadinejad said Western attempts to isolate Iran were in vain and he criticized Russia .
“ Russia made a mistake by backing the anti-Iran resolution and we believe that their analysis in this regard was incorrect , ” he said .
The Russian source said Iran ’s plan for 10 more enrichment plants did “ not add optimism to talks ” , in a reference to talks with Tehran revived in October but stalled by disputes .
The United States and its allies fear Iran will divert its declared civilian nuclear energy program to yielding atomic bombs , not electricity .
Tehran says it has no such intention .
Concerns have deepened over Iran ’s retreat from an October deal in principle that would see its low - enriched uranium -- which is potential fissile material for bombs -- sent abroad for processing into fuel for a nuclear medicine reactor in Tehran .
“ The situation surrounding the agency is stormy now .
We have a lot of difficult challenges , ” new IAEA Director - General Yukiya Amano told reporters on his first day in office after succeeding Mohamed ElBaradei .
Amano declined to elaborate .
IAEA spokeswoman Gill Tudor said Iran had not yet informed the U.N. nuclear inspectorate directly of its new enrichment plans and that it would seek clarification from Tehran .
Western diplomats and analysts believe the new enrichment plan may be largely bluster , possibly a negotiating gambit by Iran , and would take many years if not decades to execute .
But analysts said the risk remained of Iran using an array of above - board civilian enrichment plants to camouflage one or two small covert sites geared to enriching uranium to the high purity suitable for nuclear warheads .
Microsoft co-founder and billionaire investor Paul Allen was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is undergoing chemotherapy .
In a memo sent to employees , Jody Allen , Paul Allen 's sister and the chief executive officer of his investment firm Vulcan Inc , said the 56 - year - old received the diagnosis early this month .
According to the memo , Mr Allen has diffuse large B - cell lymphoma , a relatively common form of lymphoma .
Mr Allen battled another form of immune system cancer , Hodgkin 's lymphoma , more than 20 years ago and survived .
Jody Allen wrote that Mr Allen " is optimistic he can beat this , too .
" Paul is feeling OK and remains upbeat , " she added .
" He continues to work and he has no plans to change his role at Vulcan . "
Mr Allen founded Microsoft with Bill Gates , a high school friend and fellow computer enthusiast , in 1975 .
He served as the company 's executive vice president of research and new product development until 1983 , when he left to focus on his health .
Mr Allen remained a major shareholder and member of the board , and went on to invest broadly in technology , real estate , sports and the arts .
He formed Vulcan in the mid-1980s to invest in media and communications companies , including America Online , DreamWorks Animation and cable operator Charter Communications Inc .
He also co-founded a Silicon Valley research lab that he then shuttered after investing more than 100 million US dollars .
Beyond technology , Mr Allen has used his Microsoft earnings to take his interests to an extreme .
A longtime sports fan , Mr Allen bought American football 's Seattle Seahawks and basketball 's Portland Trailblazers , and he is part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC , a major league soccer team .
At the last count , Mr Allen 's net worth totalled about 11.5 billion US dollars , making him the 17th richest person in the world according to Forbes ' September 2009 tally .

EVERY politician says something he has to walk back once in a while .
In the case of Bradley Byrne , a Republican candidate for governor of Alabama , it was
I think there are parts of the Bible that are meant to be literally true and parts that are not .
Mr Byrne was battered by so much criticism that he quickly trudged to a Piggly Wiggly grocery store to hold a press conference and recant .
Claiming he had been misquoted , he said
I believe the Bible is true .
Every word of it .
Mr Byrne 's momentary hesitation about the literal truth of every word of the Bible makes him the religious hippie in the Republican field .
James Potts , another runner , thinks that public property should be allowed to display monuments to every faith — except Islam : " Either you accept our way of life or you go back to another country that is Muslim . "
All supported voluntary school prayer .
All but one thought that public - school teachers should be allowed to teach from the Bible .
The one dissenter on that last question ?
Roy Moore , the judge famously stripped of his job as the state 's chief justice for installing , then refusing to remove , a 5,200 - pound granite monument to the Ten Commandments in his courthouse .
Yes , nearly all of the Republican candidates are running to Mr Moore 's right on the role of Christianity in public life .
Mr Moore 's reason for not wanting to teach from the Bible in school was not , of course , because the Bible is n't perfect .
He argued that government teaching of scripture could ruin it .
Good to see that anti-government orthodoxy can still , sometimes , trump religious orthodoxy , in today 's GOP .

In a previous post I briefly mentioned some work that I am doing on aliasing .
There is a draft paper [ 1 ] , describing the theory , calculus , graphical notation ( alias diagrams ) and implementation .
Here I will try to give an idea of what it ’s about , with the hope that you will be intrigued enough to read the article .
Even before you read it you might try out the implementation [ 2 ] , a simple interactive interface with all the examples of the article .
What the article does not describe in detail — that will be for a companion paper — is how the calculus will be used as part of a general framework for developing object - oriented software proved correct from the start , the focus of our overall “ Trusted Components ” project ’ [ 3 ] .
Let me simply state that the computation of aliases is the key missing step in the effort to make correctness proofs a standard part of software development .
This is a strong claim which requires some elaboration , but not here .
The alias calculus asks a simple question : given two expressions representing references ( pointers ) , can their values , at a given point in the program , ever reference the same object during execution ?
As an example application , consider two linked lists x and y , which can be manipulated with operations such as extend , which creates a new cell and adds it at the end of the list :
The calculus makes it possible to prove that if x and y are not aliased to each other , then none of the pointers in any of the cells in either of the lists can point to ( be aliased to ) any cell of the other .
If x is initially aliased to y , the property no longer holds .
You can run the proof ( examples 18 and 19 ) in the downloadable implementation .
The calculus gives a set of rules , each applying to a particular construct of the language , and listed below .
The rule for a construct p is of the form
a |= p = a ’
where a and a’ are alias relations ; this states that executing p in a state where the alias relation is a will yield the alias relation a’ in the resulting state .
An alias relation is a symmetric , irreflexive relation ; it indicates which expressions and variables can be aliased to each other in a given state .
The constructs p considered in the discussion are those of a simplified programming language ; a modern object - oriented language such as Eiffel can easily be translated into that language .
Some precision will be lost in the process , meaning that the alias calculus ( itself precise ) can find aliases that would not exist in the original program ; if this prevents proofs of desired properties , the cut instruction discussed below serves to correct the problem .
The first rule is for the forget instruction ( Eiffel : x := Void ) :
a |= forget x = a \- {x}
where the \- operator removes from a relation all the elements belonging to a given set A .
In the case of object - oriented programming , with multidot expressions x.y.z , the application of this rule must remove all elements whose first component , here x , belongs to A .
The rule for creation is the same as for forget :
a |= create x = a \- {x}
The two instructions have different semantics , but the same effect on aliasing .
The calculus has a rule for the cut instruction , which removes the connection between two expressions :
a |= cut x , y = a — < x , y >
where — is set difference and < x , y > includes the pairs [ x , y ] and [y , x ] ( this is a special case of a general notation defined in the article , using the overline symbol ) .
The cut instruction corresponds , in Eiffel , to cut x /= y end : a hint given to the alias calculus ( and proved through some other means , such as standard axiomatic semantics ) that some references will not be aliased .
The rule for assignment is
a |= ( x := y ) = given b = a \- {x} then <b È {x} x ( b / y ) } >
end
where b /y ( “ quotient ” ) , similar to an equivalence class in an equivalence relation , is the set of elements aliased to y in b , plus y itself ( remember that the relation is irreflexive ) .
This rule works well for object - oriented programming thanks to the definition of the \- operator : in x := x.y , we must not alias x to x.y , although we must alias it to any z that was aliased to x.y .
The paper introduces a graphical notation , alias diagrams , which makes it possible to reason effectively about such situations .
Here for example is a diagram illustrating the last comment :
( The grayed elements are for explanation and not part of the final alias relation . )
For the compound instruction , the rule is :
a |= ( p ; q ) = ( a |= p ) |= q )
For the conditional instruction , we get :
a |= ( then p else q end ) = ( a |= p ) È ( a |= q )
Note the form of the instruction : the alias calculus ignores information from the then clause present in the source language .
The union operator is the reason why alias relations , irreflexive and symmetric , are not necessarily transitive .
The loop instruction , which also ignores the test ( exit or continuation condition ) , is governed by the following rule :
a |= ( loop p end ) = t N
where span style= ” color : # 0000 ff ; ” > N is the first value such that t N = t N+1 ( in other words , t N is the fixpoint ) in the following sequence :
t 0 = a
t n+1 = ( t n È ( t n |= p ) )
The existence of a fixpoint and the correctness of this formula to compute it are the result of a theorem in the paper , the “ loop aliasing theorem ” ; the proof is surprisingly elaborate ( maybe I missed a simpler one ) .
For procedures , the rule is
a |= call p = a |= p.body
where p.body is the body of the procedure .
In the presence of recursion , this gives rise to a set of equations , whose solution is the fixpoint ; again a theorem is needed to demonstrate that the fixpoint exists .
The implementation directly applies fixpoint computation ( see examples 11 to 13 in the paper and implementation ) .
The calculus does not directly consider routine arguments but treats them as attributes of the corresponding class ; so a call is considered to start with assignments of the form f : = a for every pair of formal and actual arguments f and a .
Like the omission of conditions in loops and conditionals , this is a source of possible imprecision in translating from an actual programming language into the calculus , since values passed to recursive activations of the same routine will be conflated .
Particularly interesting is the last rule , which generalizes the previous one to qualified calls of the form x. f ( … ) as they exist in object - oriented programming .
The rule involves the new notion of inverse variable , written x ’ where x is a variable .
Laws of the calculus ( with Current denoting the current object , one of the fundamental notions of object - oriented programming ) are
Current.x = x
x.Current = x
x.x ’ = Current
x ’.x = Current
In other words , Current plays the role of zero element for the dot operator , and variable inversion is the inverse operation .
In a call x.f , where x denotes the supplier object ( the target of the call ) , the inverse variable provides a back reference to the client object ( the caller ) , indispensable to interpret references in the original context .
This property is reflected by the qualified client rule , which uses the auxiliary operator n ( where x n a , for a relation a and a variable x , is the set of pairs [ x.u , y.v ] such that the pair [ u , v ] is in a ) .
The rule is :
a |= call x.r = x n ( ( x ’ n a ) |= call r)
You need to read the article for the full explanation , but let me offer the following quote from the corresponding section ( maybe you will note a familiar turn of phrase ) :
Thus we are permitted to prove that the unqualified call creates certain aliasings , on the assumption that it starts in its own alias environment but has access to the caller ’s environment through the inverted variable , and then to assert categorically that the qualified call has the same aliasings transposed back to the original environment .
This change of environment to prove the unqualified property , followed by a change back to the original environment to prove the qualified property , explains well the aura of magic which attends a programmer ’s first introduction to object - oriented programming .
I hope you will enjoy the calculus and try the examples in the implementation .
It is fun to apply , and there seems to be no end to the potential applications .

Antidepressant medications probably provide little or no benefit to people with mild or moderate depression , a new study has found .
Rather , the mere act of seeing a doctor , discussing symptoms and learning about depression probably triggers the improvements many patients experience while on medication .
Only people with very severe depression receive additional benefits from drugs , said the senior author of the study , Robert J. DeRubeis , a University of Pennsylvania psychology professor .
The research was released online Tuesday and will be published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn .
Hundreds of studies have attested to the benefits of antidepressants over placebos , DeRubeis said .
But many studies involve only participants with severe depression .
Confusion arises , he said , “ because there is a tendency to generalize the findings to mean that all depressed people benefit from medications . ”
The current analysis attempted to quantify how much of antidepressants ’ benefit is attributable to chemical effects on the brain and how much can be explained by other factors , such as visiting a doctor , taking action to feel better or merely the passage of time .

Researchers reviewed six randomized , placebo - controlled studies with a total of 718 patients who took either an antidepressant or placebo .
The patients were adults with levels of depression ranging from mild to very severe based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale , a questionnaire widely used in depression research .
The studies did not exclude patients who were likely to have a strong response to a placebo .
Researchers then compared the patients ’ depression scores at the beginning of treatment with those after at least six weeks of treatment .
The study found that the magnitude of the drugs ’ benefit increased with the baseline level of depression .
The effect of treatment was similar in people with mild , moderate and severe symptoms , regardless of whether they took an antidepressant or placebo .
Only the people who rated very severe on the depression scale at the start of the study showed measurable improvements on antidepressants .
“ There is no doubt that there are tremendous benefits from antidepressants , as our study showed , ” DeRubeis said .
“ But this study helps us resolve , to some degree , the question of how much benefit people can expect from the medicines themselves when symptoms are not severe . ”
Other research has also found that antidepressants are most effective for severe symptoms , said Dr. Philip Wang , deputy director of the National Institute of Mental Health .
Though it could be that antidepressants do n’t work well for mild to moderate depression , it ’s also possible that people enrolled in antidepressant studies have robust placebo responses that mask some of the impact of the medication .

A severely depressed person who would probably benefit from antidepressants might have symptoms such as frequent weeping , feelings of guilt and sadness , thoughts that life is not worth living , problems sleeping , fatigue and withdrawal from normal activities , DeRubeis said .
Better antidepressants are needed for people with mild to moderate depression , Wang said , as is research on how to diagnose depression with tools , such as biomarkers , that could help personalize treatment .
Of the six studies in the current analysis , three involved selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , or SSRIs , the most commonly used antidepressants , and three involved an older class of medications called tricyclics .
Both classes are thought to be equally effective , although SSRIs are associated with fewer side effects .
One exception to the study findings , DeRubeis said , was people with dysthymia , or chronic , low - level depression .
The analysis assessed severity of symptoms , not chronicity , he said .
Other studies have established that people with chronic depression , no matter how severe , tend to respond well to antidepressants while other treatment may be ineffective .

Manchester Airport has been forced to rethink trials of its invasive new X - ray machine after claims the " naked " images of airline passengers could violate child pornography laws .
This week , the airport began a year - long trial of the full - body scanner , which can instantly detect any hidden weapons or explosives without passengers having to remove any of their clothing - such as shoes and belts - for a search .
A combination of images shows an airport staff member demonstrating a full body scan at Manchester Airport .
Credit: AFP
It effectively does away with the need to frisk passengers and is expected to speed up the security process at airports , but the cost of that is passengers are starkly naked in front of security staff .
Genital outlines are clearly visible on the screen .
The scanner 's manufacturer , RapiScan , is already eyeing further airports around the world .
A few weeks ago it sold 30 of the $ US160,000 ( $ 174,000 ) scanners to the US Transportation Security Administration , Forbes reported .
Tiger Woods was admitted to Health Central Hospital the day after Thanksgiving as an overdose .
Sources connected with the hospital tell TMZ the admissions chart lists " OD " and that he was having trouble breathing .
We 're told the fifth floor of the hospital was put on lockdown when Tiger arrived .
Tiger was admitted under an alias -- William Smith .
His wife , Elin Nordegren was by his side .
As we first reported , Elin gave paramedics two pill bottles at the accident scene -- we now know the prescriptions were for Ambien and Vicodin .
Tiger was in and out of consciousness , snoring at the scene , and our sources say he clearly appeared to be under the influence of something -- not alcohol .
We 're also told doctors used a breathing tube to assist his respiration .
We 're also told hospital officials changed Tiger 's alias after a few hours to another alias because they feared people would find out he was there .
There are many ways a person can end up in debt , and many of them are linked to socio- economic factors .
But there is one major cost that can hit anyone , at any time .
The statement that a lot of Americans are in debt should n't be a shocker to anyone .
It also probably wo n’t surprise you that socio- economic classes have a major effect on the amount of debt likely to be carried from month to month .
But is there a factor that levels the playing field ?
Debt , in terms of medical care , is universally unkind with medical bills being the number one cause of bankruptcy cases .
Cancer , heart failure , and other debilitating diseases do not generally discriminate between the different wage brackets and the bills can be hefty enough to derail even the stoutest bank accounts .
Many self - pay medical customers scramble to find ways to lower their medical costs ; some skip doctor ’s appointments or delay them as long as possible .
Others avoid filling prescriptions for medications .
In the end , these kinds of choices usually wind up costing the individual more in terms of health deterioration as well as additional medical care fees for the declining health .
Where do these additional costs usually wind up going ?
You guessed it : on a credit card account , which is then carried as a balance from month to month .
The number one medical expense charged to a credit account is medication .
Other costs wind up on the Visa bill as well : click the graphic at left to see how self - pay medical bills stack up .
In the long run , debt is more a state of mind than a state of class .
Learning how to leverage debt and income for the greatest benefit could help anyone no matter who you are or how fat or thin your savings account might be .
Debt Demographics
Did you know that , on average , the poorest or lowest income families carry the most credit card debt ?
Perhaps this seems obvious , but that was n’t always the case .
A few decades ago , the poorest of the poor simply did without , meaning they were poor , but out of debt as a rule .
Now , the lowest classes have caught the middle - class disease of keeping up with the Jones ’ by charging their expenses .
This leads to the downward debt cycle of overspending , underpaying , and eventually bankruptcy .
Bankruptcy averages are at 19 % for wage earners under $ 30 k annually .
This is not the highest bankruptcy wage bracket , but only by 1 % .
To see the highest and lowest bankruptcy salaries , click the graphic to the left .
How does debt stack up in the ethnic groups ?
Comparing debt to debt , the Hispanic population carries the highest credit card balances from month to month .
With an average of over $ 10,000.00 in credit card debt , Latino persons edge out white individuals by only $ 275 .
The African American population carries the least amount in overall credit card debt per billing cycle .
But this statistic is misleading because as of 2007 , over 90 % of African American families were carrying a balance in credit card debt from month to month .
This 90 % was identified to be African American households earning between $ 10,000.00 and $ 24,000.00 yearly .
The numbers look better taking the entire African American populace as a whole .
Where is America 's Debt ?
We 've discussed Americans ' debts , but what about debt in America ?
America 's collective debt , also called the national debt or the public debt , represents the money that the U.S. government owes to the owners of debt instruments that are issued by the U.S. treasury .
There are several types of debt instruments issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury .
All of these items are collectively called treasuries .
America has always had debt .
Since the 18th century , the country has carried a load of debt that has fluctuated with the political and social climate of the day .
In 1860 , America 's debt was $ 65 million .
The Civil War brought about a major spike in the debt .
World War I and World War II also brought about major rises in the debt .
The latest American debt numbers have put it at its steepest numbers since the debt level spiked during World War II .
America 's debt , as owed to foreign nations , has been rising steadily over the years .
The gross debt in trillions of U.S. dollars was about $ 10 trillion in 1940 .
In 1950 , it had risen to about $ 18 trillion .
After falling for a few decades , it began rising again in the late 1980s .
In 2009 , America 's debt was again up to $ 18 trillion .
It is projected to continue to rise over the next few years .
By 2011 it is projected to be about $ 20 trillion .
The projected amount of American debt in the next few years equals 100 percent of the U.S. GDP .

You'd think rape would be one issue Republicans would be smart enough not make into a partisan issue , but no .
They could n't help themselves .
Franken passed an amendment that was attached to a defense bill that would withhold government contracts from companies that refused to let employees bring rape cases before the courts .
It should be tough voting against rape , but thirty Republicans did just that and now they are whining the night away because bloggers and some MSMers have highlighted their atrocity .
And in their usual silly reality , they are blaming Sen .
Al Franken because they are getting hammered over their malfeasance .
Al Franken fallout has GOP fuming
The Republicans are steamed at Franken because partisans on the left are using a measure he sponsored to paint them as rapist sympathizers — and because Franken is n’t doing much to stop them .
“ Trying to tap into the natural sympathy that we have for this victim of this rape — and use that as a justification to frankly misrepresent and embarrass his colleagues , I do n’t think it ’s a very constructive thing , ” Sen . John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) said in an interview .
“ I think it ’s going to make a lot of senators leery and start looking at things he ’s doing earlier on , because I do n’t think it got appropriate attention ahead of time . ”

Franken , who declined to be interviewed , has said previously that the measure was inspired by the story of former KBR employee Jamie Leigh Jones , who alleges that she was drugged , beaten and gang - raped at age 19 when stationed in Baghdad .
She fought the arbitration clause in her contract , and in September the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that Jones ’s sexual assault allegations were not “ related to ” her employment , allowing her to proceed in court .
KBR is fighting the ruling .

“ I do n’t know what his motivation was for taking us on , but I would hope that we wo n’t see a lot of Daily Kos-inspired amendments in the future coming from him , ” said South Dakota Sen .
John Thune , No. 4 in the Senate Republican leadership .
“ I think hopefully he ’ll settle down and do kind of the serious work of legislating that ’s important to Minnesota . ”
Aides point out that despite attacks on Republicans by liberal commentators like Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann and on blogs such as Daily Kos , Franken never appeared on any of the shows or on the blogs to make a partisan argument about the matter , saying that the senator turned down entreaties to do so .
Also , they point to the 10 Republicans who voted for the amendment as proof that it was n’t a partisan measure .
“ Sen . Franken has been proud to partner with both Republicans and Democrats to find common - sense solutions to the problems we face , ” said Jess McIntosh , his spokeswoman .
“ He ’s been working hard for Minnesota since he got here five months ago and has already introduced 10 bills — four of which were introduced with Republican co-sponsors , and two already passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support . ”
" As a software developer , I used to use Graphviz for my code comprehension needs .
While its compact format has its advantages , it was just too much effort to input data - particularly relationships .
I wanted to be able to create relationships by dragging my mouse from one node to another .
This is exactly how yEd works .
You do n't have to sacrifice the longevity of plain - text that Graphviz files offer .
yEd works entirely on the XML - based GraphML format .
You get the same benefits of cross-platform support and exporting to SVG , PNG , PDF etc. as with Graphviz .
But yEd is that it is written in Java yet has a 100 % native look and feel ( so on Mac , you can zoom in and out with 2 finger scrolling ) .
The best feature for me is its ability to group nodes and collapse / expand them .
This makes it possible to capture much bigger graphs in a single file than with Graphviz ( in which I had to mess with numerical properties ) .
Layouts also give you the ability to comprehend your data in different ways , and when you change layout it animates the transition which makes the experience fun .
y Ed , which is free , is probably better than any non -free software out there , and I 've never had to upgrade it since I first heard of it , and have n't noticed any bugs .
I 'm really grateful for yWorks for this product and hope it stays around as long as I live . "

“ This was the second law firm I went to when starting my journey towards bankruptcy .
Obviously this is not a step anyone wants to take , but from day one they treated me as if I was family .
The first law firm I went to told me through a 5 minute conversation there was no way I could file , I did n’t meet the criteria .
When I made my appointment with Reed Law firm , not only did they not dismiss me , but they also took their time reviewing my case and assisting me in getting a full discharge !!
They constantly stayed in contact with me throughout the process and were quick to respond .
I would highly recommend them to anyone I know ! ! ”

The World from Berlin The World Bids Farewell to Obama
US President Barack Obama suffered a painful defeat in Massachusetts on Tuesday .
With mid-term elections looming , it means that Obama will have to fundamentally re-think his political course .
German commentators say it is the end of hope .
Dubbed the “ hate - mail cleric ” by British tabloids , Anjem Choudary is London ’s headline - grabbing Islamist who wants to see the United Kingdom under Shariah law and the queen under a burqa .
Recently his group Al Muhajiroun ( operating under the moniker “ Islam4UK ” ) caused an uproar when they announced plans to march through the sleepy town of Wootton Bassett , a place best known for its solemn tributes to fallen British soldiers as their coffins are carried through its High Street after their arrival at a nearby Royal Air Force base .
Is Choudary simply — as the saying goes — “ taking the piss ? ”
Is Al Muhajiroun just a small band of harmless , media - savvy pranksters ?
Or is there more to Choudary than meets the eye ?
Do the views of this 42 - year - old former lawyer resonate with a larger segment of the population than the tabloids , and indeed many Muslims , would care to admit ?
The Daily Caller : Your desire to march through the town of Wootton Bassett caused a media uproar in the UK and has clearly offended the sensibilities of many Britons .
Was that the whole point ?
Anjem Choudary : Well , the concept of having a procession at Wootten Bassett was never about the people of Wootten Bassett .
The atrocities which are and have been committed in Afghanistan by the U.S. - led assault I think have been well documented .
Hence , I thought it appropriate to mention that we ’re going to have a procession in Wootten Basset in order to engage the public in the true reasons why the British government is in Afghanistan and to really expose the lies the British government and the American government are telling the public .
The campaign in Afghanistan is not about fighting for freedom and democracy , it ’s not something which will make them safer at home .
Rather , the presence of America and Britain and other countries in Afghanistan causes instability in the region and they are only there to establish their economic and military interests .
Moreover , the more Muslims who are mercilessly slaughtered in that region will make the possibility of operations taking place in Western countries , in particular in Britain and in America , a far higher likelihood were they not to be there in the first place .
The DC :
What are your thoughts on recent “ operations ” or acts of terrorism by Muslims in against United States ?
For example the soldier who killed 13 at an army base in Texas or the Nigerian man who is accused of attempting to blow up an airliner heading into Detroit ?
AC : First of all , we need to get behind these terms , because a lot of these terms are pejorative .
They ’re emotion - laden terms designed to be used against Islam and Muslims … that is the popular use of them today .
However , if you look in the dictionary at the word “ terrorism ” it has been defined as the use of force against a community or a section of the community for political ends , and that is precisely what the British and the American governments are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan , and even in their own societies against the indigenous Muslim population .
So it does not surprise me that people want to retaliate against these governments and their societies because of what they ’re doing against Islam and Muslims .
I think you have two types of terrorism : terrorism which is against the commands of God , and you have a terrorism which is in line with the command of God .
Both of them are forms of terrorism , one is not sanctioned and one is .
But definitely in war , people terrorize each other .
The individuals you ’re talking about , I do believe they see themselves as soldiers , fighting on behalf of Allah and his messenger , and they believe that the operations that they are carrying out are sanctioned by the divine text .
The DC :
So is it up to each individual to determine whether his own actions are sanctioned by the Quran ?
Who ’s the judge ?
AC : Allah said clearly in the Quran , “ Ask those who have knowledge , if you do n’t know . ”
So it is obliged upon every Muslim to abide by the divine text .
If he does n’t know , then he will go to the scholars or the students of knowledge and he will ask them what he needs to do in every situation and scenario .
So nobody will be able to make up the law as they go along .
The Shariah can be very complicated in some areas .
There are some matters which are known by necessity .
For example , to drink alcohol is prohibited , to fornicate is prohibited , to pray is obliged .
However there are some issues which are not known by necessity , like the details of the covenant of security , like the details of jihad and martyrdom operations , et cetera , for which you need to refer to the scholars of Islam in order to know what you should and should not be doing .
The DC :
Do you consider yourself one of these scholars ?
Would you feel comfortable advising on the legitimacy of a martyrdom operation ?
AC : I am merely a student of knowledge , and all Muslims must be students of knowledge .
I am not a scholar but knowledge is relative .
I know more about some issues than some of the Muslims , and I know less than others .
If you ask me a specific question , if I have the information then I can answer it , then if not I will refer you to a scholar of Islam who can give you the answer .
The DC : Many in the press seem quick to dismiss you as a something of a publicity - seeking joker , and they often comment on the relatively small size of your group , Al Muhajiroun , as if to say , “ These are just a few bad apples . ”
But given all of the attention you ’ve been receiving lately , have your numbers been growing ?
AC : As far as the numbers are concerned , I do n’t believe that Al Muhajiroun , or any Islamic movement for that matter , should be judged on the numbers , rather on their effectiveness in society .
I think that we ’ve been extremely effective in passing our concepts and ideas to the masses .
It ’s not about Al Muhajiroun , it ’s about Islam .
If people adopt the Islamic ideas and they go back to the Shariah and implement it in their lives , that is success .
The DC :
So is that was attracts people to your organization , your success at mass communication ?
AC : We are not an organization dealing with propagating Islam purely on an individual basis .
Our objective is to please Allah , obviously , which we do by working to establish Islam as a dominant force worldwide .
That will be achieved by establishing a Khilafah — an Islamic state somewhere in the world , and the process to do that involves inviting the societies in which we live to think about Islam as an alternative political , social , economic , judicial system even with its own foreign policy .
So most of our activities are based on addressing the society , and whether we like it or not , the society has its own voice , has its own tongue , which is the media .
And just the way the poets of the Quraysh , which was the society of the prophet , used to demonize him and lie about him , we find that the BBC , CNN and Sky News these days lie and demonize us .
When the companions of the prophet said to him , “ Oh prophet of Allah , the poets lie , and they fabricate about you , ” he said , “ Others will hear about me , and they will come and verify the news . ”
And what we do find in fact is that when the media tries to demonize us , others from the Muslim community and others from the media want to know the truth , and that is the way that we can pass the true message that we want to carry , away from the lies and the fabrications and the distortions , to the masses .
And I think this has reverberations around the world and many Muslims will agree and many Muslims will want to work with us .
The DC :
It ’s fair to say that the U.S. led the charge into Iraq and Afghanistan under the leadership of President Bush , but I wonder what you think President Obama ’s handling of these wars and outreach to the Muslim world ?
AC : I think that Barack Obama is doing exactly what his predecessor did .
In their foreign policy , there ’s no difference .
It is a complete absurdity — and perverse — for him to be given the Nobel Peace Prize when he has , in fact , increased the presence of U.S. forces in the occupation of Afghanistan , and the aerial bombardment has increased since he became president .
More people have been killed in the last year than were killed in the previous years toward the end of the Bush regime .
So I do believe that he is more bloodthirsty and he is more determined to fight Islam and Muslims and he has made it clear that this war for the Americans is designed to ensure that the Muslims never implement the ideology that most of the Muslims want to , which is Islam as a law and order , and thereby reestablishing the Islamic state — the Khilafah .
I believe that the Obama regime are willing to fight Muslims wherever they may go back to the fundamentals of their religion and thereby want to establish the Shariah and that includes Yemen , Sudan , Somalia and every other country where there is an Islamic resurgence .
There is a clash of civilizations today .
The head of one believes that sovereignty and supremacy belongs to God — Sheikh Osama bin Laden , and the head of the other believes that sovereignty and supremacy belongs to man — Barack Obama .
The DC :
You clearly see this as a war on Islam , yet there are Muslim soldiers among the American and British forces .
How do you explain their involvement ?
AC : They are not Muslims .
Anyone who stands with the Americans and British or indeed any non-Muslims and fights against Muslims is an apostate .
Allah mentions clearly in the Quran in chapter 5 , verse 51 , that those who stand with them are part of them .
Therefore , they go outside of the fold of Islam .
It does not surprise me that in the current climate where people grow up in the West and they are educated in the West , and they adopt the principles of secularism and democracy and freedom that eventually you ’ll find some of them joining the army and the police and even helping them against Muslims .
That is an act of apostasy and I do n’t think that anyone who has studied the Shariah and who knows about Islam would call them Muslims .
The DC : Can Islam and democracy co-exist ?
AC : The word democracy comes from the root word demos kratos , which means man-made law .
And Islam means submission — submission to the law of God .
So , in essence , they have completely different meanings .
The common meaning of democracy is that it is for the people to decide their own affairs , and that is anathema to Islam and Muslims .
There is a certain amount of truth in that characterization .
By “ utopian economics , ” Cassidy means , in the first instance , the careful elaboration of the precise scope of Adam Smith ’s Invisible Hand .
It turns out to be a lot more complicated and attenuated than sloganeering can afford to acknowledge .
To begin with , if a market economy is to be advertised as doing an acceptable job , we need a definition of a good economic outcome .
The standard version says that one allocation of goods and services to individuals ( call it A ) is better than another ( B ) if everyone is at least as well off ( in his or her own estimation ) in A as in B , and at least one person is better off .
So there is to be no trading off of one person ’s well - being against another ’s .
That sounds fair ; but notice that judgments about inequality are ruled out : if everyone is equal but poor in A , and B differs only by making one person fabulously rich , B is better than A .
That sounds a little less appetizing , but this extreme case underscores the individualistic nature of the whole exercise : nothing is supposed to matter to anyone but his or her own access to goods and services .
Notice also that , by this definition , most As and Bs simply cannot be compared : some people are better off and some worse off in A than in B , so neither is “ better ” than the other .
The next step is to say that such an allocation is “ efficient ” if no feasible allocation can leave everybody at least as well off as they were and make somebody better off .
In other words , there is no “ better ” allocation .
You would like your economy to lead to an efficient outcome .
There are many efficient allocations , some egalitarian and some just the opposite , and none of them is better or worse than any of the others .
They can not be said to be equal either ; they are simply not comparable in this language .
It is important to understand what this definition does not mean : it does not say that any efficient allocation is better , more desirable , than any inefficient one .
Why not ?
Suppose you happen to gain from the inefficiency and I happen to lose .
Then eliminating the inefficiency does not meet the test for a “ better ” state : you lose and I gain .
More concretely : suppose your favorite plumber would gladly work an extra hour for $ 50 , and suppose that you would gladly pay $ 50 for the work that she would do in that hour .
It would be a socially useful transaction , if no one else were affected .
But if your plumber pays a 20 percent marginal tax rate , she would clear only $ 40 , and then this socially useful transaction does not happen .
An income tax is “ distortionary . ”
It creates an inefficiency .
But now imagine that the tax revenues are used to provide education or health care or other benefits to poor or disabled or otherwise deserving people who would otherwise have to do without .
Then one cannot say that the no-tax efficient allocation is better than the inefficient one .
Some other criterion has to be invoked .
I have seen some staggeringly awful crap in my time , some pilots that left me wondering if the apocalypse was nigh , shows that truly defy explanation .
But nothing could have prepared me for this .
PopWatchers , behold Poochinski , a failed NBC pilot from 1990 .

Brock Lesnar 's longtime friend and Jiu-Jitsu coach tells TMZ the hospitalized fighter WILL return to the Octagon -- and he guarantees Brock will return to battle condition in the next six months .
We spoke with Rodrigo " Comprido " Medeiros -- a 7 - time World Jiu-Jitsu champ -- who tells us the reigning UFC heavyweight champ " is getting better and that is the most important thing ...
He will be fine and be fighting again within 6 months . "
Medeiros adds , " I can just say that the heavyweights can stop laughing and get ready to start crying because the champion will be back soon . "
As we previously reported , Lesnar had been hospitalized due to a mysterious intestinal disorder .
UFC president Dana

So far , Brock has yet to release a comment himself .
Supporters of the opposition to Iran 's current ruling regime continue to gather , speak out , and protest - despite the risks of imprisonment , injury or death , and the continued official restrictions on foreign media coverage .
On December 21st , 2009 , thousands of Iranians attended a funeral ceremony for Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri , the spiritual father of Iran 's reform movement , who had passed away at the age of 87 .
In the days following the funeral , mourners and protesters took to the streets defying an official ban on such memorial services .
On the Muslim holy day of Ashoura , December 27th , protesters and riot police clashed in multiple locations in Tehran , leaving many injured and between 8 and 37 protesters killed , including the nephew of opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi .
Days later , on December 30th , the Iranian government organized its own protest - against the opposition - giving all civil servants the day off to attend , providing dozens of buses and free chocolate milk for demonstrators .

Last week we established pretty much every possible way turkey cakes can be wrecked ... except one .
However , the other problem - which I have avoided mentioning until now - is that they also tend to have long skinny bodies andheads , which can look , well ... Combine these two unfortunate predilections , and you get :

Obama goes gloves off , head - on He discusses how race has flared up in the campaign , a suit over voting on the Strip
In a Sun interview Sunday , Illinois Sen. Barack Obama addressed the suddenly front - and - center issue of race in his fight with New York Sen. Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Looking poised and relatively fresh given the grueling schedule of a presidential campaign , the senator from Illinois spoke in his customary manner — cool , measured , deliberate — about urban issues , his appeal to Hispanic voters and a controversial lawsuit about Saturday ’s caucus that is pitting some Clinton backers against Obama and the union that endorsed him last week , Culinary Union Local 226 .
Audio Clip Obama on the Culinary lawsuit
Audio Clip Obama on racial overtones
Audio Clip Obama on " The Wire 's " Omar
Also , the TV show “ The Wire ” came up .
Obama , framed by a portrait of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in a Doolittle Community Center classroom , addressed the lawsuit in which a group of Democratic activists , including the state teachers union , is suing the Democratic Party , declaring as unfair the existence of nine at - large caucus sites on the Strip .
Those sites are designed to allow shift workers union and nonunion to caucus in case the 11:30 a.m. start time falls during their workday .
The plaintiffs say the Strip caucus sites are designed to give an unfair advantage to the Culinary .
Obama addressed the lawsuit head - on : “ Look , the caucus structure was agreed to by every major player in the Democratic Party here in Nevada and was negotiated by the major players in the Democratic National Committee .
Six days before the caucus is taking place , some of the people who were connected to setting up this very structure are now filing suit , trying to change the rules .
It ’s hard not to draw the conclusion that people were unhappy about the outcome of the Culinary Union endorsement process and now people are trying to fix it .
In the process it is disenfranchising dishwashers and bartenders who work hard and should be able to participate in their democracy . ”
Although Obama did n’t mention it , his surrogates , including Culinary Secretary - Treasurer D. Taylor and state Sen .
Steven Horsford , D - North Las Vegas , are quick to point out that many of those who would be “ disenfranchised ” are black or Hispanic .
For black voters especially , the issue of disenfranchisement is not to be trifled with , considering America ’s Jim Crow past and the history of willful suppression of the black vote .
Indeed , race has become a sudden and unavoidable fact of the presidential contest as it moves to the first state with a sizable minority population .
In recent weeks , Clinton allies have made a series of awkward and sometimes crass remarks that play to stereotypes about black men .
Billy Shaheen , her then - New Hampshire chairman , speaking about Obama ’s admission in his memoir that he used drugs as a teenager , said Obama would have to answer questions about whether he ’d sold drugs .
Shaheen resigned .
Andrew Cuomo , a Clinton supporter and New York ’s attorney general , said about New Hampshire , “ You ca n’t shuck and jive ” there .
Robert Johnson , founder of Black Entertainment Television , seemed to imply that while Clinton and her husband , Bill Clinton , were working hard for black people , Obama was off doing drugs .
Johnson later released a statement denying that that ’s what he meant .
Clinton recently seemed to downplay the role of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the passage of the Civil Rights Act .
“ Dr. King ’s dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , when he was able to get through Congress something that President Kennedy was hopeful to do , the president before had not even tried .
But it took a president to get it done . ”
This series of events , which the Clinton camp says are discrete and easily explained , carries considerable risk of a backlash for her .
Black voters could make up to 20 percent of Democratic caucusgoers in Nevada .
White Democrats might react angrily to any impression that the Clinton campaign hascoordinated an effort to use race against Obama .
On the news show “ Meet the Press , ” Clinton accused the Obama campaign of distorting what she said about King : “ Clearly , we know from media reports that the Obama campaign is deliberately distorting this ...
It is such an unfair and unwarranted attempt to , you know , misinterpret and mischaracterize what I ’ve said . ”
Asked by the Sun about the racial tenor of the race , Obama replied : “ I am puzzled by it .
She made a statement about Dr. King that I think was ill - advised .
But I said nothing about it .
Suddenly , she is blaming us for distorting her words .
I do n’t know how I could distort her words since I had n’t commented on her words since she made the statement .
Now you see this ratcheting up of rhetoric coming out of her surrogates .
I find it puzzling . ”
Asked whether Hispanics , who make up one - quarter of Nevada ’s population , would support a black candidate for president , he deflected the question and said they probably know the Clintons better than they know him .
He then laid out a list of policy proposals designed to help Hispanics , including immigration changes that would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants , school dropout prevention programs and money for college .
“ If Latino voters examine my track record , I think they ’ll feel enormous confidence that I will be strong advocate on behalf of equal opportunity and fairness . ”
If the recent Culinary endorsement is to mean anything , Obama will have to appeal to Hispanics , who make up 40 percent of the union ’s membership .
He also discussed his agenda for healthier cities , which includes early childhood education , job creation and drug treatment , all aimed at breaking a cycle of poor people with few opportunities going into the drug trade , which leads to prison , making them almost permanently unemployable .
Michael Kostroff , an actor who was in town to volunteer for Obama and had a chance to meet him , told the Sun that Obama ’s favorite TV show is his own : HBO ’s “ The Wire , ” which chronicles Baltimore ’s violent drug culture and the police who quixotically try to stop it .
Obama told the Sun his favorite character is Omar , a stick - up artist who steals from drug dealers and then gives the loot to poor people in the neighborhood .
“ That ’s not an endorsement .
He ’s not my favorite person , but he ’s a fascinating character . ”
Under - 18s will be banned from visiting sunbed salons in a move by the government to reduce the risk of young people developing skin cancer .
Gillian Merron , the public health minister , said that voluntary action by the sunbed industry to stop children had failed and that ministers planned to introduce legislation to tackle the problem .
The proposed ban comes as research reported in today 's British Medical Journal shows that more than 250,000 children aged 11 - 17 in England are thought to use sunbeds .
It shows that up to half of all girls aged 15 - 17 in some areas undergo artificial tanning , which experts warn seriously increases the risk of malignant melanoma , the most aggressive form of skin cancer .
Two studies of children 's tanning habits highlighted in the BMJ , which were government - funded and commissioned by Cancer Research UK ( CRUK ) , found that 6 % of 9,000 children aged 11 - 17 interviewed had used a sunbed .
The average age of first use was 14 , they found .
If translated across England that would mean that around 250,000 children in that age group had done so .
Girls , children of both sexes from deprived communities and those in the north of England are disproportionately likely to use sunbeds .
" We are determined to protect young people from the dangers of using sunbeds , " said Merron .
" Cancer Research UK 's report clearly shows worrying levels of sunbed use by under - 18s .
The report confirms that voluntary action by the industry is not protecting young people , and points to the need to introduce legislation . "
The Department of Health said : " We are currently looking at options on how to introduce such a ban on under - 18s using commercial sunbeds . "
Jenny Morris , of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health ( CIEH ) , said : " These numbers are appalling .
We must act now to limit the future damage to health .
The CIEH has long campaigned to ban the use of sunbeds by under - 18s and the provision of unsupervised facilities , and to ensure facilities provide supervision by well - trained staff .
Scotland has taken action , Wales has made a firm commitment to take action .
England should act swiftly to ensure it does not offer lower levels of protection . "
The health department decided to act after growing concern about the links between sunbed use and later development of malignant melanoma , which is four times more common now than in the 1970s .
Rates are rising four times faster than for any other type of cancer .
More than 10,400 cases were diagnosed in the UK in 2006 , 10 % of which were in under -35s .
The disease , the riskiest and most lethal form of skin cancer , kills more than 2,000 people a year .
Some teenagers have suffered horrendous burns after visiting sunbed salons , especially coin-operated premises with no staff .
Nina Goad , of the British Association of Dermatologists , said : " We would rightly be horrified if children had such easy access to cigarettes , so there is no reason why sunbeds should be any different , given that we know they can cause cancer . "
However , Merron 's pledge covers only commercial tanning places , such as high street salons and leisure centres .
Today 's research shows that 23.2 % of children who use sunbeds do so at home .
The move also does not meet the demands of bodies such as CRUK and the CIEH for more wide - ranging action , including the closure of unsupervised sunbed premises and ensuring that local authority enforcement officers can inspect salons to ensure minimum standards are being upheld .
The International Agency for Research on Cancer , the World Health Organisation 's cancer arm , recently declared ultraviolet radiation exposure , including radiation from sunbeds , to be " carcinogenic to humans " .
And the government 's own adviser , the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment , has also previously called for tough action against sunbeds .

The following is a guest weblog by Will Alexander [ and thanks to Madhav L Khandekar for introducing us to Professor Alexander ! ] .
As I have posted before , I encourage climate scientists with peer - reviewed papers on this subject to present their viewpoints as guest posts on my weblog .
Following is his brief biographical sketch
WJR ( Will ) Alexander is Professor Emeritus of the Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Pretoria , South Africa , and Honorary Fellow of the South African Institution of Civil Engineering .
He spent the past 35 years of his career actively involved in the development of water resource and flood analysis methods as well as in natural disaster mitigation studies .
His interest in climate change arose from claims that it would have an adverse effect in these fields .
In his subsequent studies of very large hydrometeorological data sets he was unable to detect any adverse human - related changes .
He has written more than 200 papers , presentations and books on these subjects .

Guest Welog By Will Alexander Adelaide , Australia – Climategate chaos Monday 7 December 2009
Google search for ‘ Climategate ’ : Beginning of November : Nil – 28 November : 10.4 million hits and rising – 6 December : 31.6 million and still rising !!!!
The international stakes are monumental .
Never in the history of science has a single issue generated so much interest and controversy .
Looking closer , never in the history of science has there been such a flagrant disregard for the fundamental requirements of scientific endeavour .
These are clearly described in the UNESCO / ICSU Declaration on science and the use of scientific knowledge ( 1999 ) .
The following are passages from the declaration that are directly relevant to the climate change issue .
The emphases are mine .
We seek active collaboration across all the fields of scientific endeavour , i.e. the natural sciences such as the physical , earth and biological sciences , the biomedical and engineering sciences , and the social and human sciences .
Today , there is need for a vigorous and informed democratic debate on the production and use of scientific knowledge …
Greater interdisciplinary efforts , involving both natural and social sciences , are a prerequisite for dealing with ethical , social , cultural , environmental , gender , economic and health issues .
Scientists have a special responsibility for seeking to avert applications of science , which are ethically wrong or have adverse impact .
The practice of scientific research and the use of knowledge from that research should always aim at the welfare of humankind .
The social responsibility of scientists requires that they maintain high standards of scientific integrity and quality control , share their knowledge , communicate with the public and educate the younger generation .
There are obviously many scientists who are deeply disturbed by the climategate affair and its inevitable consequences on the image of science as an honourable profession .
For example , this is what the UK Prime Minister is reported to have announced .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown led a chorus of condemnation against “ flat - earth ” climate change sceptics who have tried to derail the Copenhagen summit by casting doubt on the evidence for global warming .
As Shakespeare once wrote – herein lies the rub .
Surely , it is elementary high school science that in order to prove that A is a consequence of B , it is a fundamental requirement to demonstrate that B is not the consequence of C or D .
In the case of global warming there is another possible cause .
An obvious alternative to human causality is that the warming may be the consequence of changes in received solar energy and its poleward redistribution via the atmospheric and oceanic processes .
This possible linkage has been the subject of investigations in South Africa alone for more than 100 years , but completely ignored by the climate change scientists .
They blithely maintain that the changes in received solar energy are too small to influence climate .
However , they still have to explain what causes El Nino that everybody agrees has a large influence on climate .
If it is not related to the effects of variations in solar activity what alternative explanation is there ?
In 1889 , more than 100 years ago , the Knysna forester D E Hutchins reported as follows in his book Cycles of drought and good seasons in South Africa .
This confirmation comes from the Cape Town Observatory .
The returns for thirty years from the Cape Town Observatory show a close correspondence between sun-spots and temperatures the maximum of temperature lagging a year behind the minimum of sun-spots . ( p17 ) .
At Cape Town , the correspondence between the mean rainfall and mean sunspot frequency has long been an established fact .
( p25 ) .
For these reasons we ought to consider the Cape Town Observatory rainfall figures as of great importance to ourselves , an importance enhanced by the fact that they go back to the year 1842 .
For the three cycles comprised in the period 1842 to 1875 the mean annual rainfall at the Royal Observatory , Cape Town , was : –
During Minimum Sunspot years 21.05 inches .
“ Intermediate “ 23.59 “
“ Maximum “ 27.95 “
In 1970 the South African Commission of Enquiry into Water Matters recommended that research be undertaken on the possible solar influence on water resources .
Two days ago the UK Met Office buckled under public pressure .
It announced plans to release , early next week , station temperature records for over one thousand of the stations that make up the global land surface temperature record .
I can be of assistance .
One of the records will be that of the South African weather station at Cape Agulhas .
This is the southern tip of the African continent .
It is far removed from urbanisation or other disturbing influences .
This is one of my early sketches .
While there was an increase in temperature from 1918 to 1986 it was associated with increases in both solar activity and beneficial increases in widespread rainfall .
This confirms Hutchin ’s observations 100 years earlier .
It negates the claim that temperature increases will have undesirable consequences and result in our planet becoming uninhabitable .
Concurrent increases in sunspot activity , temperature and widespread rainfall .
A more sophisticated and incontestable linkage is shown in the following figure from one of my early presentations .
Comparison of the characteristics of annual sunspot densities with corresponding characteristics of the annual flows in the Vaal River .
These two examples are a very small sample of our well documented studies on the solar linkage during the past thirty years .
The linkage is unequivocal .
Despite a diligent analysis of a comprehensive hydroclimatic database of more than eleven thousand annual observations , we were unable to detect any trends or abnormalities in the data that could be attributed to human activities .
Why are we vilified for our solidly based scientific endeavours ?
There can only be one reason .
Our conscientious studies completely undermine the very basis of climate alarmism .
There is abundant , well documented evidence demonstrating the solar connection , but none at all that supports human causality .
We are not sceptics .
We simply presented the facts based on thorough , prolonged studies .
Our publications and reports are freely available .
They include the data and analytical methodologies .
Where do we go from here ?
The millions of Google hits ( about a million per day ) confirm that there are thousands of scientists and others who share our concerns .
The climate change scientists and their institutions have painted themselves into a corner from which there is no escape .
If the investigations that are now underway confirm that global temperatures increased during the past century this is still a long way from proving human causality .
When the Met Office provides global temperature data do you think that they will provide concurrent rainfall data from the same stations ?
If not , then why not ?
If rainfall decreased synchronously with temperature increases this would provide undeniable proof of a linkage .
Why did they not follow this route ?
Once again the answer is obvious .
There is no scientifically believable linkage between temperature increases and rainfall decreases .
Rising temperatures will increase the habitability of our planet and the welfare of its citizens .
Tactical error
The most recent development is that on 4 December Working Group 1 of the IPCC issued a statement that it firmly stands behind the conclusions reached in its 2007 assessment reports , “ The key finding that the warming in the climate system is unequivocal . ”
This is still a long way from proving human causality .
The only proof that they can offer is manipulated deductions from limited tree ring measurements in remote areas of the globe that show that present global temperatures are higher than any experienced in the past thousands of years .
Therefore the increases must be due to human activities .
I repeat my question .
Why did they not base their conclusions on solid analyses of rainfall and river flow measurements during the past 100 years ?
Their statement also defends the integrity of the individual scientists involved in the climategate affair .
I share the view that the individuals should not become the scapegoats for the scientifically corrupt system .
I have personal experience of the extent to which climate alarmists are prepared to go to silence the opposition .
An unforeseen consequence of the working group ’s proclaimed support for the individuals and their tactics in particular , now places the whole IPCC structure in the same boat .
If the investigations confirm serious shortfalls in procedures used in the two institutions , then by its own admission , the same criticisms must apply to the IPCC itself .

7 December 2009
French yacht designer Vincent Le Page , based in London , had revealed an innovative and ecologically friendly superyacht The Beach .
This 62 m extraordinary project was among the finalists in the annual Young Designer of the Year 2008 award .
The Beach features a quite stunning beach club formed by dropping one whole side of the yacht .
She is also very stylish and efficient .
Helical wind turbines and solar panels are used to provide renewable energy .
“ The designed of the yacht was inspired by the idea of an artificial island .
The yacht consumes 100 per cent natural energy when in island position and has a reduced carbon footprint while cruising ” , said Vincent Le Page .
The 460sq m beach club platform would provide ample space for relaxing .
There is also a pool on the main deck , several tenders , PWCs and two 6 m sailing yachts for water sport lovers .
It would take 10 minutes to deploy the beach area .
All cabins will be glazed with 100 per cent recyclable one - way glass .
“ This permits passive heating and cooling of the interiors .
Rooms surrounded by glass offer an uninterrupted view of the landscape when the yacht is in island position ” , said the designer .
When cruising under 10 knots
The Beach would rely on hybrid diesel electric drives .
The conventional diesels will be used only when traveling at higher speeds .
The Beach will accommodate 12 passengers , her estimated cost is around $ 150 millions .

This time next week Berlin will be suffering a hangover second only to the one that followed the collapse of the Wall 20 years ago .
Even though a whole generation has now grown up across Europe with no first - hand memory of the dismembered city and the divided country that surrounded it , the scenes from 9 November , 1989 , are lived and relived as the defining images of the end of the Cold War .
It is not just that this was one of the first events to be broadcast worldwide , in the earliest days of live 24 - hour television , from anywhere – although it was .
It was the sheer , undiluted ecstasy of the occasion .
The Berlin Wall was demolished euphorically , spontaneously , almost by accident .
A barrier that had taken years to build was torn down in hours with pick - axes brought from home , and bare hands .
And the spell was broken that had kept 17 million Germans , and much of the eastern part of Europe , in thrall for almost half a century .
While there is no risk that the memory of this euphoric night will soon fade – especially not while the successive anniversaries of 1989 are still celebrated – the memory of the strange and cruel years that preceded it is vanishing all too fast .
Not just in Germany , east and west , but right across what used to be called the Eastern bloc , the experience of repression and occupation is being consigned to an artistic world of fiction and film that is becoming unreal even to those who endured it .

Three years ago , the German film The Lives of Others came close to capturing the claustrophobia and paranoia of those years , while drawing criticism for the narrowness of the social milieu it depicted .
A year later , the Romanian film 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days drew in harrowing detail a small picture of Ceausescu 's Romania , through the experience of a student seeking a banned abortion .
And last year Andrzej Wajda 's epic , Katyn , exposed what happens when a country is forced by the dominating power to live a lie , and how that lie determines everything .
Such portrayals of persecution , compromise and amoral accommodations , however , have been few and far between .
And already they are giving way to a genre in which history is repeated as farce , without passing first through tragedy .
Tales from the Golden Age , which has just gone on general release in the UK , is one such , exposing the absurdities that flourished in Ceausescu 's Romania in a succession of dramatised " myths " that could , equally well , have been true .
There is gravitas in the vignettes about honourable individuals who are turned by a perverse state into criminals , the fiction that masquerades as truth , and the corruption which so penetrates society that honour ceases to be an absolute and is measured by degrees .
But an audience without the experience or knowledge to appreciate that real people were driven by threats , vindictiveness and fear to behave in such debasing ways , has no reason to treat the absurdity they see on screen as the national catastrophe it actually was , rather than the comedy it appears now .
No one would condemn those who suffered in the myriad ways perfected by totalitarian regimes for wanting to forget the reality of their past so soon .
After the Berlin Wall fell , they had a lot of life to make up : family life , professional life , intellectual life .
Why should they root around in this demeaning and perhaps shaming time ?
Why should they impose on their children a burden of fear they need never know ?
And the transformed climate in which the children born after 1989 in East and Central Europe have grown up is too rarely remarked upon .
Not only have they known nothing other than material plenty – shop shelves are full ; fresh fruit and vegetables are available around the year ; parents do not need to spend a small fortune at private markets to ensure their children are properly nourished – they have also grown up uninhibited by intrusive and malicious state scrutiny .
In some places , and for some people , old fears linger .
For decades yet there will be those who are woken by nightmares about prison camps , who live in terror of a knock at the door , who are paralysed by a sharp word from anyone in authority .
But they will be fewer and fewer .
The fall of the Wall , and everything that followed , lifted the collective sense of fear literally overnight .
This was inspiring for all who lived through it and for the many millions more who watched it from afar .
But it was mostly inspiring because , then , everyone well understood what had gone before .
If repression is consigned to oblivion , or translated so soon into farce , the real human cost of those years will not be commemorated , as it should be , in future .

ANKARA / JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel apologized to Turkey on Wednesday for publicly dressing down Ankara ’s ambassador in a dispute that has strained the once good ties between the Jewish state and the Muslim regional power .
Israel 's Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon ( L ) meets Turkey 's ambassador to Israel Ahmet Oguz Celikkol at the Knesset , the Israeli parliament , in Jerusalem January 11 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Lior Mizrahi
Turkey had demanded a formal apology for Ambassador Oguz Celikkol ’s treatment on Monday and threatened to recall him .
But after receiving the letter of apology on Wednesday , Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan threw a new barb at Israel , saying it should do more for peace in the region .
Turkey , as a Muslim country , is an important ally of Israel and in the past has helped forge contacts between the Jewish state and the Arab world .
But relations have deteriorated following criticism by Erdogan of Israel ’s offensive in the Gaza Strip last year .
The latest row broke out after Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon summoned Celikkol on Monday to protest against a Turkish television drama that portrayed Israeli diplomats as masterminds of a child abduction ring .
Ayalon invited media crews to the beginning of the meeting in Jerusalem and pointed out there was no Turkish flag on the table .
He also said he was deliberately avoiding a handshake with the ambassador .
In television images broadcast in Turkey , Celikkol was seen seated on a low couch , accentuating the sense of a slight .
Ayalon later conceded his behavior toward the envoy had been inappropriate .
But Turkish President Abdullah Gul , who is scheduled to host Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday , said that was insufficient and demanded a full apology .
Israel sent a formal letter of apology to Celikkol on Thursday .
“ I had no intention to humiliate you personally and apologize for the way the demarche was handled and perceived , Ayalon said in the letter , released by the Israeli government .
“ Please convey this to the Turkish people for whom we have great respect .
I hope that both Israel and Turkey will seek diplomatic and courteous channels to convey messages as two allies should . ”
In response , Erdogan said the Turkish foreign ministry had received “ the expected , desired answer . ”
But he added more criticism of Israel , telling a news conference : “ Israel must put itself in order and it must be more just and more on the side of peace in the region . ”
PROTEST REMAINS VALID
Ayalon had said earlier that his protest against the Turkish criticism of Israel remained valid .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamim Netanyahu also said thought the protest was correct but handled badly , according to his office .
As a predominantly Muslim nation , albeit with a secular constitution , as well as a NATO military power , Turkey is a key ally for Israel in the Middle East .
As well as providing security cooperation , Ankara has offered Israel diplomatic help in the past , notably mediating with Syria in 2008 .
But ties have become frosty since Israel ’s war in the Palestinian Islamist - ruled Gaza Strip a year ago , which drew frequent public censure from Erdogan , whose AK Party ’s roots lie in political Islam .
Netanyahu has said Turkey was aligning itself with Muslim countries hostile to Israel like Iran since before the Gaza war .
There was similar outrage last year over a Turkish series which featured Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian children .
On Tuesday in London , Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu renewed his country ’s criticism of Israel over Gaza .
He said its 2008 invasion of the territory had marked the turning point in Turkish - Israeli relations .
Despite the row , a Turkish delegation is currently in Israel to wrap up the purchase of 10 Heron drones in a deal worth $ 180 million , Turkish defense officials said .
KABUL , Afghanistan 
An American military detention camp in Afghanistan is still holding inmates , sometimes for weeks at a time , without access to the International Committee of the Red Cross , according to human rights researchers and former detainees held at the site on the Bagram Air Base .
The site , known to detainees as the black jail , consists of individual windowless concrete cells , each illuminated by a single light bulb glowing 24 hours a day .
In interviews , former detainees said that their only human contact was at twice - daily interrogation sessions .
“ The black jail was the most dangerous and fearful place , ” said Hamidullah , a spare - parts dealer in Kandahar who said he was detained there in June .
“ They do n’t let the I.C.R.C. officials or any other civilians see or communicate with the people they keep there .
Because I did not know what time it was , I did not know when to pray . ”
The jail ’s operation highlights a tension between President Obama ’s goal to improve detention conditions that had drawn condemnation under the Bush administration and his stated desire to give military commanders leeway to operate .
While Mr. Obama signed an order to eliminate so - called black sites run by the Central Intelligence Agency in January , it did not also close this jail , which is run by military Special Operations forces .
‘ KopBusters ’ filmmaker hails collective effort to ‘ fight corruption ’
A high - profile Texas drug prisoner is prisoner no more .
On Friday , Dec. 18 , a federal judge in Odessa granted Yolanda Madden her freedom , allowing her to walk out of state custody for the first time in nearly five years .
Federal judge Rob Junell ordered Madden ’s sentence vacated because the prosecution had withheld evidence that might have negated a key piece of material evidence , according to The Odessa American .

He added that neither the Odessa police nor the U.S. District Attorney ’s office appeared to be involved in wrongdoing in the case .
A retrial is possible in March , 2010 .
Madden , jailed in 2005 on a conviction of intent to distribute methamphetamine within 1,000 feet of a school zone , was the reason that Barry Cooper came to Odessa , Texas last December .
After being hired to embarrass the local police by Yolanda ’s father Raymond , Cooper set up a fake marijuana grow house and baited officers to stage an illegal raid .
When they did , police were confronted by an empty house and lots of cameras , with a hand - written poster explaining they had become part of a new reality show called “ KopBusters ” .
For Yolanda , the stunt was just the beginning of efforts to secure her freedom .
“ This is so exciting , ” Cooper told RAW STORY .
“ We ’re so happy to see Yolanda out of that cage and back with her family where she belongs . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Everybody knows we attached this case and ‘ KopBuster ’ program to my attorney general campaign as proof that citizens can band together to fight corruption , ” he told an Odessa CBS affiliate station .
On the CBS news video , Madden ’s grandmother literally dances for joy after embracing her granddaughter for the first time in years .
Odessa police , which Cooper and the Madden family insist planted drugs on Yolanda and lied to ensure her conviction , had no reaction to the ruling .

“ My message to [ others with family in jail ] :
Never stop visiting your loved ones behind bars and if you have , reunite now ! ” Cooper told RAW STORY .
“ Always send letters .
Raise hell if your loved one is caged for a non-violent drug crime .
Now is the time to yell because this unjustified drug war is finally receiving the attention and criticisms it deserves .
Go now and support your incarcerated sons and daughters and husbands and wives and mothers and fathers and cousins and friends . ”
“ The City of Odessa remains confident that justice will be served in this case , ” read a prepared statement , noted by CBS 7 .

A pretty entertaining game .
An okay game -- cute story , lots of detail , and I love the whole style where you click to interact with the world .
However , it seemed to fluctuate between too easy , perfect difficulty , and flat - out impossible .
Definitely had to use the walkthrough on this one , which makes me feel like I 'm cheating .
The clues for the spaceship switchboard and mechanical door at the end with the colors were excellent ; the clues ( if there were any ) for the rooms with the hazardous gas was rather obscure , and opening the cage at the end seemed like it was just trial and error .
Maybe some more clues next time ?
Puzzles are only fun if you have the tools to solve them .
All in all , though , a pretty fun little game .
The baby dragon was adorable .
VIEWPOINT
Greig Whitehead
For millions of people in Africa , climate change is a reality , says Greig Whitehead .
However , as he explains in this week 's Green Room , in religious nations such as Kenya , many believe that tackling global warming is beyond their control .
Even with trust in the power of God , Kenya is a country on the brink of disaster
Kenya is a deeply religious country .
Christians , Muslims and Hindus alike assemble for regular and often lengthy worship ; prayers are offered up before and after every public meeting , and even before starting a cross-country " safari " , the god of one 's faith is called on to bless the journey .
So it comes as no surprise to hear a female pastoralist from the arid lands of North - East Kenya decrying the combined wisdom of the world 's scientists , after being told that climate change is man-made .
" How can man change the climate and make it stop raining : it is God 's will that has brought the drought , " she utters .
But even with trust in the power of God , Kenya is a country on the brink of disaster .
As news reports show , the country 's rivers are drying , its more remote areas are turning to desert , and the food chain - from land , to animals , to humans - is breaking down .
The ramifications of the rural drought now stretch to the streets of Nairobi , where five million people face daily power rationing , severe water shortages and higher food prices .
In battle terms , Kenya is on the frontline ; it is staring climate change in the face .
Climate for change
But to deal with the global phenomenon , Kenya's " wananchi " ( citizens ) need to understand the complex of challenges they are up against , including a range of home - grown factors .
Gathering drinking water is becoming even more difficult for many in Africa A growing population , coupled with insufficient investment in rural infrastructure and land management , makes it even more difficult to adapt to climate change and stave off the impending disasters brought by human induced global warming .
For the future of Kenya , it is vital that practical solutions are found to meet people 's concerns and help build sustainable systems that are less vulnerable to increasingly unpredictable weather patterns .
Most importantly , it is up to the youth of Kenya to take up the fight on climate change ; to succeed where their elders are failing and to inspire a new generation to change their thinking and adapt their ways .
There are more than 4,000 secondary schools across Kenya , and apart from their purely academic function , most of them play a key role as a focal point for the surrounding community .
Secondary schools are well place to act as catalysts for community action .
The 12 % of youth fortunate to attend these schools - the country 's future leaders - have the knowledge and abilities to become " change - agents " , able to motivate people to develop a better understanding of the causes and impacts of environmental degradation .
This then provides a foundation on which to discuss and take action .
' Here and now ' Climate change is about the here and now in Kenya , already seriously affecting the wellbeing of millions of people .
Wangari Maathai has inspired many people to take action
It is a salutary warning for the more affluent countries in the North that a problem which - in essence - they have created , through industrialisation and development , will in time rebound to affect their own livelihoods .
Climate change is a global issue transcending national boundaries , but impacting first on those who can least afford to cope with the consequences .
The " God not man " cry from the lady in Kenya 's northern reaches illustrates a common problem relating to understanding the underlying causes , and underscores the incapability of people in such situations to deal with the crisis that has impacted so severely on their communities .
As Wangari Maathai , the Nobel Peace Prize winner , notes : " Climate change will bring massive ecological and economic challenges therefore , alleviating dehumanising poverty will become even more difficult . "
One of the keys to enable understanding and adaptation is to harness the power and ingenuity of youth .
As Kefa Kones Kibet , a 17 - year - old from Nakuru High School in Kenya 's Rift Valley , remarks : " Climate change causes suffering for people .
Many people in Africa walk for miles in search of water .
" Women are the ones who suffer most because they are the ones who look out for the family .
People should be educated on how to plant trees and how best to use the little water available .
" The only way to curb climate change is through action now for a better tomorrow . "
Greig Whitehead is programme manager for the International Climate Challenge , Kenya The Green Room is a series of opinion articles on environmental topics running weekly on the BBC News website Do you agree with Greig Whitehead ?
In Africa , do young people hold the key to tackling climate change ?
How can people match climate science with religious beliefs ?
Is it the responsibility of industrialised nations to prevent dangerous climate change ?
It is true that the Youth will be the salvation of Kenya , but only if they are given the ' tools ' to see and understand the issues at hand .
To do this the speed of institutional change needs to be cranked up a few notches .
There should be a concerted effort for Donors NGO 's and Govt to redirect their focus on the Youth through programs in all learning institutions and religious programs which have a tremendous outreach in Kenya .
The time is now , yesterday , not tomorrow , we 're running out of time .
To do this we need to have the ability to enact changes of this magnitude quickly .
We need to fast track the systems so that they can begin to take effect immediately .
Sadly in our world of bureaucracy without great political will and vision this could be a pipe dream .
We cannot afford to give up trying though .
Su Kahumbu , Nairobi Kenya Praying wo n't save you .
Bleddyn Bowen , Aberystwyth , Wales , UK true that religion provides convenient escape from responsibility .
yes , opportunity exist for using the education network to confront climate change .
dont generally think that this should be lumped over one group say the youth over any other .
similarly other community networks can also be utilised .
the greatest challenge is that the average kenyan spends more than 98 % of his labor time struggling to make ends meet .
conservation efforts have largely been painted as magnanimous efforts rather than pure survival .
sure educational institutions ( and others ) can make an effort to include practical conservation as part of the curriculum , but at the expense of what else ?
many youths have no time to engage in conservation after school since they are engaged in other chores .
answer lies in govt policy change to actively pursue conservation at all levels .
in fact its not conservation but restoration thats needed

The decline of all aspects of the earth 's environment and resources is a fulfillment of Bible prophecy .
At Revelation 's Fourth Seal , one - fourth part of the earth is to be destroyed before we move forward to the next Seal events ( Re.6:7- 8 ) .
The earth is on a downhill slid from which it will not recover .
Revelation 's first four Trumpet events will destroy an additional one - third ( Re.8:7-12 ) .
Bible Prophecy on the Web
Patricia Burns , Tempe , AZ , America Tess from Nairobi , Robert Harris from Derby and others have rightly pointed out that belief in God entails stewardship and responsibility towards creation .
By contrast , this article paints the rather simplistic picture of poor , uneducated people who refrain from responsible action because of their religious belief - the argument being based on the utterance of one single person somewhere in Kenya .
In any case , the Pope , in his encylica " Charity in Truth " and his message " If you want to cultivate peace , protect creation " has recently made quite clear that a new global solidarity , new socio- economic rules , new lifestyles and even a new model of development are needed to tackle the great ecological and socio-economic challenges of our day .
The encyclica also makes clear that the environmental challenges cannot be adressed separately from integral human development in all its dimensions .
This advice stems from the type of integral , interdisciplinary approach which we need , and which the type of simplistic thinking which would isolate the sciences from one another and from their philosophical and moral dimensions is unable to provide .
Let 's follow it .
Daniel , Salzburg , Austria @ Andrea , Prag :
Re your comment about people in developing countries having larger numbers of children than in developing worlds you should realise that one of the main reasons for doing this is purely for survival .
If you do n't know whether your newborn will survive their first bout of malaria then why put all your eggs in one basket ?
Adam , Gloucestershire I dont think it is God 's will for global warming to occur , though of course he is letting it happen .
Although I am not 100 % convinced it is due to man , if it is I would not be surprised .
I do wonder if it is part of the end times in which according to Jesus there will be enormous suffering ?
Peter Culbert , Belfast , N Ireland To Billy Hires of Tampa Fla ;
It is pathetic people like you with their " God disposes and I obey , therefore I do what I want " irresponsible attitude what put us here in the first place , all I have to say is that faith is blindness , and there is not worse blind than those like you who do not want to see .
It is not ignorance what blinds you my friend , it is sheer stupidity .
Adgy , Puerto Rico
With the article of Greig Whitehead here is my misfeelings , global warming is man made no doubt and it is one of the major criterion of climate change .
In addition with Africa , I would like to say that young people of all poor countries hold the key to tackling climate change .
And also would not like to add climate science with relegious beleifs .
Rich countries are mostly liable for this global warming .
Because human beings have been changed their lifestyle through industrial revulution and this activities are influencing the temperature of the global atmoshphere .
So rich countries are mostly responsible to reduce the GH GAS emission by investing money to keep the global temperature in limit .
Engr Md Abdus Salam , LGED , Kushtia , Bangladesh
Yes , climate change is in the hands of the Almighty God .
Does anyone know where the snow comes from .
Who formed the beatifull Alps and Victoria falls ?.
Can anyone try to form them ?.
Does anyone know who withholds or creates rain ?.
It is all in the power of God .
Man cannot predict about the weather for next year .
We cannot prepare with accuracy .
We can only rely on the past weather patterns and the current phenomenon particularly across the vast water ocean masses to predict the immediate weather for the next couple of days .
God changes the waves and the rain at any time and at His will .
In addition , we go to church to pray to our Creator ( God ) to give the world including the sciencetists and environmentalists like the Nobel Prize Winner Wangari Mathai of Kenya the knowledge and wisdom to help us conserve the environment and make the world a better place to live in .
As we are talking , Kenya has embarked on tree planting which means God is answering our prays .
Read the Bible , Job 30 ( God speaks at last ) .
Verses 22,23 , 25 speaks of the condition in Europe currently , when God asks '
Have you entered the storehouse of the snow and seen the treasury of the hail ..
Which I have reserved for the times of stress , for the days of the war and battle ?
Who has laid out a channel for the downpour and for the thunderstom a path ..
To bring rain to no man 's land the unpeopled wilderness .
My dear friends read the rest and gain more knowledge and wisdom .
The fear of the Almighty God is the beginning of wisdom .
Rosemary , UK
Rosemary Wandia , Bristol , UK After the 2002 general elections , Kenyans were the most optimistic people on earth .
They believed that their new leaders would steer them to greater heights economically and otherwise .
The youth were very positive and believed Kenya was on the threshhold of a new dawn to control the destiny of the country .
Many embraced political decisions such a free primary education including going as far as making free will contributions for any project that would bring prosperity to the country .
Five years later , it is the same youth who were being used to destroy the very foundations they had painstakingly build .
In a nutshell , Kenyan youth have the energy to build and bring to fruition the dreams they cherish including a prosperous country where there is no blackouts , drought , etc , all brought about by poor management of the country 's resources and political polarisation .
The youth only need patriotic , selfless leaders to inspire them into catalysts of positive change .
The youth are the future of Kenya !
Raymond Macharia , London
The problems facing much of Africa are not caused by ' man made climate change ' but by local decimation of the land .
Chopping down all the trees for fuel / building materials / to make farm land means drier air , more soil errosion and eventually famine .
Deforestation caused the Ethiopian famines in the ' 80s and contrary to what Al Gore says is why the snow on Kilimanjaro is melting .
Its still well below 0 'C on top of the mountain but the deforested slopes mean that dry air , not humid is flowing up the mountain so no new snow is falling .
Management of the land is an African issue not ours .
Peter Symonds , Notts I agree with Thom from Vancouver , it is directly possible to engage with such thinking .
The problem is not that she believes in God , but that she believes in an impersonal God who does not react to our own behaviour .
Fatalism prepares people to die , which is awful if there is a way to live .
The Christian position is that there is always a choice , a way to find life in a situation and choose it .
We believe that things can change , not because we are resourceful or stubborn , but because we can listen to warnings and change our behaviour ( as with Jonah and Nineveh ) .
To sabotage your own predictive ability in this way is foolish , but it can perhaps be reduced by using examples from their own life where they avoided danger .
" You could have died but you saw the danger and avoided it , was that God 's will ? "
Josh W , Swansea , Wales ah , more supersitious thinking when it is convenient for humans .
Oooh , we can't do anything , so we can continue on our path .
My opinion , keep your ignorance if you wish , but do not expect any help from the science that you willfully ignore .
No more medicine , agricultural assistance , etc , for Kenya .
andrea , harrisburg , USA i believe everyone irrespective of age has the capability of handling all situations .
just need focus and application of mind .
those who feel responsible should combine religious feelings of people with science and educate all people about this .
people want results .
so called industrialised nations can bring miraculous changes in the lives of these people and all over the world because they have resources .
if we all start thinking about something together and put our heart and soul into it everything is possible on this mother earth .
it is truly shameful that somewhere people are wasting water and somewhere one is just walking and walking for few drops of water
poonam loomba , ambala / india
How ironic that in an article declaring that the children of Kenya must be the ones to spearhead change , there is a photo of a child whose shoes can't hold her feet in , who has barely any flesh on her stick - thin legs , carrying a bottle with only a tiny amount of very dirty water .
The word ' trees ' appears only once in the article , but Kenya 's drought has as much to do with tree - cutting as with climate change .
As Waangari Maathai says ' You have to see the linkages ' .
Ann , Madison , WI The problem with " climate change " as presented by Mr Whitehead is that it is based on the assumption that the pre-industrial state is somehow ideal , and should be preserved .
The truth is that the climate always changes , with or without human contribution , and that life is , and has always been a major factor in that change .
Life created the current atmosphere , for without plants there would be no oxygen .
So the fact that humans affect the climate is neither exceptional , nor by necessity bad .
Many regions of the world could become more human - friendly through " global warming " .
Earth has seen far warmer periods than the projected " catastrophe " , and the ice - ages were not exactly balmy .
The planet will be fine , even when its " average temperature " ( whatever that means ) will be 3C higher .
Life will adapted and thrive , as it as done since it aeons .
Whether humanity will be fine , either during a warmer phase , or during a new Ice Age ( as we were fearing in the seventies :) , will depend on how we tackle our real problems .
If not , we 'll be one of the many species that lived for a while on Earth , like the dinosaurs .
Like many of Africa 's problems , wailing about who or what caused them and how unjust it all is does not contribute one jot to the solution .
History is history , and if we go back far enough , each and everyone of us has ancestors that were robbed , enslaved , displaced , raped , tortured and killed .
By " historical " standards every human is both victim and perpetrator .
The drought in Kenya will not be solved by globally reducing CO2 emissions , but by local measures , such as reforestation , better land and water management , and reducing population growth .
Stefaan Eeckels , Harlange , Luxembourg
The young people in Africa are a key part to the future of their country in this crisis but they need help from the industralised world to survive this terrible tragedy .
Climate Change will continue to increase in severity based upon the majority of scientist findings .
Religious beliefs are very important and it may be the only thing these people will have to rely on for help but without physical action by the world 's industralised nations the loss of human life and untold suffering will increase .
We must decide now to help or face a very dangerous world for all the young people of the world !
Mike Koutelis , Epping , New Hampshire Until all religious recognize that man created the divine , delusion will continue .
We could say that it is God 's will that they suffer their delusion and die from it , too , but that would be unkind to the naive .
Nonetheless , their delusion hinders the serious effort to reduce global warming .
They are putting themselves in a position where they will simply not matter anymore , and that is tragic .
Dr. David Heinimann , Terrace , British Columbia , Canada Most of Africa is dysfunctional with criminal dictatorships and really ignorant and stupid administrations .
When Ethiopia first requested food aid 30 years ago , their population was 30 million - today it is 70 million .
Smart hey ??
Last year for the first time in history South Africa became a net importer of food - over 10 00 farmers have been chased off the land in Southern Africa since 1990 .
Commercial farms divided up into small subsistence plots is no answer - but it is " African Culture " Maybe starvation every so often is " African culture " too ??
Dennis , Johannesburg Whitehead 's piece has little truth .
Not only the youth can do this .
All Kenyans alike are to play their roles , since this is a complex society where every old man 's opinion highly valued by the youth and the whole society for that matter .
And that is the way this country will / has always operate ( d ) .
Benn Olage , Nairobi , Kenya
This is God 's work i doubt there is much we can do about it !
The poor countries are the most vulnerable to increasingly unpredictable weather .
We are all responsible we should take action now and come up with solutions and pray for a better tomorrow .
Marciano Koorndijk , Paramaribo / Suriname .
South America
I strongly agree with Greig Whitehead .
Many African youth do not possess the basic skills to combat climate challenges as result of poverty , illiteracy and youthful exuberance .
In African tradition , religion is best understood in the conservation of the environment , thus in many African societies , natural forest is protected and conserved based on the belief that it serves as abode for supernatural beings .
Therefore , if such tradition is still in practice , there would be less deforestion which is a major cause of climate change .
It is the duty of developed nations to mitigate dangerous climate change because they are more responsible for the causes and feel less of its impacts which is majorly felt by most African countries and consequently aggravating sincere efforts to reduce poverty and other economic problems .
Aina Abiola .
A , Ibadan , Nigeria Yes , climate change is a man-make disaster , which the LDCs , specially the Africans , are the most affected and victimized .
Food production is enough to all , but not equally distributed .. so , if we have no spare planet , we need to agree to save our planet and meet our future together
Dr.Bashir Herika , Khartoum / Sudan
I beleive that young people have a responsibility to their environment and a connection to our planet which combines spiritual and pragmatic phenomena .
Earth is a mother , and should be cared for as such , with lovingkindness , dignity , and wisdom , and responsibility , not trespassing the will of the creator .
Climate change is in the hands of the Creator , in whose infinite wisdom we all rely and through Whom we are all connected .
Teresa , sudarshan , vaishnudevi
It is a great pity if Greig Whitehead does not seem to see that religious leaders are at least as important as schools , and probaboy much more so , in educating and mobilising the population to meet climate change , especially in a country like Kenya .
Christian
Aid has produced material for educatio and discussion on climate change in churches here in the UK ( read ' Angels with Trumpets ' by Paula Clifford , head of theology at Christian Aid , pub . by DLT , London 2009 ) and no doubt could help provide context - specific material for Kenya .
The way to tackle theological ignorance is through good instruction , making the churches a real force for change .
Revd Dr Liz Carmichael , Oxford , UK
Of course it is overpopulation less consumption is in our hands there are no supernatural gods .
Reality is more powerful than us it will destroy us all if we continue to deny it .
charles j jaggers , glynneath neath wales uk In a way these Kenyans are right to believe that climate change is out of their control .
Combating climate change will have to be a global effort , and it seems we would need a miracle of some kind for that to happen .
Chelsea , Salinas , CA , USA
If Kenya is a deeply religious country , there needs to be more emphasis put on the facts of science with regards to the global climate change .
Kenyans need to know that they are a significant factor when it comes to preventing their harmful future .
They need to see that things CAN be done to limit the probability of their everyday living negatively affecting them .
Why make it harder for you when you can take insignificant ( but significant ) tasks that will continualy advance your surroundings despite what is happening where you have no control .
How can something that is being proven right in front of your face not be undertaken as a serious matter ?
Mind boggling .
With regards to young people holding the key to tackle climate change , sure , I think young people have the ability to raise awareness of climate change .
It 's just a matter of them learning about the effect by school or an outside source and being shown that they CAN make a difference .
Lindsey Warburton , Toronto , Ontario , Canada
Young people are much more aware of the damage we are doing to the planet , so yes they should be heavily involved in helping to tackle the problem .
As to industrialized countries , of course they should be responsible , they have made enormous sums of money treating the planet as one large waste dump , now that those effects threaten all the planets inhabitants it is their responsibility to take action .
However having witnessed how things work in the US , I do n't have much faith that people will do the right thing , greed always trumps doing whats right :(
Dan Stewart , USA
Whether on religious or other grounds the story is always ; " my contribution is too small to make a difference , a drop in a bucket . "
In the 1930s my grandfather lived on the edge of the Oklahoma dust bowl .
While others starved he prospered by doing three things .
He kept his farm covered in cotton burrs which he got for free from the local gin .
By so doing he acquired several inches of good Oklahoma land .
He dismantled a 15000 gallon cedar water tank a firm no longer needed and re-erected it on his farm .
He changed his primary crop from cotton to a commercial garden and by taking advantage of the water tank he was able to produce fresh vegetables in seasons when others could not .
In short , he did all he was able six days a week and prayed for God 's forgiveness and help on the seventh .
One man can make a difference , at least to his wife and seven children , his neighbors and the community in which he lives .
If the world becomes a slightly better place that is a good thing too .
Sandy Almond , Knoxville , Tennessee USA
We all have a stake in the fight against global warming .
Although the young and the old have differing perspectives on various issues , climate change requires unity of purpose .
I like the idea of involving high school and University students in environmental conservation efforts .
In addition , I would suggest that all kenyans to have a mandatory National Youth Service for atleast one year .
During this period , the youth would participate in environment and infrustructural development .
Paul Njenga , Missouri , USA
It makes me angry that people think that the dire situation in Kenya is caused by global warming .
Global warming is real but the inequalities between the worlds richest and poorest countries have always existed .
I 'm sick of global warming being used as a scape goat by the developed world were in fact we are enjoying an earth destroying lifestyle by taking advantage of those from poorer nations .
Ian Pham , Kenmore , Australia
This " God not man " business is a more subtle frame - of - reference problem than it might appear to be at first glance .
I , for example , would use the word " nature " in place of " God " when trying to frame phenomena such as droughts .
Furthermore , I would link an effect such as a drought to causes such as human activity .
There may be other causes as well , but human activity is one that we humans can do something about .
My framework could be summed up as one in which nature reacts to everything that takes place , including human activity .
A framework in which God reacts to everything that takes place , including human activity , is little different , and might be just as useful for encouraging people to change their ways .
It is easy enough to argue that God is so angry at us for burning so much of His fossil fuels , cutting down so many of His forests , and despoiling so much of His world in general , that He is punishing us with droughts and other calamities , and will continue to do so until we repent and change our behaviour .
In my example here , I have used the concept of a male God , but it is easy enough to substitute
Him with a female God , a gender - neutral God , or multiple Gods that vary widely in description .
None of that really matters .
The point is that all frameworks that spring from the human mind are imperfect models of how the world really works , but they are all we have to explain the world to ourselves , so we might as well work with them as best we can .
Thom Oud , Vancouver Canada
Yes , there are many religious people who think that either God OR man does things in this world .
This is also assumed by many non-religious people ( well , by all of them ) .
I am a religious person ( Muslim ) and I think that causation is more complex than that .
The great Muslim thinker al - Ghazali came up with a theory of proximate and ultimate cause ( the ultimate one being God ) , that still leaves room for human agency .
Thus , God and man do not have to be alternative hypotheses .
This fact is appreciated by the more educated Muslims , but if the BBC insists on quoting only whatever " person in the street " they happen to encounter , they may never understand the subtleties of the Islamic faith .
Robert Stallmann , Merced , CA , USA
We , the human race have put this on us , the earth deserves a break from all our toxins , the earth wants to breath so it is taking action by eliminating the problem .
Maria , Southafrica
Yes , we need to pray AND yes , we need to take responsibility for the resources we have on this planet .
In contrast to popular thought , a good Christain / Muslim / Hindu must by definition be wise , conservative and giving .
More concern for others means leaving the land in good condition for the next generation and sharing vital resources .
Children in secondary schools should be taught to incorporate their faith with their action , not bypass it .
It will be a much for effective and positive result .
Elizabeth
This is author is a believer in the religion of man made global warming .
The " wananchi " are believers in a different God .
Will a wind farm in Illinois solve the plight ?
Will my purchase of a hybrid help them ?
Will the theft of Billions or Trillions of dollars via Kyoto or Copenhagen help them ?
The answer is a giant NO !.
Will the answers come from the youth ?
I think very possibly .
If they become engaged in local issues of finding or creating new water sources , lessons in sanitation and the prevention of disease .
These things will have an immediate , positive , long - lasting affect .
Global warming / cooling / climate change is not the cause of their problems .
This area has been drought prone for decades , if not centuries .
They even have names for the various droughts that they have experienced , much as we name hurricanes .
The article infers the " wananachi " should be praying to scientists , not God as THEY have the answers .
Sure .. that will work !
( Note : that was sarcasm . )
It could be that the answer is quite simple .
Whether caused by man or by God , if I were watching my family starve to death , I would MOVE to where we could survive .
Don , Waynesville , Ohio USA
When looked at from Greig 's perspective it is very difficult to deny whether anything that happens is God 's will , even the worst tragedies that occur in nature .
That said , however , it should be clear to practitioners of many religions that not all that happens is in accordance with God 's will , and that God lets certain things happen that are clearly in opposition to His will .
This certainly does not mean , therefore , that natural disasters or climate change is something that people should just blindly accept .
Every person has a responsibility , to a certain extent , for human welfare and the welfare of their environment .
Franklin , Kansas City , Missouri , USA
The beauty of African countries is its ethnic and linguistic groups .
Past one decade the world is moving dramatically and things are changing very fast .
The traditional socializations are constantly at friction with the everyday changing current socialisations .
Many African countries are facing racially motivated destructions , starvation , casualties due to AIDS and other diseases .
Keeping faith in own culture and tradition gives you enormous strength .
There is nothing wrong in accepting things with ' Will of God ' perspective .
But there are some current norms in the fast changing pluralistic society which definitely one has to follow irrespective of his own norms of particular religion and faith .
Elders always do their level best to motivate the new generation .
It 's not fair to blame them .
Prayers and religion always help a person .
The need is to understand the correct ' Will of God ' .
The need is to restrict false ideas and reasoning that do lead to frustration and violence .
High priorities must be given to environmental issues and must be kept at the forefront of the global meetings .
Sanjay Singh Thakur , Indore , India
All these comments sound too much like just wringing your hands instead of DOING something positive to help !
It is obvious that the basic problem is WATER - pure water in good supply .
Drill wells , or install purification plants , or import bottled water , or do all of that to get an adequate supply of pure water .
START NOW !!!
William E. Foster , Rochester , NY , USA 14610-3019
Whether it 's God 's will or science , a hotter , drier central Africa will clearly further threaten the marginal existence of millions .
It is the responsibility ( should be instinct ) of educated people to help to mitigate against this likelihood .
Raise awareness .
Do research .
Provide funds to set up micro economic units , perhaps co operatives .
You 're right .
The best hope is amongst the young and educated .
These ' agents ' will need to have positive tools for change .
Rural tribal Africa can not just wait for God 's decision .
Training , ingenuity , pragmatism and some funding will help ease the pain .
Water management is the solution .
Tony Esslinger , Seguret France Education , I believe is key not just in Africa but everywhere .
The answer to problems begins with critical reasoning and logic .
To allow the belief of the will of a God to dictate outcomes is proof that numerous religious followers have little or no understanding of the concept of personal responsibility ( this is truth not meant as negative criticism ) .
I must also state that if those who have the ability to reach the minds of the young before they 're indoctrinated into the mindset of superstition and myth .
They must not hesitate to develop a plan to educate in the direction of critical thought ; not just in developing countries but the world as a whole .
Stephen Moffe , Elmira , NY Kenya has experienced a four fold increase in population over the past 50 years , now at 38 million .
The country is projected to have a population of over 65 million in 40 years time .
It is this huge demographic change that is impacting most on Kenya .
To insist that global warming is the main problem that Kenya faces is a dangerous exercise in nonsense .
Malcolm McCandless , Dundee , Scotland
What an excellent article !
Too much attention has been given to US views on climate change and not enough to understanding those of the poorer parts of the world .
This piece goes some way to address the balance .
The message is the same : whether religious neither god nor science is going to bail out humanity on this one .
It takes action by all of us .
Geof Rayner , Rabastens , France
It is possible 4 man to tackle climate changes , i'm a science student , and according to my course in metrology , there are many ways to tackle climate changes .
beside : i pray dat God will interfere and intervene in the other hand .
Gzntility , lagos Nigeria Young People in Africa hold the Key to tackling climate change because they feel its effects now and if they want to live better tomorrow , its time to change .
They have found the damage their parents brought on along with greedy people in top ranks , and now they have to guard their own lives through environmental protection .
Religious beliefs stem from people reading their holy books .
If people can read the Bible in Genesis where man was charged to take care of the environment , then they will know that wanton destruction is not taking care of it .
It 's everyones responsibility to take care of the environment and not sit down and watch as others destroy it .
The older generation in Kenya watched as different areas from the Coast to the North was destroyed , and the youth do n't have to .
Tess , Nairobi I AGREE WITH GREIG .
THE YOUTHS CAN DEVELOP THE HABITS NOW AND WHEN THE ADULTS FACE OUT OF ACTIVE POSITIONS THE CLIMATE SITUATION MAY REVERSE .
THE DIVINE INTERVENTION IS ALSO EMENET .
THE STRIKING LOW TEMP IN EUROPE IS A RELIEF .
GOV'TS NEED TO DO MUCH IN THE AREA OF RECYLING MATERIAL IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY .

It 's time to change the world , one helpless god at a time .
Julie ,
All these events are telling us one thing , that there is no more time .
Immanuel Awoleye , Lagos Nigeria
The trouble is we do not really know much about GOD .
Atheists claim there is n't one and over the millennia our concept of GOD has changed as different religions have gained ascendancy and introduced their GOD .
The trouble is that GOD has been made in man 's image and man is getting increasingly arrogant .
Maybe GOD has now decided that it is time to do something about this upstart species which is ruining creation , sending drought to Africa and ice and snow to Europe and North America .
One thing is for certain after this severe winter it will be difficult to convince people there is global warming .
Jim , Chichester I think this analysis has been drowned out by the events of the past week .
The pastoralists ' prayers are now no longer about drought but what to do with the unprecedented deluge that has engulfed the entire country taking human as well as livestock lives and destroying homesteads , schools and crops .
Richard Kerama , Nairobi , Kenya Humanism , which most people do not understand , is the answer and can be explained with a simple example .
Despite how many prayers , when a person loses a limb no god will grow another for the victim regardless how many prayers are said .
A human can make a prosthetic , however , and provide pain relief .
John Aalborg , Ponce de Leon FL 32455 USA
God has something to say about the mentality of climate change " science " - " Thinking themselves to be wise , they became fools . "
I stand with the woman in Kenya quoted as saying , " How can man change the climate ...? "
That is indeed God 's business !
Billy Hires , Tampa , FL USA
We can not blame any body for the climate change .
Everybody has benefited from industrial revolution .
But Now we can blame industrialised nations not to take responsible role to reduce the dangerous of this disaster .
A collective efforts of all nation only can do some thing instead of a blame game which we have been watching .
Then the preyar to God , it should be sincier , many of us prey out of fear or greediness not by soul .
The preyar ceremonies are quiet commercial more than spirituel or grouupes show their power .
The God will be with those who are really believe in sincier prayer and faithful life .
All other prayers will give negetive impacts as we see all over the world now .
Every beliefs are now getting setbacke due to lack of real belief in their God 's grace and truth
Shameer , Lagos I think industrialised nations should be responsible for the climate change .
desmond , mayanghunanchina Climate change is a worldwide phenomenon .
Industrialisation in the developed countries is the major cause of climate change .
Underdevelopment , illiteracy , ignorance and poor management of the environment are the major causes of climate change in Africa .
Poor land use and management , poor agricultural practises including normadic pastures , destruction of forest and woodlands , uncontrolled expansion of urban and rural settlements expose large areas of land surface leading to erosion and silting of streams and river .
Thus we are destroying are forests and vegetation cover , and all streams and rivers are vanishing due to silting and pollution .
The destruction of forests has direct effect on rainfall and temperatures .
Reversing these trends should be the primary aim of African leaders and scientists rather carbon emissions .
Kwaku Opon Tutu , Accra , Ghana
Young people always hold the key as they are the ambassadors of tomorrow but if you look at the situation from a philosophical perspective , the wording is out of alignment with what they seek .
You are saying " Tackling Climate Change
" It may just be the usage of the words as to what is expected .
Do you want to anchor change of the climate or do you want something to be as it naturally is , or was ?
Taking ownership for anything is important and here I would say accountablity is a start , and maybe the nations that consume the most are really who should be accountable and responsible for the returning of stasis .
Thank you
vicki curio tretiak , toronto ontario I have just short comment I would like to share with others and this is about the inappropriate growth of human population in all developing countries ( not only particularly in Africa ) .
I think it is not realistic to find some genius solution for global warming and I am no expert at all , but I am quite concerned ( well - everybody must be ! ) about all the situation with our planet .
My point is - we have to try to bring education to all poor nations over the world , to help them understand the problem , starting their active involvement in the global process and make them understand that their natural right to have as much childern as they like is not ideal .
" When I have not enough food and water for me , is it not quite selfish to bring a new human being to this world ? "
It is obvious , that there is gonna be only suffering in its life ...
While the families in let´s say " developed countries " have 1 - 3 childern in average , what is the average number in poor areas with lack of water and food ?
8 -10 ?
I understand the religion , ethics and human rights , but for me this is one of the most crutial things , which should not be forgotten - to bring the education to those people and make them understand the consequences of their conduct .
Andrea , Prag
Ever since people have lived to see the birth of their grandchildren , the human race has been doomed .
There are too many people and it is now impossible to reduce the growth .
There will be wars over food and drink within the next 50 years , and unless a miraculous replacement for fossil fuels is discovered / invented and adopted faster than any other technology has been , the population growth will outweigh any ' carbon reduction ' efforts put in place .
No -one would expect a 50 % reduction in CO2 over the next 60 years , but the population of the World will roughly double in that time , so that is what is required .
And that would only maintain the current levels of pollution !
Also , a miserable by - product of this process will be the loss one of the fundamental traits of humanity ; empathy .
When there is n't enough food and water for the World , people will stop wanting to help others survive that are in situations where aid is required .
Happy new year .
Simon Morris , London , UK
Whether global warming is largely anthropogenic , is essentially irrelevant to the necessary course of action .
If non -human causes contribute very significantly to climate change , that merely means that we must work that much harder to moderate our greenhouse gas emissions .
( CO2 , CH4 , NOx , ...)
If you are in a lifeboat with rising water in the bilges , do you reject a request to stop peeing in the boat , just because " There are also some waves lapping over the sides " ?

Erik Christiansen , Melbourne , Australia
I agree with that idea youths are much more informed on the methods needed to carry on this movement , furthermore .
they are taught on the various ways to stabilise global warming .
also many have a profound knowledge of geology .. with funds from mr.greig i think they are able ..i'm an A4 student , 17years .

The woman 's belief in God appears to be regarded as mere superstition here .
Yet God , right at the beginning of the Bible , " puts man in charge " of his creation .
I believe this includes responsible management of the environment .
Therefore I believe that the Christian perspective on climate change is irrespective of the theories , we should not squander God 's creation by putting out unsustainable CO2 and using up earth 's finite resources at such a high rate , and instead behave in a responsible manner as " stewards " of God 's creation .
Robert Harris , Derby I do not know if young people will be the key to tackling climate change by themselves , I think that all people must colaborate in saving the world with their little or big contribution from the scope they handle .
This is the world we have , there is no alternative in the short term to colonize other planet , and we have to take care or die .
By the way I think that religions have been a necessary evil for human beings , taking care of the moral and ethical aspects of societies , and giving hope for the most vulnerable people , but very frecuently have represented an obstacle to technological development of societies and an obstacle to people for taking the responsability of their future in their own hands .
Of course I believe that the responsability of industrialised countries is bigger than the others , but each one ( industrialised or not ) have to take the necessary and responsible actions to prevent the damages or to avoid continuing the damage they have caused .
Raúl , Matamoros Key , Caracas , Venezuela Because of ignorance the African women think its a natural phenomenon .
Ignorance is bliss for them as they cant tolerate the fact that it is a man made circumstances .
It is the matter of great concern but whole world is looking on each other without taking any firm initiatives .
This climate change is not affecting us directly so we are silent , but the day will come when we will be adversely affected .
And , till then it will be too late to take any initiatives .
Its better to stitch at time otherwise the torn piece will unable to protect us from anything .

The article is full of holes - yes we are responsible for part of global warming but partof it may be a natural process .
Yes we in the west consume much more per capita than people in the devloping world but is China and India etc to be simply taken out of the equation only because they grew poluting masters now instead of having a history of big polution ?
And then the question of what happens to your forests - I did not cut a single tree in your country .
It is difficult of course to control business and politicians but it is possible to let them pay for their mistakes .
Are people in Kenya ready to do anything with destruction of own forests ?
Yes we in the west have obligation to help but if it is only us that have to do something then I am afraid the whole thing is a hard sell .
besides - the warming albeit drasticly fast still has very long paces - even if we achieve the most what is possible now the effects will be gradual and show up only in time .
Maybe we should better prepare for the apparently unavoidable instead of lamenting and demanding more money from the west .
Beware these are not the reach in the west that actually pay for it - common folk is footing the bill not the big business .

The future lies in the imagination and flexibility of youth but perhaps more important it also relies on a willingness of older generations to be flexible enough to adopt new ways that enable the youth of today to prosper and make the changes that need to happen so they become reality .
Wall street , the corporate world , needs to yield to the needs of future generations and richer nations need to understand as the author pointed out that the climate stresses felt today by those most vulnerable will very rapidly become first hand knowledge for all from which there is no hiding .
The corporate world of Wall Street currently will have no protection , no buffer , when stress becomes so great that societies start to break down .
I suggest the world , the world of mankind get its act together and act in unified manner to confront global warming and make a valiant effort to reverse the pitiful outcome likely to result from the climate summit in Copenhagen if nothing is done .
The corporate world of military spending , consumerism and money should not be allowed to dash the hopes of future generations .
I do n't think God would disapprove of a World that takes action .
Dale Lanan , Longmont , Colorado , USA Survivor of these generation and the ones to come depends on what we do now to save it .

Only the people of kenya can understand how they feel hence they hold their believes or not , things are out of their hands , its more of a question when concrete steps would be taken for a healthier earth ( or we go forward on the dinosaur route ) .
Root of the problem is human manipulation of earth which has gone a lot over the board and now we need a system which uses the human brain for a positive cause and herein I agree , youth do hold a promise for a different future ; if we made this mess , we would definitely have within us the ways that would clear up this mess as well .

The real problem is not religious trusting in God , but scientists believe they can manage everything at their will .
gio lodovico baglioni , Italy - lake Iseo revelations 11:18 bible :-
But the nations became wrathful , and your own wrath came , and the appointed time for the dead to be judged , and to give [ their ] reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name , the small and the great , and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth . "
niko , bergen / norway Education will help tackle the problem .
Young people in Africa do n't have more knowledge than the old ones .
Some generations have remained stagnant in development , so I beleive whether young or old Africans , we should take the ' education first ' approach .
Mark , Assen / The Netherlands
This excellent article embodies why the people of more ' developed ' nations , capable of acting on a relatively good understanding of the facts , progress , mechanisms and effects of climate change , have an obligation to press governments to develop programmes that alter our attitudes to National government and act from supra national perspectives in the perception and response to the global facts of climate change .
In earlier stages of development , Northern / Western countries have attributed epoch changing phenomena and events to the will and hand of a higher , external force , god , or whatever .
It 's in our history and mostly we see things differently and are able to attribute causes and responses on a basis of social , cultural and scientific development that gives us more complex insight , technologies and potential for action .
It 's a global problem and the societies of More developed countries are relatively well insulated from some of it's emerging immediate effects , materially , socially , and so on .
That insulation is temporary and our knowledge and realisation of the magnitude of climate change is not easy for us to ' process ' .
We can though , also know that the universal value of a human life is the basis of human rights legislation .
From a world centred perspective , we somehow have to hurry to action on this basis .
Clearly , governments and cross governmental and NG organisations have to change priorities and focus on enabling developments that prioritise help to enable development of infrastructure ( and this includes people ) to enable LDCs ( Less developed countries ) to best respond to their immediate problems and be full members of a cooperative global squaring up to the facts of climate change .
Efforts in this direction were scuppered at Copenhagen this time round .
We have to take steps to create processes above mere competition , to describe and tackle climate change .
The old Industrialized nations were ignorant of the consequences of the processes they set in motion .
Now we know that the industrializing processes rampant now , in China and India for example , are worsening the problems the world faces - and it stares us in the face that ill - regulated international industrial competition is not a viable or sustainable way for the world to continue .
Not simple .
What is simple is that investing in the people , in the future and therefore in education to facilitate non industrialized nations in responding to their physical and social issues is paramount .
Religious responses are part of a world view , a making sense of the world that we have to acknowledge and respect as different , that does not change overnight , but clearly , if my house is on fire , I 'm not going to pray for rain if there 's water at hand .

We certainly need some global warming here in alberta .
It is always cold and we have no summer to speak of !
We use coal for energy , our vehicles run 24 hours daily , our furnaces never shut off .
Canada is the greatest contributor to greenhouse gases and yet we are in a frozen tundra that is becoming colder yet .
Where is the global warming ?
joseph , calgary alberta canada
For some Religious people to understand , accept and do something about climate change and its effect on us we will have to blend the science and religion .
Rita , Tamale , Ghana Mr Whitehead is right ; young people ARE the key to tackling climate change ( they do n't hold the key , they themselves are the key ) .
But only education will help .
Religion is and always has been totally useless in dealing with realities of nature - that is not its purpose .
If someone says ' It 's God 's will ' , then that person is working on a Darwin Award .
Science - which always doubts even itself , in total contrast to religion - is the answer , and the only answer .
It is time for religious people to accept that religion has other purposes , and does NOT provide an answer to everything .

The variation in the climate in Kenya is nothing to do with human activities worldwide .
The rains come , the rains go .
It 's natural variation .
Thomas Goodey , Cuxton - upon - Medway , UK I believe that young people in Africa hold a key role in changing the future .
If they could be educated and learn to understand how they can directly influence their own lives and the world around them it could change so much .
But I also believe that it is the responsibility of industrialized nations to step in and help .
We in America have been blessed to be a blessing .
If we could use our knowledge and resources for good instead of greed it could change the world .
Krystle Leininger , Lancaster , USA Drought very common in Kenya .
In the tropical regions , there is plenty of moisture , the big issue is the direction of the wind .
They were having floods last October .
I think it is extremely narrow minded for a acclaimed journalist to blame a short term drought on climate change .
Seems he is trying to make an inference that developed countries are responsible for the drought in Kenya .
To do so would be an insult to the intellect of his audience .
David Lear , Everett , Wa USA Education will help tackle the problem .
Young people in Africa do n't have more knowledge than the old generations .
Some generations have remained stagnant in development , so I beleive whether young or old , we should take the ' education first ' approach .
Young people all over the world are standing up and calling for proper attention to climate changes .
The impact of climate change will in many cases be strongest in developing countries , and thus climate change poses a threat to development , as it risks hampering access to water , food , sanitation and security , among other things .
Unless young people are equipped with tools such as education and health , including reproductive health , their empowerment , involvement and contributions will not be possible , or at least a lot less successful .
Arlin Rajan , India
It is easy to use religion to help shine a light onto the unknown , and ' climate change ' is very much an unknown .
There are masses of conflicting data covering topics such as how much change will occur , what the change will be , where it will happen and what the causes are .
With all that uncertainty , it makes sense to turn to God .
However , in Kenya , I would suggest that people look at the cause for the rivers drying .
It is n't necessarily carbon emissions .
Other factors such as deforestation , over irrigation , over population and industry can all play a part .
If these are the reasons , then the solution lies in education and reform .
Jeff Barnsley , Auckland , NZ I find it interesting in that an article which touches on Kenya 's population explosion and its failure to manage land use accordingly is still willing to place the blame squarely at the feet of global warming .
Here 's a thought .
If global warming were to vanish off the radar tomorrow , would Kenya 's problems disappear with it ?
I do n't think they would , because many of the issues in that country lie with a burgeoning populace making increasing and unsustainable demands on badly managed resources , not on the amount of carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere .
Kenya 's carbon dioxide output is less than 0.1 % of the world 's total output at around 12 million tonnes per annum .
Compare this to , say , the American military in Iraq 's annual output of around 141 million tonnes , or China 's 28,431 million tonnes per annum and you can see just how miniscule Kenya 's contribution is .
To impose more restrictions and limitations in the name of climate change on these people , while doing little to tackle the fundamental problems affecting them is not just misguided , but downright wrong .
How do you tell a developing nation it needs to cut back because of climate change when the West is starting wars whose carbon output dwarfs that of Kenya , yet is specifically excluded from carbon offsetting agreements in both Kyoto and Copenhagen ?
Mark McCorkell , London , UK Kenyans are not the ones who have caused climate change , and it is understandable from a cultural perspective why they would attach a spiritual rather than scientific significance to the drought .
The fertile green rift valley of my childhood is now a brown wasteland where nothing will grow .
To Kenyans , understanding the root cause of the drought is not really the focus right now .
Survival has become an all consuming task .
James Bennett , Kijabe Kenya
If a man or woman has religion and yet makes the decision to remain a poor steward of the magnificence that has been placed in our care ( according to one 's belief ) , then that religion is worthless .
Global Warming , industrialized pollution , even the pollution of immediate orbits around our planet , are such examples of spitting in the face of what God has provided for you .
Roger , Shushi , NKR
Most major religions share a similar moral base .
Even if what happens is " God 's will , " is it really better to sit by and watch , or to try to do some good for the world ?
Whatever happens , at least you 'll know you tried .
Humanism and religion can exist in harmony .
Jesus saw people suffering and he did n't just stand there and watch - - he helped .
Whatever you believe , helping the environment is doing the right thing .
Grace , Meadow Vista , CA United States
Bring your carbon footprint down to the level of the average Kenyan , and then maybe you will have some advice to give them about climate change .
What difference does it make what Kenyan 's believe about the reason for climate change ?
They are in the same situation either way .
If you think climate change is human caused and live in a developed country , it is your responsibility to do something about it , and not give advice or try to convince other people about what you think is the reason for climate change .
I think this article is out of line to bring up religious belief on climate change , but it brings up a good question on how religious beliefs affect what Kenyan 's do about the poverty & food shortages they face .
At least according to the Christian worldview , God 's control over nature does not remove our responsibility to care for nature , and it does n't change the reality that there are consequences for our actions .
Christians need to both pray and act responsibly .
Matthew , Surrey , Canada
You know , this is my issue .
I am Bible college student , a lover of Christ and am an activist for a green earth .
I believe that while on the earth for however long we have been , that we 've caused and are continuing to cause damage to our environment .
We need to take responsibility for what is going on in our world and not throw out the " it 's God 's will " every time a big issue hits .
Because Biblically speaking it 's not God 's will .
As believers we are told to be good stewards , how does this not apply to our earth ?
It 's unfortunate that BBC interviewed the rather " stereotypical Christian " and did n't get a chance to speak to MANY Christian organizations that believe in protecting our earth .
Chloe , Vancouver , Canada Only 3 of 59 commentators so far have touched on the real problem - that of overpopulation .
It really does n't matter what happens to the climate , continuing to have large families without high infant mortality , will guarantee a subsistence lifestyle for all .
We need to stabilise and reduce our population far more than our carbon emissions .

This is n't a confirmation of AGW .
It is an article on drought and lack of infrastructure .
The presumption ( assumption ) is that it is caused by what some propose is AGW .
What they do n't say is that these countries are not being allowed to build infrastructure ( the same as we have ) so they wo n't add to what some claim is AGW .
We can have it but they can't .
Children are dying because the developed nations are controlling the purse strings .
They are dying now .

The government of Israel has siphoned over a billion shekels in money taken from Palestinian laborers for national insurance between 1970 - 1994 , a report released on Wednesday
states .
According to the report , compiled by the workers ’ rights organization Kav LaOved , between the years 1970 - 1994 over NIS 1 billion was withheld from Palestinian workers ’ salaries in order to pay their national insurance , but in practice , the report states , the money was instead funneled to the Finance Ministry and used to pay National Labor Union fees , even while the workers were not given membership in the union .
Kav LaOved said that during those years , Palestinian workers would receive an invoice with their paycheck that detailed a sum withdrawn for national insurance .
According to the report ’s findings , only 7.63 percent of the withheld funds went to pay for the workers ’ insurance , with the remainder being funneled to the Finance Ministry .
In the report , entitled “ State Robbery , ” Kav LaOved cites a letter received in 1993 from the Finance Ministry saying that the money withheld went to pay the civilian authorities in the West Bank in order to fund infrastructure programs .
Hannah Zohar , the author of the report and director of Kav LaOved , said she presumes that the infrastructure programs in question had to do with the construction of settlements .
The Finance Ministry has denied the allegations .
The report describes the 1991 legal case in which the Flower Growers Union petitioned the High Court demanding the return of funds that were not used for the national insurance payments as intended .
The court ruled in their favor and forced the government to return approximately NIS 4.7 million to employers and their workers .
Zohar told the Post on Thursday that the court case should have set a legal precedent leading to the return of all the money siphoned away from national insurance payments , but instead has been largely forgotten .
The Finance Ministry issued a statement Thursday denying the allegations , adding that the report is based on “ confusion over the different roles carried out by separate branches of the government . ”
The Histadrut labor federation called the report “ full of lies ” and “ baseless ” and accused Kav LaOved of coming to their conclusions before conducting their research , with the findings having “ no connection to reality . ”
The Government Payments Branch did not respond to the report .
Facing the political peril of double - digit unemployment rates , President Obama today urged a series of tax cuts , infrastructure projects , and small business loans to help employers hire more people .
Some loans would involve unspent federal bailout funds , a step already under fire from Republicans .
GOP members such as party chairman Michael Steele said the biggest threats to job creation are Obama 's big spending programs , including health care .
Here 's some play - by - play on Obama 's jobs speech this morning at The Brookings Institution in Washington , D.C .
11:26 a.m. --
Obama opens with an anecdote about meeting with his economic team during the transition a year ago , as they discussed the financial crisis that had frozen credit markets .
" The fear among economists across the political spectrum was that we were rapidly plummeting towards a second Great Depression , " Obama said .
11:30 a.m. --
Obama discusses the " difficult steps " needed to meet the crisis , including the big stimulus package .
Also takes a poke at Republican opponents : " We were forced to take those steps largely without the help of an opposition party which , unfortunately , after having presided over the decision - making that led to the crisis , decided to hand it over to others to solve . "
11:33 a.m. --
After extolling the stimulus plan , Obama notes " we are in a very different place than we were a year ago " -- fears of another depression are gone and the economy is growing again .
Also stresses that the unemployment rate actually fell last month , from 10.2 percent to 10 percent .
He adds , however , " our work is far from done . "
11:37 a.m. --
Obama gets to the heart of the matter , discussing " broader steps " that can help job growth , starting with help for small businesses .
The president pitches an elimination of capital gains taxes on investments by small businesses , as well as more generous write - offs .
Then the biggest headline : Juicing small business loans through bailout money available in the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
11:39 p.m. --
The second step involves more road , bridge , and other infrastructure projects , including a speed - up of those already approved under the stimulus package .
The third step is more jobs for clean energy -- including rebates for property owners " who retrofit their homes to become more energy efficient , which we know creates jobs , saves money for families , and reduces the pollution that threatens our environment . "
11:42 p.m. --
Obama returns to the TARP program , which he wants to wind down in favor of more support for job creation and deficit reduction .
This time he pokes banks who received assistance : " There has rarely been a less loved or more necessary emergency program than TARP , which -- as galling as the assistance to banks may have been -- indisputably helped prevent a collapse of the entire financial system . "
And , again , Republicans and the Bush administration : " Launched hastily under the last administration , the TARP program was flawed , and we have worked hard to correct those flaws and manage it properly . "
11:45 a.m. --
Obama ties the search for more jobs to his domestic agenda -- says all employers will be helped by an improved health care system , a better educated work force , new sources of clean energy , and fairly regulated markets .
11:48 a.m. --
The budget deficit issue : Obama says he 's working to cut it , even amid needed investments for economic recovery : " Even as we have had to spend our way out of this recession in the near term , we have begun to make the hard choices necessary to get our country on a more stable fiscal footing in the long run . "
Another dig at the GOP : " These budget busting tax cuts and spending programs were approved by many of the same people who are now waxing political about fiscal responsibility while opposing our efforts to reduce deficits by getting health care costs under control .
It 's a sight to see . "
11:50 a.m. --
The problems of jobs and deficits are rooted in failures of the political system , Obama says : " We have seen the consequences of this failure of responsibility .
The American people have paid a heavy price . "
11:52 a.m. --
Obama wraps up by urging lawmakers to remember people looking for work : " These folks are n't looking for a hand out .
They 're not looking for a bail out .
They 're hoping for a chance to make their own way , to work , to succeed using their talents and skills . "
He does close on a note of optimism : " These have been a tough two years .
And there will no doubt be difficult months ahead .
But the storms of the past are receding .
The skies are brightening .
And the horizon is beckoning once more . "

We are still in the midst of the libel suit brought by the British Chiropractic Association against Simon Singh , and now another defender of science has been targeted by such a suit .
Paul Offit , Amy Wallace , and Wired Magazine have been sued for libel by Barbara Loe Fisher , the head of the National Vaccine Information Center ( NVIC ) .
Here is a pdf of the complaint .
The subject of the suit is the excellent article by Amy Wallace criticizing the anti-vaccine movement .
Wallace was attacked for this piece by anti-vaccinationists – essentially because she got the story correct .
Wallace pointed out that the science strongly favors vaccine effectiveness and safety , and that the anti-vaccine movement is dangerously wrong – hurting the public health with their misinformation .
The anti-vaccinationists were apparently very upset over be called out by a mainstream journalist .
They got a lot of bad press this year , the Chicago Tribune also did a series of articles detailing the dangerous pseudoscience of the anti-vaccine movement .
Wallace ’s article earned her a place in the infamous baby - eating photo ( along side Offit and yours truly ) that only served to further embarrass the anti-vaccine movement via the blog , Age of Autism .
The law suit , in this context , seems like just the next step in the campaign against Offit and Wallace .
The NVIC , despite its innocuous name , is an ideological anti-vaccination group , and they were targeted among others in the Wallace piece .
Fisher found a sentence in the article that she felt she could build a libel case around .
Fisher , who has long been the media ’s go - to interview for what some in the autism arena call “ parents rights , ” makes him particularly nuts , as in “ You just want to scream . ”
The reason ?
“ She lies , ” he says flatly .
“ She lies ” will now be the subject of as much analysis as the term “ bogus ” was in Singh ’s article about the BCA , so I might as well start .
Critics often walk a fine line – we want to accurately portray the actions and claims of the targets of our criticism , without holding any punches , but we have to be clear in our terminology and careful not to inadvertently give the wrong impression .
The term “ lie ” is problematic .
It is not necessarily inaccurate , but it can carry implications not intended by the writer , because it may imply something about what another person knows or believes .
Often we speculate , when someone makes a claim that is demonstrably false , are they deliberately lying or are they grossly mistaken .
But this is a false dichotomy .
There is a vast gray zone in between .
Making a claim without due diligence is a form of deception .
Often people will make claims as if they are verified and documented truths , without acknowledging that the claim is controversial , or without really verifying the facts .
People may care more about the utility of a claim and its relationship to their ideology than whether or not it is objectively true .
Are making such claims lying ?
It is more than being wrong , but not quite a knowing lie .
However , when one is engaged in a public debate and advocacy about an important health issue , one has a responsibility to get basic information correct and to relay it in as unbiased a manner as possible .
Being recklessly wrong in such a case may be the moral equivalent of lying .
On the NVIC website there are numerous examples of misinformation .
For example , about squalene ( a vaccine adjuvant ) they write :
However , the use of squalene type vaccine adjuvants , which were allegedly added to experimental anthrax vaccines and made Gulf War soldiers sick , is controversial .
OK – they write “ allegedly ” so I guess they are covered .
But this is still deceptive , and meant to scare people off vaccines .
It turns out that there was no squalene in the anthrax vaccines given to Gulf War soldiers .
And soldiers who developed unexplained symptoms in the Gulf War were not more likely to have antibodies to squalene .
The anthrax vaccine - squalene - Gulf
War syndrome connection has been completely demolished at every point .
It is no longer “ controversial ” among scientists .
So is the NVIC statement above a “ lie ” or is it just sloppy misinformation – and is there a functional difference between the two ?
The use of libel suits to intimidate critics and have a chilling effect on open discussion is an old strategy .
As I said , the BCA attempted to do that by suing Simon Singh , taking advantage of the horrible English Libel laws .
Uri Geller sued James Randi in the past for saying he cannot really bend spoons .
Matthias Rath sued Ben Goldacre for criticizing his health claims .
Skeptics have , to a degree , engaged in public criticism of pseudoscience with the constant threat of being sued .
Even when such suits are legally unsuccessful , they can be financially ruinous and therefore an effective bullying tool .
The ability to sue for libel is an important right to redress legitimate wrongs .
But this right can easily be abused to silence open discussion .
For this reason many states have SLAPP laws ( strategic lawsuit against public participation ) .
Recently the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the need for open public discussion of important issues is a legitimate defense against a libel suit .
This is also the point behind the Keep Libel Laws out of Science movement , which is partly a backlash against the BCA suit against Singh .
Now the anti-vaccine movement in getting in the game , using the threat of libel to place a chill on legitimate criticism of their dangerous misinformation .
It is time for the scientific and skeptical communities to rally behind Paul Offit as we did Simon Singh .
I suspect this lawsuit will backfire against Fisher as much as the Singh suit did against the BCA .
Let ’s take a close look at the claims
Fisher makes and whether they constitute “ lying ” .
I suspect she will not hold up well under close scrutiny , just as the BCA claims did not .
Skeptical analysis is all about shining the light of science into those dark places of dubious claims and ideology that fear the light .
Libel suits are often used as a tool to shield against the light of open examination , but we should fight back by using them as opportunities to shine even more light .
Fisher better put on her sunglasses .

Poor child nutrition still causes major problems in the developing world - despite some progress , experts say .
A third of deaths in children under five in those countries are linked to poor diet , a report by Unicef suggests .
It also reveals 195 m children - one in three - have stunted growth , even though rates have fallen since 1990 .
Unicef said the number of underweight children also remained high , with many countries struggling to hit official targets to halve the figures .
An estimated 129 m children are underweight .
Rates of stunted growth are higher because while some children may be a normal weight - in fact some can even be overweight - the food they are getting is of such poor quality they they have growth problems .
Experts warn that such a condition is often irreversible and effectively condemns children to a lifetime of poor health .
Dangerous Unicef chief Ann Veneman said : " Undernutrition steals a child 's strength and makes illnesses that the body might otherwise fight off far more dangerous .
" Unless attention is paid to addressing the causes of child and maternal undernutrition today , the costs will be considerably higher tomorrow . "
HOW TO TACKLE THE PROBLEM
Poor nutrition has traditionally been a problem for Peru In 1999 , the government , in partnership with Unicef and the US International Development Agency , set up the Good Start in Life programme
The project used health staff to provide ante-natal support to mothers , promote breastfeeding and offer food supplements in five mainly rural regions
By 2004 , more than 75,000 children under three were benefiting and rates of stunted growth fell from 54 % to 37 % A national programme is now being rolled out The organisation has pinpointed the first 1,000 days of life as the key period in which to tackle the problem .
It said promoting breastfeeding as the exclusive source of nutrition for the first six months and continued breastfeeding until at least two was essential .
But Unicef said providing access to food supplements was also an important part of the solution .
Many aid programmes are focusing on iodised salt to aid brain development and vitamin A supplements , which help bone growth and the body 's ability to fight infection .
Such steps , the report suggested , could reduce deaths by a fifth .
Monitoring schemes Unicef said that together with its partners , which include governments and international aid agencies , it was making progress to improve nutrition for children in the 150 countries it was working in .
Indeed , since 1990 the proportion of children underweight in the developing world has fallen by a sixth , according to figures compiled from Unicef 's own monitoring schemes and data provided by other bodies such as the World Health Organization and World Bank .
Millions of children in India are malnourished And stunted growth rates have dropped by a quarter over the same period .
Nonetheless , just 63 out of 117 countries look like they will meet the Millennium Development Goal of halving the rates of underweight children between 1990 and 2015 .
Progress has been particularly poor in Africa .
Asia is performing a little better , although India is making little progress , while South America is making some significant strides .
Kitty Arie , a senior policy adviser at the Save the Children charity , also pointed out poor nutrition had long - term consequences , including lower school performance .
" This is an urgent issue that can and must be tackled . "
And UK international development minister Mike Foster agreed more could be done .
" We have to work more effectively with our development partners and national governments to make nutrition a priority . "

Transforming lead into gold is an impossible feat , but a similar type of " alchemy " is not only possible , but cost - effective too .
Three Penn State researchers have shown that certain combinations of elemental atoms have electronic signatures that mimic the electronic signatures of other elements .
According to the team 's leader A. Welford Castleman Jr. , Eberly Distinguished Chair in Science and Evan Pugh Professor in the Departments of Chemistry and Physics , " the findings could lead to much cheaper materials for widespread applications such as new sources of energy , methods of pollution abatement , and catalysts on which industrial nations depend heavily for chemical processing . "
The researchers also showed that the atoms that have been identified so far in these mimicry events can be predicted simply by looking at the periodic table .
The team used advanced experimentation and theory to quantify these new and unexpected findings .
" We 're getting a whole new perspective of the periodic table , " said Castleman .
The team 's findings will be published in the 28 December 2009 early on - line issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , and at a later date in the print edition of the journal .
Castleman and his team -- which includes Samuel Peppernick , a former Penn State graduate student who now is a postdoctoral researcher at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , and Dasitha Gunaratne , a Penn State graduate student -- used a technique , called photoelectron imaging spectroscopy , to examine similarities between titanium monoxide and nickel , zirconium monoxide and palladium , and tungsten carbide and platinum .
" Photoelectron spectroscopy measures the energy it takes to remove electrons from various electronic states of atoms or molecules , while simultaneously capturing snapshots of these electron - detachment events with a digital camera , " said Castleman .
" The method allows us to determine the binding energies of the electrons and also to observe directly the nature of the orbitals in which the electrons resided before they were detached .
We found that the amount of energy required to remove electrons from a titanium - monoxide molecule is the same as the amount of energy required to remove electrons from a nickel atom .
The same is true for the systems zirconium monoxide and palladium and tungsten carbide and platinum .
The key is that all of the pairs are composed of isoelectronic species , which are atoms with the same electron configuration . "
Castleman noted that , in this case , the term isoelectronic refers to the number of electrons present in the outer shell of an atom or molecule .
The team looked at images of the photoelectron spectroscopy data .
Bright spots in the images , which correspond to the energy of the electrons emitted during their removal from the atoms ' outer shells , appeared to be similar between the pairs of species in the three systems studied .
Likewise , graphical displays of energy peaks were similar between the pairs , and theoretical calculations also resulted in the pairs having matching energy levels .
Castleman explained that the molecules titanium monoxide , zirconium monoxide , and tungsten carbide are superatoms of nickel , palladium , and platinum , respectively .
Superatoms are clusters of atoms that exhibit some property of elemental atoms .
Former work in Castleman 's lab has involved investigating the notion of superatoms .
One of his previous experiments showed that a cluster of 13 aluminum atoms behaves like a single iodine atom .
Adding a single electron to this aluminum - atom system results in the cluster behaving like a rare - gas atom .
Further , he showed that a cluster of 14 aluminum atoms has a reactivity similar to an alkaline earth atom .
Now , Castleman 's new research takes the superatom idea to a new level and provides a sound quantitative foundation for the concept of superatoms .
" It looks like we can predict which combinations of elemental atoms mimic other elemental atoms , " he said .
" For example , by looking at the periodic table , you can predict that titanium monoxide will be a superatom of nickel .
Simply start at titanium , which has four outer - shell electrons , and move six elements to the right , because atomic oxygen possesses six outer - shell electrons .
The element you end up on is nickel , whose 10 outer - shell electrons make it isoelectronic with the 10 outer - shell electron molecule resulting from the combination of titanium and oxygen .
We thought this finding must be a curious coincidence , so we tried it with other atoms and we found that a pattern emerged . "
Castleman said that he does n't know if the pattern will occur across the entire periodic table or if it will be confined to only a part of it .
Right now , he and his team are working through the transition - metal atoms .
In the future , they plan to take the research a step further to investigate whether or not the superatoms are chemically similar to their respective single atoms .
" Platinum is used in nearly all catalytic converters in automobiles , but it is very expensive , " said Castleman .
" In contrast , tungsten carbide , which mimics platinum , is cheap .
A significant amount of money can be saved if catalytic - converter manufacturers are able to use tungsten carbide instead of platinum .
Likewise , palladium is used in certain combustion processes , yet it is mimicked by zirconium monoxide , which is less expensive by a factor of 500 .
Our new findings are exciting from both a scientific as well as a practical point of view . "
This research was funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research .
By now , I hope you know America was founded by a revolution against the British .
In a modern day twist so to speak , we have a English chef who wants to kickstart a revolution in america
Now that 's a revolution I would love to see .
As I wrote here about what school lunches teach our children , I think it 's very good to have a celebrity spokesperson taking the lead .
While I sometimes have a problem with celebrity chefs , and food as fashion , Jamie Oliver is taking a giant leap here as advocate .
I have the utmost respect for that .
And for this ;
The series is loosely based on Jamie Oliver 's U.K. series , " Jamie 's Ministry of Food " and " Jamie 's School Dinners , " which saw his successful grass - roots efforts improve the school lunches in communities there .
For the latter show , it resulted in a total overhaul of the school dinner program in the U.K .
In America , he 's turning his attention to helping people of all ages eat more balanced meals and cook with fresh ingredients , not only at schools , but also homes , workplaces and even restaurants .
And this ;
I believe that every child in America has the right to fresh , nutritious school meals , and that every family deserves real , honest , wholesome food .
Too many people are being affected by what they eat .
It 's time for a national revolution .
America needs to stand up for better food !
You live in an amazing country full of inspirational people and you have the power to change things .
With your help , we can get better food into homes , schools and communities all over America and give your kids a better future .
I can't add anything more to this wonderful story .
The Magic
Hat here is a Chef 's toque .
All I can do is encourage you to join the revolution here .
I did because I believe our children are worth it .
Hercules , the 900lb liger , crosses Abbey Road and takes the Underground as he goes on a tour of ' Sixties London '
At first glance it seems this 12 - ft long , 900 lb prowling beast is on the loose around the streets of London , taking in a tour of the sights .
But even though Hercules the colossal liger appears to be strolling across Abbey Road and leaving a London Underground station , he 's really in the warm climate of the Freestyle Music Park in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina .
The aptly - named Hercules looks happy and relaxed as he pads around the mock - up English city that celebrates the British music invasion of the States in the 1960's .
Hercules the liger walks across the iconic Abbey Road set in a mock - up of London in a U.S. music park
The shot was used as the cover of The Beatles ' 1969 Abbey Road album
And in a graphic display of his incredible size and strength , Hercules stops for a spot of lunch handed down from the top of an iconic 1967 double decker bus , eating and drinking his way through some of the 25lbs of meat and gallon of water he needs each day .
' Hercules is a prime example of hybrid vigour , which he gets from his lion father and his tigress mother , ' said Dr Bhagavan ' Doc ' Antle , the founder of The Institute of Greatly Endangered and Rare Species ( TIGERS ) in South Carolina , who has brought up eight - year old Hercules since birth .
' The social side of his personality of course is inherited from his father and the pensive , observant nature is inherited from his mother .
' As a mixture of the world 's largest two big cats , Hercules is an impressive specimen and a pretty well balanced and relaxed guy too . '
Hercules poses with Ragani Ferrante from TIGERS outside a ' London Underground ' station
Pounding his way past one of London 's famous black cabs , Hercules ' bright and wide eyes take in the sights and sounds around him .
' This excursion demonstrates the sheer size and power of Hercules as he walks past some of the most recognisable landmarks in the world , ' said Dr Bhagavan .
' Most people are aware in their everyday lives of the size of a double decker bus and they know how large that is .
' Now they can see that Hercules is larger than the black cab and can easily stretch his way to the top of a London bus . '

Standing four - and - a - half - feet high at the shoulder and almost 6ft tall at the tips of his ears , Hercules has a page devoted to him in the Guinness Book of World Records .
' People ask me if Hercules is the " largest " big cat in the world and my response to that is always that he has an entire section in the book of records , ' explained Dr Bhagavan .
' There have been fat cats and unhealthy looking cats , but Hercules is an exceptional specimen and you just have to look at him and this photo - shoot to appreciate his physique .
' One thing I have always thought when I look at Hercules and indeed all big cats is that to look into their eyes is to look into God 's own eyes . '
Being photographed next to a traditional London black cab again highlights the size of Hercules
Able to run in short bursts as fast as a male tiger , Hercules approached his day trip to the Freestyle Music Park the same way he does any new adventure .
' He is excited by any new environment , " said Dr Bhagavan .
' Hercules becomes bright eyed and attentive and me and his handlers from TIGERS take real joy in accompanying him on these new experiences .
' His parents Arthur , a lion , and Ayla , a tigress , were outstanding cats and this is obvious when you take a look at Hercules . '
Working from TIGERS base at Myrtle Beach , Dr Bhagavan is keen to point out that despite people 's perceptions , the population of wild lions is declining .
' Everyone is aware that tigers are critically endangered , but it is the population of lions that is not on the table .
There are only around 20,000 left in the wild and this needs to be addressed . '
Spending the majority of his day sleeping , Hercules and his brothers , Sinbad , Zeus and Vulcan are just some of the cats under Dr Bhagavan 's care .
' I have 25 years of experience with big cats , ' he explained .
' One point I must make is the commonly held misconception that ligers are inbred and unhealthy .
Strip clubs are often thought to be seedy places that offer sex to men who ought to be spending their ...

The Times , November 20 , 2009
Jerome Starkey in Shinwar
“ People hate the Americans from the bottom of their hearts , ” Haji Akhtar Mohammed Shinwari said as he recalled how the US military had brought death to his homeland .
For residents of Shinwar , a village in distant Nangahar province , the message from President Karzai ’s address yesterday that the Americans would hand over security over the next five years was disappointing .
At the village bazaar , Mr Shinwari told The Times that he could not wait that long .
In 2007 , a unit of special forces was speeding along a busy road a few miles from his village when they opened fire , killing 19 people and wounding 50 .
The unit responsible was sent home and the local US commander described the incident as a “ stain on our honour ” .
He paid out almost $ 40,000 ( £ 25,000 ) in compensation .
But trust , in Afghanistan ’s conservative Pashtun belt , is hard won and easily forfeited .
In the 20 months since the attack house raids by Nato troops had continued , Mr Shinwari , 44 , said .
More civilians had been killed , while little had been done to help ordinary people .
“ People do n’t like their operations , ” he said .
“ They search houses without permission , detain people without trial . ”
In the neighbouring village of Rakhzi , Niaz Amin , a 20 - year - old student , lost his older brother and grandfather in American operations last year .
“ We still do n’t know why they did it , ” he said .
“ When they came into the house I tried to speak to them in English but they shouted , ‘ Do n’t speak ’ .
“ The first time they came my brother ran out and he was wounded by an airstrike .
They took him to the hospital but brought back his body .
Eight days later my grandfather was shot when he went out of the mosque . ”
The Shinwar district , close to the border with Pakistan , has a reputation for smuggling .
Its fierce hostility towards the Americans has made most of it a no - go area for foreign aid workers .
Security officials claim that it is an occasional sanctuary for insurgents .
But many of the villagers ’ complaints are more mundane .
“ When [ the Americans ] drive along the roads they do n’t let anyone overtake them , ” Mr Shinwari said .
“ It does n’t matter if you ’re transporting a dead body or a sick woman to hospital .
Even if they get a puncture or break down , if it takes one hour or two days , they do n’t let anybody overtake them . ”
As The Times drove east yesterday from Jalalabad , the capital of Nangahar province , along tree - lined avenues flanked by orange groves , our car swerved on to the hard shoulder a few miles from the main Shinwar bazaar .
A green laser from an American weapon flashed across our chests .
Drivers here have learnt the hard way .
You pull over and stop to let the American convoys pass .
It is a far cry from General Stanley McChrystal ’s strategy of protecting the people .
The villagers ’ complaints underline the difficulty that foreign forces face in trying to win over a wary population .
Most US soldiers look at Shinwar and see a deathtrap , full of roadside bombs and Taliban ambushes .
Fazil Hakim , 36 , a friend of Mr Shinwari , insisted that security in the area was fine .
The only risk , he said , was being caught up in an attack against the Americans .
“ Wherever the troops are there ’s instability .
They bring problems with them , ” he said .
Mr Shinwari added : “ They should just stay in their bases .
More troops wo n’t bring peace .
We need economic development , not soldiers . ”

Gerard Russell , a former British political attaché in Kabul , warned that the big foreign presence was hindering the Afghan Government .
“ There are many disadvantages to having foreign troops on the front line , ” he said .
“ It ’s holding the Afghans back and saving them from the need to solve their problems themselves .
Until the Government realises this is a fight for its own survival it wo n’t make the tough decisions , and they wo n’t realise that as long as we [ the international community ] are in the way . ”
Mr Karzai promised much yesterday : a complete handover of security control within five years , more roads and railways , a crackdown on corruption , plans to negotiate with the Taliban and for at least 40 per cent of foreign aid to be spent through his administration .
He reiterated the need to eliminate civilian casualties at the hands of Nato forces .
Mr Shinwari said that a US aid agency had levelled the road in his village but that the most valuable development project had come from the Afghan Government , which gave his village almost $ 50,000 to improve an irrigation canal .
Dr. Richard Wolfenden , Alumni Distinguished Professor of Biochemistry & Biophysics , and member of the National Academy of Sciences , and co-author Charles Lewis , PhD publish a report in the November issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing that without enzymes speeding the process , it would take 2.3 bilion years to complete vital biological transformation .
All biological reactions within human cells depend on enzymes .
Their power as catalysts enables biological reactions to occur usually in milliseconds .
But how slowly would these reactions proceed spontaneously , in the absence of enzymes – minutes , hours , days ?
And why even pose the question ?
One scientist who studies these issues is Richard Wolfenden , Ph.D. , Alumni Distinguished Professor Biochemistry and Biophysics and Chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
Wolfenden holds posts in both the School of Medicine and in the College of Arts and Sciences and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences .
In 1995 , Wolfenden reported that without a particular enzyme , a biological transformation he deemed “ absolutely essential ” in creating the building blocks of DNA and RNA would take 78 million years .
“ Now we ’ve found a reaction that – again , in the absence of an enzyme – is almost 30 times slower than that , ” Wolfenden said .
“ Its half - life – the time it takes for half the substance to be consumed – is 2.3 billion years , about half the age of the Earth .
Enzymes can make that reaction happen in milliseconds . ”
With co-author Charles A. Lewis , Ph.D. , a postdoctoral scientist in his lab , Wolfenden published a report of their new findings recently in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The study is also due to appear in the Nov. 11 print edition .
The reaction in question is essential for the biosynthesis of hemoglobin and chlorophyll , Wolfenden noted .
But when catalyzed by the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase , the rate of chlorophyll and hemoglobin production in cells “ is increased by a staggering factor , one that ’s equivalent to the difference between the diameter of a bacterial cell and the distance from the Earth to the sun . ”
“ This enzyme is essential for both plant and animal life on the planet , ” Wolfenden said .
“ What we ’re defining here is what evolution had to overcome , that the enzyme is surmounting a tremendous obstacle , a reaction half - life of 2.3 billion years . ”
Knowing how long reactions would take without enzymes allows biologists to appreciate their evolution as prolific catalysts , Wolfenden said .
It also enables scientists to compare enzymes with artificial catalysts produced in the laboratory .
“ Without catalysts , there would be no life at all , from microbes to humans , ” he said .
“ It makes you wonder how natural selection operated in such a way as to produce a protein that got off the ground as a primitive catalyst for such an extraordinarily slow reaction . ”
Experimental methods for observing very slow reactions can also generate important information for rational drug design based on cellular molecular studies .
“ Enzymes that do a prodigious job of catalysis are , hands - down , the most sensitive targets for drug development , ” Wolfenden said .
“ The enzymes we study are fascinating because they exceed all other known enzymes in their power as catalysts . ”
Wolfenden has carried out extensive research on enzyme mechanisms and water affinities of biological compound .
His work has also influenced rational drug design , and findings from his laboratory helped spur development of ACE inhibitor drugs , now widely used to treat hypertension and stroke .
Research on enzymes as proficient catalysts also led to the design of protease inhibitors that are used to treat HIV infection .
“ We ’ve only begun to understand how to speed up reactions with chemical catalysts , and no one has even come within shouting distance of producing , or predicting the magnitude of , their catalytic power , ” Wolfenden said .
Support for this research came from the National Institute of General Medicine , a component of the National Institutes of Health .

Is the US media helping the terrorists ' cause ?
As the USA steps up security measures after the recent mid-air terrorist attempt , Mark Mardell compares the differing reactions to terrorism on both sides of the Atlantic .
Security in US airports has increased dramatically since the bomb attempt Living in America , it is easy to forget that the plot to blow up a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day actually failed .
No one was killed and - apart from the plotter himself and the man who tackled him - no one was hurt .
Yet the country seems to be reeling .
Pundit after pundit frets that the threat is not being taken seriously enough , that the world - changed after 9/11 for ever - has just changed again and that America is insufficiently aware of just how serious this is .
The administration and the security services remain in a state of heightened alert .
The cancellation and delay rate at airports is up 100 % since the incident .
Some of that may be down to the weather but each day sees a slew of new security alarms .
Military fighter jets escorted an airliner back to a Midwest airport when a passenger would not put away his hand luggage .
Newark airport was closed when a man nipped under a security barrier to kiss his girlfriend and several flights have been cancelled after sniffer dogs started barking .
The culprit in one case - a jar of honey !
It is a sticky business getting it right .
Obama ' t oo calm '
So perhaps the plot did not fail after all .
There is a general assumption in America that al - Qaeda simply wants to kill as many Americans as possible , that murder is their objective .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder
It is of course one of their goals but not for nothing are they , by many , still called terrorists .
They are , after all , trying to effect political change by using violence to create a state of fear by terrorising people and , in a democracy , that can send politicians into a blind funk .
Terrorists want to create terror .
It is in the job description !
President Obama 's opponents have long accused him of being soft on terrorism .
He does not even use the George Bush phrase " war on terror " .
So the hostile columnists pounced after the Christmas Day plot .
It took the president four days to speak from his Hawaii holiday home and , when he did , he sounded low key and calm .
They wanted anger and dismay .
Of course it is one of Obama 's trade marks that he is cool and analytical but the commentators want , not a problem solver , but an emoter - in - chief .
They have a political objective but their complaint boils down to the fact he did not appear frightened enough .
He was not terrified .
Subsequently he has appeared angrier , sterner - if mainly with his own intelligence services .
This mood of high seriousness has robbed the West of a really effective propaganda weapon .
It has made it difficult to exploit the sheer ridiculousness of an underpants bomber .
If the thought of the state of al - Qaeda 's undergarments made people snigger instead of quake , that would be a moral victory .
British attitude
And I think the whole thing would play rather differently at home in the UK .
I do not much buy the British stiff upper lip : that we are unsettled by nothing , except of course the weather !
Obama has declared that a proud nation does not hunker down and adopt a siege mentality in the face of such threats
But there are historical and political reasons why we seem less phased by the threat of terrorism .
Of course part of it goes back to 9/11 .
We have not suffered an attack like that .
For Americans , the events of that day created a profound and utterly new sense of vulnerability .
I grew up with stories of my mum coming home as a schoolgirl and finding a hole down the street where a house used to be , obliterated by German bombs ; of going into school and hearing a friend had been killed in a raid .
And most of my adult life has been against the background of IRA terrorism , a persistent drum beat of death .
I was one of the first on the scene when they blew up Harrods .
I know the cost in human terms .
But it means we see terrorism as a background threat .
It might have your name on it but it is statistically improbable .
A bit like road accidents : acknowledging that people will be killed in car accidents is not an argument against seat belts and air bags .
It is just a recognition that - despite all the sensible precautions - it will happen , perhaps to you and yours .
' Terrified ' US
The danger is that al - Qaeda did succeed on Christmas Day with the help of their unwitting foot soldiers in the American mass media .
People here have been terrorised and , just as President Johnson had to be tough in Vietnam - not because he thought it was sensible but because , as a Democrat , he could not be seen to be soft - Obama has adopted some of the rhetoric of war .
But in his last statement he seemed alert to this .
He has declared that a proud nation does not hunker down and adopt a siege mentality in the face of such threats .
In a rebuke to his critics , he warned that Americans should define what it means to be American .
A bunch of fanatics should not be allowed to define his nation .
It is all a bit coded but he is saying that it is his critics and those who thought Bush got it right who are really soft on terrorism , giving al - Qaeda what they desire : a terrified United States that dances to their tune .

Former CIGNA executive Wendell Potter says one of the most important things we can do to reform health care is to control the medical loss ratio - something Al Franken , Jay Rockefeller and other senators are attempting to do :
Today , insurers only pay about 81 cents of each premium dollar on actual medical care .
The rest is consumed by rising profits , grotesque executive salaries , huge administrative expenses , the cost of weeding out people with pre-existing conditions and claims review designed to wear out patients with denials and disapprovals of the care they need the most .
This equation is known as the medical loss ratio ( MLR ) , an aptly named figure that is widely seen by investors as the most important gauge of an insurance company 's current and future profitability .
In a private health insurance industry that collected $ 817 billion this year , a 14 percentage point difference in the MLR represents $ 112 billion a year !
Over 10 years , that would be more than enough to pay for health reform .
Thanks to the efforts of several senators who pushed for a minimum MLR to be included in reform legislation , the current Senate bill requires insurers to provide an annual rebate to each enrollee if non-claims costs exceed 20 % in the group market and 25 % in the individual market .
Sen . Al Franken ( D - Minn. ) is now leading a group including Sens. Jay Rockefeller ( D - W. Va. ) and Blanche Lincoln ( D - Ark. ) to introduce an amendment that would go further by requiring that 90 percent of the money consumers spend on health insurance premiums go directly to health care costs .
The senators are proposing a reform that strikes at the heart of a health insurance system that puts profits first , and it would have a profound effect .
When MLRs increase , that eats into profits , and Wall Street becomes very unhappy .
A case in point is Aetna , the nation 's third largest publicly - traded health insurance plan .
Three years ago , the company reported that its quarterly MLR had inched up from 77.9 percent to 79.4 percent in 12 months .
On the day this was disclosed , Aetna 's share price plunged 20 percent as investors sold off their shares , reducing the company 's market value by billions of dollars .
Wall Street investors expect insurers to pay as little as possible for medical claims .
As a result , the nation 's health insurance industry has evolved into a cartel of huge for - profit companies that together reap billions of dollars a year at the expense of their policyholders .
The seven largest firms -- UnitedHealth Group , WellPoint , Aetna , Humana , CIGNA , Health Net , and Coventry Health Care -- enroll nearly one in three Americans in their health insurance plans .
This year the industry will take about $ 25 billion in profits for getting between American
patients and their doctors , according to the industry 's trade group .
And they do this by finding every excuse in the book not to pay a claim , even if it means
canceling individual policies when people get sick or ridding their rolls of unprofitable small business group policies if an employee or family member falls seriously ill .
They issue confusing benefit statements to members so only highly motivated and persistent challengers of their denials stand a chance of reversing an unfair decision .
And in the final analysis , when an insurance company has decided it no longer can make enough profit on a particular person or employer - sponsored group , it drives them away in a process known as " purging . "
In this unconscionable profit - protection maneuver , an insurer will hike premiums so high that the policyholder has no choice but to pay outlandish rates for what may be a reduced benefit package , find another insurer , or simply go without coverage .
The consequences of such decisions can be deadly -- but Wall Street always has the last word when profits are the main
consideration .
When Wall Street is n't calling the shots , the outcome is decidedly better for health care consumers .
Government - operated plans , such as Medicare , and some organizations that provide coordinated care , consistently maintain higher medical loss ratios .
Kaiser had a 90.6 percent MLR in 2007 .
Between 1993 and 2007 , Medicare 's MLR has n't dropped below 97 percent .
The health care reform bill now being debated in the Senate must include a provision , such as that proposed by Sen .
Franken , that sets a minimum medical loss ratio to keep insurers from gouging consumers and leaving patients without the care they need .
Instead of being a formula to reward investors , a properly regulated medical loss ratio in combination with other cost containment measures in the legislation would be a reliable tool for keeping insurance company profits and administrative waste in check .
Toyota 's plant in Venezuela has more than 2,000 workers
Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez has told car companies they must share their technology with local businesses or leave the country .
Mr Chavez gave the ultimatum to Toyota , Ford , General Motors and Fiat during a public address .
If the demand is n't met , he said : " I invite you to pack up your belongings and leave .
I 'll bring in the Russians , the Belorusians , the Chinese . "
Venezuela has nationalised most of the oil , metal and coffee industries .
Mr Chavez attacked Toyota in particular , saying it was not producing enough four - wheel drive vehicles , which are used for public transport , and ordered an investigation .
So far , the carmakers have not responded .
Last year , car plants in Venezuela produced 135,042 cars and trucks .
Currency controls in Venezuela mean the industry is struggling to get enough money to import parts and pay off debts .
Ahah , this one came from Australia , that 's why it took so long !

Okay , so these were packaging , but they 're pretty neat so I count them , and will probably re-use them to give something to another geek someday .
I 'm puzzled about the ram .
I think the clock will go to the office .

Many years ago , one mustard dominated the supermarket shelves : French ’s .
It came in a plastic bottle .
People used it on hot dogs and bologna .
It was a yellow mustard , made from ground white mustard seed with turmeric and vinegar , which gave it a mild , slightly metallic taste .
If you looked hard in the grocery store , you might find something in the specialty - foods section called Grey Poupon , which was Dijon mustard , made from the more pungent brown mustard seed .
In the early seventies , Grey Poupon was no more than a hundred - thousand - dollar - a - year business .
Few people knew what it was or how it tasted , or had any particular desire for an alternative to French ’s or the runner - up , Gulden’s .
Then one day the Heublein Company , which owned Grey Poupon , discovered something remarkable : if you gave people a mustard taste test , a significant number had only to try Grey Poupon once to switch from yellow mustard .
In the food world that almost never happens ; even among the most successful food brands , only about one in a hundred have that kind of conversion rate .
Grey Poupon was magic .
Ketchup triggers , in equal measure , all five of the fundamental tastes ; one food theorist calls it " the Esperanto of cuisine . "
Ruven Afanador
So Heublein put Grey Poupon in a bigger glass jar , with an enamelled label and enough of a whiff of Frenchness to make it seem as if it were still being made in Europe ( it was made in Hartford , Connecticut , from Canadian mustard seed and white wine ) .
The company ran tasteful print ads in upscale food magazines .
They put the mustard in little foil packets and distributed them with airplane meals — which was a brand - new idea at the time .
Then they hired the Manhattan ad agency Lowe Marschalk to do something , on a modest budget , for television .
The agency came back with an idea : A Rolls - Royce is driving down a country road .
There ’s a man in the back seat in a suit with a plate of beef on a silver tray .
He nods to the chauffeur , who opens the glove compartment .
Then comes what is known in the business as the “ reveal . ”
The chauffeur hands back a jar of Grey Poupon .
Another Rolls - Royce pulls up alongside .
A man leans his head out the window .
“ Pardon me .
Would you have any Grey Poupon ? ”
In the cities where the ads ran , sales of Grey Poupon leaped forty to fifty per cent , and whenever Heublein bought airtime in new cities sales jumped by forty to fifty per cent again .
Grocery stores put Grey Poupon next to French ’s and Gulden’s .
By the end of the nineteen - eighties Grey Poupon was the most powerful brand in mustard .
“ The tagline in the commercial was that this was one of life ’s finer pleasures , ” Larry Elegant , who wrote the original Grey Poupon spot , says , “ and that , along with the Rolls - Royce , seemed to impart to people ’s minds that this was something truly different and superior . ”
The rise of Grey Poupon proved that the American supermarket shopper was willing to pay more — in this case , $ 3.99 instead of $ 1.49 for eight ounces — as long as what they were buying carried with it an air of sophistication and complex aromatics .
Its success showed , furthermore , that the boundaries of taste and custom were not fixed : that just because mustard had always been yellow did n’t mean that consumers would use only yellow mustard .
It is because of Grey Poupon that the standard American supermarket today has an entire mustard section .
And it is because of Grey Poupon that a man named Jim Wigon decided , four years ago , to enter the ketchup business .
Is n’t the ketchup business today exactly where mustard was thirty years ago ?
There is Heinz and , far behind , Hunt ’s and Del Monte and a handful of private - label brands .
Jim Wigon wanted to create the Grey Poupon of ketchup .
Wigon is from Boston .
He ’s a thickset man in his early fifties , with a full salt - and - pepper beard .
He runs his ketchup business — under the brand World ’s Best Ketchup — out of the catering business of his partner , Nick Schiarizzi , in Norwood , Massachusetts , just off Route 1 , in a low - slung building behind an industrial - equipment - rental shop .
He starts with red peppers , Spanish onions , garlic , and a high - end tomato paste .
Basil is chopped by hand , because the buffalo chopper bruises the leaves .
He uses maple syrup , not corn syrup , which gives him a quarter of the sugar of Heinz .
He pours his ketchup into a clear glass ten - ounce jar , and sells it for three times the price of Heinz , and for the past few years he has crisscrossed the country , peddling World ’s Best in six flavors — regular , sweet , dill , garlic , caramelized onion , and basil — to specialty grocery stores and supermarkets .
If you were in Zabar ’s on Manhattan ’s Upper West Side a few months ago , you would have seen him at the front of the store , in a spot between the sushi and the gefilte fish .
He was wearing a World ’s Best baseball cap , a white shirt , and a red - stained apron .
In front of him , on a small table , was a silver tureen filled with miniature chicken and beef meatballs , a box of toothpicks , and a dozen or so open jars of his ketchup .
“ Try my ketchup ! ” Wigon said , over and over , to anyone who passed .
“ If you do n’t try it , you ’re doomed to eat Heinz the rest of your life . ”
In the same aisle at Zabar ’s that day two other demonstrations were going on , so that people were starting at one end with free chicken sausage , sampling a slice of prosciutto , and then pausing at the World ’s Best stand before heading for the cash register .
They would look down at the array of open jars , and Wigon would impale a meatball on a toothpick , dip it in one of his ketchups , and hand it to them with a flourish .
The ratio of tomato solids to liquid in World ’s Best is much higher than in Heinz , and the maple syrup gives it an unmistakable sweet kick .
Invariably , people would close their eyes , just for a moment , and do a subtle double take .
Some of them would look slightly perplexed and walk away , and others would nod and pick up a jar .
“ You know why you like it so much ? ” he would say , in his broad Boston accent , to the customers who seemed most impressed .
“ Because you ’ve been eating bad ketchup all your life ! ” Jim Wigon had a simple vision : build a better ketchup — the way Grey Poupon built a better mustard — and the world will beat a path to your door .
If only it were that easy .
The story of World ’s Best Ketchup cannot properly be told without a man from White Plains , New York , named Howard Moskowitz .
Moskowitz is sixty , short and round , with graying hair and huge gold - rimmed glasses .
When he talks , he favors the Socratic monologue — a series of questions that he poses to himself , then answers , punctuated by “ ahhh ” and much vigorous nodding .
He is a lineal descendant of the legendary eighteenth - century Hasidic rabbi known as the Seer of Lublin .
He keeps a parrot .
At Harvard , he wrote his doctoral dissertation on psychophysics , and all the rooms on the ground floor of his food - testing and market - research business are named after famous psychophysicists .
( “ Have you ever heard of the name Rose Marie Pangborn ?
Ahhh .
She was a professor at Davis .
Very famous .
This is the Pangborn kitchen . ” )
Moskowitz is a man of uncommon exuberance and persuasiveness : if he had been your freshman statistics professor , you would today be a statistician .
“ My favorite writer ?
Gibbon , ” he burst out , when we met not long ago .
He had just been holding forth on the subject of sodium solutions .
“ Right now I ’m working my way through the Hales history of the Byzantine Empire .
Holy shit !
Everything is easy until you get to the Byzantine Empire .
It ’s impossible .
One emperor is always killing the others , and everyone has five wives or three husbands .
It ’s very Byzantine . ”
Moskowitz set up shop in the seventies , and one of his first clients was Pepsi .
The artificial sweetener aspartame had just become available , and Pepsi wanted Moskowitz to figure out the perfect amount of sweetener for a can of Diet Pepsi .
Pepsi knew that anything below eight per cent sweetness was not sweet enough and anything over twelve per cent was too sweet .
So Moskowitz did the logical thing .
He made up experimental batches of Diet Pepsi with every conceivable degree of sweetness — 8 per cent , 8.25 per cent , 8.5 , and on and on up to 12 — gave them to hundreds of people , and looked for the concentration that people liked the most .
But the data were a mess — there was n’t a pattern — and one day , sitting in a diner , Moskowitz realized why .
They had been asking the wrong question .
There was no such thing as the perfect Diet Pepsi .
They should have been looking for the perfect Diet Pepsis .
It took a long time for the food world to catch up with Howard Moskowitz .
He knocked on doors and tried to explain his idea about the plural nature of perfection , and no one answered .
He spoke at food - industry conferences , and audiences shrugged .
But he could think of nothing else .
“ It ’s like that Yiddish expression , ” he says .
“ Do you know it ?
To a worm in horseradish , the world is horseradish ! ”
Then , in 1986 , he got a call from the Campbell ’s Soup Company .
They were in the spaghetti-sauce business , going up against Ragú with their Prego brand .
Prego was a little thicker than Ragú , with diced tomatoes as opposed to Ragú ’s purée , and , Campbell ’s thought , had better pasta adherence .
But , for all that , Prego was in a slump , and Campbell ’s was desperate for new ideas .
Standard practice in the food industry would have been to convene a focus group and ask spaghetti eaters what they wanted .
But Moskowitz does not believe that consumers — even spaghetti lovers — know what they desire if what they desire does not yet exist .
“ The mind , ” as Moskowitz is fond of saying , “ knows not what the tongue wants . ”
Instead , working with the Campbell ’s kitchens , he came up with forty - five varieties of spaghetti sauce .
These were designed to differ in every conceivable way : spiciness , sweetness , tartness , saltiness , thickness , aroma , mouth feel , cost of ingredients , and so forth .
He had a trained panel of food tasters analyze each of those varieties in depth .
Then he took the prototypes on the road — to New York , Chicago , Los Angeles , and Jacksonville — and asked people in groups of twenty - five to eat between eight and ten small bowls of different spaghetti sauces over two hours and rate them on a scale of one to a hundred .
When Moskowitz charted the results , he saw that everyone had a slightly different definition of what a perfect spaghetti sauce tasted like .
If you sifted carefully through the data , though , you could find patterns , and Moskowitz learned that most people ’s preferences fell into one of three broad groups : plain , spicy , and extra-chunky , and of those three the last was the most important .
Why ?
Because at the time there was no extra-chunky spaghetti sauce in the supermarket .
Over the next decade , that new category proved to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Prego .
“ We all said , ‘ Wow ! ’ ” Monica Wood , who was then the head of market research for Campbell ’s , recalls .
“ Here there was this third segment — people who liked their spaghetti sauce with lots of stuff in it — and it was completely untapped .
So in about 1989 - 90 we launched Prego extra-chunky .
It was extraordinarily successful . ”
It may be hard today , fifteen years later — when every brand seems to come in multiple varieties — to appreciate how much of a breakthrough this was .
In those years , people in the food industry carried around in their heads the notion of a platonic dish — the version of a dish that looked and tasted absolutely right .
At Ragú and Prego , they had been striving for the platonic spaghetti sauce , and the platonic spaghetti sauce was thin and blended because that ’s the way they thought it was done in Italy .
Cooking , on the industrial level , was consumed with the search for human universals .
Once you start looking for the sources of human variability , though , the old orthodoxy goes out the window .
Howard Moskowitz stood up to the Platonists and said there are no universals .
Moskowitz still has a version of the computer model he used for Prego fifteen years ago .
It has all the coded results from the consumer taste tests and the expert tastings , split into the three categories ( plain , spicy , and extra- chunky ) and linked up with the actual ingredients list on a spreadsheet .
“ You know how they have a computer model for building an aircraft , ” Moskowitz said as he pulled up the program on his computer .
“ This is a model for building spaghetti sauce .
Look , every variable is here . ”
He pointed at column after column of ratings .
“ So here are the ingredients .
I ’m a brand manager for Prego .
I want to optimize one of the segments .
Let ’s start with Segment 1 . ”
In Moskowitz ’s program , the three spaghetti-sauce groups were labelled Segment 1 , Segment 2 , and Segment 3 .
He typed in a few commands , instructing the computer to give him the formulation that would score the highest with those people in Segment 1 .
The answer appeared almost immediately : a specific recipe that , according to Moskowitz ’s data , produced a score of 78 from the people in Segment 1 .
But that same formulation did n’t do nearly as well with those in Segment 2 and Segment 3 .
They scored it 67 and 57 , respectively .
Moskowitz started again , this time asking the computer to optimize for Segment 2 .
This time the ratings came in at 82 , but now Segment 1 had fallen ten points , to 68 .
“ See what happens ? ” he said .
“ If I make one group happier , I piss off another group .
We did this for coffee with General Foods , and we found that if you create only one product the best you can get across all the segments is a 60 — if you ’re lucky .
That ’s if you were to treat everybody as one big happy family .
But if I do the sensory segmentation , I can get 70 , 71 , 72 .
Is that big ?
Ahhh .
It ’s a very big difference .
In coffee , a 71 is something you ’ll die for . ”
When Jim Wigon set up shop that day in Zabar ’s , then , his operating assumption was that there ought to be some segment of the population that preferred a ketchup made with Stanislaus tomato paste and hand - chopped basil and maple syrup .
That ’s the Moskowitz theory .
But there is theory and there is practice .
By the end of that long day , Wigon had sold ninety jars .
But he ’d also got two parking tickets and had to pay for a hotel room , so he was n’t going home with money in his pocket .
For the year , Wigon estimates , he ’ll sell fifty thousand jars — which , in the universe of condiments , is no more than a blip .
“ I have n’t drawn a paycheck in five years , ” Wigon said as he impaled another meatball on a toothpick .
“ My wife is killing me . ”
And it is n’t just World ’s Best that is struggling .
In the gourmet - ketchup world , there is River Run and Uncle Dave ’s , from Vermont , and Muir Glen Organic and Mrs. Tomato Head Roasted Garlic Peppercorn Catsup , in California , and dozens of others — and every year Heinz ’s overwhelming share of the ketchup market just grows .
Comex No Longer Fulfilling Your Gold Contracts With Physical Gold
The division of the New York Mercantile Exchange commonly known as the Comex provides a commodities market for gold , as well as aluminum , copper , and silver .
Without going so far as suggesting it ’s impossible to get physical gold when exercising your Comex futures contracts , Jesse ’s Cafe Americain explains that these days it just does n’t seem very likely :
“ We would not conclude that you cannot get gold from the Comex in the exercise of your futures contract .
‘ Cash settled ’ is nothing new , and we ourselves have done this in the past .
But we also have taken delivery , and have been speaking with other traders and funds , and many are spotting a trend .
“ Comex is putting forward the offer of paper in the form of money or ETF positions very aggressively , and making it the much easier alternative .
Delivery of physical gold from the Comex is no longer as straightforward or even as semi-convenient as it had been in the past …
“ The conclusion we reach for now is that if one is counting on the ability to receive delivery of physical gold from the Comex for whatever purposes , then do n’t .
You will wait and fight and stand in queue to obtain the goods from Enron nation . ”
More details on the story are available from Jesse ’s Cafe Americain in its post on the Comex and exchange for physical gold .
The news leaked several days ago that in tonight ’s State of the Union address , President Obama will speak about the need to curb the government ’s out of control spending .
He will announce spending freezes on “ non discretionary , ” non military spending , as well as pay and bonus freezes on some political appointees .
To put this announcement in context , I want you to imagine a 400 lb man who was eating 3100 calories per day a year ago .
A year ago , the man started eating 3555 calories per day ( an increase of 455 calories – 14.67 % ) and gained 64 lbs during the past year and now weighs 464 lbs–an increase of 16 % .
Now , the even fatter man realizes that his weight has become an even more serious problem and he hatches a plan to deal with it .
He decides that he will freeze the increases in his caloric intake from most snacks for the next three years .
However , he decides that instead of cutting his meal sizes , he will actually continue to increase their sizes .
He will also increase the sizes of some of his snacks , while freezing the growth in the sizes of other snacks .
He concludes that these meals and snacks are essential to his survival and that therefore he must increase their sizes if he wants to get healthy .
Does this example sound far fetched ?
It isnt .
The numbers used above are scaled down numbers from our federal budget .
Our 2009 budget , passed in 2008 under President Bush called for $ 3.1 trillion in spending .
Of this , $ 1.89 trillion was “ mandatory ” –it funded government social welfare programs .
These are the meals described above .
The remaining $ 1.21 trillion was considered discretionary funding –these are the snacks described above .
But , included in the discretionary funding of that budget was $ 515.4 billion for the Defense Department , $ 145.2 billion for the War on Terror , $ 37.6 billion for the Department of Homeland Security , and $ 44.8 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs .
That total is $ 743 billion .
These are the snacks that the man above will not only continue to eat , but will actually increase the size of .
Now , lets look at the 2010 budget which was proposed by President Obama last February .
This budget had $ 3.55 trillion in spending .
Of this , $ 2.184 trillion was “ mandatory . ”
This is an increase of 15.6 % in only one year .
As you can see , the costs of Social Security , Medicare , and other programs are rising rapidly .
The remaining $ 1.368 trillion was considered discretionary .
The cost of these snacks increased by $ 13.1 % in that single year .
In other words , while discretionary costs are rapidly rising they are not the biggest problem .
Our mandatory costs are not only bigger than our discretionary costs–but mandatory costs are increasing at a much faster rate than are discretionary costs .
But , this budget included $ 663.7 billion for the Defense Department , $ 52.5 billions for the Department of Veterans Affairs , and $ 42.7 billion for the Department of Homeland Security .
The total here was $ 758.9 billion .
This is an increase of about 2.14 % .
If President Obama were proposing to cap the annual growth in the total budget at 2.14 % , the majority of Americnas would be pleased .
However , as mentioned above this spending freeze will not include mandatory spending –the biggest and fastest growing part of the budget .
But , just like the fat man described above , our national debt increased by 16 % in President Obama ’s first year–and just like that fat man , we are going to increase what we eat .
The government is cooking itself bigger meals as well as increasing the size of its snacks .
This is not the way to get in shape .
Using our analogy of the overweight man , we see that at best , this will only slow the rate at which the man gets fatter .
And , we would be fools to think that the President ’s freeze on discretionary spending actually means a freeze on discretionary spending .
The news of the spending freeze was leaked the other day , but this morning news leaked that the President was going to request a 6.2 % increase in the education budget .
Of course this money will come with strings attached .
Federal money always comes with strings attached and efforts to increase federal control .
Federal funding for education is nothing more than a move by the federal government to expropriate the money from Americans through taxes and then sell that money back to State education departments and local districts in exchange for influence .
The Carter Administration nationalized education in 1979 and the effect has been disastrous : steady declines in education all across the nation and sharp increases in costs of education .
These federal actions have made the American people pay more money for less education .
But , we cant be surprised by the Obama Administration ’s efforts to further erode local and family control over yet another aspect of our lives .
On top of this , President Obama will announce an $ 8 billion high speed rail initiative in Florida tomorrow .
This sounds nice , but the fact of the matter is that the high speed rail systems proposed by the government is a horrible idea that will be extremely costly , bad for the environment , and will not be high speed !
This isnt actually a new plan , but rather a rehashing of a plan that President Obama put forward last year .
The good people at the Georgia Public Policy Foundation put together a report on this plan last year .
You can find that report here .
Here are a few excerpts :
“ The FRA is not proposing to build 200 - mph bullet trains throughout the U.S. Instead , in most places it is proposing to upgrade existing freight lines to allow passenger trains to run as fast as 110 mph – which means average speeds of only 55 - 75 mph .
This would actually be slower than driving for anyone whose origin and destination are not both right next to a train station . ” ( Page 6 )
“ Even with these optimistic assumptions , high - speed rail reduces corridor transportation energy consumption by only 8.3 percent .
This means the operational energy and greenhouse gas savings fall to zero if we assume instead that automobiles and airplanes are , by 2025 , just 8.3 percent more energy efficient than they are today .
If automakers meet Obama ’s fuel - efficiency standards , autos will be more than 30 percent more efficient in 2025 than they are today , so high - speed rail will actually be wasting energy . ” ( Page 21 )
“ the FRA system will carry each person an average of 58 miles per year . ” ( Page 25 )
But , these are just the two spending increases that have been leaked today .
If we factor in the “ mandatory ” increases in social welfare programs , the increases in defense and intelligence budgets , and the new jobs / stimulus programs that Congress is almost sure to pass , we are still looking at heafty budget increases .
The man in my analogy would be stupid to not go on a diet .
Our government should do the same .
It needs to stop eating snacks where it can and begin to reduce the size of its meals to a sustainable level .
If President Obama is serious about preventing the looming debt crisis from wiping out decades of economic growth , he needs to change his tone .
Instead of just freezing spending in certain areas while allowing the already bloated budget to expand , Mr. Obama should cut the budget where possible .
He should also look for ways to stop the increases in the costs of mandatory spending before it is too late .
But of course , it may already be too late .

Persevere .
It ’s worth the effort because these shallots , prized by chefs , are more intensely pungent than other kinds .
You will understand once you mince some into a mignonette for oysters , add thin slices under the skin of a chicken , or roast them with root vegetables .
Bradley Farms ’ gray shallots are $ 8 a pound at Columbus Avenue and 97th Street on Fridays , Grand Army Plaza on Saturdays .
Kayla Rosenblum sat upright and poised as she breezed through the shapes and numbers , a leopard - patterned finger puppet resting next to her for moral support .
But then came something she had never seen before : a visual analogy showing a picture of a whole cake next to a slice of cake .
What picture went with a loaf of bread in the same way ?
Kayla , who will be 4 in December , held her tiny pointer finger still as she inspected the four choices .
“ Too hard , ” she peeped .
Test preparation has long been a big business catering to students taking SATs and admissions exams for law , medical and other graduate schools .
But the new clientele is quite a bit younger : 3 - and 4 - year - olds whose parents hope that a little assistance  costing upward of $ 1,000 for several sessions  will help them win coveted spots in the city ’s gifted and talented public kindergarten classes .
It was October when 150 protesters took to the streets of the city ’s East Side , demanding an end to violence in Saginaw .
Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics indicate a ruthless nature lurking in Saginaw , a city that once boomed with industrial prowess and attracted workers from across the nation but now watches as its population ebbs while the violence stays .
Even as Saginaw lost more than 10 percent of it citizens — more than 7,000 moved away since 2000 — violent crime continues to climb , up more than 50 percent in 2008 compared with 2000 , FBI statistics show .
The annual violent crime statistics stretching back to 2000 expose the troubles .
The 2008 numbers released in September — the most recent available consolidating crime statistics for more than 8,700 communities — show that once again , as it has each year since 2003 , Saginaw ranked as the No. 1 most violent city in America .
The ranking is based on violent crimes per person in the nearly 850 cities with populations greater than 40,000 .
Occurrences of murder , non-negligent manslaughter , forcible rape , robbery and aggravated assault comprise the categories the FBI uses to gauge a city ’s proclivity to violence .
Despite an overall increase in violent crime through 2008 , the number of recorded homicides this year , 13 , is the third lowest number recorded this decade .
In Michigan , Flint ranked sixth , Detroit 10th and Pontiac 11th based on the 2008 statistics .
You have to go back to 2002 , a year when Irvington , Calif. , topped the list , to find the most recent year Saginaw was n’t No. 1 .
“ Our 30 - year crime history is appalling , ” said Saginaw County Prosecutor Michael D. Thomas , a Freeland Democrat .
“ You ca n’t do more with less . ”
Thomas identified reductions in police , more lenient state sentencing guidelines and a disproportionately low number of prosecutors in Saginaw County versus similar cities as key factors in Saginaw ’s crime rate .
The Saginaw Police Department has 105 sworn officers ; it had 136 in November 2000 , said Personnel Generalist Beth Church of the city ’s Employee Services Department .
Kalamazoo has 40 percent the incidents of violent crime compared to Saginaw , according to 2008 FBI figures , and employs 30 prosecutors .
Saginaw County has nearly 20 prosecutors , Thomas said .
And statistics show , he said , if you ’re tougher on criminals who commit minor crimes , you can reduce the number of major crimes they ’re likely to commit in the future .
Christina Jones , 75 , a lifelong East Side resident and Houghton - Jones Neighborhood Task Force board member said she ’s noticed that “ it ’s gotten worse ” over the last 10 years .
“ Hearing the reports , you ’re not even safe walking out your door , ” she said , “ And that ’s a scary feeling . ”
In the past , she said , violence seemed confined mainly to gang conflicts , but today “ these little thugs ” are unfocused with the crimes they commit , she said .
The key , Jones said , is reaching youths before they turn 14 , after which they “ sometimes become hardened and kind of hard to reach .
“ We need to try and educate our young people and instill in them some sort of morals , ” she said .
Surrounded by lottery , gambling , drinking , smoking and cursing , “ they see nothing wrong with it , and most of the parents are involved in all of that .
..
They think wrong is right . ”
March organizers followed the demonstration with four months of meetings uniting key public figures , service providers , community organizers and residents in a quest for a solution .
The sessions promoted synergy between police officers , educators , clergy , youths and government officials .
This month , a “ steering session ” is planned to complete a “ five - point strategic plan , ” said Larry D. Camel , the co-founder of Parishioners on Patrol , the group that coordinated the march and meetings .
Law enforcement is key to protecting the public , Thomas said .
But even if the court system had the resources to fully prosecute all criminals , legislators still sometimes render impotent the system ’s potential to enact justice .
“ Our sentencing guidelines tie some of our judge ’s hands behind their backs , ” he said , removing the judge ’s leeway in imposing a sentence and often resulting in shorter sentence benefiting the convict .
Thomas said first - offense felons go to prison less than 10 percent of the time in Michigan .
Based on the number of parolees Thomas ’s office prosecutes , many convicts are released from prison early , Thomas said .
Midland , a city with about 10,000 fewer people than Saginaw , had only 50 violent crimes in 2008 and ranked as one of the safest cities in the nation at 766 out of about 850 cities in the United States with 40,000 people or more , according to federal statistics .
Saginaw Township , with fewer than 40,000 people , recorded 102 violent crimes the same year .
“ That tells you what you already know , that Midland is quite a fine town , ” Thomas said .
i Phone owners may love Apple 's sexy mobile device , but they absolutely can't stand AT&T .
It ranks dead last in customer satisfaction for dropped calls and spotty 3G service , a sore spot that Verizon has been poking at with new ads .
Now the U.S. 's second largest wireless provider is looking to turn things around , hopefully before it loses iPhone exclusivity rights .
Its newest strategy is especially unique , though , because it comes in the form of an iPhone app called Mark the Spot [ iTunes Link ] .
The free customer service app is really quite simple .
Whenever you experience a problem with your service ( e.g. a dropped call , bad 3G connection , poor quality ) , you can open up the app and report the issue right where you are .
Once you cite the problem and add additional info , it gets submitted to AT&T 's customer support team .
The key to the app is that it 's location - based , meaning that AT&T can aggregate this data to find dead spots and trouble areas .
This app is simple but smart — it provides useful data to AT&T while giving customers an outlet for venting about their hatred for AT&T and how they wished the iPhone was on Verizon .
Still , it may be too little , too late .
Just do n't try to report a network outage when there 's no network due to an outage ; you may just rip open a black hole in the fabric of spacetime .
If you have not delved into the thousands of e-mail messages and files hacked from the computers of British climate scientists , let me give you the closest thing to an executive summary .
It is taken from a file slugged HARRY_READ_ME , which is the log of a computer expert ’s long struggle to make sense of a database of historical temperatures .
Here is Harry ’s summary of the situation :
Aarrggghhh !
That cry , in various spellings , is a motif throughout the log as Harry tries to fight off despair .
“ OH [ EXPLETIVE ] THIS ! ” he writes after struggling to reconcile readings from weather stations around the world .
“ It ’s Sunday evening , I ’ve worked all weekend , and just when I thought it was done I ’m hitting yet another problem that ’s based on the hopeless state of our databases .
There is no uniform data integrity .
... ”
Harry , whoever he may be , comes off as the most sympathetic figure in the pilfered computer annals of East Anglia University , the British keeper of global temperature records .
While Harry ’s log shows him worrying about the integrity of the database , the climate scientists are e-mailing one another with strategies for blocking outsiders ’ legal requests to see their data .
While Harry is puzzling over temperatures 
“ I have that familiar Twilight Zone sensation ”  the scientists are confidently making proclamations to journalists , jetting to conferences and plotting revenge against those who question the dangers of global warming .
When a journal publishes a skeptic ’s paper , the scientists e-mail one another to ignore it .
They focus instead on retaliation against the journal and the editor , a project that is breezily added to the agenda of their next meeting : “ Another thing to discuss in Nice ! ”
As the scientists denigrate their critics in the e-mail messages , they seem oblivious to one of the greatest dangers in the climate - change debate : smug groupthink .
These researchers , some of the most prominent climate experts in Britain and America , seem so focused on winning the public - relations war that they exaggerate their certitude  and ultimately undermine their own cause .
Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has poured cold water over a proposal by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown for a global tax on financial transactions to fund future bank bailouts .

We ’re not in the business of raising taxes , " Flaherty said after a Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in St. Andrews , Scotland .
" But the principle , the idea , that banks should plan ahead for their own demise and fund that with a living will , or some other concept like that , is a good one and more work is going to be done on that by the G20 finance ministers . "
The U.S. also rejected the idea .
In a speech Saturday to the finance ministers , Brown said such a tax should be considered to raise the level of accountability in the financial sector .
" I believe we should discuss whether we need a better economic and social contract to reflect the global responsibilities of financial institutions to society , " Brown told the G20 ministers .
" It can not be acceptable that the benefits of success in this sector are reaped by the few but the costs of its failure are borne by all of us , " he said .
Brown said a tax on financial transactions would need to be implemented globally .
" Let me be clear : Britain will not move unless others move with us together , " he said of the levy , modelled after the so - called Tobin tax proposed by American economist James Tobin in the early 1970s as a way of curbing speculation on financial markets .
Following the talks , G20 finance officials issued a statement in which they pledged to maintain emergency support for their economies until global recovery is assured .
The statement said economic and financial conditions have improved , but it stressed that recovery is " uneven and remains dependent on policy support . "
High unemployment remains a major concern , the ministers said .
I know so many people who believe that the God of the Bible ( which one ? ) actually exists , yet they break the 10 Commandments all the time .
Honestly , if you believe this all knowing , all powerful , ever present being exists , then should n't you be doing everything you can to do what he / she / it says ?
This question , and minor variations of it , pose what appears to be an insurmountable obstacle to all Christians except for perhaps the most rabid biblical literalists .
Although I have never met anyone who actually lived as if they believed every word in the Christian bible was the literal word of a divine being , I accept the possibility that such people might be out there somewhere .
The Secular Thinker draws on his ( or her ) experience as an atheist attending a Catholic college , noting that it was difficult to distinguish Catholic students from non-Catholics .
A common response , one that I have received many times , is that nobody is perfect and that these students cannot be expected to never violate god 's laws .
But if one really believed that one 's eternal soul was in jeopardy , would n't one be able to avoid breaking whatever version of the 10 Commandments one was taught ?
The " nobody 's perfect " response does not strike me as a viable one .
Observations like these lead many atheists , and more than a few Christians I suspect , to question the sincerity of the beliefs professed by some Christians .
Perhaps they do notbelieve what they claim to believe and simply maintain the appearance of such beliefs for the sake of the social benefits they confer ( e.g. , being part of a religious community , etc. ) .
Perhaps they profess the beliefs because they were taught from an early age that this is what they are supposed to believe .
Perhaps they try with all their might to convince themselves that they believe these things because doing so carries some sort of emotional benefit .
What such individuals describe as a " crisis of faith " may be little more than their rational mind revolting at the incongruence between their claimed beliefs and their behavior .
What it boils down to for me , again and again , is that the overwhelming majority of those who call themselves Christians do not behave as if their souls were at risk .
Few even seem to have a clear idea of what their bible says
The funny ( or sad ) thing is that the last time I posted something along these lines , it was picked up and linked at a Christian blog .
The blogger expressed agreement and joined me in lamenting the problem of " fake Christians , " evidently missing the point entirely .
It seems to me that a real Christian would have to be one who wholeheartedly rejected the arrogance associated with attempting to interpret the meaning of his or her " holy " scripture and instead lived as if every word of it was true
PORT ARTHUR , Texas ( AP ) —
As much as 450,000 gallons of crude oil spilled in a southeast Texas port Saturday after two vessels collided , the U.S. Coast Guard said .
No injuries have been reported , but part of the port has been closed and some nearby residents have been evacuated .
Port Arthur police Sgt. Ken Carona told television station KFDM that fewer than 100 people were evacuated from the area because of hydrogen sulfide – a hazardous gas with a rotten egg smell – that was emanating from the oil .

He told the station that people will be allowed back when the levels go down .
While the Coast Guard said around 450,000 gallons of oil were spilled , Carona says only about 40,000 gallons of oil were spilled .
U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Renee Aiello told The Association Press that the crude spilled at the Port of Port Arthur when a 600 - foot tanker carrying oil collided with a towing vessel pushing a loaded barge .
The Coast Guard was notified of the collision around 9:50 a.m. , she said .
The crash left a 15 - by - 8 - foot hole in the tanker , Aiello said .
The towing vessel then ricocheted and hit another tanker that was tied to a pier .
Aiello did n’t know what damage was caused to that ship .
Aiello said a portion of the oil in the damaged tank has been moved to another holding tank on the ship .

In which various people speak their minds in a reasonably coherent fashion .
Google will begin paying bounties as high as $ 1,337 to researchers who privately report high - severity security bugs in its Chrome browser and Chromium open - source project .
The " experimental new incentive , " which Google announced Thursday , is for external researchers only .
It addresses a key complaint among many researchers that the security of far too many applications is built on the backs of people who receive no compensation for the countless hours they spend discovering and reporting critical vulnerabilities .
" It 's a step in the right direction because it 's compensating security researchers for their time in looking for vulnerabilities , " said Dino Dai Zovi , a researcher who last year launched a campaign with the rallying cry " No more free bugs " .
" A lot of companies treat vulnerabilities as accidental discoveries , which is really not the case . "
Over the years , Dai Zovi has reported critical bugs in Sun Microsystems ' Solaris and Apple's Mac OS
X that could have caused considerable harm to users had the vulnerabilities been exploited by criminals .
To date , neither company has paid him a dime .
Microsoft , Oracle and virtually every other commercial software manufacturer also steadfastly refuse to reward responsible disclosure , even though their products also benefit from it .
The Internet Explorer bug that criminals used to pierce the defenses of Google and other companies has probably cost Microsoft hundreds of thousands of dollars in man hours and damage to reputation .
One can only guess if the vulnerability , which lurked in the browser for years , would have been fixed sooner had white - hat hackers had more of an incentive to find it .
Adobe might also benefit from such a program .
To date only a handful of software makers offer security bug bounties .
They apply almost exclusively to open - source projects such as Mozilla 's Firefox , Daniel J. Bernstein 's djbdns .
Google 's program will offer a base reward of $ 500 for certain reports and as much as $ 1,337 ( the number is often used as hacker shorthand for " elite " ) for " high and critical impact bugs . "
A panel established by Google will have sole discretion for awarding cash rewards . ®
The most serious criticisms leveled at the authors of the e-mail messages revolve around three issues .
One is whether the correspondence reveals efforts by scientists to shield raw data , gleaned from tree rings and other indirect indicators of climate conditions , preventing it from being examined by independent researchers .
Among those who say it does is Stephen McIntyre , a retired Canadian mining consultant who has a popular skeptics ’ blog , climateaudit.org .
A second issue is whether disclosed documents , said to be from the stolen cache , prove that the data underlying climate scientists ’ conclusions about warming are murkier than the scientists have said .
The documents include files of raw computer code and a computer programmer ’s years - long log documenting his frustrations over data gathered from countries in the Northern Hemisphere .
Finally , questions have been raised about whether the e-mail messages indicated that climate scientists tried to prevent the publication of papers written by climate skeptics , which were described by the scientists in the e-mail messages as “ garbage ” and “ fraud . ”
Officials with Britain ’s national climate office have defended the integrity of the climate unit ’s work , noting that the warming trend it has measured is largely replicated by separate groups at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
“ This is a shallow and transparent attempt to discredit the robust science undertaken by some of the world ’s most respected scientists , ” said Vicky Pope , the office ’s senior spokeswoman , in an e-mail message .
Rajendra K. Pachauri , the chairman of the intergovernmental climate panel , issued a statement rebutting claims that the e-mail messages , which involved some members of the panel , indicated that the panel ’s reports were biased .
In posts on the blog Realclimate.org , some of the scientists who participated in the correspondence have also said that , although inappropriate language was used at times , their critical comments about people or research papers were based on the quality of the arguments .
The public disclosure of the e-mail messages has already led to calls from conservative British and American legislators for investigations .
The lead Saudi Arabian climate negotiator , Mohammad al - Sabban , said that the affair could affect negotiations over a new global climate treaty .
“ This is very serious and can put the whole climate debate , including any future agreement in Copenhagen and beyond , in big question , ” Mr. al - Sabban said in an e-mail message .
And even some environmental campaigners believe that the disclosures have damaged calls for climate action .
George Monbiot , a British environmentalist and author , excoriated some of the climate unit ’s scientists and many of his fellow activists on Wednesday in a column in The Guardian .

The Pakistani government has been thrown into disarray after the removal of immunity for politicians and government officials .
Pakistan 's interior minister Rehman Malik has been summoned to appear in court on corruption charges and is scheduled to appear in court next month .
More than 250 Pakistani politicians and government officials are facing possible prosecution .
Mr Malik is one of the most high profile government ministers accused of corruption .
On Thursday , the Defence Minister Ahmed Muktar was also prevented from leaving the country because of a police order .
Dozens of cases have been reopened after the Supreme Court overturned immunity granted to politicians and government officials .
The special protection was introduced in 2007 by former President Pervez Musharraf , to allow the return of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
Opposition activists are calling on the President Asif Ali Zadari and his government to resign .
But Mr Zadari has dismissed the demands .
In Wisconsin , conservative and pro-business groups said Friday that they were considering a lawsuit to block a proposed law that would ban corporate spending during political campaigns .
In Kentucky and Colorado , lawmakers looked for provisions in their state constitutions that may need to be rewritten .
And in Texas , lawyers for Tom DeLay , the former House majority leader , said the pending state campaign finance case against him should be thrown out .
A day after the United States Supreme Court ruled that the federal government may not ban political spending by corporations or unions in candidate elections , officials across the country were rushing to cope with the fallout , as laws in 24 states were directly or indirectly called into question by the ruling .
“ One day the Constitution of Colorado is the highest law of the state , ” said Robert F. Williams , a law professor at Rutgers University .
“ The next day it ’s wastepaper . ”
People are abandoning print newspapers because the articles are too long .
That ’s what journalist Michael Kinsley says in The Atlantic .
Here is his opening paragraph : “ One reason seekers of news are abandoning print newspapers for the Internet has nothing directly to do with technology .
It ’s that newspaper articles are too long .
On the Internet , news articles get to the point . ”
It might be more than that .
Editors often say that different kinds of stories must conform to length restrictions .
At many print news outlets , editors cut stories to fit into allotted spaces .
Other times they commission more words for the same reason .
That ’s artificial .
The way to determine length is to figure out how much room the story needs .
Most stories need few words ;
Twitter tweets are good enough for some .
Some stories need tons of words and tons of space .
Some stories can be one or the other , depending on how many layers of the story you want to display .
The only thing to do is ruthlessly prune that wood .
If you end up with bonsai , so be it .
If you end up with a sequoia , that might be because it ’s what the story demands .
Kinsley hits on the real problem elsewhere in his 1,800 - word essay : Certain journalism writing conventions add unnecessary words to stories , which in turn makes them too long .
( Reuters editors see stories that exceed 500 or 600 words as indistinguishable from “ Gravity ’s Rainbow . ” )
Those conventions include useless comments from outside experts to lend an appearance of objectivity to the story as well as context that is n’t really context .
One example he uses comes from a New York Times story that is shorter than his essay :
Handing President Obama a hard - fought victory , the House narrowly approved a sweeping overhaul of the nation ’s health care system on Saturday night , advancing legislation that Democrats said could stand as their defining social policy achievement .
It ’s a fair point , especially when Kinsley ’s desire is to find out WHAT HAPPENED , never mind the this - and - that of political chess and so much blah blah blah .
But the kind of writing he attacks would irk him at 200 words — or 2,000 .
The root of the problems he has are with the architectural approach to news that so many journalists and journalism professors have touted over the years : “ inverted pyramids ” of news presentation , “ kickers , ” and other modular design elements that newsies can use like building blocks to assemble a story like you would assemble a car .
Too many journalists learn to treat quasi- scientific approaches to doing the news as gospel , which means that too many things that work well in some circumstances do n’t work in others — but get used anyway .
No matter if you ’re a two - paragraph breaking - news writer at Reuters or if you ’re John McPhee in the throes of your fifth book in a series about the decline of stick - shift drivers in Pennsylvania , the facts and the narrative count more than anything else .
Tell those stories well and give them the length that you deserve , and someone is bound to read you to the end .
Kinsley makes one other point that struck me : “ On the Internet , news articles get to the point . ”
Yes , and in newspapers , many articles do the same thing .
The best ones know that you learned what happened yesterday and give you more today .
And on the Internet , many articles are atrocious reads too .
It ’s not the medium , it ’s the writing quality .
Writing can stink wherever you publish it , and at the risk of saying it again , at whatever length it appears .
Finally , newspaper story length appears to be decreasing .
That ’s what I ’ve seen from my years covering the news about the news , though I admit that I have no proof .
At The Wall Street Journal , it ’s one of Rupert Murdoch ’s diktats to the reporters and editors .
I know of no evidence that says story length decreases are producing more subscribers .
Certainly at many other papers , this is not happening .
Circulation is falling because people can get stuff online for free whenever they want — at any length .
No more focus groups dedicated to changing the composition of print stories will change that .
PS , Not counting this postscript , it took me 693 words to write this blog post .
By any blog reader ’s standards , that ’s probably too long .
PPS , John McPhee did n’t write five books about stick shift .
He did , however , write four books about geology that are lots of fun even if you do n’t care about geology .
That ’s why many writers are jealous of John McPhee :
You care despite your lack of interest and his lack of regard for brevity .

Lists of rules tend to be phrased in the negative .
From the Ten Commandments to the Bill of Rights , most rules are , in fact , the list of things you should n’t do .
This goes double for books on improv .
Some of the rules I ’ve listed in earlier articles do the very same thing .
However , the problem with listing rules in terms of the negative – as in “ do n’t do this ” and “ do n’t do that ” – is that the negativity actually reinforces the very habit you ’re trying to break .
It ’s an important distinction to make , since as performers ( and human beings ) , the harder you try not to do something , the more you think about it and the more it ’s at the forefront of your mind and the easier it slips out .
Have you ever tried to forget something ?
It ’s pretty much all you can think about , right ?
Same thing with all these rules .
If you talk about all the things you ca n’t do and should n’t say , then that ’s what your mind will focus on .
If you ’re in an improv scene and you ’re thinking to yourself , “ I should definitely not ask a question , ” then you ’re a ) obviously not focused on the moment , and b ) probably about to ask a question .
How can you focus on what your partner is saying if you ’re thinking about what not to do and making lists of things not to say ?
It ’s just the way human brains work .
So , if you need rules , try to phrase them in the positive .
Instead of saying “ Do n’t Ask Negative Questions ” , try thinking of it as “ Ask Positive Questions ” , or better yet , “ Make Statements . ”
That way , not only do you avoid a major pitfall , you give yourself an instant game plan , too .
Positivity breeds positivity .
If you ’re standing on stage and thinking , “ Please do n’t fail , please do n’t fail , ” then all your brain really hears is “ FAIL .
FAIL . ”
That kind of negativity kills confidence and lack of confidence disconnects an audience almost immediately .
Instead , stand tall and say to yourself , “ Let ’s have fun .
Make some bold choices , ” and surprise , surprise , that ’s what your brain hears and that ’s what you focus on .
FOCUS !
Your players are telling you what they want – have you listened ?
It seems like a simple thing , but it ’s often overlooked .
Focusing on your players is one of the most important things you can do as a DM besides actually showing up to the game .
As an improviser , focus is vital .
If you ’re not actively listening to your scene partner , you are not only missing the scene , you ’re missing the point !
Now , I ’m going to let you in on a little secret : no improviser has all the answers ( and neither do Dungeon Masters , despite what they might say ) .
I know , it ’s shocking .
However , the difference between a good improviser and a mediocre improviser is what they do when confronted with the unexpected .
Same with Dungeon Masters .
Some improvisers will look away , out in to the audience .
Some DMs will stare down at their dice , or at some chart on their DM screen as if the answer will magically appear …
The truth is that the answer is almost never on any chart .
For improvisers , the answer is always in your scene partner .
What I mean by that is to focus on the other person .
When confronted with an unexpected situation , a good improviser will make their response about the other person .
The relationship between the scene partners is what we , as an audience , have come to see .
As the DM , you should focus on your players .
They are the most important part of the game .
Not the monsters .
Not the really cool traps .
Not their characters .
The players .
If the players are n’t the focus of the game , no amount of cool McGuffins or awesome loot is going to save it .
I ’m not talking about knowing their names or what character they play , I ’m talking about their style of play .
Some players can have fun even when their characters lose .
Heck , I ’ve seen some players have a good time while their characters died .
Some players can’t have fun unless their characters win .
Some are just there to hang out with friends .
As long as they are the focus , your game stays on track .
However , you also need to be able focus on the scene you are setting .
Fortunately , the two go hand in hand .
What elements are you creating that will attract your players ’ focus ?
What is the point of this scene ?
Is it to introduce the main villain ?
To expose a betrayal ?
Reveal a hidden ally ?
If you know the main focus of the scene , you know everything – and how everything relates to the focus .
But be careful with how you structure a scene .
Is the scene “ winnable ” by the player standards ?
Have you set it up as a challenge or as an intentional set - back ?
Always remember that as intensely as you focus on your players , they are watching you for cues on how to react .
You are setting the standard – if you ’re unfocused and talking about the latest YouTube video instead of the scene at hand , chances are they wo n’t be too focused on the game , either .
KNOW WHEN TO GIVE AND WHEN TO TAKE
One of the hardest skills to master in improvisation , even more than knowing when to talk or even what to say , is knowing when to stop talking .
Know when to shut up and let your partner add to the scene .
You ’ve added something ; now let them agree and add something else .
If you ’re not sure , talk less – not more .
Silence can be a powerful tool in an improviser ’s arsenal if used with confidence and not out of fear .
As an improviser , too much exposition will absolutely kill a scene .
If you come out on stage and tell your scene partner what ’s just happened , what ’s happening now , and what ’s going to happen , then what ’s the point of the scene ?
You ’ve just performed a monologue and made your scene partner completely unnecessary .
As a Dungeon Master , you run the game .
It ’s your job to settle rule disputes and set obstacles in front of your players as they pursue their goals .
I ’ve said this before , but it ’s important enough to repeat : your job is n’t necessarily to tell the whole story .
Let the players talk to each other – who knows what awesome stuff they ’ll come up with ?
Instead of constantly asking them , “ What do you want to do ? ” , you can just look at each of them in turn .
The power of silence is amazing .
Instead of demanding they come up with a plan , explore what happens when you simply look at each of them expectantly .
Wait for them to come up with a plan .
Pretty soon they ’ll get the idea that you ’re not going to hold their hands the entire time .
The DM does not have to talk all the time to reinforce their status .
FORGET ALL THE RULES AND JUST HAVE FUN
The most important rule in improv is not on any list .
The imperative I live by as an improviser is to have as much fun as possible .
The lists of rules are just that – a list of guidelines , created by another person .
If they do n’t make sense in your game , feel free to ignore them .
I ’m not even of the opinion that you have to “ learn the rules before you can break them . ”
Go ahead , break ‘ em !
The way these rules came about is through trial and error .
Some improvisers were watching other improvisers and noticed that the lackluster scene had a bunch of denials and arguments and negotiations , so they said , “ We ’ll eliminate all those things and have only great improv scenes ! ”
That would be fantastic if it were that easy , but remember , correlation is not necessarily causal …
Just because people saw bad improv scenes that had lots of denials and questions and talking about the action , that does n’t automatically mean that all scenes that have those elements will be bad .
( There is definitely a link , but they do n’t cause bad scenes . )
I ’ve seen plenty of fun improv scenes where the players asked a series of interview - type questions , scenes where they told each other “ No ” , and even scenes where they argued and talked about past events .
But neither the questions nor the arguments were ever the focus of those scenes – the relationship between the players was always the focus in every great improv scene .
As a Dungeon Master , sitting in front of a handful of players expecting you to entertain them can obviously be a little daunting .
Even more so if you ’re unprepared .
How can you possibly know everything your players are going to do and have a response ready for everything your players might try – while simultaneously corralling them back on the track of your well - written plot ?
Simple : You can ’t .
Really .
So relax ( and learn to improvise ) .
The real trick is to be flexible enough to use their suggestions and incorporate their choices along with your own outlines .
Have you ever used a player ’s creativity against them ?
It does n’t make you evil , just a good Dungeon Master .

" There is nothing secret about the meeting -- it 's just the sacred nature of the things we will be talking about , " said Rammell .
" We are going to talk about ( LDS Church founder ) Joseph Smith 's prophecy that the Constitution will be hanging by a thread and that the Latter - day Saint elders will step forward and save it . "
Mormon women are barred from holding the LDS priesthood , but the GOP hopeful provided a further explanation for their exclusion from the campaign meetings :
Rammell said that though LDS women were not invited because of lack of space , he hopes that the men will take the message home to their wives .
And what message might some critics take home from Rammell 's announcement ?
As the Standard Journal notes : " In the past , Rammell has been criticized for using his faith to further his campaign . "
Whether the aspiring Republican is guilty of that in this instance will be the subject of in - depth follow - up coverage by the Standard Journal , just as soon as its reporters have obtained the ecclesiastical clearance required to attend Rammell campaign events .
In other Mormon news :

" I plan to be a visible ally for gay and transgendered Utahns , " he said .
" We are agents of change . "
More Mormons like Ben McAdams , please .
Update : Rex Rammell describes official LDS church disapproval of his tactics as " ridiculous " :
An LDS church spokesman has released this statement :
" The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints is politically neutral and does not endorse or promote any candidate party or platform .
Accordingly , we hope that the campaign practices of political candidates would not suggest that their candidacy is supported by or connected to the church . "

( CNN ) --
The past 12 months have been a banner year for cyber crime .
And that could be bad news for the future of e-commerce .
" At current trends , in three or four years people will start to think twice about transacting on the Web , individuals and businesses , " said Michael Fraser , director of the communications law centre at the University of Technology Sydney .
" The way it 's trending now , the Web could be so full of rubbish that people wo n't trust it , " Fraser said .
" That could destroy the potential of the whole knowledge economy , which so many developed economies are counting on for the competitive advantage . "
According to antivirus maker Symantec , 87 percent of e-mail traffic in the past year was spam , compared to just under 70 percent in 2008 .
More than 40 trillion spam messages were sent according to Symantec , which monitors about a third of the world 's e-mail traffic .
That 's about 5,000 spam messages for every person on the planet .
More of that spam is harboring malicious software , or " malware , " -- 2 percent of spam contained malware , a 900 percent increase from the previous year .
Malware comes in a variety of forms that can search computers for bank information and personal details for identity theft , or hijack computers to become foot soldiers in a spamming army of zombie " botnets " -- often unbeknownst to the owner .
In Australia alone , an estimated 10 percent of computers are infected with malware , Fraser said .
" And we 're relatively low because we have less ( broadband penetration ) than many other countries , " he said .
The past year saw an explosion of individuals on social networking sites such as Facebook having their accounts compromised and spam being sent to friends within their network .
In this way , cyber criminals have made the attacks more personal because they are sending out messages appropriating victims ' names , says Marian Merritt , an Internet safety advisor for Norton , the antivirus brand produced by Symantec .
" In the past , people felt annoyed by spam , they did n't really feel a sense of being attacked , " Merritt said .
" But if your Facebook account is hacked , it 's embarrassing . "
The past year has seen the rise of " scareware " -- malware that parrots a legitimate antivirus software program and then infects the computer with " the very malware it purports to protect against , " a Symantec report said .
For a 12 - month period ending June 30 , Symantec received 43 million reports of scareware installation attempts .
" That took a lot of us in the industry by surprise the past year , " Merritt said .
" You get a pop - up ad saying , ' you have multiple viruses ' then asks you to download the antivirus software .
Once you download those programs , they hold you hostage . "
The speed of news
The past year saw the rising speed and popularity of malware spam and Web sites with touts related to current events and celebrity news .
" Who killed Michael Jackson ? "
" Get swine flu medicine here " and " Full eBook Harry Potter " were some popular online traps to open dangerous e-mail attachments or be directed to Web sites ' malware .
" If you want to know what spam will be hitting tomorrow , look at Google Trends today , " said Merritt , referring to Google 's site that shows hot topics and searches by its users .
One of the most alarming incidents in 2009 for governments and policy makers was the July 4 attacks on U.S. government sites , such as the White House , the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq -- followed a few days later by similar attacks on Web sites in South Korea .
According to a research paper by antivirus maker McAfee , both attacks were made by the same " botnet " of 50,000 computers , which spammed targets with so many e-mails their IT systems were overwhelmed .
North Korea was suspected as the originator of the attack , leading Dmitiri Alperovitch , vice president of threat research at McAfee , to suggest one motivation of the attack " could have been to test the impact of flooding South Korean networks and the transcontinental communications between the U.S. government ... ( which ) would provide them with a significant advantage in case of a surprise attack . "
The attack highlights the problem of security on the Internet -- a transnational attack , using commercial services and tens of thousands of personal computers .
To fight the attacks would take strong local and international laws on cyber security , a great deal of cooperation among commercial providers and effective systems to report the crimes -- none of which is happening today , Fraser said .
" The community does n't know where to turn to when these crimes occur , and the police do n't know how to report it or record it , and prosecutors and court systems have a hard time coping with cases that involve gigabytes of evidence , " he said .
Looking ahead to 2010 , antivirus maker Trend Micro predicts that there will be more attacks on Mac operating systems .
Previously ignored by malware makers because of its relatively low market share , the booming popularity of iPhones is drawing the attention of cybercriminals .

Crooks tried to impersonate Ricky Gervais by using a picture of The Office character David Brent mounted in a counterfeit passport as part of a comically inept attempt to withdraw a large sum from the comedian 's bank account .
The ingenious retro-fraudsters tried to extract £ 200,000 from the comic actor 's bank account in order to buy gold bullion .
Instead of using phishing or cyber - crime to obtain login credentials and cash - out the account or obtaining fraudulent lines of credit after impersonating Gervais , the crooks kept it old school .
Their cunning plan revolved around impersonating Brent by turning up at a bank vault with a amateurishly faked passport featuring a ' David Brent ' picture cut from the packaging of a DVD of The Office instead of a proper passport photo .
It 's unclear whether the crooks were impersonating Gervais himself or simply posing as couriers acting on his behalf and using the counterfeit passport to back up their story .
In any case , bank officials quickly became suspicious and called Gervais , 48 , who authorised them to bring in the police and arrest the criminal masterminds , the Daily Telegraph reports .
After making an arrest , police told Gervais that the passport was either stolen or obtained from a dead man before it was amateurishly altered .
It 's unclear how the fraudsters figured out where Gervais banked .
The comic himself suggested the attempted fraud turned out to be an inside job , hatched by corrupt insiders at the unnamed bank .
The scam took place several years ago but Gervais only spoke about if for the first time this weekend .
The comic was not left out of pocket by the attempted scam and not required to testify in subsequent court proceedings .
The Sun , which carries an entertaining mock - up of what the fake passport might have looked like , reports that more details of the scam will be discussed during the Ricky Gervais Guide to Law & Order podcast .
A quick perusal of iTunes , however , suggests that this is actually the latest in the comic 's Guide To audiobooks .
An audio trailer for the upcoming audio book , where the Invention of Lying star talks about the scam , can be found on the comic 's Ricky Gervais ...

Version 0.1.1 released January 3 , 2010
I ’ve tagged and released the current sources of cl - gtk2 as version 0.1.1 .
The primary motivation for this was the recent release of closer - mop library which breaks cl - gtk2 - 0.1 by causing symbol conflicts .
Other than that , there were several bugfixes and addition of binding to most parts of Gdk , see the full changelog for details .
Robie The Robot Banker
| By
I ’m really starting to get into the Christmas spirit , if you could n’t tell .
With Christmas just days away I ’m doing all sorts of different stuff to really get me in the mood .
I was thinking about Christmases past and then I looked over and saw my old friend , the Robot Banker …
We all know Robby the Robot from Forbidden Planet , but do you recall , Robie the Robot ?
He was sold primarily at Radio Shack in the 1980 ’s and was a big holiday gift .
Whoever named him clearly was trying to play him off as some relation to the other more famous Robby , although they bare no resemblance .
Back then Christmas meant shopping at Radio Shack and this little guy was just about the coolest bank you could get .
I do n’t remember specifically what year I got Robie , but I remember thinking he was awesome .
Basically you pop a quarter ( or nickel , dime , penny , every little bit helps ! ) and Robie eats in and then stores it in his belly for safe keeping .
You can pop his bottom off and get the money out when you feel the little bugger has eaten enough change .
In hindsight , Robie really is n’t that neat .
He has one function , he ’s kinda creepy and you ca n’t really store much money in him .
Plus he ’s really loud .
Like the little motors and servers moving him sound like they could power a tank .
Still I remember being overjoyed at getting this guy when I was a kid .
Sure he was n’t like a main gift territory , but this was the kind of stuff you lived for at Christmas .
Stuff you would n’t buy yourself any other time of the year .
Robie has been in and out of storage for years and you can see he ’s more than his fair share of beat up .
So when I decided to write this little article about one of my favorite offbeat Christmas gifts , I decided to pop some batteries in him to see if he would work .
Low and behold , HE DOES work .
Although he ’s a bit possessed .
brains
I guess after all these years Robie is starving for coins and attention because once I turn him on he keeps eating even when there ’s no money in his hand .
He ’s a strange thing , he goes from pitiful , to surprised to a zombie - like beast craving morechange !
See for yourself below .
Do they still make these ?
I know TOMY sold them in Japan for a bit .
This guy also reminds me of a robot from some movie …
I ca n’t remember the name of the horror movie now , but this robot who looks a bit like Robie gets struck by lightning I think and then starts killing people .
If you know the name of that movie , respond below .
OAKLAND , Calif . -- Disgruntled Oakland Raiders fans are making a high - profile plea for owner Al Davis to step down as the team 's general manager .
The group that put up the billboard says it has gathered more than 25,000 signatures for a petition asking Al Davis to step down as GM .

A billboard was posted on the freeway near the Oakland Coliseum this week , saying " MR. DAVIS , DO THE RIGHT THING , PLEASE HIRE A GM . "
The group that put up the billboard says it has gathered more than 25,000 signatures for a petition asking Davis to step down as general manager .
The petition also calls on Davis to hire a new GM , hire a Super Bowl - caliber coach and " agree to refrain from intervention in personnel or football operational matters . "
The Raiders ( 3 - 8 ) have won three Super Bowls under Davis ' leadership but appear headed to a seventh straight losing season .
Oakland 's 27 - 80 record since the start of the 2003 season is the worst in the NFL .
We are located in the Heart of Eastlake — halfway between Fremont and the Amazon campus .
Easy access on and off I - 5 , in the midst of the Google , Tableau and Facebook campuses but also a hop , skip and jump from Expedia .
And because of the 520 Bridge , we are just as close to Microsoft and the Eastside .
The “ I - 5 North / Roanoke ” sign at the end of the 520 Bridge might as well have our firm name on it .
There is free street parking around our building on Eastlake Avenue and ( sometimes ) an open space in our parking lot .
We are an award winning group — one of America ’s Best Firms ( see our icons ) .
Let us help you regain stability .
The best way to monitor our fee structure is to look at Wolfgang Anderson ’s AVVO website , which may answer any questions you might have .
Twenty years ago , on the night of November 9 , 1989 , following weeks of pro-democracy protests , East German authorities suddenly opened their border to West Germany .
After 28 years as prisoners of their own country , euphoric East Germans streamed to checkpoints and rushed past bewildered guards , many falling tearfully into the arms of West Germans welcoming them on the other side .
Thousands of Germans and world leaders gathered in Berlin yesterday to celebrate the " Mauerfall " - the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and German reunification - and to remember the approximately 100- 200 who died attempting to cross the border over the years .
Collected here are photographs both historic and recent , from the fall of the Berlin Wall .
Be sure to pause on photos 12 - 15 , and click them to see a fade effect from before to after .

The last Ice Age razed all of the coniferous forests in Finland .
After the ice sheet retreated , trees from elsewhere –like the Scots Pine–gradually colonized the vacant niches .
On a smaller scale , the same thing happened in many high mountains of the Earth ’s temperate regions , including the Sierra Nevada Range of California .
We can learn a thing or two about climate history from Alpine dendrology .
Round Top Lake , at 9340 feet elevation in the Northern Sierra near Carson Pass , is my favorite place for informal climate history research .
Whitebark
Pine trees grow in tight clumps around the North half of the lake .
Other high altitude conifers–like Lodgepole Pine , Mountain Hemlock , and Red Fir–also grow in the Carson Pass area .
But Whitebark
Pines can grow at slightly high elevations than these other trees .
At Round Top Lake , the Whitebark Pines in any given group are nearly identical genetically , since they reproduce asexually .
New tree trunks grow outward from an existing root system .
This is called suckering .
The seeds that do sprout ca n’t endure the harsh Winters at that altitude .
Walking 100 yards downhill from the lake on the main trail , one can see Whitebark Pines that have grown in a more normal way .
Naturalist Jeffrey P. Schaffer mentioned Round Top Lake in the 1989 edition of his book , The Tahoe Sierra : A Natural History Guide to the 106 Hikes in the Northern Sierra .
Here ’s a link to a review of a more recent book by Schaffer .
http://www.amazon.com/Tahoe-Sierra-Natural-History-Northern/dp/0899972209
Question : After the last Ice Age , how did the Whitebark Pines reach the lake in the first place ?
My answer :
At some time after the last Ice Age , the Northern Hemisphere was warmer than it is these days .
The Whitebark Pines sprouted from seeds at that time , with a little avian assistance .
The Clark nutcracker helps to spread seeds from the conifers in the Carson Pass area .
The bird caches seeds that it gathers in anticipation of the Winter food shortage , but often stores more than it needs .
Some of the forgotten seeds sprout a fair distance–and even uphill–from the parent trees .
Several years ago , I was surprised to see a knee - high Whitebark Pine seedling outside the half - circle of clone clusters hugging Round Top Lake .
However it did not survive .
If the Northern Sierra climate heats up in a big way , I ’d expect individual seed - sprouted Whitebark Pines at Round Top Lake to eventually supplant the clumps of small trees .
Over the last 1000 or more years , the clones have been gradually accumulating random mutations , which should put them at a slight competitive disadvantage with any future surviving seed - sprouted progeny .
When I see a lot of isolated Whitebark Pine seedlings that grow to 6 feet in height at Round Top Lake , then I ’ll believe that the Northern Sierra climate is the warmest that it ’s been since before the last Ice Age .
Jennifer Marohasy kindly allowed me to guest - post a guest article about this preliminary investigation on her blog .
That report is similar to this one , but with less detail .
On 29 August 2009 , co-investigator James Mayeau and I visited Round Top Lake for more detailed study .
Here ’s a link to James ’ account of our exploits on that day , in a second guest - posting at Jennifer ’s blog .
http://jennifermarohasy.com/blog/2009/09/white-bark-pine-trees-part-2-a-note-from-james-mayeau/
This blog post includes a link to more of James ’ photos from Round Top Lake .
Although the overwhelming majority of Whitebark Pines at Round Top Lake were clones growing in clumps , we did manage to find a few medium - sized individual trees near the sunnier West end .
I ’m guessing that their growth rates were pretty slow , given the marginal nature of the habitat .
They probably predate the latest global warming that started in the late 1970s .
If any of the West - end trees date from the 1930s , that would be additional evidence that the last round of ’ global warming in the 80s and 90s was not a big deal , even by 20th Century standards .
A good follow - up project would be to count the growth rings in these few West - end trees , in order to determine their ages .
Alas , my academic background is in analytical chemistry ; I ’m not qualified to drill for core samples in living trees .
Studies that emphasize tree ring analysis tell parts of several different stories that Nature has woven together into the fabric of climate history .
These stories are about precipitation ( in the case of Bristlecone Pines in the semi-arid Basin and Range Region of the Western US ) , insolation , wind , and yes temperature .
Modern dendroclimatology often requires sophisticated techniques to tease out the temperature parts of tree - ring stories .
One lesson from the recent Keith Briffa controversy :
In modern - dendroclimatology - based climate history studies , the methodological uncertainties stemming from sampling error , inter alia , are huge .
On the other hand , Seat - of - the - Pants Dendroclimatology ( SPDC ) emphasizes straightforward early 20th Century technology : shoeleather , cameras , maps , field guides , and optional hand - operated tree - boring devices .
The key insight of SPDC :
For a given topography , temperature is the single unambiguous control variable that governs tree reproduction mode just below Alpine timberline .
When clumps of clone trees dominate the landscape there , one can be certain that the climate was appreciably warmer at some time in the past .
Side note .
At timberline in the Northern Sierra , it is difficult to find Whitebark Pines in the form of trees ; instead they typically grow as Alpine shrubs–known as krummholz .
This is the subject of ongoing climate - related investigation by other researchers .
http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/programs/snrc/climate_landscape/high_elevation_sub1/genetic_variability.shtml
Summary .
In the Northern Sierra , Seat - of - the - Pants Dendroclimatology can give a more accurate indication of pivotal warming events in Earth ’s geologically recent climate history than can modern dendroclimatology .
In terms of the debate surrounding the ‘ unprecedented ’ global warming of the late 20th Century , Round Top Lake is ‘ the elephant in the room ’ .

January 25 , 2010 — Restructure !
Another example of white privilege and othering is when white people assume that racialized people have deeper roots and stronger family ties than white people .
The othering is based on the notion that “ non-white ” people are foreign people , and that “ non-white ” people have a stronger ethnic identity because we are more homogeneous and monolithic in ways of thought .
White privilege allows white people to ignore the ways in which a white - majority society encourages only white families to lay down their roots and blossom , while historically , it enacted laws to extinguish and suppress “ non-white ” and racialized families .
White Americans envy African Americans for having “ roots ” in “ Africa ” , while ignoring the fact that Africa is a heterogeneous continent ( like Europe ) , and that most African Americans cannot trace their African ancestry precisely because of white racism and slavery .
It is no accident that African Americans are more likely to find documents attesting to the existence of their white ancestors .
White Americans whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations are the ones with the deepest roots , the ones whose histories were allowed to be recorded , the ones who own property passed down from generations , when all this was denied to non-white people .
White people envy Native Americans and Aboriginal Canadians for having “ culture ” , while ignoring the fact that white racism and colonialism committed genocide against millions of indigenous peoples , and systematically stamped out most of their cultures with government - sanctioned forced assimilation .
Residential schools in Canada ensured that indigenous children lost their languages , cultures , religions , and family ties , while ensuring the proliferation of the English language , Western European culture , white - messiah Christianity , and white institutions , until as recently as 1996 .
In the United States , these were called Indian boarding schools , and enrollment peaked in the 1970s .
White people envy Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians for being “ connected ” to “ ancient Japan ” , when it is precisely this insistence that Asians are perpetual foreigners that led to the internment of Japanese Americans and Canadians during World War II .
American and Canadian governments confiscated the property of people of Japanese descent , such that their family heirlooms could not be passed down to their descendants like family heirlooms were passed down the generations of white families .
White people who have been in North America for multiple generations can open up their grandparents ’ original attics to find tokens of family history , while most Americans and Canadians of Japanese descent do not have their grandparents ’ original attics , because of racism and their lack of white privilege .
When white people wish that they were “ ethnic ” and cite the “ roots ” , “ culture ” , or “ family history ” of ethnic minorities as the point of envy , their thinking is privileged and fantastical to the extreme , as if their concept of people of colour is wholly constructed by fictional archetypes of the Magical Negro , Noble Savage , and Oriental Wiseman .
For example , a white person commenting on Stuff White People Do : wish they were “ ethnic ” wrote the following :
I am so fragmented that I have no idea really what cultural traditions I might have spawned from … so to me I am just American who grew up on mac and cheese with hotdogs .
I assume a lot white people feel similar to me in the sense that our ethnicity has been so diluted you almost feel void of a past beyond your immediate family . [… ]
I have a few friends who are very rich in their culture , be it Italian , Greek , Japanese , etc and I do somewhat envy the warm sense of oneness they seem to enjoy through a rich tradition of food , celebration , and language that has been [ passed ] down to them from generations past .
I feel like they have a story with roots .
( Note that even when people of colour grow up on mac and cheese with hotdogs , white people still perceive us as “ other ” on account of our race , and not as culturally “ American ” ( or Canadian ) as white people . )
Compare this white person ’s envy with the reality of many Chinese Americans :
Odder still , their father claimed to be an only son , with no surviving relatives in China or America .
“ For us , the question was always ‘ so who are you anyway ? ’ ” Steve said .
“ There was the sense that you have no past . ” [ … ]
But the legacy of the Chinese Exclusion Act and the paper son phenomenon lingers .
The result is that a younger generation of Chinese Americans like Steve Yee grew up confused about and disconnected from their family history . [ … ]
Worried about Lillie ’s progress in school , their father insisted the others stop speaking Chinese at home .
Today , none of the six children speaks Chinese .
“ Basically we were told to put down your chopsticks , we ’re going to eat hot dogs and watch the Giants like everybody else , ” Yee said . [… ]
For her own children ’s sake , Yee ’s sister Lillie Yee -Shiroi , 61 , also wanted to learn more about her father ’s life and family history .
There was so much basic information they did n’t know .
What was her father ’s real birth date ?
When did he arrive in San Francisco ?
On what boat ?
“ When my son was in fifth grade he had to do a family history project and make a family tree , ” recalled Yee - Shiroi , a retired social worker who married a Japanese American .
“ On my husband ’s side there were all these relatives .
On my side , besides my brothers and sisters , there was question mark , question mark , question mark . ”
The white privilege of white people , especially those of multi-generational descent , allowed them to have deep roots to their family , culture , and history .
At the same time , white racism directly caused the erasure of racialized people ’s pasts .
Ironically , white people act as if racialized people have “ ethnic ” privilege , when what white people envy — roots — are exactly what white people have more than us .
Roots , culture , and family history are benefits of white privilege , not “ ethnic ” privilege .

The mere fact that there will be votes in the Assembly to regulate and control the sale and distribution of marijuana would have been unthinkable even one year ago .
And if the bill does n't pass this year , it will soon .
Or , the bill will be irrelevant because the voters will have passed the measure to regulate and tax marijuana that will be on the ballot this November .
A group of police officers , judges and prosecutors who fought in the failed " war on drugs " is cheering this Tuesday 's upcoming marijuana legalization votes in the California Assembly 's Public Safety and Health committees as a sign of increasing public frustration with the harms caused by prohibition and the widespread desire for a new approach .
Judge Jim Gray , who retired last year from the California Superior Court in Orange County and is a speaker for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) said , " The mere fact that there will be votes in the Assembly to regulate and control the sale and distribution of marijuana would have been unthinkable even one year ago .
And if the bill does n't pass this year , it will soon .
Or , the bill will be irrelevant because the voters will have passed the measure to regulate and tax marijuana that will be on the ballot this November . "
Judge Gray testified at an informational hearing on marijuana legalization in the Assembly 's Public Safety Committee last October .
Video is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDKarCeC_Ic
On Tuesday , January 12 , the Public Safety Committee will conduct a formal hearing on Assemblyman Tom Ammiano 's marijuana legalization bill , AB 390 .
Following the hearing the committee will vote and , if the bill is approved , there will then be a second hearing and vote in the Health Committee .
Separately , marijuana legalization advocates recently announced that they have collected enough signatures to place an initiative on the ballot this November that will allow California voters to end marijuana prohibition .
Elsewhere , legislators in Washington State are also holding a hearing on marijuana legalization this week and the Rhode Island Senate is currently conducting a blue ribbon commission overview of that state 's marijuana laws .
Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) is a 15,000 - member organization representing police , prosecutors , judges , FBI / DEA agents and others from around the world who want to legalize and regulate all drugs after fighting on the front lines of the " war on drugs " and learning firsthand that prohibition only serves to worsen addiction and violence .

To all the people , who cry " WACHSTUM !
WACHSTUM ! WACHSTUM ! ( growth ! ) " all the time .
Please open your eyes and see , how the world has changed .
Not only the internet , but also automation made enormous changes to the " workplace " .
Why do the people yelling for growth all the time ?
Yes , because growth should result in work .
Well , that was true in history .
But look at this :
1952
2009
Also look at this home - automator - robot from Fanuc .
The only thing to think about on the present is money and work .
And how to deal and distribute with it .
Not necessarily growth !
Let 's change the direction of thinking !

Skill Challenge : Holiday Shopping
‘ Tis the season for giving and receiving gifts .
Regardless of your personal or religious reasons for celebrating during the holiday season , everyone likes getting gifts .
This is no secret to retail merchants .
They know that you ’ll be shopping for everyone on your list at this time of year and they want you to spend , spend , spend .
Shopping for Christmas presents can be a lot of hard , grueling work .
It ’s the part of the holidays that I like the least .
So I decided to look at a challenging , real life situation through my D&D coloured glasses ( as I so often do ) .
A few months ago we put together a skill challenge called Battle for the Remote .
It ’s in that same vein that I present a holiday themed , real life skill challenge called Holiday Shopping .
Do n’t forget to enter the Dungeon ’s Master Design a Holiday Dungeon Content .
This skill challenge is a little bit outside the box , but it would still qualify ( if I was n’t one of the judges ) .
Enter today .
Setup
There are n’t many shopping days left until Christmas .
You ’ve still got to pick up gifts for numerous people on your list .
Priority should go to your wife ’s gift if you know what ’s good for you .
Complexity

Thievery ( hard DC )
Use of Thievery to steal gifts results in automatic failure of the skill challenge .
Even if the check is successful you ’ve ruined the original purpose for the gift giving .
You should feel deep shame .
Success
You did it .
You got gifts for everyone on your list .
You ’re happy to be done and you know they ’ll be happy to get these gifts .
Another holiday shopping season is over .
Failure
You could n’t find the gift you wanted and had to settle for something not on the list .
It could go either way , but you ’re pretty sure the outcome wo n’t be great .
Worse yet , you got everything on the list but grossly misjudged someone ’s desire to own that particular gift .
Better luck next year .

Aalif Surti and Aditi Shedde are making news because of the birth of their child .
The reason ?
According to Mohammed Wajihuddin of The Times of India , they refuse to list a religious identity for him :
It was n’t a spur - of - the - moment decision .
“ A few months into my pregnancy , we had decided that we would not give our child any religious identity , ” says Aditi .
“ We are not against religion , but who are we to choose a religion on our baby ’s behalf ?
We will expose him to the values of different faiths and cultures , and when he grows up he will be free to follow any faith — or none if he wishes . ”
Sounds perfectly sensible … but they ’re getting shit for not labeling him .
Indian birth certificates require you to list some form of religious identification :
The couple had almost hit a dead end .
There were four choices on the form — Hindu , Muslim , Christian and Others .
Aditi says she did not want any of them for her child , as even Others required them to identify the sect or community .
She argued with the officer some more and finally agreed on Others , but without any identification .
“ Others is just to facilitate the generation of the certificate .
We know our child has no religion , ” she says .
They ’ll have to deal with the issue later on , when the child enrolls in school or applies for a passport , but the couple says they ’re prepared for the fight .
The upside to all this is that other Indian parents will be able to follow in their footsteps , perhaps with a little less hassle next time .
With each set of parents who follows suit , this will become a non -issue over time .
The whole practice is ridiculous , though .
This is precisely what Richard Dawkins and the British Humanist Association are referring to with their “ Do n’t Label Me ” campaign .
No children know what religion they want to follow ( or whether they want to abandon it altogether ) and it ’s a form of brainwashing for any parents to stick a set of made - up beliefs onto a child who does n’t know any better .
With Dragon Age : Origins releasing this week I was reading up on the game ’s features and details when I came across Dragon Age Journeys : The Deep Road .
To quote the site , “ Dragon Age Journeys , a free to play browser based game set in the Dragon Age world , will be available Oct 22nd .
Dragon
Age Journeys puts players in the role of a hero exploring the underground dwarven kingdom of Orzammar .
Players will uncover a dastardly plot that threatens to unleash a great evil that wont stop until it destroys all living things .
Based on BioWares upcoming dark fantasy epic Dragon Age : Origins , Dragon Age Journeys sets a new standard of quality for browser - based games with addictive combat mechanics and fluid gameplay .
Players of Dragon Age Journeys will have the chance to earn exclusive in game content for Dragon Age : Origins on the day of its release . ”
The part that got my attention in there was the ability to earn in game content for Dragon Age Origins .
So , I logged in with my EA Account created a knight type fighter .
I started playing and after about 90 minutes I had two of the three items unlocked for when I play Dragon Age Origins .
The three pieces you get are an amulet , a belt , and a helmet .
From the looks of their stats they are not that great , but they probably are a bit better than your starting equipment .
If you ’re playing just for the unlocks be sure to read the details of how to get each one because one of them has multiple components and you can miss parts of it if you are not careful .
After I unlocked the first two items I actually wanted to keep playing .
My knight / soldier was just starting to get some good weapons , attacks , and squad mates .
The Deep Roads is just the first portion of the Dragon Age Journeys story and it was about 3 and a half hours before I made it to the end .
I ’m sure I could do it much faster if I were to play again or play on an easier difficulty but where is the fun in that .
I found the story pretty interesting and I ’m looking forward to when they release the next portion of Dragon Age Journeys so I can pick up where things left off .
For a flash game it is surprisingly deep .
They have almost all of the normal RPG elements you would expect from a a full game and a couple nice little extra they could add because it is web based .
Like the quick travel option , which came in handy more than once when I wanted to go back to town to get more potions sell unwanted equipment .
I would just quick travel to town , do my shopping , and then quick travel back to the area I was at before .
It takes you to the entrance of the area and not to the exact spot you left but the areas are not so big that it was an issue .
The side bar is also a useful addition .
You can use it to pull up statistics in the left frame of the screen without interrupting the game .
They have that portion set aside for achievement details , slain statistics , and quest info .
Overall the interface is nicely down and it is laid out just like the screen shots I ’ve seen for Dragon Age Origins .
The one thing I found annoying about the Dragon Age Journeys was the movement .
You click the mouse where you want to move on the screen and your characters move there automatically .
Hold down the mouse and it keeps moving .
Pretty standard stuff , but because of how the levels are laid out there are not a lot of strait paths .
Combine this with the speed of the movement and I seemed to always be running my characters into walls if I tried to move by holding down the mouse .
Part of that could be because I was playing on a laptop screen so it is possible if I had been playing on my normal desktop monitor I would not have had this issue since I would have more screen real estate to work with .

Something really big : Sequoia source code , free to download and study , no NDAs .

Folks , you 'll love this .
Sequoia blew it on a public records response .
We ( basically EDA ) have election databases from Riverside County that Sequoia insisted on " redacting " first , for which we paid cold cash .
They appear instead to have just vandalized the data as valid databases by stripping the MS - SQL header data off , assuming that would stop us cold .
They were wrong .
The Linux " strings " command was able to peel it apart .
Nedit was able to digest 800 meg text files .
What was revealed was thousands of lines of MS - SQL source code that appears to control or at least influence the logical flow of the election , in violation of a bunch of clauses in the FEC voting system rulebook banning interpreted code , machine modified code and mandating hash checks of voting system code .
I 've got it all organized for commentary and download in wiki form at :
http://studysequoia.wikispaces.com/
This is the first time we can legally study a voting system 's innards without NDAs or court - ordered secrecy .
Join the fun :) .
First goal is to prove that Sequoia did in fact vandalize the data files by stripping the MS - SQL headers - if so that will affect other public records inquiries against Sequoia .
Second goal : what does the code do , what are the security implications , is it as big a violation of the FEC rulebook as it appears ?
Thanks ,
Jim March
To follow on Chris 's post yesterday , I want to point out that a lot of activists have been insisting that there 's a Nixon - esque " secret plan " in the works - only not to end the Vietnam War , but to make the health care bill radically better than the gutted carcass that passed the U.S. Senate in December .
In general , I do n't believe in the Secret Pony Plan Theory ( ie . the theory that says that when any politician we 're supposed to love does something awful , it 's actually part of a secret 15 - dimensional plan to do something awesome ) - never have , never will .
Politicians do things because they are forced to do things , not out of the goodness of their own hearts , and if there ever is a secret plan , it 's usually to pull one over on the public .
As it relates specifically to health care , I especially do n't believe there 's a secret plan to make the bill better in conference committee for two reasons .
First and foremost , it 's a good rule of thumb that from a progressive perspective , most bills get worse - not better - in conference committee .
These negotiations are where lobbyists have their most influence , because much of the wheeling and dealing is done through winks and nods , and because everyone knows the final product is an inexorably moving train that both chambers will likely pass .
I defy you to name more than a few bills that have gotten markedly better - rather than markedly worse - in a conference committee .
Second , if there is any hope of making a bill better in conference committee , that hope relies on the conference committee negotiations actually being open to the public .
But that 's not guaranteed - not even close .
Sure , there is always a final conference committee vote - but the real , most pivotal work of ironing out the different bills can be done behind closed doors .
On many conference bills , the one party in control holds secret meetings , and then all the public gets to see is one two - minute vote for final - passage and that 's it .
This does n't have to be the way it 's done - and in many cases it is n't ( I spent many a long night in contentious and controversial Appropriations conference committees when I worked on the Hill - and they were public ) .
But on health care , it looks like the closed - door approach is now the way forward , according to some stenography by The New Republic 's Jonathan Cohn :
According to a pair of senior Capitol Hill staffers , one from each chamber , House and Senate Democrats are " almost certain " to negotiate informally rather than convene a formal conference committee .
Doing so would allow Democrats to avoid a series of procedural steps -- not least among them , a series of special motions in the Senate , each requiring a vote with full debate .
Cohn , regurgitating his Democratic sources ' spin without so much as a question , couches this turn of events as wonderful news because it will disenfranchise congressional Republicans and expedite the process .
It 's a classic authoritarian argument .
And as I wrote in a San Francisco Chronicle piece about American Czarism way back at the beginning of 2009 , I 'm someone who believes in democracy - so I 'm not inclined to cheer at anyone 's disenfranchisement ( I know , that sets me apart from the cynical and partisan DC chattering class ) .
That 's particularly true when when said disenfranchisement impacts not just the GOP , but also rank - and - file progressives .
You see , if there was even a tiny chance this bill was going to get better in conference committee , that chance was , in part , reliant on progressive pressure on an open process .
Ya know , pressuring individual conferees on specific amendments , etc .
But if the conference negotiations take place in secret , that progressive public pressure is far harder to muster and to appropriately target .
This is probably why Progressive Caucus leader Rep. Raul Grijalva ( D - AZ ) is none too pleased about the news .
I still remember the good ole days when President Obama promised to make sure that all the health care negotiations would be televised on C - SPAN .
I did n't think that would happen ( although I was hoping he 'd try ) , but I did think there would be at least a modicum of transparency in this process .
That we 've gone from promising all negotiations would be televised for everyone to see to potentially a situation where the final , most important negotiations are locked behind closed doors is sad - not just from an objective transparency / democracy perspective , but , as you can see , from a progressive final - legislative - product perspective .

Django tips : laying out an application
Continuing the theme of dealing with common questions from the Django mailing lists and IRC channel , today we ’ll look at how to organize the various bits of a Django - based project or application .
Projects versus applications
This is really more of a separate ( though related ) question , but understanding the distinction Django draws between a “ project ” and an “ application ” is a big part of good code layout .
Roughly speaking , this is what the two terms mean :
An application tries to provide a single , relatively self - contained set of related functions .
An application is allowed to define a set of models ( though it does n’t have to ) and to define and register custom template tags and filters ( though , again , it does n’t have to ) .
tries to provide a single , relatively self - contained set of related functions .
An application is allowed to define a set of models ( though it does n’t have to ) and to define and register custom template tags and filters ( though , again , it does n’t have to ) .
A project is a collection of applications , installed into the same database , and all using the same settings file .
In a sense , the defining aspect of a project is that it supplies a settings file which specifies the database to use , the applications to install , and other bits of configuration .
A project may correspond to a single web site , but does n’t have to — multiple projects can run on the same site .
The project is also responsible for the root URL configuration , though in most cases it ’s useful to just have that consist of calls to include which pull in URL configurations from inidividual applications .
Views , custom manipulators , custom context processors and most other things Django lets you create can all be defined either at the level of the project or of the application , and where you do that should depend on what ’s most effective for you ; in general , though , they ’re best placed inside an application ( this increases their portability across projects ) .
Default project - level file layout
When you run django - admin.py startproject , Django will automatically create a new directory containing four files :
__init__.py , which will be empty .
This file is required to tell Python that the directory is a Python module and can be imported ( and imported from ) .
, which will be empty .
This file is required to tell Python that the directory is a Python module and can be imported ( and imported from ) .
manage.py , which provides a number of convenience functions for working with the project .
, which provides a number of convenience functions for working with the project .
settings.py , which will be the project ’s settings file .
, which will be the project ’s settings file .
urls.py , which will be the project ’s root URL configuration .
Generally you do n’t need to modify this layout , and for compatibility and consistency it ’s probably best if you do n’t .
If you do want to change things , though , here ’s what it ’s safe to do :
You can put your settings in a file that ’s not called settings.py —
Django finds out where your settings are by looking at the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE , not by looking for a file with a specific name .
— Django finds out where your settings are by looking at the environment variable , not by looking for a file with a specific name .
You can put your root URL configuration somewhere that ’s not called urls .
py — Django looks at the ROOT_URLCONF setting to find out where your URL configuration lives .
manage.py and __init__.py should be left alone .
Default application - level file layout
When you run manage .
py startapp , Django creates a sub- directory of your project directory , and creates the following files :
__init__.py , which serves the same purpose as at the project level .
, which serves the same purpose as at the project level .
models.py , which should hold the application ’s model classes .
, which should hold the application ’s model classes .
views.py , which is for any custom views the application wants to provide .
The __init__.py and models .py files ( or , if you want to split up your models across multiple files , a directory called models which can act as a Python module ) are required ; without __init__.py , Python wo n’t be able to import from the application , and Django is hard - wired to expect models in a file or module called models .
The views .
py file , however , is optional and you can delete it if you wo n’t be providing any views , or rename it if you want to call it something else ( though for sake of consistency it ’s probably best not to rename it ) .
Extra special stuff
There are four “ special ” locations inside your application which can be used in order to take advantage of specific features , so if you want to use these features you do n’t have a whole lot of choice in how you set them up :
To define custom template tags or filters , you must create a sub- directory in the application ’s directory called templatetags , and it must contain a file named __init__.py so that it can be imported as a Python module .
To define unit tests which will automatically be noticed by Django ’s testing framework , put them in a module called tests ( which can be either a file named tests .
py or a directory called tests ) .
The testing framework will also find any doctests in that module , but the preferred place for those is , of course , the docstrings of the classes or functions they ’re designed to test .
To provide custom SQL which will be executed immediately after your application is installed , create a sub - directory called sql inside the application ’s directory ; the file names should be the same as the names of the models whose tables they ’ll operate on ; for example , if you have an app named weblog containing a model named Entry , then the file sql / entry.
sql inside the app ’s directory can be used to modify or insert data into the entries table as soon as it ’s been created .
To provide custom Python functions which will run when the application is installed , put them in a file named management .py , and use Django ’s internal dispatcher to connect your functions to the post_syncdb signal .
That last one deserves a bit more explanation , so let ’s look at it in detail .
Internally , Django uses a package called PyDispatcher to enable its various bits to communicate cleanly with each other .
Basically , the dispatcher works like this :
Various parts of Django , as well as other applications , define plain objects called “ signals ” .
Code which wants other things to be notified of something happening tells the dispatcher to send a particular signal .
Code which wants to be notified when something happens uses the dispatcher ’s connect method to listen for a particular signal .
For example , if you wanted to set up a function which would execute any time a new application is installed , you could create a file in your application called management .
py , and put this code in it :
from django .
dispatch import dispatcher from django.db.models import signals def my_syncdb_func ( ) : # put your code here ... dispatcher .
connect ( my_syncdb_func , signal = signals .
post_syncdb )
Several of the applications bundled with Django use this trick to do various things :
django.contrib.sites listens to find out when it ’s been installed , and creates the default “ example.com ” site object , which is needed for the admin to function .
listens to find out when it ’s been installed , and creates the default “ example.com ” site object , which is needed for the admin to function .
django.contrib.contenttypes listens for any new apps being installed , and creates new ContentType instances for all the models being installed .
listens for any new apps being installed , and creates new instances for all the models being installed .
django.contrib.auth listens on two fronts : when the auth app is installed , it prompts you to create a superuser , and when any new app is installed , it creates permissions for that app ’s models .
This works because the syncdb function in manage .
py imports the management files from all the installed and soon - to - be - installed apps in your project ; that makes sure any app which needs to can take advantage of the dispatcher .
Other useful conventions
Of course , that does n’t cover all the things you might want to do within Django , so naturally people end up wondering how they should organize the rest of their code .
Generally there ’s no need to require standardized layouts or locations for certain functions , but it can be helpful to adhere to a few conventions .
So to provide an example , here ’s how I generally lay out any additional bits I need in things that I ’m working on .
At the project level , I generally do n’t add a whole lot ; it ’s rare that I need to do something that does n’t make more sense as part of an application .
However , if you ’re going to be running multiple projects which all use some or all of the same applications , it can be useful to organize your settings carefully .
Jacob has , once or twice , pointed out the trick that we use at the Journal - World , and I think it ’s fairly useful : we have our code base in one directory structure , and settings files in another , with a “ default ” settings file at the top level of the settings tree .
Settings files for individual sites import the default settings and override anything they need to , or add any extra settings they require .
Because Django does n’t require settings files to live in the same directory tree as the applications their projects use , this is extremely easy and extremely useful to do .
At the application level , I usually drop in a few more files depending on exactly what the application is going to be using :
If the application defines any custom manipulators , I put them in a file called forms .py instead of in the views file .
instead of in the views file .
If there are multiple custom managers in the app , I put them in a file called managers .py instead of the models file .
instead of the models file .
If I ’m defining any custom context processors , I put them in a file called context_processors.py .
.
If I ’m setting up any custom dispatcher signals , they go in a file called signals.py .
.
If the application is setting up any syndication feeds , the feed classes go in a file called feeds.py .
Similarly , sitemap classes go in sitemaps.py .
.
Similarly , sitemap classes go in .
Middleware classes go in a file called middleware .py .
.
Any miscellaneous code which does n’t clearly go anywhere else goes in a file or module called utils .
I do n’t always use all of that functionality in an app , but if I do it ’s nice to have a convention for it , so that I only need to remember to do from appname import forms or from appname import feeds .
And one more thing …
This is something I ’m still in the process of developing , but I also like to have an easy way to test the dependencies my applications have , and to make sure everything is configured properly .
The easiest way to do this , in my experience , is to put some code in the application ’s __init__.py which checks for everything the application will need .
I wrote up a simple example in a post on the Django developers list , and I ’m still working on improving that ; there are functions tucked away in django.
core .
management which will let you test not only whether an application can be imported and is listed in the INSTALLED_APPS setting , but whether it ’s actually been installed into the database .
How do you do it ?
I think I ’ve covered everything I know of , and every trick I use , for laying out a Django project or application cleanly ; if you see something here you like , feel free to start using it .
And if I ’ve overlooked something cool that you know of , please post it in a comment and let the world know about it :)
James
Bond does not make an appearance until Part Two of what is perhaps his most polished adventure , From Russia with Love .
And when he has been briefed by M and outfitted by Q , and told what is expected of him , he suffers a mild mid-life crisis .
What , he asks as the plane takes him towards the Golden Horn , would his younger self think of the man now so " tarnished with years of treachery and ruthlessness and fear " , sent off " to pimp for England " ?
Eventually dismissing this as an idle or feeble mood , he reflects further :
" What - might - have - been was a waste of time .
Follow your fate and be satisfied with it , and be glad not to be a second - hand motor salesman , or a yellow - press journalist , pickled in gin and nicotine , or a cripple - or dead . "
Yes , well , that seems to put the profession nicely in its place , and indeed in its context .
I read those words when I was a schoolboy in Cambridge in the early 1960s and had already decided that only journalism would do .
Not long afterwards , I was strolling along Tenison Road and saw , I swear , a wheezing second - or even third - hand motor belching towards me .
Behind its wheel sat a man of impossibly fly - blown and lugubrious appearance ; his skin sallow and wrinkled , an unfiltered cigarette in his mouth ; his eyes like piss - holes in the snow .
Only one detail was required to complete the scene , and at first my disordered senses almost refused to register it .
Stuck in the corner of his windscreen was a faint and tattered card that read " PRESS " .
It was yellow all right .
It might as well have been stuck in the band of his hat .
Christ knows where he had been - perhaps to a bad day at the Newmarket races - but it took little imagination to see where he was bound .
And this was not a Giles cartoon but a glimpse of the future I thought I wanted .
I cheered up immensely .
Clichés and caricatures are there to be overcome , after all .
And I had my Orwell books to go back to .
Not much later , I came across Orwell 's essay " Confessions of a Book Reviewer " .
It opens thus , in case you may have forgotten :
" In a cold but stuffy bed - sitting room littered with cigarette ends and half - empty cups of tea , a man in a moth - eaten dressing - gown sits at a rickety table , trying to find room for his typewriter among the piles of dusty papers that surround it .
He cannot throw the papers away because the wastepaper basket is already overflowing , and besides , somewhere among the unanswered letters and unpaid bills it is possible that there is a cheque for two guineas which he is nearly certain he forgot to pay into the bank ...
He is a man of thirty - five , but looks fifty .
He is bald , has varicose veins and wears spectacles , or would wear them if his only pair were not chronically lost .
If things are normal with him he will be suffering from malnutrition , but if he has recently had a lucky streak he will be suffering from a hangover . "
Orwell of course could be discouragingly pessimistic at times .
But for light relief there was always Evelyn Waugh , who in his Decline and Fall had taught me that even original sin could have its lighter side .
What could be funnier than the school sports - day at Dr Fagan 's awful Molesworth - like establishment at Llanabba ?
The arrangements are being made :
" Admirable !
And then there is the Press .
We must ring up the Flint and Denbigh Herald and get them to send a photographer .
That means whisky .
Will you see to that , Philbrick ?
I remember at one of our sports I omitted to offer whisky to the Press , and the result was a most unfortunate photograph .
" Boys do get into such indelicate positions during the obstacle race , do n't they ? "
A picture appeared to be emerging here .
In the opening pages of Scoop , as William Boot is still in the train from Somerset to London and as yet has no idea what awaits him at the offices of the Daily Beast , he recalls that :
" He had once seen in Taunton a barely intelligible film about newspaper life in New York where neurotic men in shirt - sleeves and eye - shades had rushed from telephone to tape - machines , insulting and betraying one another in circumstances of unredeemed squalor . "
Could this squalor ever be redeemed ?
Perhaps not by one of my other favourite standbys , Graham Greene , who sent Hale of the Daily Messenger down to Brighton for the day , there to pass his time in hucksterism and fatuity , " drinking gins and tonics wherever his programme allowed " :
" For he had to stick closely to a programme : from ten till eleven Queen 's Road and Castle Square , from eleven till twelve the Aquarium and Palace Pier , twelve till one the front between the Old Ship and West Pier , back for lunch between one and two in any restaurant he chose round the Castle square , and after that he had to make his way all down the parade to the West pier and then to the station by the Hove streets .
These were the limits of his absurd and well - advertised sentry - go . "
( And so much of journalism is the " sentry go " : the stake - out , the hand - out , the lobby correspondents attending on their " source " who knows as well as they do when the deadline is coming .
Hale and the Daily Messenger are doomed to miss the only real story of the day , which is Hale murdered in broad daylight by having a stick of hard rock jammed down his throat : an apposite revenge upon the idle and the spoon - fed . )
Enough , perhaps , of the Catholic school of fiction .
I graduated to the cool and elegant universe of Anthony Powell , in whose world the influence of the newspapers is relatively minimal .
In fact , as it now seems to me , the absence of this influence is a limitation on his claim to have been describing English social reality .
Surely Sir Magnus Donners , that tycoon of 1930s tycoons , should have been the ambitious and manipulative proprietor of at least one Fleet Street title ?
When Powell gets round to it , though , as he does in the 10th of his 12 - novel cycle , he does not stint .
Here is the port - soaked " Books " Bagshaw , in Books Do Furnish a Room :
" He possessed that opportune facility for turning out several thousand words on any subject whatever at the shortest possible notice : politics : sport : books : finance : science : art : fashion - as he himself said , " War , Famine , Pestilence or Death on a Pale Horse " .
All were equal when it came to Bagshaw 's typewriter .
He would take on anything , and - to be fair - what he produced , even off the cuff , was no worse than what was to be read most of the time .
You never wondered how on earth the stuff had ever managed to be printed . "
Bagshaw 's gift for non-specialisation is further emphasised a little later on , when he hears a saloon - bar criticism of the Woman 's Page from an irate X Trapnel :
" Do n't breathe a word against the Woman 's Page , Trappy .
Many a time I 've proffered advice on it myself under a female pseudonym . "
And this only sent me back to Evelyn Waugh and The Loved One , in which the repulsive Jake Slump , wreathed in the fumes of a bar - fly and chain - smoker , is a veteran of the agony advice column " Aunt Lydia 's Post Bag " .
A few themes seem to be emerging from the way in which our novelists have treated our journalists : copious gin ( or whisky , or port , or what you will ) , mediocrity , cynicism , sloth , and meanness of spirit .
This is to say nothing of the greatest of all les déformations professionelles : shameless and indeed boastful fabrication .
And I entirely forgot to mention the fiddling of expenses .
All professions are deformed by this , of course , but only journalism has made a code out of it :
" Mr Salter saw he was not making his point clear .
" Take a single example , " he said .
" Supposing you want to have dinner .
Well , you go to a restaurant and do yourself proud , best of everything .
Bill perhaps may be two pounds .
Well , you put down five pounds for entertainment on your expenses .
You 've had a slap - up dinner , you 're three pounds to the good , and everyone is satisfied . "
( Evelyn Waugh : Scoop ) .
" Various members of the staff emerged from Hand and Ball Passage during the last dark hour of the morning , walked with an air of sober responsibility towards the main entrance , greeted the commissionaire and vanished upstairs in the lift to telephone their friends and draw their expenses before going out again to have lunch . "
( Michael Frayn : Towards the End of the Morning ) .
An absolutely brilliant dead - pan account of the expenses racket is also given in Philip Norman 's marvellous novel of the Sunday Times in the late 60s : Everyone 's Gone to the Moon .
This is the only rival to Frayn since Waugh .
Frayn's Towards the End of the Morning , first published in 1967 , used to have the status of a cult book among the hacks ( as we all agree to call ourselves ) .
It does have more or less everything : the white - haired and burned - out old soak who can only reminisce about forgotten , bibulous trips with forgotten , bibulous stars of old Fleet Street : the bullying , self - loathing pictures editor who insists on how self - made he is ; the dreamy assistant scribe who only wants to write book reviews for the New Statesman on the side ( that dates it a bit : in those days the NS had a literary editor and was literate ) ; the neurotic deputy editor who can't keep up the supply of pre-digested columns entitled " In Years Gone By " , or hold his rural clergymen contributors to their deadlines .
( In the latter respect , there is something of a lift from William Boot 's " Lush Places " countryman column in Scoop . )
There was always , also , an interest in guessing whether Frayn had " set " it all at either the Observer or the Guardian , which in those days were separate institutions .
( Malcolm Muggeridge 's journalism novel Picture Palace had been too transparent in this regard , enraging his employers , the then - Manchester Guardian management , who obtained an injunction preventing its publication . )
In the introduction to the new edition , Frayn says that it was a touch of both .
The paper is never given a name , but it 's in any case obviously not the Observer because it comes out every day .
A possible clue , for addicts and cognoscenti , is contained on the very cover of the new edition which drops an entire word out of the title of the novel , and rather metaphysically offers it as Towards the End of Morning .
The Guardian is no longer so celebrated for its misprints but there will always be those of us who are nostalgic for the days when it was , and when the opera critic Phillip Hope Wallace , for example , could wake up to find that he had reviewed last night 's Covent Garden performance of Doris Godunov .
Admirers of Frayn 's second novel are sneered at by those of us who are in the know , and who appreciate that it is his first novel about journalism that really demonstrates his genius .
In The Tin Men , published in 1965 , there are some boozers and louts and misfits , to be sure .
But the brilliance of the thing lay in its attempt to reduce the business of hackery to an exact formula .
At a demented research institute named for William Morris , eager eyes gaze at a computer that can handle UHL , or " Unit Headline Language " .
A survey is conducted , in which people are shown the random headlines :
ROW HOPE MOVE FLOP
LEAK DASH SHOCK
HATE BAN BID PROBE
A total of 86.4 % of those responding say that they understand the headlines , though of this total a depressing number cannot quite say why .
Thus the search must go on .
Would people like to read about air - crashes with children 's toys in the wreckage , or without children 's toys in the wreckage ?
In the case of a murder of a woman , should the victim be naked or partially clad ?
Frayn re-summons the tones of old Fleet Street into this laboratory of shame , when the questing researcher Goldwasser is brusquely accosted by his vile assistant Nobbs : " ' Do you prefer a female corpse to be naked , or to be clad in underclothes ? ' he repeated to Goldwasser .
' That 's what I call a good question , mate .
That 's what I call a good question . ' "
How shall we know the cultural mayhem wrought by thinking in headlines ?
Philip Roth 's Portnoy does it all the time , as he guiltily imagines how his foulness would be rendered on the front page .
When a Wasp girl will not administer him a blow - job for fear of suffocation , for example : JEW SMOTHERS DEB WITH COCK : Vassar Grad Georgetown Strangulation Victim ; Mocky Lawyer Held .
The habit breaks out fairly mildly in Scoop , where all the genius goes into the reporter 's cables that are now a thing of the past ( " LOVELY SPRING WEATHER BUBONIC PLAGUE RAGING " ) .
In Decline and Fall , a lazy journalist comes to interview the mad architect Dr Silenus at Margot Beste - Chetwynde 's country home , and " happily " visualises as he talks : " Peer 's Sister - in - Law Mansion Builder On Future of Architecture . "
In Brideshead Revisited , for that matter , debutantes shriek at the headline " Marquis 's Son Unused to Wine . "
In one movie version of Hecht and MacArthur 's The Front Page , Walther Matthau sees the condemned man 's distraught girlfriend launch herself from a window and barely breaks off to mutter : " Shady Lady Leaps for Love , " thus anticipating the New York Post 's " Headless Body in Topless Bar " by some two decades .
But in Frayn's Tin Men the examples are barely even satirical , or self - satirising .
" Child Told Dress Unsuitable By Teacher " ; " Paralysed Girl Determined to Dance Again " .
And since the demure days in which he was originally writing , further defences against satire have been erected at the lower end of the business .
( Just try adding " bonk " to the list of four - letter headline words listed earlier , and begin your computer simulation . )
Martin Amis's Yellow
Dog does its level best at parody ( as can be proven by the mild name of his fictional rag , the Morning Lark , which is far less grotesque than the Daily Beast or Daily Brute and could very easily be imagined on a newsstand right now ) .
And yellow is the light in the newsroom , and in the eyes of the hacks , and in so many of the bodily - fluids that they tirelessly seek to make their readers emit .
The new modern skill is that of wildly overdone photocaption - writing , where no groan - making multiple - entendre is off - limits , and again I was n't absolutely sure that part of the yellowing Clint Smoker 's effort , about royalty in a Chinese restaurant , could n't have been at least partly stolen :
" But sweet turned to sour when photographers had the sauce to storm their private room .
Wan tun a bit of privacy , the couple fled with the lads in hot pursuit - we 'll cashew ! "
( " That bit was good , " said a hard - bitten old Fleet - Streeter of my acquaintance , " but the bit about how we discuss the readers at editorial meetings was bloody uncanny . " )
In Kingsley Amis 's Girl , 20 , which is the second funniest of his novels and the only one I can call to mind that features journalism - though I suppose Jim Dixon in a low moment does briefly impersonate a newspaper reporter on the telephone - the description of the editor Harold Meers is so thoroughly and worryingly accurate that I have met people who are certain that they must know who the bastard was . ( " ' It 's the way he keeps thinking up new ways of being a shit that you can't help taking your hat off to him for , ' said Coates . "
Albert Coates , incidentally , exactly resembles Jake Slump in the tartarean depths of his smoker 's cough - " Coates drew at his cigarette and coughed terribly .
He seemed unaware of any link between these two actions " - while the hero of Girl , 20 joins Slump , Boot , and the awful Reg Mounce of Towards the End of the Morning , in the notorious newspaper - industry bind of the hack who has been fired without knowing it . )
The Amises are the only ones of the authors I have mentioned who did n't serve time on a national newspaper .
Fleming was a foreign editor for Kemsley when that family owned the Sunday Times , Waugh was a correspondent and Greene had been a subeditor as well .
Powell toiled at the Daily Telegraph , and Frayn we all know about .
They mostly did quite well out of it .
Orwell never had a steady job , but he haunted Fleet Street in search of work and knew the argot .
Yet they all unite in employing the figure of the journalist , or the setting of a newspaper , as the very pattern and mould of every type of squalor and venality .
The sole exception I can call to mind is PG Wodehouse , who started out as a penny - a - liner on the Globe and seems to have found journalism to be innocent fun .
Bertie Wooster never misses a chance to mention his article on " What The Well - Dressed Man Is Wearing " , which appeared in his Aunt Dahlia 's own magazine Milady 's Boudoir , and to which he deprecatingly refers as " my ' piece ' , as we journalists call it " .
Psmith , in Psmith Journalist , takes over a small magazine of domesticity in New York , named Cosy Moments , and transforms it briefly into a campaigning , reforming and crime - fighting organ .
His slogan when confronted by those who would intimidate him is : " Cosy Moments can not be muzzled . "
This motto has been inscribed on the wall above my keyboard for many years .
Probably nothing is as boring as the reminiscences of an old Fleet Street hand , but I shall have to say that I pity those now in the trade who wo n't remember the atmosphere of that little enclave between Ludgate Circus and the Strand , with its byways and courts and alleys .
Yes , the smell of printer 's ink , the thunder of the presses like the engine - room of the Titanic .
Yes , the lights blazing in the black - glass palace of the old Daily Express , and the vans swinging out on their way to catch the overnight trains with the first edition .
Yes , the fog around Blackfriars Station .
Yes , the exorbitant padding of the night - shift by printers with names like M Mouse .
Yes , the suicidal imbibing in the King and Keys , or the Punch , or El Vino .
Yes , the demented whims of the latest proprietor .
Yes , the overflowing ashtrays and the pounding of ancient upright typewriters .
Yes , the callousness and gallows humour .
( " Shumble , Whelper and Pigge knew Corker , " as Waugh describes a hacks ' reunion in Scoop .
" They had loitered of old on many a doorstep and forced an entry into many a stricken home . " )
And yes , it 's true that the most celebrated opening line of any Fleet Street war correspondent was that of the hack in the Congo who yelled : " Anyone here been raped and speaks English ? "
The palm goes to Frayn , in the end , because well before it happened he could see that closing time was coming , to those pubs and those hot - metal presses both .
Hackery and Grub Street had of course been lampooned before , from Pope to Gissing , but the real " age " of newspapers begins roughly with the Northcliffe press - " written by office - boys for office - boys " , as someone loftily said - and the era of mass literacy .
In other words , it opened with the 20th century and may have closed with it .
In Frayn's two novels in the sixth decade of that century , the lure of television is already beginning to exert its anti-magic .
The mindlessness of the opinion poll and the reader - survey is coming to replace news and analysis .
The reporters and editors are beginning to think about mortgages and pensions .
The editor is a cipher .
I do not think that there will again be a major novel , flattering or unflattering , in which a reporter is the protagonist .
Or if there is , he or she will be a blogger or some other species of cyber- artist , working from home and conjuring the big story from the vastness of electronic space .
In any case , the literature of old Fleet Street was to a very considerable extent written by journalists and for journalists .
Most reporters I know regard Scoop as a work of pitiless realism rather than antic fantasy .
The cap fitted , and they wore it , and with a lop - sided grin of pride , at that .
Perhaps this assists us in answering the age - old question : why does the profession of journalism have such a low reputation ?
The answer : because it has such a bad press .
