BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Microsoft
Corp issued software to fix a record 31 security flaws in its programs , and Adobe Systems Inc warned that glitches in its products could let hackers take control of a user ’s PC .
Microsoft released patches on Tuesday that repair vulnerabilities in Windows , Office and Internet Explorer , as well as key pieces of software that businesses use in their data centers .
Adobe said in a security bulletin on its website that Reader and Acrobat users should update their software to the newest versions .
Additional software is available if those releases are not compatible with a customer ’s PC .
The maker of design and document imaging software said it has yet to find any malicious software that exploits the vulnerabilities .
It classified the risk as “ critical , ” the highest level of risk on its scale evaluating the danger of such threats .
Adobe said the threat applies to users of Windows PCs as well as Apple Inc ’s Macintosh computers .
Once hackers learn of security vulnerabilities , they quickly develop malicious software to exploit them .
Such programs can be used for cybercrimes such as identity theft , sending spam and taking control of computer systems .
Alerting hackers to the flaws presents a challenge for businesses as they need time to test the patches before installing them on their computer systems .
They need to make sure that the new software does not interfere with existing programs because patches can sometimes cause systems to crash .
“ Patching will be especially challenging for enterprises , ” Dave Marcus , a senior researcher with McAfee Inc , the world ’s No. 2 security software maker , said of the Microsoft patches .
It will be easier for consumers to address the threats as they can quickly download patches over the Internet , easily eliminating their exposure to attack .
Such patches rarely cause stand - alone PCs to crash .

So much for English common law and Sir Edward Coke ’s dictum that a man ’s home is his refuge and castle .
“ For a man ’s house is his castle , et domus sua cuique est tutissimum refugium [ and each man ’s home is his safest refuge ] , ” Coke wrote in 1628 .
So much for the Bill of Rights and centuries of English common law — police in Texas can now demand you evacuate your castle at gunpoint .
William Blackstone , in his Commentaries on the Laws of England , said “ no doors can in general be broken open to execute any civil process , ” except in the case of criminal causes .
In the United States , the Castle Doctrine , arising from English common law , designates one ’s place of residence as a refuge not only against violent attacks , but unwarranted trespassing by the state .
In Texas , the authorities have put an end to this idea , which ultimately found its way into Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights guarding against unreasonable searches and seizures .
Property rights are integral to the Constitution .
“ Police can arrest people who do n’t leave town under mandatory evacuation orders under a new state law that goes into effect in the heart of Texas ’ hurricane season , ” reports the Associated Press .
“ As it stands , officials cannot compel people to evacuate , only warn that those who stay behind wo n’t have any emergency services at their disposal . ”
The new law gives county judges and mayors the power to authorize use of “ reasonable force ” to remove people from the area .
[ efoods ]
The state now has the authority to smash down your door and arrest you for failure to follow orders .
The Supreme Court has ruled “ the Fourth Amendment protects other interests in addition to privacy interests , such as possessory interests . ”
In other words , the court ruled that the state cannot evict without cause .
Jonathan Jorissen , writing for the Ave Maria Law Review in 2007 , noted that “ forcible removal of victims of natural disasters [ in this instance , Katrina ] seemingly constitutes seizures .
Applying the requisite standard of reasonableness , it must be asked whether the actions were , in fact , reasonable .
Given the nature of the situation , it is evident that they were not .
The affected citizens were not guilty of any crime .
Additionally , their property was in no way necessary for the government to carry out its duties .
Instead , these hurricane victims were further victimized by their government , which removed them from their homes based on the suspicion that they might contract some disease .
Without a more compelling interest , the government ’s actions were unreasonable . ”
As Supreme Court Justice William Patterson observed , property rights are the foundation of any social compact .
“ Men have a sense of property : Property is necessary to their subsistence , and correspondent to their natural wants and desires ; its security was one of the objects , that induced them to unite in society . ”
In Texas , the state has destroyed that compact and the very concept of natural law .

BBC News , Tegucigalpa
Last Saturday night , when President Manuel Zelaya went to bed in his official residence , he must have felt at least an inkling of the loneliness of power .
Mr Zelaya has found some powerful regional supporters
In the few days previously , the Supreme Court had twice accused him of acting illegally .
His attorney general had said he should stand down .
He had sacked his chief of defence staff .
The heads of the army navy and air force had all resigned .
Despite all that , he apparently slept well .
But not for long .
He was rudely awoken before dawn as masked soldiers entered the private quarters of the man that still , at that stage , was officially their commander - in - chief .
Now the soldiers were giving the orders .
The president was marched out of his house and taken to a nearby military airport .
Still in his pyjamas , he was forced to board a plane .
By the time it took off , he still had no idea where he was being taken , or what his fate might be .
The destination was Costa Rica , and enforced asylum .
' No hero 's welcome '
It might have seemed like his darkest hour .
But President Zelaya has instead found himself an unlikely hero with some powerful champions .
He [ Mr Zelaya ] is the democratically elected president of Honduras .
He was kidnapped by criminals
Paulina , teacher in Tegucigalpa " President Zelaya was democratically elected .
He has not completed his term , " stated US President Barack Obama .
" This is a coup against us all , " said Venezuela 's leader Hugo Chavez , who has vowed to do what he can to restore the sometime cattle rancher to power .
Mr Zelaya now says he will be returning to his home country on Thursday .
If he is expecting a hero 's welcome , he might be disappointed .
The new Honduran government , which remains unrecognised by any country in the world , has said the exiled president is now a regular citizen and should expect to be arrested and imprisoned if he returns .
Popularity plummeted But what of the Honduran people ?
Recent events in Tegucigalpa , with hundreds of protesters chanting the president 's name have proved that he has his fanatical supporters .
Troops stormed the president 's home at around dawn on Sunday " He is the democratically elected president of Honduras .
He was kidnapped by criminals , " said Paulina , a primary school teacher , as she hurled insults at the soldiers currently occupying the presidential palace .
But in the weeks before he left the country , Mr Zelaya 's popularity was in fact plummeting .
One survey put it at about 30 % .
" We saw this coming around six months ago , " said Miguel , a lawyer as he watched protesters build a barricade of burning tyres in the centre of the capital .
" Zelaya , for some reason , became a radical , " he said .
' Expertly planned '
Perhaps seeking inspiration from President Chavez in Venezuela , Mr Zelaya , who said Honduran democracy grossly favoured the country 's wealthy elite , began to turn his attention to the constitution .
It currently allows presidents to only sit for one term of four years .
Mr Zelaya 's presidency was due to expire next January .
His efforts to alter the situation would appear to have been relatively modest .
Last Sunday , he was attempting to push what was in effect a referendum about whether a future referendum would take place on rewriting the constitution .
But Mr Zelaya 's enemies it seemed , wanted to stop the process in its inception .
And they had powerful institutions on their side : the Supreme Court , the Congress , the army .
The removal of President Zelaya was expertly planned and orchestrated .
Yet , for its proponents , it might have been disastrously mistimed .
They are now left in nominal charge of a country .
Their nemesis has been turned into a symbol of Central America 's long , unhappy , struggle against military dictatorship .
And questions remain as to whether , assuming it was his intention , he really could have altered the Honduran Constitution in order to prolong his rule .
Even highly popular leaders , such as Hugo Chavez , have discovered that such an undertaking is not always successful .
Might the generals and judges and politicians who decided that Manuel Zelaya had to go , now be wondering whether they would have been better off doing nothing ?

A lot of jaws dropped last night when Rachel Maddow presented this segment on the fundamentalist sect The Family , which turns out to provide a creepy linking factor between those princes of " family values " NV Sen .
John Ensign and SC Gov. Mark Sanford -- and that curious , cranky , and crazy loon and noodge , OK Sen .
Tom Coburn .
They are the Family — fundamentalism ’s avant - garde , waging spiritual war in the halls of American power and around the globe .
They consider themselves the new chosen , congressmen , generals , and foreign dictators who meet in confidential cells , to pray and plan for a “ leadership led by God , ” to be won not by force but through “ quiet diplomacy . ”
Their base is a leafy estate overlooking the Potomac in Arlington , Virginia , and Jeff Sharlet is the only journalist to have written from inside its walls .
The Family is about the other half of American fundamentalist power — not its angry masses , but its sophisticated elites .
Sharlet follows the story back to Abraham Vereide , an immigrant preacher who in 1935 organized a small group of businessmen sympathetic to European fascism , fusing the Far Right with his own polite but authoritarian faith .
From that core , Vereide built an international network of fundamentalists who spoke the language of establishment power , a “ family ” that thrives to this day .
In public , they host prayer breakfasts ; in private they preach a gospel of “ biblical capitalism , ” military might , and American empire .
Citing Hitler , Lenin , and Mao , the Family 's leader declares , " We work with power where we can , build new power where we can 't . "
Sharlet ’s discoveries dramatically challenge conventional wisdom about American fundamentalism , revealing its crucial role in the unraveling of the New Deal , the waging of the Cold War , and the no-holds - barred economics of globalization .
The question Sharlet believes we must ask is not “ What do fundamentalists want ? ” but “ What have they already done ? ”
Even though the Family is n't totally unknown , I know a lot of people whose eyes were popping out during this segment about its connections to the Ensign and Sanford scandals .
Among Rachel 's guests was Jeff Sharlet , a contributing editor forandwho actually infiltrated the Family and literally wrote the book on it , The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power , now out in paperback . , first published last year , is yet another of those books from recent years that are by all accounts utterly splendid , which I 've forlornly added to the " must read " list that I know I 'll never get to .
By way of summary , Jeff posted the jacket copy on his blog when the book was published , in February 2008 :

Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley is very upset with President Obama for going sightseeing in Paris , while telling Congress to get moving on healthcare reform .
Grassley posted , “ Pres Obama you got nerve while u sightseeing in Paris to tell us ” time to deliver ” on health care . ”
Grassley originally posted on Twitter , Pres Obama you got nerve while u sightseeing in Paris to tell us ” time to deliver ” on health care .
We still on skedul / even workinWKEND . ”
An hour later came , “ Pres Obama while u sightseeing in Paris u said ‘ time to delivr on healthcare ’
When you are a “ hammer ” u think evrything is NAIL I ’m no NAIL . ”
Republicans have no room to talk about presidents and vacation .
George W. Bush spent 250 days of his first 15 months in office at Camp David , in Crawford or Kennebunkport .
Up to August of 2008 , Bush had spent 916 days of his presidency on vacation .
He spent almost as many days on vacation as JFK spent in office .
Advertisements
I personally do n’t begrudge this president a little down time .
Unlike Bush , Obama seems to prefer the short getaway as opposed to the week or two out of the office .
From the early looks of it , Obama is more of a weekend off kind of president .
Of course , any president is never truly on vacation or off the clock until their terms ends .
The hammer and nail complaint is as old as the hills , and it is usually true .
All presidents see themselves as the hammer and congress as the nails .
This is part of the built in conflict caused by the congressional separation of powers .
Grassley ’s complaints would have more credibility if he would have complained about Bush ’s vacations , or if he just would n’t have returned from over a week of vacation for Memorial Day .

Mousavi , who has led a massive wave of public opposition to the disputed June 12 vote that returned hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to power , accused the country 's rulers of " cheating " and warned of a dangerous path ahead if the crackdown on demonstrators continued .
" If this huge volume of cheating and changing the votes ... which has hurt people 's trust , is presented as the very evidence of the lack of cheating , then it will butcher the republican aspect of the system , and the idea that Islam is incompatible with a republic will be proven , " Mousavi said .
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who last week ordered a probe into allegations of electoral fraud , had insisted in his Friday sermon that the margin of Ahmadinejad 's victory over Mousavi meant there had been no cheating .
Iran 's electoral watchdog , the 12 - member Guardians Council , said on Saturday it was ready to randomly recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes from the election , state television reported .
Opposition leader calls for purging of the republic
Mousavi issues the strongest challenge to the Ayatollah since the Islamic Revolution
Mousavi added that the Islamic Republic must be purged of what he called lies and dishonesty , sending out a direct challenge to conservative rulers after a week of unrest in Iran .
The opposition leader , who claims victory in the poll , told supporters he was " ready for martyrdom " , according to an ally .
But he said he did not seek confrontation with the authorities .
" We are not against the Islamic system and its laws but against lies and deviations and just want to reform it , " he said in a statement on his website at the end of another tumultuous day .
Mousavi said if authorities refused to allow peaceful protests they would face the " consequences " – an apparent rejoinder to Khamenei 's warning that opposition leaders would be held responsible for any bloodshed resulting from protests .
" The people expect from their officials honesty and decency as many of our problems are because of lies ...
The Islamic revolution should be the way it was and the way it should be , " Mousavi said .
" If the people 's trust is not matched by protecting their votes , or if they are not able to defend their rights in a civil peaceful reaction , there will be dangerous ways ahead . "
Riot police out in force as protests turn violent
Protestors defied Khamenei 's demands and faced off against security forces in Tehran
Mousavi 's statements came after police firing tear gas and water canons clashed with thousands of protestors who defied an ultimatum from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for an end to their street protests .
At least one person was wounded when shots rang out during Saturday 's rally as demonstrators faced off against hundreds of security personnel to assemble in Enghelab ( Revolution ) Square in the heart of the capital , witnesses said .
Helicopters criss - crossed Tehran and ambulance sirens wailed into the night after streets emptied of protesters who had defied Friday 's stern warning from Khamenei during his weekly prayers .
The head of Iran 's Security Council , Abbas Mohtaj , on Saturday delivered a specific warning to Mousavi and his supporters .
" Your national duty tells you to refrain from provoking illegal gatherings , " Mohtaj said in a statement .
" Should you provoke and call for these illegal rallies you will be responsible for the consequences . "
Since the protests began , scores of prominent political activists , including reformist leaders and former government officials , have also been rounded up by the authorities .

Craigslist expects record revenue : $ 100 million ONLINE ADVERTISING
Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Craigslist expects record revenue : $ 100 million 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
Defying its anti-commercial reputation , Craigslist is expected to rake in $ 100 million in revenue this year , the most ever for the classified advertising site , according to a new report .
The San Francisco company 's finances are a rare bright spot amid a slumping economy that is decimating businesses of all kinds .
Classified Intelligence Report , a publication by media consulting firm Advanced Interactive Media Group , predicted in its report that Craigslist 's revenue would increase 23 percent in 2009 from the year before .
While other classified listings businesses , such as newspapers , retract , Craigslist 's is expanding , primarily because of its growing popularity as a jobs board .
" Craigslist , whether you agree with what it 's doing or not , has pretty much changed the way we look at classifieds , " said Jim Townsend , editorial director for Advanced Interactive Media .
" They 're a game changer . "
Susan MacTavish Best , a Craigslist spokeswoman , responded : " As a closely held private company , we never comment on rumors with regards to our revenue at Craigslist or back - of - the napkin guesstimates .
In fact , we have never discussed our revenue at any time , so the plethora of numbers that have been reported over the years are merely stabs in the dark of which we 've had no part - this most recent study included . "
Craigslist charges $ 25 to post job ads in 17 cities .
Job listings in the Bay Area cost $ 75 .
In New York City , the site charges real estate brokers $ 10 for each apartment they list .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The estimate of Craigslist 's revenue included proceeds from listings in its erotic services category , which was renamed adult services last month .
The company had said it would donate all money from erotic services ads to charity , but left it an open question as to how revenue from its successor category would be used .
Revenue from adult services is expected to be at least $ 17.9 million this year , the report said .
Jim Buckmaster , Craigslist 's chief executive , has repeatedly said that increasing the site 's income is n't a priority .
Instead , he takes a money - is n't - everything approach that leads many people to erroneously believe that the Web site is a nonprofit .
The company explains its financial philosophy on its
Web site by saying that it relies on " local communities to suggest ways to make money without compromising Craigslist . "
Posting ads to sell a car , find a roommate or land a date remains free .
In April , Craigslist attracted 46.5 million unique U.S. visitors , according to comScore Inc .
Newspaper publishers have complained that Craigslist 's rise has eroded their once - dominant print classified businesses .
The defection of advertisers to Craigslist and other Web sites sent U.S. newspaper classified sales spiraling down 29 percent last year , according to the Newspaper Association of America .
Craigslist 's revenue has been growing quickly , nearly doubling over the past two years , and increasing by a factor of 14 since 2003 , according to the report .
Still , its $ 100 million in annual revenue would place the company far below Internet giant Google , which had $ 21.8 billion in revenue last year .
There was no estimate of Craigslist 's profit in the report , although Townsend said that it 's no doubt highly profitable .

There have been 191 British fatalities in Afghanistan since 2001 The Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) has gone to the Court of Appeal to try to significantly reduce the compensation awarded to two injured soldiers .
One , who was shot in the leg in Iraq , received £ 46,000 , while the other , injured in training , got £ 28,750 .
Both had their payouts raised due to complications , but the MoD argues that they should only be compensated for their " original injuries " .
The stance has attracted criticism amid mounting casualties in Afghanistan .
' Key principle '
The court appeal comes after two more soldiers were killed in Helmand province , bringing the total number of UK fatalities since operations began in Afghanistan in 2001 to 191 .
Military officials said on Monday that the first phase of a major offensive - Operation Panther 's Claw - had been completed in Helmand .
If what the government was trying to do was to absolve ourselves of our responsibility , we would n't have doubled the compensation levels for the most seriously injured
Bill Rammell
Armed forces minister
Send us your comments Cpl Anthony Duncan was initially awarded £ 9,250 after being shot , while Marine Matthew McWilliams received £ 8,250 for fracturing his thigh on a training exercise .
Appealing to a tribunal to have those sums increased , both men argued they had suffered a number of subsequent health problems during their treatment and that these should not be regarded as separate from their original injuries .
Three judges agreed with them and increased their compensation , but the MoD is now seeking to overturn that ruling .
It claims it is trying " to clarify an earlier judgment about how the armed forces compensation scheme is administered , and to protect the key principle of the scheme : the most compensation for the most seriously injured " .
Simon Weston , who suffered horrific burns in the Falklands conflict , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the compensation system was " incredibly flawed " .
A lot of service personnel with the worst injuries " will never work again or will always have problems " , he said .
" What we need to understand is that this large sum of money is not so they can go on jollies and go on holidays and buy nice flash cars .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" This means that they 're buying a home , they will be subsidising their own care because they wo n't be given a huge amount by the state .
" These guys are using that money to live not to exist .
It seems petty to be revising the small amount of money . "
But armed forces minister Bill Rammell said the nub of the case was about the government rightly trying to protect the principle of giving the most compensation to the most seriously injured .
Speaking from Afghanistan , he told BBC Radio Scotland : " If what the Ministry of Defence and the government was trying to do was to absolve ourselves of our responsibility , we would n't have doubled the compensation levels for the most seriously injured last year .
" We would n't have made it easier for service personnel once they leave the armed forces to get training , we would n't have given them better access to housing , and better access to healthcare . "
The MoD is conducting a review of the compensation scheme following a number of appeals from , or on behalf of , former servicemen .
' Skimping and saving '
One of the most high - profile came from Diane Dernie , the mother of Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson , who lost both legs and suffered severe brain damage in Afghanistan .
Initially he received £ 152,000 , but following widespread criticism that was increased .
The MoD points out that it has doubled the maximum lump sum payment to £ 570,000 for the most severely injured soldiers , in addition to an index - linked monthly income for life .
But the chairman of the Commons select defence committee , the Conservative MP James Arbuthnot , warned against " skimping and saving " on compensation for the armed forces .
" If the Ministry of Defence is appealing to keep the costs of looking after injured servicemen as low as possible , then it sends all the wrong messages to people who are wondering whether to join the armed forces , wondering whether to put themselves on the line , for principles that we are asking them to pursue , " he said .

SALT LAKE CITY , July 31 ( UPI ) --
A gay couple who kissed in a plaza belonging to the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City will not be prosecuted for trespassing , officials said .
Salt Lake City Prosecutor Sim Gill said the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has not made clear that Main Street Plaza is private property , but he said the church has the right to determine what behavior is appropriate there .
The plaza , between the church 's North Temple and South Temple , was once part of the city 's Main Street and has no gate .

" The two individuals believed -- albeit mistakenly -- that they had the right to be there , " Gill said .
" Fairness requires that either that property be not open to the public or you condition that in a way that the person who comes on understands that it is private property . "
Matt Aune and Derek Johns were arrested July 9 .
They said they were detained by security guards as they strolled across the plaza after they stopped for a kiss .
The arrest inspired some " kiss - in " demonstrations , including two on the plaza .

A hospital patient from Essex has become the first person without underlying health problems to die after contracting swine flu , it was announced today .
The patient died today at Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , NHS East of England said .
The patient 's family has asked that no details of their relative are released .
The trust said in a statement it " would like to extend their deepest sympathies to the family affected as they come to terms with their loss " .
News of the death comes as the number of people who had died while infected with the H1N1 virus has doubled in the last week .
It is thought that fifteen people with swine flu have now died since the virus was first identified in the UK in March .
Today 's death marks a new point in the outbreak as all of the previous victims were believed to have serious underlying health problems .
Yesterday Sir Liam Donaldson , the chief medical officer said that on top of the deaths , another 43 people were critically ill with the bug and a further 335 were being treated in hospital .
London and the West Midlands are on the verge of being classed as having epidemics because of the rate at which the virus is spreading .
There are 9,718 confirmed cases of swine flu in the UK but officials fear the real figure could be 10 times higher .
The US has the biggest outbreak , with 33,902 confirmed cases , followed by Mexico , with 10,262 , and the UK third .
The World Health Organisation has said there have been 429 deaths from the virus worldwide and nearly 95,000 infections since it was first reported in Mexico .
Earlier today , the government said plans to deal with the pandemic could allow anyone infected with swine flu to stay off work for 14 days without a doctor 's note .
Employees can currently be off for seven days , including weekends and bank holidays , without needing a sick note from their GP .
A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said : " The government is rightly considering possible measures to minimise the risk of further spread of swine - flu and protect public health .
" We do n't want people to feel obliged to leave the home or return to work when they are still unwell or put an unnecessary burden on GPs in a pandemic .
Contingency plans therefore include the possibility of extending self - certification to 14 days for a limited period . "
He said the measures would " only be implemented if absolutely needed " , and the decision would be taken by the government 's civil contingencies committee .
Dozens of sharia courts in the UK are regularly giving illegal advice on issues including marriage and divorce , a report published today claims .
Decisions concerning marriages not recognised under English law , polygamy , and disputes regarding children are being made by at least 85 sharia courts , according to the report by the thinktank Civitas .
There is no clear divide between the functions of imams and the sharia courts .
An imam who conducts a marriage which is not registered and then advises on disputes within that marriage acts in breach of the law and outside the scope of the sharia court 's role , Civitas say .
" Some of these courts are advising illegal actions , " said Denis MacEoin , a former lecturer in Arabic and Islamic studies who wrote the report .
" And others transgress human rights standards . "
Muslim arbitration tribunal ( MTA ) , a network of sharia courts , has been operating in London , Manchester , Bradford , Birmingham and Nuneaton since 2007 under the 1996 Arbitration Act .
These make decisions that are legally binding and can be enforced by the English courts , provided they do not conflict with English law and both parties choose to use them .
An MTA spokeswoman said that critics of any use of Islamic law failed to recognise that both parties had to agree to any form of dispute resolution in Britain .
" The establishment of Muslim Arbitration Tribunals is an important and significant step towards providing the Muslim community with a real opportunity to self determine disputes in accordance with Islamic sacred law , " a statement from the organisation said .
But today 's report claims that many smaller and often informal courts are making decisions under sharia law beyond their legal remit .
" About two - thirds of Muslim marriages are not being registered under the Marriages Act , which is illegal , " said Neil Addison , a barrister specialising in the law on religion .
" A woman with such a marriage would have no choice but to go to a sharia tribunal …
But it 's not the way arbitration is supposed to work . "
MacEoin said : " By demanding marriage under Muslim law , the divorce is determined by the man saying ' I divorce you ' three times .
Divorce under Islamic law also affects the wife 's entitlement to alimony , custody of children , and who keeps the family house .
These will all be decided by sharia law and will be discriminatory towards the woman in all cases . "
A decision last year by the UK's highest court caused controversy when it said sharia law was " wholly incompatible " with human rights law .
The House of Lords , granting asylum to a woman whose child would have been removed and placed with an abusive father under sharia law in Lebanon , described sharia in the country as " created by and for men in a male dominated society " .
There has also been high - profile support for sharia courts however , from figures including the archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , who last year said that formal recognition of sharia law " seemed unavoidable " .
Many Muslim lawyers have compared the operation of sharia courts to the Jewish beth din , which also operate as arbitration tribunals under UK law , a comparison which is questioned by the report .
The report disputes the comparison .
" These courts are not operating within the same disciplines as the beth din " , said Addison .
" The beth din acknowledge that ' the law of the land is the law . ' and a rabbi cannot perform a synagogue marriage ceremony unless a registrar is present to simultaneously register the marriage under English law . "
" Imams and mosques are performing marriage ceremonies that are not registered under English law , " Addison added .
" They are the only religion that are doing it … Hindus and Sikhs have registered their temples under the Marriages Act . "
The report 's findings raise questions about the appropriate scope of tribunals under the Arbitration Act , experts say , which were not intended to deal with issues like divorce .
Sharia courts also need to be more transparent if they are to continue , critic says .
" These tribunals do n't seem to have any system of record keeping " said MacEion .
" They are not transparent – either within their own community or for the outside community .
That is a problem that needs to be looked at . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Hydroxycut products , popular dietary supplements used for weight loss , have been linked to liver damage and are being recalled , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday .
The FDA has received 23 reports of serious liver injuries , including a death , linked to Hydroxycut products .
The FDA said it has received 23 reports of serious liver injuries linked to Hydroxycut products , which are also used as energy enhancers and as fat burners .
The reports include the 2007 death of a 19 - year - old man living in the Southwest , which was reported to the FDA in March .
Other serious liver problems reported included liver damage that resulted in a transplant in 2002 , liver failure , jaundice , seizures and cardiovascular problems .
The FDA is warning consumers to immediately stop using 14 Hydroxycut products manufactured by Iovate Health Sciences Inc. of Oakville , Ontario , and distributed by Iovate Health Sciences USA Inc. of Blasdell , New York .
The company is voluntarily recalling the following products : Hydroxycut Regular Rapid Release Caplets , Hydroxycut Caffeine - Free Rapid Release Caplets , Hydroxycut Hardcore Liquid Caplets , Hydroxycut Max Liquid Caplets , Hydroxycut Regular Drink Packets , Hydroxycut Caffeine - Free Drink Packets , Hydroxycut Hardcore Drink Packets ( Ignition Stix ) , Hydroxycut Max Drink Packets , Hydroxycut Liquid Shots , Hydroxycut Hardcore RTDs ( Ready - to - Drink ) , Hydroxycut Max Aqua Shed , Hydroxycut 24 , Hydroxycut Carb Control and Hydroxycut Natural .
Watch more on the FDA 's concern »
According to the FDA , last year , Iovate sold more than 9 million units of Hydroxycut products , which were distributed widely to grocery stores , health food stores and pharmacies .
" The FDA urges consumers to discontinue use of Hydroxycut products in order to avoid any undue risks .
Adverse events are rare , but exist .
Consumers should consult a physician or other health care professional if they experience symptoms possibly associated with these products , " said Dr. Linda Katz , interim chief medical officer of the FDA 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition .
Liver damage is rare , but patients who experienced problems were taking doses recommended on the product label , the FDA said .
Symptoms include brown urine , nausea , vomiting , fatigue , stomach pain , itching and light - colored stools .
The FDA has not determined what specific ingredients are responsible for the problems , because the products contain a variety of overlapping ingredients and herbal extracts .
Dietary supplements sold before October 1994 are not required to undergo any FDA review before going to market .
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 required manufacturers to ensure a supplement to be safe before marketing .
But manufacturers still do n't need to register a product with the FDA or get approval before selling a supplement .
The agency can take action against an unsafe supplement once it's on the market .
Since December 2007 , any serious adverse event reported to the manufacturer must now be reported to the FDA within 15 days .
The Council for Responsible Nutrition , the leading trade association representing the dietary supplement industry , said that both the FDA and Iovate " took appropriate action today . "
" We commend FDA for warning consumers of a potential safety problem associated with these products , and were encouraged to see that the company -- Iovate Health Sciences -- agreed to recall the products from the market until further determinations can be made , " said Steve Mister , the council 's president and CEO .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on Tuesday accepted a U.S. - backed effort by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias to mediate an end to the political crisis in Honduras and said talks with his rivals would begin on Thursday .
“ Our first meeting is set for Thursday , in Costa Rica , ” Zelaya , told Honduran radio from Washington .
In Honduras , Roberto Micheletti , who was appointed president by Honduran lawmakers after the June 28 coup , also said he would attend Thursday ’s talks under Arias ’ mediation .
Arias , a Nobel Peace Prize winner with experience in solving Central American conflicts , faces mediating between sharply opposed positions .
Zelaya said his reinstatement as president was nonnegotiable .
“ What this is is not a negotiation , this is the planning of the exit of the coup leaders , ” he said .
But Micheletti maintained his position that Zelaya could not return as president .
“ We ’re not going to negotiate , we ’re going to talk , ” he said .
“ We ’re going into these talks because we ’re interested in having peace and tranquility in Honduras . ”
Zelaya , whose ouster was sparked by his efforts to change presidential term limits and by his political shift to the left , spoke after meeting U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
She urged him to negotiate rather than try to force his way back into the country .
Zelaya had tried to fly home on Sunday , but the interim government stopped his plane from landing .
At least one person was killed when troops clashed with pro-Zelaya protesters who went to the airport in the capital , Tegucigalpa , to meet him .
The coup in the impoverished Central American coffee and textile exporter has been widely condemned abroad , and posed a diplomatic challenge for U.S. President Barack Obama .
The Organization of American States took the rare step to suspend Honduras on Saturday after Honduras ’ interim authorities defied its ultimatum to reinstate Zelaya .
But the group has failed to find a solution to the crisis .
ARIAS ROLE
Arias declined to speculate about the prospects of success in the mediation .
“ What I would like is not to let them leave until there is an agreement , ” he said in the Costa Rican capital , San Jose .
Clinton said all issues should now be settled in talks with Arias , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for helping to end political violence in Central America .
“ I believe it is a better route for him to follow at this time than to attempt to return in the face of the implacable opposition of the de facto regime , ” Clinton said of Zelaya .

“ So , instead of another confrontation that might result in a loss of life , let ’s try the dialogue process and see where that leads , ” she added .
While backing a restoration of “ the democratic , constitutional order ” in Honduras , Clinton did not explicitly call for Zelaya to return to power , saying this should be negotiated by the parties themselves .
Some analysts wondered whether the United States may be tempering its support for Zelaya , although Obama said he said he should return to power .
“ America supports now the restoration of the democratically elected president of Honduras , even though he has strongly opposed American policies , ” Obama said in a speech in Russia .

“ We do so not because we agree with him .
We do so because we respect the universal principle that people should choose their own leaders , whether they are leaders we agree with or not , ” he added .
The United States has repeatedly condemned the coup in Honduras , which has a population of 7 million and is the third poorest country in the Americas after Haiti and Nicaragua .
ARGUMENTS FOR OUSTER
Defying the international pressure , Micheletti has insisted Zelaya was legally removed .
Micheletti said in Tegucigalpa that if Zelaya returned to Honduras , it should not be as president but to face charges in the courts .
“ He committed crimes and he must pay for them , ” he said .
Micheletti’s interim government says the ouster was a constitutional transition carried out by the army and supported by the Supreme Court because Zelaya had illegally tried to organize a vote on changing presidential term limits .
Zelaya took office in 2006 and had been due to leave in 2010 .
He had riled the country ’s traditional ruling elite with his leftward shift and growing alliance with Venezuela ’s socialist president , Hugo Chavez .
In the Honduran capital , several thousand anti-Zelaya demonstrators packed into a main plaza , waving blue and white national flags and posters ridiculing Chavez , who many accused of meddling for backing Zelaya -- nicknamed “ Mel ” .
“ We do n’t want Mel back .
Those people were going to take us to socialism , ” said Carlos Ramos , a teacher and retired air force officer who was taking part in the protest .
Several thousand supporters of Zelaya led by his wife , Xiomara , staged their own rally .
“ They say there is peace in the country , but how can there be peace if people cannot leave their neighborhoods ... if there is a curfew , if they are suspending people ’s rights and the army is out repressing the people , ” Xiomara Zelaya said .
Latvia , a small Baltic nation with the population of 2.3 million people has been going through the deepest recession in the European Union , which it joined in 2004 .
Did Muhammad Evict the Jews of Medina for Attacking and Killing Muslims ?
Abu Shuja'ah , a prominent internet propagandist for Islam , justified Muhammad 's attack , deportation and slaughter of the Jews of Medina saying : " The Jews were driven out of Medina for attacking and killing Muslims . "
Is that true ???
[ Read in Bangla ]
In the course of founding Islam by Prophet Muhammad ( 610 –632 CE ) , the Jews , who had lived in Muhammad ’s adopted home of Medina for many centuries , suffered horrible pogrom , the first holocaust of the Jews .
Muhammad attacked and deported two Jewish tribes , while he slaughtered , en masse , the males of the third tribe , Banu Quraiza , and enslaved their women and children .
Muhammad extirpated idolatry from Arabia by giving polytheists a choice between death and conversion to Islam , as demanded by annihilatory divine verses 9:5 , and 8:39 etc .
Muslims always have justifications for those atrocities of Muhammad , as Abu Shuja ’ah , a prominent Islamic propagandist , claims : “ The Jews were driven out of Medina for attacking and killing Muslims .
Consider it a mirror of today ’s Gaza ” .
Upon proper investigation of canonical Islamic literature , those claim turn out baseless , which I have enumerated in my book , Islamic Jihad : A Legacy of Forced Conversion , Imperialism and Slavery .
This claim of Shuja ’ah is also false , proven below .
Let us start with a review of Prophet Muhammad ’s encounter with the Jews of Medina .
He relocated to Medina in June 622 CE on the background that his mission at Mecca , his city of birth , had failed .
His prophetic mission had become stagnant there at the time , but was making rapid progress in Medina acquiring , even in his absence , some 76 converts over the previous three years .
His prophetic mission at Mecca had made only some 150 converts over the previous 13 years .
The prophet was invited to Medina by his Medinan disciples ( those 76 ) , who belonged to the two Pagan tribes : ‘ Aws ’ and ‘ Khazraj ’ .
He settled down in Medina without facing any opposition from any group , including the richer and more influential Jews .
It is anticipated that the Jews might ’ve been welcoming of him , as he was actively converting the idolaters to a monotheism , which he presented as a sister - religion to Judaism and Christianity .
Muhammad continued his preaching unimpeded at Medina and the polytheists converted to Islam at a high frequency .
But the problem with the Jews started only after Muhammad became too ambitious to present himself also as a prophet , a savior , of the Jews ( & Christians ) as well .
So Muhammad initially started pampering the Jews & Christians by saying good things about them and adopting their customs .
He initially held Moses above himself : “ The Prophet said , “ Do n’t give me superiority over Moses ” ” [ Bukhari 4:620 ] .
Quranic verses also started showing down to pamper them saying , Allah gave them ‘ guidance and light ’ in the form of Torah [ Q 5:44 ] ; Jews were a “ righteous ” people [ Q 6:153 - 54 ] , who ‘ excelled the nations ’ [ Q 45:16 ] etc .
And he adopted many Jewish rituals and customs — fasting , circumcision , and praying toward Jerusalem etc. — to give Islam an Abrahamic creed - like look for the first time .
Allah ’s and Muhammad ’s reason behind all these goody - goody sayings about , and gestures toward , the Jews was to come out later ; it was Muhammad ’s ambition to become a prophet of the Jews as well .
So , Allah later revealed ( Q 3.5 ) :
( I have come to you ) , to attest the Law which was before me .
And to make lawful to you part of what was ( Before ) forbidden to you ; I have come to you with a Sign from your Lord .
So fear Allah , and obey me .
The same is repeated in Q 5:48 :
And unto thee have We revealed the Scripture with the truth , confirming whatever Scripture was before it , and a watcher over it .
So judge between them by that which Allah hath revealed …
But , if they failed to follow Muhammad , Allah threatens them with punishments in the next verse ( Q5:49 ) :
… And if they turn away , then know that Allah 's Will is to smite them for some sin of theirs .
Lo ! many of mankind are evil - livers .
Despite Allah ’s pleadings initially , followed by threats , the Jews did not accept Muhammad as their prophet .
Instead , they became staunch critics of Muhammad ’s revelations , because they had the inner knowledge of what is in the Torah , which Muhammad said he brought in its entirety through his Quran .
They could easily point out the errors in Muhammad ’s messages , which they did irrefutably putting Muhammad and Allah in a defensive and embarrassing position .
Allah eventually became sure that the Jews ( & Christians ) would not embrace his message whatsoever .
So , Allah came down with a verse ( Q 2:120 ) to relieve Muhammad from further persuasion of them :
Never will the Jews or the Christians be satisfied with thee unless thou follow their form of religion .
Say : “ The Guidance of Allah , - that is the ( only ) Guidance . ”
Wert thou to follow their desires after the knowledge which hath reached thee , then wouldst thou find neither Protector nor helper against Allah [ Q 2:120 ] .
The stage was set for Muhammad to do what the Jews deserved — i.e. their extermination from Medina — for refusing to accept Muhammad ’s prophethood .
Soon ( January 624 ) , Muhammad , while pursuing with some 300 - plus Muslim raiders to attack and plunder a Meccan caravan , engaged a Meccan rescue - army , double ( or triple ) in strength , in the battle of Badr and achieved a stunning victory .
Muhammad ’s confidence was ‘ sky high ’ .
The Jews can be challenged now to mete out Allah ’s promised punishment to them ( e.g. verse 5:49 ) for rejecting Muhammad ’s mission .
Now let us see how Muhammad initiate violence against the Jews , according to the prophet ’s earliest and most original biographer Ibn Ishaq [ Life of Muhammad ( c. 750 ) , Karachi , p. 363 ] :
Meanwhile there was the affair of the B. Qaynuqa .
The apostle assembled them in their market and addressed them as follows : ‘ O Jews , beware lest God bring upon you the vengeance that He brought upon Quraysh [ Meccans ] and become Muslims .
You know that I am a prophet who has been sent — you will find that in your scriptures and God 's covenant with you . ’
They replied , ‘ O Muhammad , you seem to think that we are your people .
Do not deceive yourself because you encountered a people ( i.e. the Quraysh ) with no knowledge of war and got the better of them ; for by God if we fight you , you will find that we are real men ! ’
Here Muhammad threatened the Jews to submit to Islam ( i.e. to his religious and political authority ) , pointing to them what happened to the Meccans at Badr — a fate that may visit them too , if they did n’t embrace Islam .
But the Jews rejected his threatening invitation with defiance , promising to strike back hard if Muhammad would attack them .
After Muhammad ’s threat , Allah also came with his own threat to the Jews as Ibn Ishaq ( p. 363 ) notes :
A freedman of the family of Zayd b. Thabit from Sa' Id b. Jubayr or from Tkrima from Ibn ' Abbas told me that the latter said the following verses ( Quran 3:13 ) came down about them :
‘ Say to those who disbelieve : you will be vanquished and gathered to Hell , an evil resting place .
You have already had a sign in the two forces which met ’ , i.e. the apostle ’s companions at Badr and the Quraysh .
‘ One force fought in the way of God ; the other , disbelievers , thought they saw double their own force with their very eyes .
God strengthens with His help whom He will .
Verily in that is an example for the discerning .’ [ Quran 3:13 ]
As the Banu Qainuqa Jews flatly rejected both threats , it was time for Muhammad to look for an excuse for putting the threat into action .
It seems Muhammad found no excuse whatsoever for attacking the Jews .
So , Allah had to create one for Muhammad , an outrageously silly one at that in verses 8:55 – 58 .
The Jews , for rejecting Muhammad , suddenly became the worst of beasts :
For the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who reject Him :
They will not believe .
[ Quran 8:55 ]
What punishment do they deserve ?
It ’s stated in previous verse ( Quran 8:54 ) :
… after the manner of the people of Pharaoh and those before them :
They treated as false the Signs of their Lord : so We destroyed them for their crimes , and We drowned the people of Pharaoh : for they were all oppressors and wrong - doers .
The Jews , for rejecting Muhammad , deserved similar punishment as Pharaoh suffered ( i.e. complete destruction ) for rejecting Moses .
To create an excuse for attacking the Jews , Allah falsely accused Banu Qainuqa of breaking treaty in the next verse 8:56 :
They are those with whom thou didst make a covenant , but they break their covenant every time , and they have not the fear ( of Allah ) .
Here Allah says that Muhammad had made a treaty with the Jews of Medina , which they broke repeatedly .
In this verse , Allah lied on two counts : 1 ) No such treaty existed between Muhammad and the Jews , and 2 ) Even if it existed , the Jews never broke .
It will be made clear below .
1 ) Did a treaty exist between Muhammad and the Jews ?
There existed no treaty between Muhammad and the Jews , duly signed by both parties , which will become clear below .
By existence of a treaty between Muhammad and the Jews , Muslims mean the so - called “ Constitution of Medina ” [ Ibn Ishaq , p. 231-232 ] .
Muslims boast about this so - called treaty — deemed ‘ ideal blueprint ’ of the Islamic state — as an epitome of tolerance , freedom , human rights and justice for people of all faiths in Islamic states .
But this treaty , singed within the first year of Muhammad ’s relocation to Medina , actually demands unconditional subjugation of all Medinans to the political and religious authority of Muhammad , a recent refugee there .
What I will prove here is that the treaty was never signed by the Jews ; they probably never saw it .
The wording of the treaty starts as thus : " In the name of God the Compassionate , the Merciful .
This is a document from Muhammad the prophet between the believers and Muslims of Quraysh and Yathrib , and those who followed them and joined them and labored with them . ”
And it ends with the words : “ God approves of this document …
Muhammad is the apostle of God . "
The words of both Allah and Muhammad , discussion above , have proven beyond doubt that the Jew would never accept Islam and submit to Muhammad ’s leadership , never accept Muhammad as a prophet .
Would the Jews , then , sign something , which says twice that this is a document from Muhammad the prophet of God ?
Signing of this document would mean that the Jews accepted Muhammad ’s claim of ‘ prophethood ’ , which they flatly and persistently rejected , indeed ridiculed , all along .
They even suffered horribly at Muhammad ’s hand ; still , they did n’t accept him as a prophet .
Therefore , it becomes clear that this document would never be signed by the Jews .
Indeed , according Montgomery Watt ( a Western Islamic scholar favorite to Muslims , whose books are published in Pakistan ) : there were nine contracting parties in this document : they were the Muslim refugee from Mecca and the Medinan Arab tribes ( non-Jewish ) , who had become essentially Islamic by converting to Islam in large numbers after Muhammad ’s arrival in Medina .
None of the Jewish tribes were co-signatory in this document .
[ Watt M , Islam and the Integration of Society , 1961 , p. 19 ]
Wording of this treaty makes it evident that it was an invitation from Muhammad to other tribes of Medina ( the Jews included ) to assemble under Muhammad and follow his commands .
The Jews had no participation in its creation .
It was , most likely , a document that records a secret understanding between Muhammad and the Medinan pagan - turn - Muslim tribes , who had formal alliance with the Jewish tribes .
The Jews probably never saw this document .
2 ) Did the Jews break any treaty ?
Even if a treaty existed , the Jews never broke it , even not once , forget about their breaking it ‘ every time ’ as Allah accuses them of .
It becomes evident from Allah ’s own words , the next verse , in which Allah commands Muhammad to attack the Jews :
If thou fearest treachery from any group , throw back ( their covenant ) to them , ( so as to be ) on equal terms : for Allah loveth not the treacherous [ Quran 8:58 ] .
This verse is Allah ’s direct command to attack Banu Qainuqa , the first Jewish tribe to face Muhammad ’s sword , as Al - Tabari cites the account of al - Zuhri that a verse was brought by angel Gabriel to Muhammad , which said [ History of Al - Tabari , New York , VII :86 ] :
‘ And if thou fearest treachery from any folk , then throw back to them their treaty fairly ’ [ Quran 8:58 ] .
Whereupon , Muhammad said , ‘‘ I fear Banu Qaynuqa ’’ and ‘ the Messenger of God advanced upon them . ’
This verse gives clear command to Muhammad to attack Banu Qainuqa , and as the reason , Allah only mentions Muhammad 's fear that the treaty may be broken in the future ; the Jews had n’t broken it yet — not even once , forget about many times as Allah claimed in previous verse .
In fact , the real reason as to why the Jews should be attacked can be found in the next verse ( Quran 8:59 ) :
And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip ( Allah ’s Purpose ) .
Lo ! they can not escape .
The Jews were obviously trying to “ outstrip Allah ’s purpose ” .
Allah tried to persuade , indeed pleaded , the Jews in so many verses to accept
His revelations , sent through Muhammad .
They not only rejected Allah ’s pleadings , but also ridiculed those messages : they found so many faults with his messages , causing ridicule and embarrassment to Muhammad - Allah duo .
How dare they ?
They deserve the gravest of punishment for a crime of such huge proportion .
Let them not escape , commands Allah .
In sum , Muhammad attacked the Jews for his fear that Banu Qainuqa might break a treaty sometime in the future , not because they already broke one .
Over this fear , Muhammad besieged Banu Qaynuqa .
After a fifteen - day siege , the Jews surrendered .
In order to mete out the deserving punishment to them ( Allah had promised to smite them in Q5:49 and drown and destroy them completely like Pharaoh in Q8:54 ) , Muhammad ordered the surrendered men to be tied for their summary execution .
At this point , Abdullah ibn Obayi— vilified as hypocrite in Islam , but a rather humane chief of the Khazraj clan , who had converted to Islam , but never approved Muhammad ’s cruelties — firmly intervened .
He even threatened Muhammad with consequences had he slaughtered the Jews .
As a result , Muhammad prudently relented from slaughtering the prisoners .
Instead , he exiled them to Syria [ Ibn Ishaq , p. 363-64 ] .
Here ’s another hadith , which describes Muhammad ’s threat against the Jews most clearly [ Bukhari 9:85:77 ] :
Narrated Abu Huraira :
While we were in the mosque , Allah 's Apostle ( Muhammad ) came out to us and said , " Let us proceed to the Jews . "
So we went along with him till we reached Bait - al - Midras ( a place where the Torah used to be recited and all the Jews of the town used to gather ) .
The Prophet stood up and addressed them , " O Assembly of Jews !
Embrace Islam and you will be safe ! "
The Jews replied , " O Muhammad !
You have conveyed Allah 's message to us . "
The Prophet said , " That is what I want ( from you ) . "
He repeated his first statement for the second time , and they said , " You have conveyed Allah 's message , O Muhammad . "
Then he said it for the third time and added , " You should know that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle , and I want to exile you from this land , so whoever among you owns some property , can sell it , otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle . "
This discussion makes it clear that the Jews never ever aggressively attacked and killed any Muslim , which , Muslims claim , forced Muhammad to attack and evict them in defence .
They even did n’t break any treaty , which Muslims offer as the most common justification .
Even treaty probably never existed .
Hence , Muhammad had no justification to attack the Jews .
Muhammad ’s attacking and evicting , and even mass slaughtering and enslavement , of the Jews was an instance of unjustified barbarism to the extreme .
The Historical Unreliability of Jesus : A Review of Robert VanVoorst ’s Jesus Outside The New Testament
The Historical Unreliability of Jesus : A Review of Robert VanVoorst ’s Jesus Outside The New Testament
by Sarah Schoonmaker
Robert VanVoorst ’s Jesus Outside the New Testament claims to provide evidence for Jesus ’ life , death , and resurrection from non-Christian historians and Jewish writings .
Jesus Outside the New Testament refers to the following classical writers in order to defend the historical reliability of Jesus : Thallos , Pliny the Younger , Suetonius , Tacitus , and Josephus .
The purpose of this review is to address the historical writers that remain lauded as evidence for the historical Jesus and demonstrate how they all fail to bolster any historical support for Christianity .
Thallos :
VanVoorst points to Thallos as the earliest reference to Jesus set in the middle of the first century 55 C.E. Most of Thallos ’ works perished , but was quoted by Sextus Julius Africanus , a Christian writer in his History of the World .
This book was eventually lost , but the quote originating with Thallos was also mentioned by Byzantine historian , Georgius Syncellus .
According to Syncellus , when Julius Africanus writes about the darkness of the death of Jesus , he mentions that , “ Thallos calls this an eclipse of the sun , which seems to be wrong . ” [ i ]
Julius claims that the darkness was miraculous , “ a darkness induced by God . ”
Even though Thallos could have mentioned the eclipse with no reference to Jesus , VanVoorst claims that it is more likely that Julius who had access to the context of Thallos ’ quotation was correcting Thallos as a “ hostile reference to Jesus ’ death . ” [ ii ]
For instance , VanVoorst concludes , “ if Thallos was simply writing about an eclipse , Julius Africanus would not have cared to say that Thallos was mistaken . ” [ iii ]
In logic , when an argument against a particular view is offered , one mentions the claim under refutation , followed by premises and a conclusion .
If Thallos were arguing against the claim that the eclipse was associated with the death of Jesus , he would have mentioned this event .
However , there is no reference to Jesus , so therefore , one cannot conclude that it is even likely that Thallos was responding to a Christian claim about the “ darkness induced by God ” surrounding Jesus ’ death .
VanVoorst ’s conclusion is a straw man fallacy because he creates an argument that Thallos does not claim to make .
At best one may only infer that Thallos wrote about Jesus in his lost writings , but this is a massive assumption .
Pliny the Younger
As a prominent lawyer and senator in Rome , Pliny published nine books of letters between 100 and 109.[iv ]
He writes about punishment of Christians specifically by the Roman governor Trajan .
Pliny also records that Christians would “ sing hymns to Christ before dawn on a determined day and took oaths to refrain from theft , robbery , and adultery , not to break any promises , and not to withhold a deposit when reclaimed . ” [
v ]
Pliny also tells Trajan that , “ many people of all classes , ages , and regions of his province are infected by this contagious superstition . ” [ vi ]
VanVoorst credits this source fairly by claiming that Pliny ’s writings do not bear independent witness to Jesus independent of Christianity .
“ What is related about Christ confirms two points made in the New Testament : first , Christians worship Christ in their songs ( Phil . 2:5-11 ; Col. 1:15 - 20 ; Rev. 5:11,13 ) , and second , no Christian reviles or curses Christ ( 1 Cor. 12:3 ) .
Pliny , however , shows no knowledge of Christian writings in his letter . ” [ vii ]
Pliny bears witness to the practices of Christianity and the persecution from the government .
However , he offers no contribution to the historical Jesus .
As a result , he is equivalent to any other historian writing about Greek mythology .
Just because a historian writes about a certain group worshipping a god or gods , this does not validate the existence of their god or gods .
Suetonius
The Roman writer Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus ( ca. 70 - ca. 140 ) practiced law in Rome and was a friend of Pliny the Younger .
He published a book Lives of the Caesars , which covers the lives and careers of the first twelve emperors , from Julius Caesar to Domitian.[ viii ]
In the fifth section of Lives of the Caesars , Suetonius reports how emperor Claudius treated several people during his reign .
The quote claimed to support Jesus Christ is as follows , “ He ( Claudius ) expelled the Jews from Rome , since they were always making disturbances because of the instigator Chrestus . ” [ ix ]
VanVoorst claims that “ Christus ” often found confusion with “ Chrestus , ” by non-Christians .
Furthermore , the Codex Sinaiticus ( fourth century ) spells Christian with an - “ eta ” in all three New Testament occurrences of the word ( Acts 11:26 , 26:8 ; 1 Pet 4:16 ) . [ x ]
In particular , “ Christians ” were also referred to as “ Chrestians . ”
I find VanVoorst most convincing for the possibility of the connection to Jesus Christ when he claims that ‘ Chrestus ’ “ does not appear among the hundreds of names of Jews recorded by the Roman catacomb inscriptions and other sources , yet was a familiar Gentile name .
He concludes that this opens the door to the possibility that Suetonius may have confused Christus for Chrestus . ” [ xi ]
On the contrary , Bart Ehrman notes that Suetonius is probably referencing an individual “ Chrestus ” and Jesus ’ followers , since Jesus of the Gospels was executed twenty years prior to the riots .[ xii ]
My conclusion rests on the possibility of a reference to Jesus Christ here , however advances no farther than speculative evidence .
Tacitus
As a Roman historian , Tacitus is most famously known for the Annals , which covers the Roman Empire from 14 - 68 C.E. and includes information about the reign of Nero .
He records Nero ’s probable arson of Rome in order to implement his own architectural designs and how he passed the blame to Christians as a ready scapegoat .
As a result of this blame , Nero heatedly persecuted Christians and Tacitus wrote the following about this , “ But neither human effort nor the emperor ’s generosity nor the placating of the gods ended the scandalous belief that the fire had been ordered .
Therefore , to put down the rumor , Nero substituted as culprits and punished in the most unusual ways those hated for their shameful acts , whom the crowd called “ Chrestians . ”
The founder of this name , Christ , had been executed in the reign of Tiberius by the procurator Pontius Pilate . ” [ xiii ]
Indeed , emperor Nero used Christians as a scapegoat to explain the fire , which broke out in Rome ( 64 A.D. ) .
Tacitus mentions that the Christians were likely not the cause of the fire , but used the fire as an excuse to persecute Christians .
The Annals do not prove that Jesus Christ existed but merely that Christians existed in the First Century A.D. , which no scholar has ever disputed .
Since Tacitus recorded The Annals one hundred years after Jesus ’ proposed existence , this lacks historical reliability .
It is important to remember that the negative evidence cited above is not “ absence of evidence , ” but rather “ evidence of absence . ”
In science , negative evidence is often as important as positive evidence .
Josephus :
As a Jewish historian , Josephus briefly mentions Jesus two times in the Antiquities .
Josephus mentions James “ the brother of Jesus who is called Messiah ” ( Ant. 20.9.1 ) .
While Josephus does discuss many individuals with the name Jesus in the Antiquities , he does not refer to any of them as “ Messiah . ”
I believe this is a reference to the Jesus of the Gospels since no other Jesus was associated with “ Messiah ” or called by its definition , “ the anointed one . ”
While I grant this as a reference to Jesus of the Gospels , the credibility of this reference remains highly contestable .
For instance , Josephus ’ other reference has him professing faith in Jesus , calling him Messiah when Josephus never became a Christian in the first place .
“ Now there was about this time Jesus , a wise man , if it be lawful to call him a man ; for he was a doer of wonderful works , a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure .
He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles .
He was [ the ] Christ .
And when Pilate at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us , had condemned him to the cross , those that loved him at the first did not forsake him ; for he appeared to them alive again the third day ; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him .
And the tribe of Christians , so named from him , are not extinct at this day . ”
Since Christian scribes copied Josephus ’ writings through the Middle Ages , it is controversial whether his references to Jesus were altered or not .
While Christians quote this passage as reliable evidence to Jesus ’ existence , teachings , and resurrection , these references did not show up in the writings of Josephus until centuries after his death , at the beginning of the fourth century .
Thoroughly dishonest church historian Eusebius is credited as the real author .
The passage is out of context , which points to text alteration .
All scholars agree that Josephus , a Jew who never converted to Christianity , would not have called Jesus “ the Christ ” or “ the truth , ” so the passage must have been doctored by a later Christian–evidence , by the way , that some early believers were in the habit of altering texts to the advantage of their theological agenda .
The phrase “ to this day ” reveals it was written at a later time .
Everyone agrees there was no “ tribe of Christians ” during the time of Josephus–Christianity did not get off the ground until the second century .
If Jesus were truly important to history , then Josephus should have told us something about him .
Yet he is completely silent about the supposed miracles and deeds of Jesus .
He adds nothing to the Gospel narratives and tells us nothing that would not have been known by Christians in either the first or fourth centuries .
The paragraph mentions that the divine prophets foretold Jesus , but Josephus does not tell what they said or us who those prophets were .
If Jesus had truly been the fulfillment of Jewish prophecy , then Josephus would have been the exact person to confirm it .

Whenever the two American journalists imprisoned in North Korea go home , analysts doubt they 'll emerge with tales from inside the sprawling gulag where 200,000 North Koreans are thought to be confined .
Those who have attempted to glean insights into North Korea 's draconian prison system believe that Laura Ling and Euna Lee – each sentenced Monday to 12 years of " hard labor " – will serve in a conventional jail or a facility run by the national security agency .
" North Korea has four or five different kinds of correctional facilities , " says Won Ki Choi , a longtime analyst of North Korean affairs , now based in Washington .
A concentration camp – a gulag – is the last possibility . "
Mr. Choi cites contacts inside North Korea saying that Ms. Ling and Ms. Lee were being held in a " guest house " operated by the North 's security agency after soldiers picked them up on March 17 on the Tumen River border with China .
Reporting on human rights
The women had been filming a documentary for Current TV , the Internet cable network of which former US vice president Al Gore is chairman .
North Korean authorities accused them of committing " hostile acts " and entering the country illegally , but it 's unclear whether they had crossed the river or were standing on the ice in the middle .
They had been reporting on North Korean human rights abuses , a topic that upsets North Korean officials .
They were focusing on North Korean women who flee to China .
It is still not clear if North Korean authorities picked up the film they had already shot .
The producer and cameraman on the project , Mitch Koss , escaped .
He has not revealed publicly what he saw or whether he got away with his equipment and videotape .
Nor is there any indication from North Korea of what has happened to the women since their trial opened June 4 .
" North Korea thinks these journalists are very valuable , " Choi says .
" Maybe they go from their four - or five - star state guest house to a one - star facility .
Otherwise , when they get out they will give a big news conference and say how badly they were treated .
North Korea is not that foolish . "
No hard labor , but ' awful ' conditions
Analysts agree North Korea is not likely to subject the women to the horrors of life in a gulag , despite the allusion to " hard labor " in the brief announcement carried by Pyongyang 's Korean Central News Agency .
Still , they believe Lee and Ling face a terrible existence while remaining in the North as pawns in a worsening confrontation between North Korea and the US .
" North Korean prisons are called labor reform institutes , " says Kim Sang Hun , who has been aiding North Korea refugees ever since retiring from the UN World Food Program 15 years ago .
" They will not be held with ordinary North Korean prisoners but in separate facilities .
They know some day they will be released . "
Still , Mr. Kim continues , life in a North Korean prison " will be awful . "
Lee and Ling " will have no beatings and no hard work , " he says , " but they will get very little food and will be very hungry . "
He believes they will remain " in solitary cells , " unable to communicate with one another and only rarely visited by a diplomat from the Swedish embassy , which represents US interests in Pyongyang .
Ling 's sister did secret film in North
It will be " out of the question " for family members to see them , Kim continues .
One reason may be that , several years ago Ling 's older sister , Lisa Ling , posing as a member of a medical team , did a National Geographic documentary with a hidden camera .
The film provided devastating insights into life in the North and the level of thought control imposed by the regime .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version misidentified Laura Ling 's sister . ]
On the basis of interviews with numerous defectors , Kim says prisoners are poorly clothed and typically suffer from extreme heat in the summer and terrible cold in the winter ; their diets consist of small portions of rice or wheat .
Dear Cecil : I recently discovered your site / column , and after spending days and nights reading , I 'm convinced you are indeed the world 's smartest person and so best qualified to answer my question :
Who made money during the 1929 stock market crash ?
I know being so smart , you 're probably laughing all the way to the bank during this one .
Bernard , currently in Accra , Ghana
Cecil replies :
Ca n’t complain , but smart did n’t have much to do with it .
Forget to invest in your retirement account : if you do n’t bet , you ca n’t lose .
You ca n’t beat a system like that .
Tales of people making out like bandits just before or during the 1929 stock market crash are relatively rare , possibly because the fortunate few kept it to themselves given the mood of the times .
But we can be certain some did well — a panic sale for one guy often means an easy profit for somebody else .
Years ago I told how Joseph Kennedy , father of John F. et al , made his fortune in part by liquidating stocks right before the crash .
Joe was n’t the only operator out there .
Here are the stories of a few more :
The classic way to profit in a declining market is via a short sale — selling stock you ’ve borrowed ( e.g. , from a broker ) in hopes the price will drop , enabling you to buy cheaper shares to pay off the loan .
One famous character who made money this way in the 1929 crash was speculator Jesse Lauriston Livermore .
Starting humbly as a chalkboard boy at Paine Webber , he began looking for patterns in the market and making imaginary bets that earned him fortunes in his diary .
By age 16 he was playing with real money as a successful stock trader .
Sometimes he was lucky — he made a bundle selling short right before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , which one assumes he had n’t foreseen .
Other times he just played his cards right .
In 1907 he sold short during a market crash and cleared more than $ 1 million .
Livermore made his share of mistakes , often losing big in the commodities markets and going bankrupt at least once .
But he kept roaring back .
He made a few million betting the right way in the World War I bull market of 1916 and claimed he ’d made $ 3 million in 1925 shorting wheat .
That was just a warm - up for the real fun during the 1929 crash , when he sold short and made more than $ 100 million — serious money even now and a monster jackpot then .
If he ’d been smart he would have quit right there and lived a life of ease .
Uh-uh .
He contrived to once again lose most of his money and in 1933 married noted “ black widow ” Harriet Metz Noble , whose four previous husbands had all committed suicide .
Just after Thanksgiving 1940 Livermore joined the club by shooting himself in the head .
Some people made money the old - fashioned way during the crash — i.e. , by stealing it .
After the initial crisis on Black Thursday , a group of high - powered bankers tried to stabilize the market by using a $ 130 million pool of funds to buy stocks , sometimes at prices above market value .
A member of the group , Albert H. Wiggin , head of Chase National Bank , began short selling his own portfolio at the same time he was committing his bank ’s money to buying .
He shorted more than 42,000 shares , making more than $ 4 million .
Because he used a Canadian shell company to buy the stocks , he did n’t even pay taxes on his gains .
Though forced to resign in disgrace , Wiggin otherwise went unpunished and got to keep the money , the jerk .
Charles Edwin Mitchell stole less than Wiggin but is remembered as one of the villains of 1929 because he not only took care of himself , he managed to impoverish everybody else .
Not long before the crash he orchestrated a high - pressure campaign to sell $ 650 million of stock in his National City Bank at an average price of more than $ 340 per share .
By 1933 the stock would be selling for less than a tenth that amount .
He then sold 18,300 shares of stock to his wife and later bought it back for a tax loss of nearly $ 3 million , which meant he paid no income taxes for 1929 despite substantial earnings .
Questioned about these transactions by a Senate committee , Mitchell admitted the scam and was charged with tax evasion in 1933 .
He was acquitted of the criminal counts by a jury , but the government won a civil judgment of more than $ 1 million in back taxes .
A few people profited in the run-up to the crash because they kept their greed in check .
Speculators Bernard Baruch and John Raskob got out of the market in early 1929 , sensing trouble ahead .
His fortune intact , Baruch remained a respected figure and advisor to presidents till the end of his long life .
Raskob later suffered heavy losses when Anaconda Copper shares tanked but remained wealthy enough to develop the Empire State Building , suggesting the truth of the trader ’s maxim : there ’s a place for bulls and bears but not pigs .

Oil 's surge to near $ 70 a barrel has stoked fresh debate about what 's driving the market -- and where prices may be headed if the economy is turning up .
Edward Silver , a former Times staff writer who keeps a close eye on the energy market , offers some context on the latest price action , and the global supply / demand equation :
The world consumes 30 billion barrels of oil a year .
Without it , our food does n’t make it to the supermarket and our flights to Hawaii are grounded .
Too bad the price is set by such a moody bunch .
Crude gained 3.2 % to $ 68.44 a barrel in futures trading last week , but prices seesawed along the way .
Again , bulls won the tussle .
An $ 85 - a - barrel yearend forecast from Goldman Sachs and more hints of economic recovery -- including surprising strength in Chinese manufacturing -- overshadowed flush oil stockpiles and other dismal data indicating a weak appetite in the United States , which still devours almost a quarter of global output .
Even before the economic signs turned more encouraging , oil was sizzling .
Prices have more than doubled since crude visited the low - $ 30s in February .
The falling dollar has helped , as some investors have turned to raw materials as a hedge against the greenback 's slide .
Clearly , instability is in the DNA of our primary energy source .
Only a year ago , oil was on an epic ascent , driven by exuberant traders to a peak of $ 147 a barrel in July .
The industry was vilified .
Priuses were sold out .
Some analysts set targets of $ 200 a barrel .
Yet in short order , the recession and credit crunch rewrote the script for the rest of 2008 .
Those traders turned morose , vaporizing almost 80 % of the commodity ’s value in five chaotic months .
In the aftermath , big oil companies and the petrostates of the world have been grappling with a surplus and paring production to shore up the market .
Demand for crude , however , is considerably less volatile than the price .
Even as the rally unfolded this spring , commentators often repeated the view that the price strength made no sense because fuel use had collapsed .
But " collapsed " does n’t describe a world market that will shrink a measly 3 % this year to 83.2 million barrels a day , according to the International Energy Agency .
Though fewer Americans took long car trips over Memorial Day weekend , China ’s 8 - million - barrel - a- day habit will see a dent of only 70,000 a day this year , the IEA says .
In fact , the Asian giant burned more oil this April than last April .
And all those tankers filled with surplus crude that bearish observers point out ?
Combined , these floating warehouses hold just over a single day ’s worth of global use .
Wall Street , bullish oil traders and the Obama administration all are betting that the U.S. economy will look better in the second half than the first , of course .
In its mid-May report , the Energy Department assumes the beginnings of a recovery in consumption .
It forecasts only a slight pullback in U.S. oil use this year , to 18.9 million barrels a day from 19.4 million in 2008 , and an uptick in 2010 .

If we take a look at some of the numbers behind the Waxman - Markey Bill , we get a clearer sense of its ambition , its limitations and the winners and losers .
Content of the Bill
From reading much of the coverage of the bill , one might be forgiven for believing that the bill is nothing more than a cap - and - trade scheme .
In point of fact it is a lot more than just a trading scheme .
The bill includes provisions that mandate emission performance standards for new coal - fired power stations , making it virtually mandatory for such sites to install CCS .
It includes a mandatory nationwide renewable energy standard and funding provisions for a range of renewable energy , energy efficiency and clean transport technologies .
The bill also sets objectives to reduce tropical deforestation and it would make use of the revenue generated from allowance allocations to fund domestic and international adaptation , as well as international technology transfer .
You ’ll find an overview of the bill here .
Coverage of Cap-and - Trade
The bill proposes a cap - and - trade scheme which would cover 84.5 % of US emissions by 2016 .
This compares more than favourably with the EU ’s coverage of just 52 percent ( assuming the proposals to extend the scope of the EU ETS are accepted ) , or the coverage under the proposed Australian CPRS of about 75 percent .
When we take into account that the bill also allows for the participation of domestic emission offsets , it is evident that there will be very few US emissions sources that will not participate in the scheme in one way or another .
Emissions Reductions
The bill would cap emissions from large sources at 17 % below 2005 levels in 2020 and at 83 % below 2005 levels in 2050 .
Relative to the EPA ’s projected business - as - usual emissions , this is equivalent to an emissions reduction of 1.4 Gt - CO2 and 7.1 Gt - CO2 respectively .
If these targets are met , US per capita emission will fall from their current level of about 24.5t - CO2 , to 17.8t - CO2 in 2020 and 3.07t - CO2 in 2050 .
The latter figure is in line with the attainment of a global emissions target of 27 Gt - CO2 , assuming all other countries are able to achieve the same per capita emissions .
By 2050 the US emissions per unit of GDP would have declined to one - tenth of their current levels .
Role of International Emissions Offsets
The bill allows for liable parties under the cap - and - trade scheme to use up to 2 billion emission offsets per year in order to meet their emissions caps .
Half of these emissions offsets may be obtained from international projects .
Given the emission reductions that are required to achieve the caps , this would mean that the US could meet its entire emission reduction task using international offsets from the beginning of the scheme through until 2018 .
Thereafter , the US could meet 70 percent of its emission reduction task in 2020 with the use of international offsets , falling to 14 percent by 2050 .
Effects on the Global Carbon Market
In 2016 , 5.4 billion allowances will be allocated or auctioned under the proposed scheme .
Compare this with the 1.9 billion EU ETS allowances that would be allocated or auctioned in 2016 under the proposals for Phase III of the EU ETS .
In terms of the underlying carbon asset , the proposed US scheme would be almost three times the size of the expanded EU ETS .
Renewables Development
The bill mandates the generation of 20 percent of total electricity from renewable sources by 2020 , with the possibility to use energy efficiency measures to cover 5 percent of the target .
This would equate to a renewable energy target of 650 TWh ( given the EIA forecast of electricity consumption in the US in 2020 is 4,311 TWh and assuming energy efficiency measures are used to cover 5 percent of the target ) .
Current renewable capacity in the US ( excluding conventional hydro ) is about 30 GW and generates about 100 TWh of electricity per year .
So to achieve the target , will require the development of about 120GW of new renewable capacity , which is about four times greater than the current installed renewable capacity ( excluding conventional hydro ) .
However , the bill is less ambitious than it at first appears .
This is because the earlier American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) has already provided a significant boost to renewables , which the EIA estimates will be in the order of 50 GW of additional new renewable capacity by 2020 .
So the bill itself would only add another 70 GW to that figure up to 2020 .
It is certainly less ambitious than the target proposed under the EU Renewable Energy Directive , which would require about 3,000TWh of installed new renewable generation by 2020 – almost five times greater than that proposed under the bill .
Energy Efficiency Potential
As noted above , the bill would allow States to meet 5 percent of the renewable energy standard using energy efficiency measures ( rising to 8 percent under certain circumstances ) .
This means an annual market for energy efficiency improvements of 220 TWh by 2020 , which is the equivalent of half of the UK ’s annual electricity generation .
The bill also sets forth a number of other energy efficiency provisions relating to lighting products , appliances , and commercial furnaces , as well as funding for energy efficiency technologies .
Nevertheless , energy efficiency is one area where the bill is relatively unambitious .
Even with all measures introduced as proposed in the bill , the EPA estimate that US energy intensity ( primary energy consumption per dollar of real GDP ) would fall by less than 12 percent by 2050 .
This is extremely small , when compared with the 46 percent drop in US energy intensity that was achieved between 1975 and 2005 .
Energy efficiency is the bill ’s biggest missed opportunity .
Reductions from CCS
The bill includes provisions that would effectively make it mandatory for new coal - fired power stations to install CCS technology .
In their analysis of the bill , the EPA estimates that an additional 56 GW of CCS would need to be installed by 2025 , increasing to 162 GW in 2050 .
That means 56 GW of CCS plant would need to be built in just 17 years – when there is not a single commercially operating example anywhere in the world .
Incidentally , this would also mean that approximately 300 Mt - CO2e per annum would need to be sequestered by 2025 – that is greater than the total annual emissions from a country like The Netherlands .
There is a lot riding on CCS .
The Biggest Winner is Nuclear
While the bill greatly encourages the development of renewable energy , the biggest winner is nuclear .
This is not evident from the text of the bill , but it is evident from a study of the EPA and EIA data .
In the absence of the bill , the EIA estimated that there would be 7GW of new nuclear capacity by 2025 and 12 GW of new nuclear capacity by 2050 .
However , if we look at the EPA analysis , they estimate that with the passage of the bill , new nuclear capacity would increase to 34 GW in 2025 and 161 GW in 2050 .
There is a certain rationale behind these results : fossil fuel generation is forecast to fall dramatically ; the renewable energy targets are not massively higher than the EIA was already forecasting ; and the energy efficiency measures are very modest .
These facts combine to create a significant gap in supply , which ( rightly or wrongly ) the EPA expect nuclear to fill .

Calculating Multiplicative Inverses in Modular Arithmetic
I ’m sure plenty of people already know this , but I ran into it today , and it ’s interesting … so here it is .
A common and very easy result in abstract algebra is that the ring ( where is any positive integer ) contains a multiplicative inverse for ( with ) , if and only if .
But what if you want to know what the multiplicative inverse is ?
Well , for small values of , you could just try numbers until one of them works .
It turns out that also has a multiplicative inverse ( namely , ) , so it must also be relatively prime to … that helps when we ’re doing the math mentally , but less so with a computer , since every possibility still requires some amount of work .
It turns out there ’s a slightly faster way to find multiplicative inverses in , and it ban be done by doing the calculation of by the Euclidean algorithm , and tracing our own calculation through the steps .
For those who may not remember , the Euclidean algorithm for the greatest common divisor depends on the fact that the greatest common divisor of and is the same as the greatest common divisor of and the remainder when is divided by .
So , for example : .
In our case , we start with the assumption that , so ultimately , the process will end with .
That ’s all the setup we need .
Here are the two cases for our calculation :
Case 1 : .
Clearly , the muliplicative inverse of one is one , so we are done .
Case 2 : .
Here , we reduce the problem to the next step in the chain of the Euclidean algorithm .
Restating the problem , we wish to find a such that , for any integer .
Using simple division , we know that we can write , where are integers and .
But , and this is important , we also know that ( the next step in the Euclidean algorithm ) , so we can actually refine our inequality to .
Now , by solving a smaller instance of this same problem , we can find such that .
Another way of putting this is that divides .
Now we are done .
We simply choose .
Then .
By examining each term separately , it ’s clear that this is evenly divisible by , so we have , and we ’re done .
Here ’s some code to compute this in Haskell :
inverse :: Integral a => a -> a -> a inverse q 1 = 1 inverse q p = ( n * q + 1 ) `div` p where n = p - inverse p ( q `mod` p )
And there you have it , multiplicative inverses in .

RIO DE JANEIRO , June 2 ( UPI ) -- Brazilian officials confirmed Tuesday that debris spotted in the Atlantic Ocean is wreckage from missing Air France Flight 447 .
Brazilian Defense Minister Nelson Jobim said no survivors were found , CNN reported .

The Airbus A330 was headed from Rio de Janeiro to Paris with 216 passengers and 12 crew members on board when it encountered heavy turbulence and disappeared from radar early Monday .
Floating objects , including an airplane seat and an orange life vest were spotted Tuesday about 400 miles northeast of the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha .
A French commercial vessel arrived on the scene Tuesday and confirmed the wreckage .
CNN said a Brazilian Navy ship is expected to arrive Wednesday .
While the majority of the passengers were from Brazil , France and Germany , 29 other countries were represented on the passenger list -- including two passengers from the United States , CNN said .
Among the passengers was Prince Pedro Luis de Orleans e Braganca , 26 , a member of Brazil 's non-reigning royal family , and two executives of French tire company Michelin .
A Michelin spokeswoman identified the officials as Luiz Roberto Anastacio , president of Michelin Latin America , and Antonio Gueiros , director of informatics .
Search crews will try to locate the cockpit voice and data recorders to determine the cause of the crash .
The Airbus A33O 's automatic system initiated a series of messages with the company 's maintenance computer just before it disappeared Monday , indicating several pieces of aircraft equipment had broken down , Air France Chief Executive Officer Pierre - Henri Gourgeon told CNN .
U.S. - based AccuWeather.com said updrafts from thunderstorms near Fernando De Noronha may have reached up to 100 mph , which would lead to severe turbulence for the aircraft .
Meteorologists said the stormy conditions could have played a role in the plane 's structural or electrical failure .
Hundreds of workers across England and Wales have walked out in support of nearly 650 construction contractors sacked from the Lindsey Oil Refinery .
It came after about 1,200 workers staged unofficial walkouts at the North Lincolnshire plant , in a jobs dispute .
Workers in Teesside , South Wales , Cheshire and Yorkshire are among those to have come out in support .
Expected talks aimed at resolving the dispute at Lindsey - owned by Total - have failed to go ahead , Acas has said .
The sacked Lindsey workers have been told they have until 1700 BST on Monday to reapply for their jobs .
They had been building an additional plant next to the existing site in Killingholme , but withdrew their labour last week in protest at a sub- contractor axing 51 jobs while another employer on the site was hiring people .
The workers argued this broke an agreement not to cut jobs while there were vacancies elsewhere on the site .
Total insists no such agreement was in place .
Workers insist the assurances were given in February following a bitter dispute in which they said foreign labour was being used to exclude British contractors and to undermine hard - won conditions .
What became known as the ' foreign workers row ' led to to a wave of unofficial strikes and protests at refineries and power stations across the UK .
Workers are now claiming management at the Lindsey refinery are using the redundancy process to victimise activists involved in the previous wildcat strikes .
Meanwhile , workers at a number of sites have walked out in support of those who have lost their jobs in North Lincolnshire :
In Teesside , some 1,100 construction workers on a new biofuel plant project , owned by Ensus , walked out .
A company spokesman at the site - on the Wilton chemical complex - said the action was not taken by people directly employed by them
About 300 contract workers downed tools at Aberthaw power station in south Wales , with some holding a peaceful protest outside .
The company said no RWE npower staff were involved and operations were not affected
Up to 450 contract maintenance staff walked out at the Stanlow Oil Refinery in Ellesmere Port , Cheshire .
Shell says the action will not affect production but may delay routine maintenance projects
Some contract workers have downed tools at Ferrybridge power station in West Yorkshire .
Scottish and Southern Electric say the plant is operating normally
In North Yorkshire , contract workers took support action at Drax and Eggborough power stations , near Selby .
The GMB union says the total number taking part at Drax , Eggborough and Ferrybridge is about 600 workers .
At Staythorpe power station near Newark , Nottinghamshire , 100 scaffolding contractors walked out unofficially for a second day
Workers at Fiddler 's Ferry power station in Cheshire , owned by Scottish and Southern Energy , also showed their support by walking out .
Text messages were reportedly being sent to fellow workers around the UK to encourage them to take action .
One of the sacked Lindsey workers said : " We are asking for support from workers across the country which I am sure will be given .
Total will soon realise they have unleashed a monster .
" It is disgraceful that this has happened without any consultation . "
Another sacked contract worker , John McEwan , said : " We were left no option .
If we have to defend the rights of our men on these sites and our pay and conditions then we have to do that . "
The judges ruled that black labs were unlikely to cause serious injury A dog walker who was knocked down and injured by a black labrador has failed to convince appeal judges to award her £ 160,000 in damages .
Patricia Welsh , 56 , needed surgery on her knee after the dog collided with her in Wellbank , Angus , in 2005 .
She tried to sue the labrador 's owner , Neil Brady , but a judge ruled against her as it was " a pure accident " .
Mrs Welsh appealed but the new judges ruled that black labs were unlikely to cause serious injury or death .
' Unforeseen collision ' Former college lecturer Mrs Welsh was exercising her golden retriever , Cava , at a field near her home when the black lab called Ebony ran into her .
When she took the case to the Court of Session , the judge Lord Malcolm ruled against her and warned that courts must not contribute to " the creation of a society bent in litigation " .
Lord Malcolm said : " In my view , what occurred was an unfortunate and unforeseen collision - it was a pure accident .
" If the law was to consider a labrador running in a field as something which is dangerous in itself , this would come close to making dog owners insurers in respect of all injuries and damage caused by their animals . "
The appeal , heard by Lord Nimmo Smith , Lady Dorrian and Sir David Edward QC , was based on the liability of the keeper of an animal under the 1987 Animals ( Scotland ) Act .
The legislation provides that a person will be liable for injury or damage caused if the animal belongs to a species which is generally likely to seriously injure or kill or cause damage to property .
Fell short Sir David said the question for the appeal judges became : " Are fully grown black labradors , by virtue of their physical attributes or habits , likely , unless controlled or restrained , to injure severely or kill persons or animals ? "
Ebony , a labrador bitch who weighed 25kg , was described as large , lively and boisterous .
She was considered excitable but not aggressive , although she did not always respond to commands to return to her owner .
Sir David said that Mrs Welsh 's counsel , Colin MacAulay QC , had " sought valiantly " to persuade them that there was evidence to show that labradors could be dangerous .
But he said the appeal judges considered it " fell far short " of what was required to meet the legal test and the appeal was rejected .

When you first begin a webcomic , it 's new , exciting and your head is swimming with ideas .
Much like a relationship .
As time goes on , those ideas ( that seemed fantastic at the time ) , seem immature , and at times desperate .
Much like in a relationship .
Relationships do n't only compare to webcomics , but can also apply to any new ideas or projects .
When you start something new , you will usually go at it full steam .
Then , when you get stuck or bored you wonder how you accumulated so much shit .
This is when things can go two ways :
Either you drop your project altogether and start something new , or you find something new to do with your project .
Sure , sometimes your project may be messy , can change over time or look like it is ripping apart at the seams , but it will always be something that you put your heart and soul into .
Whether it be for a fleeting moment or a lifetime .

With millions of page views every month PizzaTorrent was one of the Internet 's larger torrent meta - search engines .
Unfortunately for the site 's owner , being in the spotlight also had its downsides .
After ongoing DDoS attacks on the site the founder decided to pull the plug and shut the site down for good .
Launched last year , PizzaTorrent was a torrent meta - search engine inspired by the enormous success of YouTorrent .
The site allowed its users to search for torrents on more than a dozen torrent indexers in real - time and was one of the few torrent sites not monetized by advertisements or affiliate links to paid ‘ high - speed ’ downloads .
For the site ’s owner PizzaTorrent was mostly a fun project and a way of giving something back to the BitTorrent community .
All the money that went into it came directly from the pockets of the site ’s founder .
In the first few months after going live the site ’s popularity started to grow up to a point where it had more than 3 million page views a month .
However , as time went by the fun started to fade as well , and this eventually led to the site ’s closure .
“ I did n’t receive any legal threats .
All the difficulties really come from other kinds of attacks , ” the PizzaTorrent founder explained to TorrentFreak .
He said that with the growing number of visitors , DDoS and other attacks on the site increased .
RIP Pizza
“ My feeling is that the search engine was very misunderstood .
Or perhaps for the many people that liked it , there were just as many people that hated it .
And they decided to destroy it , ” the founder of the site said .
It is not clear to him where the attacks originated from .
“ I do n’t know if these people are connected with any anti-piracy lobby or copyright industry , or just lone snipers .
But in the end the system won , ” he told Torrent Freak .
To end all the trouble PizzaTorrent was closed for good earlier today .
There is simply no fun in running a project where you constantly have to evade attacks from unknown ‘ enemies ’ .
The founder is considering making the code public or giving it to another suitable party , so it ’s not unlikely that PizzaTorrent will reappear one way or another .
“ Remember , remember the fifth of November , ” the PizzaTorrent founder said , fading into one of the dark corners of the Internet .
Largest diamond in galaxy predicts future of solar system
Astronomers discovered the largest diamond of all times in space .
The weight of the precious stone reportedly makes up ten billion trillion trillion carats or five million trillion trillion pounds ) .
Largest diamond in galaxy predicts future of solar system
The space diamond is virtually an enormous chunk of crystallized carbon , 4,000 kilometers in diameter .
The stone is located at a distance of 50 light years from Earth , in the Constellation Centaurus .
Scientists believe that the diamond is the heart of an extinct star that used to shine like the Sun .
Astronomers have already dubbed the space diamond as Lucy in a tribute to the Beatles song ‘ Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds . ’
" You would need a jeweler 's loupe the size of the Sun to grade this diamond ! " says astronomer Travis Metcalfe ( Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ) , who leads a team of researchers that discovered the giant gem .
The cosmic stone completely outclasses all diamonds that have ever been found on Earth .
The largest diamond weighing 546 carats was found in South African Republic .
The diamond , The Star of Africa , resides in the Crown Jewels of England .
The Star of Africa was cut from the largest diamond ever found on Earth , a 3,100 - carat gem .
Lucy , also known as BPM 37093 , is actually a crystallized white dwarf .
A white dwarf is the hot core of a star , left over after the star uses up its nuclear fuel and dies .
It is made mostly of carbon and is coated by a thin layer of hydrogen and helium gases .
The white dwarf is not only radiant but also harmonious .
It rings like a gigantic gong , undergoing constant pulsations .
" By measuring those pulsations , we were able to study the hidden interior of the white dwarf , just like seismograph measurements of earthquakes allow geologists to study the interior of the Earth .
We figured out that the carbon interior of this white dwarf has solidified to form the galaxy 's largest diamond , " says Metcalfe .
Astronomers say that our Sun will die in five billion years and become a white dwarf too .
About two billion years after it will turn into a similar diamond that will continue to sparkle in the center of the solar system forever .

There are many issues going on around the world that could have a material impact on the future of oil — both short term and long term , said Matthew Simmons , chairman emeritus of Simmons International .
Citing Iran ’s presidential election controversy , Ukraine ’s conflict over natural gas , Nigeria threatening to shut down its oil system , Venezuela ’s current strike and Peru ’s domestic unrest , Simmons said all the concerns around the world will have an “ unbelievable impact on oil supplies . ”
Chavez : Venezuela hopes to sell oil at $ 100
“ If one of these 4 or 5 things turned really ugly , prices can go way higher than we ’ve seen , ” Simmons told CNBC .
“ And if 2 or 3 of them happen at the same time , I do n’t think there ’s any normal ceiling on the price of oil . ”
Simmons said although the level of demand is low , the odds of oil being stored for speculation is “ extremely low . ”
I 'm an IT contractor .
When I 'm working , I 'm insured .
I generally let my insurance lapse when I 'm between gigs .
Yeah , it 's risky , I know .
But my wife is on Medicare , parts A , B , and the newest : Medicare D , the drug benefit run by our glorious , best - care - in - the world private insurance industry .
So I 'm never worried about her .
Right ?
My job ended in mid June .
I could have worked longer , but I was just going to work doing absolutely nothing all day ( which I hate with a passion ) so I laid myself off .
Better for me , better for the company .
My last day of benefit coverage was the last day of my last working month , i.e. , June 30 .
My wife 's surgery was on June 29 , outpatient , no big deal .
Not covered by dental , which we knew going in , so we paid out of pocket .
The prescriptions were covered as usual .
The prescription ran out over the long 4th of July weekend , so she called in early Monday to her oral surgeon to approve the refill , which he did right away , and called it into our pharmacy .
She was in bed , in pain , so I drove over to get it .
They had the drug , and they filled the prescription .
But oh , by the way : your insurance coverage has been denied .
Please pay the full amount , $ 13.58 .
Huh ?
What ?
Denied ?
How can that be ?
My wife is on Medicare D . They take the payments right out of her social security , so we never miss a payment .
This is , after all , the best system in the world !
They keep telling us that , so it must be true .
I fished in my wallet and found my wife 's Medicare D drug insurance card , issued by her insurer , Humana .
A bit irate , I waved it in the face of the hapless pharmacist .
See ?
She 's covered !
Okay , okay , no need to wave that card , sir .
We 'll call it in again .
Please wait .
A long wait ... pharmacists on the phone .
I 'm wandering around the store , window shopping .
Eventually , they get back to me .
And the story turns out to be this .
When I was working , I had Blue Cross medical , and I covered my wife , just to make sure .
Blue Cross 's coverage was a little better in some respects than Medicare and I figured , why not .
But Humana found out that my wife was covered by Blue Cross , and they set a flag on her record that said : coverage will be paid by primary care provider , i.e. , Blue Cross .
Then Blue Cross went away , but the flag on my wife 's record stayed put .
So Humana said : Blue Cross pays .
And Blue Cross said : no we do n't .
Result : coverage denied .
Your multiple - payer system at work .
Or , to be more precise , at not working .
The pharmacist was surprisingly sympathetic , considering that I had chewed his head off earlier .
He gave me an 800 number to call : Humana Customer Service .
So ... to the phones again !
Another long wait .
But finally I talked to a real person at Humana Customer Service .
You 're denying my wife 's coverage , I said .
Please pay it .
Do you have other insurance ?
she asked .
Not any more , I said .
Oh , there 's a problem with the premium ?
she asked .
No .
The premium is automatically deducted from her Social Security .
We 've been paying you .
Now it 's time for you to pony up .
Hang on , she said .
Another loooong wait .
Yes , she said .
I see you 're covered by Blue Cross .
(*#&$(*&!!
No , we 're NOT covered by Blue Cross any more .
We are covered by YOU , Humana .
Your records are in error .
Now fix your records and pay the damned claim .
I see , she said .
Please hang on .
Another loooooong wait .
Mr. Pickering ?
Everything is fine now .
If you run the claim again , it should go through .
**********************************************
So they ran the claim again , and it went through .
The final bill had been reduced from $ 13.58 to a $ 5 copay .
The pharmacist was on the phone twice , once to Blue Cross and once to Humana .
I was on the phone once in one long call to Humana .
The entire episode took about an hour .
During that hour , the pharmacist wasted his time , I wasted my time , the people at Blue Cross wasted their time , all because Humana was trying to save $ 8.58 which they ended up paying anyway .
And that 's not even counting the cost for the offices and salaries of all those people Humana hires to shift the cost over to Blue Cross , and the people Blue Cross hires to shift the cost back to Humana .
You want to know why our health insurance costs so much ?
You want to know why single payer is the best option ?
Take this incident .
And multiply it by 250 million insured Americans .
That 's why .

Today , I went to the movies and was mistaken for an usher by a belligerent woman who wanted me to ask a large , intimidating man to stop smoking his cigar in the theater .
Being the gentleman that I am , I politely asked him to abstain .
He beat me up .
Then the woman effortlessly beat him up .
RML
Clumsiness is unbecoming in a lover , so if you want to be coming in your lover , you 'd better know what you 're doing .
I have * never * met a woman who did n't like it up the butt .
Perhaps not at first because of misconceptions about it or the failures of inadequate former lovers , but when they were finally with someone who knew what he was doing back there , they learned why pleasuring the 100,000 + nerve endings in the backdoor can be more fun than the 20,000 in the front .
Besides , it adds a " dirty / naughty / nasty little slut " feeling that you can't achieve vaginally .
I can't tell you how many times I 've heard " bbb...b.. bbut I 'm not supposed to like anything THERE ! " as she 's bucking around so much with a finger up her bottom ( and sometimes one tickling her G - spot in the front , too ) that I can barely keep her clit in my mouth .
I did n't mean to spend this much time on what was originally going to be a smart - assed reply , but if I 'm anything , it 's thorough , so here 's my newly created ...
I 'll say this on her behalf , " Do a LITTLE fucking research before you attempt any Anal Plundering & Pillaging , moron ! "
Most women wo n't say that , so I will say it for them .
Read that again .
If you 're truly interested in butt sex , then read about it .
Learn about it .
Get to know it .
Watching some coked up , uncle molested bleach blond whore in " Country Anal Angels 5 : The Poop Scootin ' Boogie " does n't fucking count , jackass .
If you can't be bothered to read and learn about the ...( well , I do n't wanna , but I 'll just say it ) " ins and outs " of anal intercourse , do n't even bother mentioning it to her .
If you can know the all the stats of that damned football team dating back to SuperBowl I or know how to properly set the timing on your engine , then you can damned well take the time to learn how to fuck your woman properly in the ass .
Treat her bunghole better than the way you 'd want yours treated .
Would you like the doctor to shove a half lubed , half bone dry tube up your brown eyed wonder winky ?
No ???
Well , neither would she .
Proooceeeeeeed slooooooowlllly at first .
Start with something small like a little dildo ( see note below ) , small buttplug , your finger ( gloved or ungloved ) with enough lube to make it easy going , then about 10 % more .
Have her relax .
Start by tickling her sphincter , not just ramming it straight in like it 's some sort of new Downhill Race to My Knuckle on the X - Games .
Tickle it , swirl around it , suck her clitty simultaneously .
Make use of those nerve endings and use them to your advantage .
Give her some butt - foreplay and pretty soon it will start feeling " empty ...lonely " and " needing something " in it .
Then go in a little further and take your time while you 're doing it .
Slowly continue the circles and it wo n't be long until she " needs more " .
Lather , rinse , repeat .
( well , OK , do n't " rinse " )
Get her to enjoy two or three fingers before you try plowing her virgin garden with the mighty manly sausage o' love .
Your fingers have the advantage of being " incremental " .
Two fingers is only slightly more than one which is only slightly more than none .
Your cock is n't .
It goes from nothing to something with very little transition .
That 's useful later , but not to an anal virgin .
You 're lubing an asshole , not packing your wheel bearings .
Would you like to walk around with a greasy , Vaselined crack for two days because of ten minutes of pleasure ?
Neither will she .
You do n't have to use some petroleum based grease to get in there initially .
Of course , that may not apply to extended anal sessions later .
You do n't even have to use some special anal lube .
Waterbased lubes clean up with soap and water .
Use 'em !
Brands like Wet and ( our favorite ) Liquid Silk are fantastic anal lubes .
Keep it handy , though .
Her butt is n't " self basting " ( sorry , it 's November ) like her vagina is .
If you sense things drying up , take the upper hand and squirt a little more on , you moron .
( sidenote :
Be sure you do n't leave anything labeled " Anal Lube " or " Ass Grease " on the table when someone 's taking a digital picture of you . )
DANGEROUS ROAD AHEAD - PROCEED WITH CAUTION
So you finally have the chance to put your cock / favorite dildo / buttplug where all that sunshine comes out .
Lube that thing .
Use a condom if you are n't disease free and mutually SEXclusive .
Take it slowly .
Remember the transition period that the head of your cock does not provide .
provide .
Let her " adjust " to to fullness of it .
Take your friction on the " out " When you 're finally in , do n't start fucking it like a cunt .
When you 're finally in , do n't start fucking it like a cunt .
Do n't let her hole slam shut .
Do n't pull all the way out then slam it back in , even if she likes that in her pussy .
" Why ? " you ask , because her asshole is n't her pussy .
( Chances are that you are her asshole , but I digress . )
There is n't a rubber band constantly trying to close the entrance to her vagina to keep things out , ( the proper term for that is a " wedding band " , HAH ! ) so you have to treat it differently .
While you can do this later when you 're both a lot more experienced anally , do n't do it now .
Positions Doggie style first .
Enjoy seeing her butt and back for awhile .
Get to know what you 're doing before you try ...

Turnabout 's Fair Play - Yup , it is .
Do n't expect her to submit to your filhty perversions , you bastard , if you wo n't let her do it to you .
You may / probably will end up liking it since you have just as many nerve endings there as does she .
You 're not gay until you 're cooling off with a Zima after installing the tracklighting for your buddy " Steve " .
Do n't be rude !
Few and far between are the women who can come 100 % from anal stimulation ( unlike you .... YES YOU .
If you still have your prostate , you could actually be forced to ejaculate by rubbing it with a finger . )
Do n't be a dick and make her masturbate herself .
Give her the ultimate gift* : a reach - around and do it for her .
* " ultimate " as far as I do n't know a better gift to give while your penis is in their rectum .
Speaking of being a Gentleman ButtFucker , a warm washcloth , wiped gently front to back first , then only around and towards the anal area , is usually appreciated after you 've just slammed your salami into her hieney for a half hour .
DANGER , WILL ROBINSON ! -
Be sure to listen to her when she cums .
The window of opportunity for you may be closing if it's her final , rip roaring orgasm , so be prepared .
Hell , by that point , most men have been thinking about Harry Carry singing " Take Me Out to the Ballgame " for awhile .
Do n't do anything that could cause a trip to the hospital .
This includes fucking with dildos that could be lost ( there 's a reason why buttplugs have that base ) , anything made out of regular glass ( Pyrex and borosilicate glass dildos excluded , light bulbs definitely INCLUDED ) , or anything that could be pinched in two by an orgasmic anus .
There 's nothing that will bring a woman back down to earth with a rock solid THUD than realizing that you only have half of that 1/4 pound weiner from Costco in your hand .
By the way , did you know that some candles melt at body temperature and that some colored candles from overseas use lead in the color coat ?
Things that can cause a trip to the hospital also includes ...
Hole Jumping -
In short , there 's a reason why poop comes out where it does .
All of the flora and fauna in our bodies have specific purposes and they should n't mix .
Well , the truth is that they can mix , but in one direction only : pussy -> butt .
( No one I know has ever had any trouble with it , but I 'm not a doctor .
( I do , however , play one in the bedroom . ) )
After something comes out of her butt , absolutely under no circumstances should it go anywhere but to the sink to be washed or to a " staging towel " , but you know what I mean .
This goes for your dick , too .
Do n't be rubbing it anywhere .
If she has go to her doctor because of an infection , the doctor will know that it 's all because of her asshole ... the one she used to date .
What about YOU , though ?
What about YOUR NEEDS ? -
Well , if you do get a little dirty , then good .
it 's an asshole , you idiot .
At least you 're not going to get her pregnant , just take a shower and use some antibacterial soap .
Oh , and grow some nuts if you 're going to be pussy about it .
Speaking of ...
…using black magic , of course .
Summary via Pharyngula :
The laughing fellow on the left is Sanal Edamaruku , president of Rationalist International and atheist .
The cranky old man in the robes on the right is Pandit Surinder Sharma , a self - described Tantrik Magician .
The scene is in a studio on Indian television , where the magician is trying to kill the atheist with sorcery .
Sharma had said he could kill anyone with sympathetic magic inflicted on a doll made of dough , and that he could accomplish this in a mere three minutes … so Edamaruku confidently offered himself as a victim .
The old fake went on for hours and failed .
After nearly two hours , the anchor declared the tantrik ’s failure .
The tantrik , unwilling to admit defeat , tried the excuse that a very strong god whom Sanal might be worshipping obviously protected him .
“ No , I am an atheist , ” said Sanal Edamaruku .
Finally , the disgraced tantrik tried to save his face by claiming that there was a never - failing special black magic for ultimate destruction , which could , however , only been done at night .
Bad luck again , he did not get away with this , but was challenged to prove his claim this very night in another “ breaking news ” live program .
Edamaruku obliged and willing went to his “ doom ” that night .
The encounter took place under the open night sky .
The tantrik and his two assistants were kindling a fire and staring into the flames .
Sanal was in good humour .
Once the ultimate magic was invoked , there would n’t be any way back , the tantrik warned .
Within two minutes , Sanal would get crazy , and one minute later he would scream in pain and die .
Did n’t he want to save his life before it was too late ?
Sanal laughed , and the countdown begun .
The tantriks chanted their “ Om lingalingalingalinga , kilikilikili …. ” followed by ever changing cascades of strange words and sounds .
The speed increased hysterically .
They threw all kinds of magic ingredients into the flames that produced changing colours , crackling and fizzling sounds and white smoke .
While chanting , the tantrik came close to Sanal , moved his hands in front of him and touched him , but was called back by the anchor .
After the earlier covert attempts of the tantrik to use force against Sanal , he was warned to keep distance and avoid touching Sanal .
But the tantrik “ forgot ” this rule again and again .
Now the tantrik wrote Sanal ’s name on a sheet of paper , tore it into small pieces , dipped them into a pot with boiling butter oil and threw them dramatically into the flames .
Nothing happened .
Singing and singing , he sprinkled water on Sanal , mopped a bunch of peacock feathers over his head , threw mustard seed into the fire and other outlandish things more .
Sanal smiled , nothing happened , and time was running out .
Only seven more minutes before midnight , the tantrik decided to use his ultimate weapon : the clod of wheat flour dough .
He kneaded it and powdered it with mysterious ingredients , then asked Sanal to touch it .
Sanal did so , and the grand magic finale begun .
The tantrik pierced blunt nails on the dough , then cut it wildly with a knife and threw them into the fire .
That moment , Sanal should have broken down .
But he did not .
He laughed .
Forty more seconds , counted the anchor , twenty , ten , five … it ’s over !

The Great Tantra Challenge
On 3 March 2008 , in a popular TV show , Sanal Edamaruku , the president of Rationalist International , challenged India ’s most “ powerful ” tantrik ( black magician ) to demonstrate his powers on him .
That was the beginning of an unprecedented experiment .
After all his chanting of mantra ( magic words ) and ceremonies of tantra failed , the tantrik decided to kill Sanal Edamaruku with the “ ultimate destruction ceremony ” on live TV .
Sanal Edamaruku agreed and sat in the altar of the black magic ritual .
India TV observed skyrocketing viewership rates .
Everything started , when Uma Bharati ( former chief minister of the state of Madhya Pradesh ) accused her political opponents in a public statement of using tantrik powers to inflict damage upon her .
In fact , within a few days , the unlucky lady had lost her favorite uncle , hit the door of her car against her head and found her legs covered with wounds and blisters .
India TV , one of India ’s major Hindi channels with national outreach , invited Sanal Edamaruku for a discussion on “ Tantrik power versus Science ” .
Pandit Surinder Sharma , who claims to be the tantrik of top politicians and is well known from his TV shows , represented the other side .
During the discussion , the tantrik showed a small human shape of wheat flour dough , laid a thread around it like a noose and tightened it .
He claimed that he was able to kill any person he wanted within three minutes by using black magic .
Sanal challenged him to try and kill him .
The tantrik tried .
He chanted his mantras ( magic words ) : “ Om lingalingalinalinga , kilikili … . ”
But his efforts did not show any impact on Sanal – not after three minutes , and not after five .
The time was extended and extended again .
The original discussion program should have ended here , but the “ breaking news ” of the ongoing great tantra challenge was overrunning all program schedules .
Now the tantrik changed his technique .
He started sprinkling water on Sanal and brandishing a knife in front of him .
Sometimes he moved the blade all over his body .
Sanal did not flinch .
Then he touched Sanal ’s head with his hand , rubbing and rumpling up his hair , pressing his forehead , laying his hand over his eyes , pressing his fingers against his temples .
When he pressed harder and harder , Sanal reminded him that he was supposed to use black magic only , not forceful attacks to bring him down .
The tantrik took a new run : water , knife , fingers , mantras .
But Sanal kept looking very healthy and even amused .
After nearly two hours , the anchor declared the tantrik ’s failure .
The tantrik , unwilling to admit defeat , tried the excuse that a very strong god whom Sanal might be worshipping obviously protected him .
“ No , I am an atheist , ” said Sanal Edamaruku .
Finally , the disgraced tantrik tried to save his face by claiming that there was a never - failing special black magic for ultimate destruction , which could , however , only been done at night .
Bad luck again , he did not get away with this , but was challenged to prove his claim this very night in another “ breaking news ” live program .
During the next three hours , India TV ran announcements for The Great Tantra Challenge that called several hundred million people to their TV sets .
The encounter took place under the open night sky .
The tantrik and his two assistants were kindling a fire and staring into the flames .
Sanal was in good humour .
Once the ultimate magic was invoked , there would n’t be any way back , the tantrik warned .
Within two minutes , Sanal would get crazy , and one minute later he would scream in pain and die .
Did n’t he want to save his life before it was too late ?

That moment , Sanal should have broken down .
But he did not .
He laughed .
Forty more seconds , counted the anchor , twenty , ten , five … it ’s over !
Millions of people must have uttered a sigh of relief in front their TVs .
Sanal was very much alive .
Tantra power had miserably failed .
Tantriks are creating such a scaring atmosphere that even people , who know that black magic has no base , can just break down out of fear , commented a scientist during the program .
It needs enormous courage and confidence to challenge them by actually putting one ’s life at risk , he said .
By doing so , Sanal Edamaruku has broken the spell , and has taken away much of the fear of those who witnessed his triumph .
In this night , one of the most dangerous and wide spread superstitions in India suffered a severe blow .

An Amsterdam court has ordered The Pirate Bay to block all Dutch visitors to its website , threatening the site administrators with daily fines for noncompliance .
Dutch antipiracy group Stichting BREIN , whose website is still down from an extended denial of service attack , filed a suit against the three Pirate Bay administrators who were found guilty earlier this year of aiding copyright infringement in Sweden — despite the fact that the three claim not to own the site .
( They say it is owned by a Seychelles company called Reservella . )
None of the men showed up in the Dutch court , claiming they had heard nothing of the lawsuit ( BREIN says that it contacted them through mail , e-mail , Twitter , and Facebook ) .
Peter Sunde ,
The Pirate Bay 's most public face , also announced that he was filing a defamation suit ( in Sweden ) against Tim Kuik , BREIN 's chief .
The court 's injunction is preliminary — BREIN will need to apply for a permanent injunction before this one expires in two months .
Sunde and his two co-defendants are ordered to block all Dutch traffic to their site and face a � 30,000 fine per day for noncompliance .
Sunde claimed on his Twitter feed today that " none of us have access to even block everything , so good luck with that .
I wrote a letter to the court telling them that . "
He 's also looking for a " good lawyer that can work for free , since we have no cash . "
Sunde and his codefendants were hit with a shared 30 million kronor fine at the end of their Swedish court case — that 's worth about $ 4 million , or $ 1 million per defendant .
But the Dutch fines for not implementing the required block could reach as high as �3 million ( $ 4.2 million ) .
Ironically ,
The Pirate Bay crew could owe more cash in a case they claim not even to have been notified about than in their insanely high - profile " Spectrial " in Sweden earlier this year .
Obama a fan of ' the great Urdu poets '
The fact that President Obama had good Pakistani friends at Columbia in college was one that was basically kept out of his campaign on the theory that anything with any connection to Islam would feed a viral rumor the campaign was trying to kill .
Now , though , it 's another useful diplomatic tool , as in his interview with Dawn this weekend :
‘ Any plan to visit Pakistan in the near future ? ’
‘ I would love to visit .
As you know , I had Pakistani roommates in college who were very close friends of mine .
I went to visit them when I was still in college ; was in Karachi and went to Hyderabad .
Their mothers taught me to cook , ’ said Mr Obama .
‘ What can you cook ? ’
‘ Oh , keema … daal … You name it , I can cook it .
And so I have a great affinity for Pakistani culture and the great Urdu poets . ’
‘ You read Urdu poetry ? ’
‘ Absolutely .
So my hope is that I ’m going to have an opportunity at some point to visit Pakistan , ’ said Mr Obama .
The U.S. Department of Justice has begun to look into the way that large operators form exclusivity agreements for popular handsets over concerns that the practice is anticompetitive , according to a report in The Wall Street Journal citing unnamed people familiar with the matter .
According to the report , published online on Monday , the DOJ may be looking broadly at ways that large telecom operators , including AT&T and Verizon , may be acting anticompetitively .
Other issues include ways that operators restrict the kinds of services that can be offered on their networks , the Journal reported .
The DOJ does reveal when it is officially investigating a matter .
It has n't yet in this case , which could mean it is now considering whether to launch an official investigation .
The agency declined to comment for this story .
Consumer Interest
Public interest groups applauded the news of a potential investigation .
" The focus of the Department 's investigation should be on the clearly anti-competitive rates , terms and conditions imposed by AT&T and Verizon on the high - capacity broadband market , " wrote the NoChokepoints coalition , a group that urges the Federal Communications Commission to do more to improve competition in the broadband market , in a statement .
Public Knowledge , a public interest group , also supports a DOJ investigation .
" Consumers have suffered over the past ten years as the industry has consolidated and strengthened its hold over which services can be offered and which equipment can be used .
Competition is almost nonexistent in crucial services for home and business use , " Gigi Sohn , president of Public Knowledge , said in a statement .
If the DOJ does launch an official investigation , it will be a direct result of the change at the White House , and not because of any specific new kinds of deals or services , said Evan Stewart , a lawyer with Zuckerman Spaeder who practices antitrust law .
" Clearly the Obama administration and the people they 've installed at the Justice Department and the [ Federal Trade Commission ] have made it clear they view antitrust laws differently than the Bush people , " he said .
While the investigators may be interested in the telecom segment in part because of the way it 's grown , they may ultimately have trouble making a case , he said .
When companies in an industry grow primarily through market consolidation , rather than internal growth , antitrust questions arise , he said .
The dominant telecom providers have all grown into their positions through acquisitions .
However , particularly in mobile , no one provider has a big enough market share to cause concern , he said .
Even the largest operator , Verizon , has less than 30 percent market share .
Exclusivity Eyed
The DOJ may be specifically interested in the issue of exclusive handset deals , following concern that some members of Congress have recently expressed over the practice .
The Committee on Commerce , Science and Transportation held a hearing last month to discuss the effect that long - term exclusivity deals have on the wireless market and particularly on people living in rural areas .
Smaller rural operators argue that exclusive handset deals turn rural customers into second - class citizens because in some cases they have no option to buy the latest and most popular phones .
Even though the DOJ has n't confirmed that it has launched an investigation , Senator John Kerry , a Massachusetts Democrat who presided over the recent hearing , commended the administration 's review of exclusive cell - phone deals .
" This is the kind of healthy oversight we want to see , " Kerry said in a statement .
" During our committee 's examination of exclusive deals between cell phone manufactures and wireless providers , it was clear that we need to know more about how these contracts affect competition in the marketplace and its impact on consumers .
As the future of communication continues to move out of the ground and into the airwaves , it is important that we ensure the wireless market remains competitive and consumers are protected . "
Operators like AT&T , which is in the spotlight because its deal for the popular Apple iPhone is unusually long , say that such arrangements promote innovation .
AT&T is in the second year of its exclusive arrangement for the iPhone and while the companies have n't revealed how long the deal will last , many people believe it is expected to go on for five years .
Before the deal between AT&T and Apple for the iPhone , exclusive agreements more commonly lasted for a period of months , not years .
At the recent hearing , Kerry and other senators struggled to understand AT&T 's reasoning for how such deals promote innovation .
AT&T is also among operators at the center of the debate over whether wireless operators should be able to forbid certain applications from running on their networks .
The operator is not yet supporting picture messaging on the iPhone , nor tethering , which would let users connect their iPhones to laptops for Internet access on their computers .
AT&T did not reply to a request for comment about the potential DOJ investigation .
Grant Gross in Washington , D.C. , contributed to this report .
Rob at Boing Boing Gadgets thinks that Node — a power outlet that can accept several cables safely — may be the power outlet of tomorrow .
I completely agree with him .

Better Django models
Using model managers and improving query performance
In Django , most interactions with a database are through its Object - Relational Mapper ( ORM ) , a feature Django shares with other recent Web frameworks , such as Rails .
ORMs are increasingly popular with developers , as they automate many common interactions with a database and use familiar object - oriented approaches rather than SQL statements .
Django programmers may choose to bypass the native ORM in favor of the popular SQLAlchemy package , but although SQLAlchemy is quite powerful , it is also more difficult to use and requires more lines of code .
Django applications can and have been developed using SQLAlchemy instead of the native ORM , but some of the most attractive features of Django , such as its automatically generated administrative interface , require use of the ORM .
Frequently used acronyms API : Application programming interface
Application programming interface HTML : Hypertext Markup Language
Hypertext Markup Language RDBMS : Relational database management system
Relational database management system SQL : Structured Query Language
This article sheds light on some of the lesser - known features of the Django ORM in particular , but SQLAlchemy users may find some of the cautions about inefficient query generation applicable to their own code .
Software versions used in this article include :
Django V1.0.2 ( parts 1 and 2 )
Django V1.1 alpha ( part 3 )
sqlite3
Python V2.4-2.6
( Django does not yet support Python V3 . )
IPython ( for the sample output )
The Django ORM supports many database back ends , but sqlite3 is the easiest to install and comes bundled with many operating systems .
These examples should work with any back end .
For a list of databases that Django supports , see Related topics .
Avoiding common traps in ORM query generation
Django 's design encourages an agile - development style that rewards rapid prototyping and experimentation .
In early stages , it 's best not to worry about performance and instead favor readability and ease of implementation .
Sometimes , it does n't take long to hit performance problems .
Often , it happens the first time you try your application with real data .
It may become obvious when the test suite execution creeps over the five - minute mark , but contains just a few tests .
Other times , the application is just noticeably slow .
Luckily , there are some easily identifiable patterns that are correspondingly easy to fix .
A common case is shown in Listing 1 ( the application 's models . py file ) and Listing 2 .
Listing 1 . Basic models for the examples application : models.py
from django.db import models #
Some kind of document , like a blog post or a wiki page class Document ( models .
Model ) : name = models .
CharField( max_length=255 ) #
A user - generated comment , such as found on a site like # Digg or Reddit class Comment ( models .
Model ) : document = models .
ForeignKey ( Document , related_name= 'comments ') content = models .
TextField ()
About the code samples Django provides a handy shortcut to setting up a working environment in stand - alone code : running python manage .
py shell .
All code samples in this article presuppose that the environment has been invoked in this way .
In Django lingo , the following is assumed in this article : The Django project is called better_models .
The better_models project contains an application called examples .
The examples application models a basic blog - like system of documents and zero or more comments on those documents .
Listing 2 shows how to access the models set up in Listing 1 in an inefficient way .
Listing 2 .
Accessing those models very slowly
from examples .
model import * import uuid #
First create a lot of documents and assign them random names for i in range ( 0 , 10000 ) : Document.objects.create(name=str(uuid.uuid4 ( ) ) ) #
Get a selection of names back to be looked up later names = Document.objects.values_list ( ' name ' , flat =True ) [ 0:5000 ] #
The really slow way to get back a list of Documents that # match these names documents = [ ] for name in names : documents.append(Document.objects.get(name=name ) )
This is a contrived example , but it illustrates a fairly common use case : Given a list of identifiers , get all the items that correspond to those identifiers from the database .
The naively coded example above took 65 seconds to run when using sqlite3 in - memory .
With a file system - dependent database , it would be even longer .
However , Listing 3 has a fix for this slow - running query .
Instead of issuing multiple database queries for each name value , use the fieldname__in operator to generate an SQL query similar to :
SELECT * FROM model WHERE fieldname IN ( ' 1 ' , ' 2 ' , ...)
( The actual query syntax generated will vary by database engine . )
Listing 3 . A fast query for getting a list of items
from examples import models import uuid for i in range ( 0 , 10000 ) : Document.objects.create(name=str(uuid.uuid4 ( ) ) ) names = Document.objects.values_list ( ' name ' , flat =True ) [ 0:5000 ] documents = list ( Document.objects.filter(name__in=names ) )
This code executes in only 3 seconds .
Note that this code casts the result of the query to a list in order to force the query to be evaluated .
Because Django queries are evaluated lazily , simply assigning the result of the query would not cause any database access to occur , invalidating the comparison .
Database gurus may find this example obvious , especially if they 're accustomed to writing raw SQL , but many Python programmers do n't have a database background .
Sometimes , the best instincts of programmers can actually work against efficiency .
Listing 4 demonstrates one way you might choose to refactor the code in Listing 2 , not realizing it will turn out to be a trap .
Listing 4 . A common pattern resulting in slow database usage
for name in names : documents.append(get_document_by_name( name ) ) def get_document_by_name( name ) : return Document.objects.get ( name=name ) )
On the surface , it might seem like a good idea to create a separate method for retrieving documents from the database .
Maybe there 's other work that should be done here , such as adding data to the model before returning it .
Watch out for this pattern because refactoring into discrete methods can appear to be an improvement on the code .
Writing unit tests from the very beginning of development and including at least some tests that operate on large datasets can help identify when refactoring results in sudden performance drops .
Encapsulating common queries with manager models
All Django developers use the built - in Manager class :
It 's what gets called for all methods of the form Model.objects .* .
The base Manager class is automatically available and provides commonly used methods that return QuerySets ( for example , all ( ) ) , those that return values ( for example , count ( ) ) , and those that return Model instances ( for example , get_or_create ( ) ) .
Django developers are encouraged to override the base Manager class .
To illustrate why this feature is useful , extend the examples application to include a new model , Format , which describes the file format of the documents in the system .
An example is shown below .
Listing 5 . Adding a model to examples
from django.db import models class Document ( models .
Model ) : name = models .
CharField(max_length=255 ) format = models .
ForeignKey ( ' Format ' ) class Comment ( models .
Model ) : document = models .
ForeignKey ( Document , related_name= 'comments ') content = models .
TextField ( ) class Format ( models .
Model ) : type = models .
CharField ( choices= ( ( ' Text file ' , ' text ' ) , ( ' ePub ebook ' , ' epub ' ) , ( ' HTML file ' , ' html ' ) ) , max_length=10 )
Best practices for database updates
Any time you add tables or columns in models .py , you need to re-synchronize the related database .
There are a few best practices for this :
In early development , use an in - memory database like sqlite3 only and employ database fixtures to automatically load sample content .
In - memory databases can be quite fast for a single user and reduce a lot of waiting time in dropping and re-creating tables in a traditional RDBMS like MySQL .
Use a test - driven development approach .
The Django testing framework re-creates your database from scratch each time , so the tables are always up to date .
Combining this functionality with sqlite3 in - memory databases makes testing even faster .
Try one of the many Django add - ons that manage database synchronization .
I have had good experiences with the django - evolution package , but there are others .
For more information about django - evolution , see Related topics .
If you choose to use sqlite3 in your development or testing , be sure to perform final integration tests with your production database .
Django's ORM helps to flatten out the differences between RDBMS engines for most common cases , but not all behaviors are guaranteed to be identical .
Next , use the changed models to create some sample documents that have Format instances assigned .
Listing 6 . Create some documents with assigned formats
# First create a series of Format objects \ and save # them to the database them to the database format_text = Format.objects.create(type='text ' ) format_epub = Format.objects.create(type='epub ' ) format_html = Format.objects.create( type='html ' )
# Create a few documents in various formats for i in range ( 0 , 10 ) : Document.objects.create( name= ' My text document ' , format=format_text ) Document.objects.create(name= ' My epub document ' , format=format_epub ) Document.objects.create(name= 'My HTML document ' , format=format_html )
Imagine that this application will provide a way to first filter the documents by format , then to filter that QuerySet by other fields such as title .
Following is a simple query to return just the text documents : Document.objects.filter(format=format_text ) .
In this example , the meaning of the query is quite clear , but in a mature application , you may need to apply many more restrictions to the result set .
You may want to restrict the listing to only those documents marked public or documents no older than 30 days .
If you have to call this query from multiple places in your application , keeping all of the filtering clauses in sync can become a real maintenance headache and a source of bugs .
This is where a custom manager can help .
Custom managers offer the ability to define unlimited numbers of " canned " queries — similar to the built - in manager methods , such as latest ( ) ( which returns only the most recent instance of a given model ) or distinct ( ) ( which issues a SELECT DISTINCT clause in the generated query ) .
Not only do these queries reduce the amount of code that may need to be duplicated across your application but managers improve readability .
Over time , would you prefer to read this :
Documents.objects.filter(format=format_text,publish_on__week_day=todays_week_day , is_public=True).distinct().order_by( date_added ) .reverse ()
Or will it be easier for you or a new developer to understand :
Documents.home_page.all ( )
Creating a custom manager is extremely simple .
Listing 7 shows the get_by_format example .
Listing 7 . Custom Manager class that provides methods for each format type
from django.db import models class DocumentManager ( models .
Manager ) : #
The model class for this manager is always available as # self .
model , but in this example we are only relying on the # filter ( ) method inherited from models .
Manager . def text_format( self ) : return self.filter(format__type='text ') def epub_format ( self ) : return self.filter(format__type='epub ') def html_format( self ) : return self.filter (format__type='html ' ) class Document ( models .
Model ) : name = models .
CharField(max_length=255 ) format = models .
ForeignKey ( ' Format ') #
The new model manager get_by_format = DocumentManager ( ) #
The default model manager now needs to be explicitly defined objects = models .
Manager ( ) class Comment ( models .
Model ) : document = models .
ForeignKey ( Document , related_name= 'comments ') content = models .
TextField ( ) class Format ( models .
Model ) : type = models .
CharField ( choices= ( ( ' Text file ' , ' text ' ) , ( ' ePub ebook ' , ' epub ' ) , ( ' HTML file ' , ' html ' ) ) , max_length=10 ) def __unicode__( self ) : return self .
type
A few comments about this code :
If you define a custom manager , Django automatically removes the default manager .
I prefer to leave the default manager and the custom manager so other developers ( or myself , when I forget ) can still use objects and it will behave exactly as expected .
However , because my new get_by_format manager is just a subclass of Django 's models .
Manager , all the default methods , such as all ( ) , are available to it .
Whether to include the default manager as well as your custom manager is a personal preference .
and it will behave exactly as expected .

Whether to include the default manager as well as your custom manager is a personal preference .
It 's also possible to assign your new manager to objects directly .
The only disadvantage is if you then want to override the initial QuerySet itself .
Then your new objects will have an unexpected behavior that other developers might not anticipate .

You need to define the manager class in models .
py prior to defining your model class , or the class wo n't be available to Django .
This is similar to the restrictions around ForeignKey class references .
class references .
I could have simply implemented DocumentManager with a single method that takes an argument , like with_format ( format_name ) .
Generally , I prefer manager methods that have verbose method names but take no arguments .
with a single method that takes an argument , like .
Generally , I prefer manager methods that have verbose method names but take no arguments .
There 's no technical limit to the number of custom managers you can assign to a class , but you wo n't likely need more than one or two .
Using the new manager methods is simple enough .
In [ 1 ] : [ d.format for d in Document.get_by_format.text_format ( ) ]
[ 0 ]
Out [ 1 ] : < Format : text >
In [ 2 ] : [ d.format for d in Document.get_by_format.epub_format ( ) ]
[ 0 ]
Out [ 2 ] : < Format : epub > In [ 3 ] : [ d.format for d in Document.get_by_format.html_format ( ) ]
[ 0 ]
Out [ 3 ] : < Format : html >
Now there is a convenient place to hang any functionality related to these queries , and you can apply additional restrictions without cluttering up the code .
It 's also in keeping with the spirit of Django 's brand of model - view - controller ( MVC ) to put this kind of functionality in models .
py rather than littering it in views or template tags .
Overriding the initial QuerySet that a custom manager returns
Another coding pattern that can apply to manager classes is one that may have no custom methods at all .
Instead of defining a new method that returns only HTML - format documents , for example , you could define a custom manager that operates entirely on that restricted set , such as the one shown below .
Listing 8 . Custom manager for HTML documents
class HTMLManager ( models .
Manager ) : def get_query_set ( self ) : return super( HTMLManager , self ) .get_query_set().filter(format__type='html ' ) class Document ( models .
Model ) : name = models .
CharField(max_length=255 ) format = models .
ForeignKey ( ' Format ' ) html = HTMLManager ( ) get_by_format = DocumentManager ( ) objects = models .
Manager ( )
The get_query_set ( ) method is inherited from models .
Manager and is overridden in this example to take the basic query ( the same one that all ( ) generates ) and apply the additional filter to it .
Any subsequent methods you add to this manager would call your get_query_set ( ) method first , then apply additional query methods on that result , as shown below .
Listing 9 .
Using the custom format manager
# Our HTML query returns the same number of results as the manager # which explicitly filters the result set .
In [ 1 ] : Document.html.all().count ( ) Out [ 1 ] : 10 In [ 2 ] : Document.get_by_format.html_format( ).count ( ) Out [ 2 ] : 10 # In fact we can prove that they return exactly the same results In [ 3 ] : [ d.id for d in Document.get_by_format.html_format ( ) ] == [ d.id for d in Document.html.all ( ) ]
Out [ 3 ] : True #
It is not longer possible to operate on the unfiltered # query in HTMLManager ( )
In [ 4 ] : Document.html.filter(format__type='epub ') Out [ 4 ] : [ ]
Use this class - based method for filtering queries when you expect to have many operations on a subset of your data and want to reduce the amount of code and the complexity of the queries you need to generate .
Using class and static methods with models
There are no restrictions on the types of methods you can add to a manager .
Methods can return QuerySet s , as shown above , or they can return instances of the related model class ( available as self .
model ) .
TThere may be cases where you want to do operations that are related to a model , but do n't return instances or QuerySets .
The Django documentation states that all methods that are n't on instances of a model class should go on the manager , but another possibility is to use Python 's class and static methods .
Here 's a simple example of a utility method that 's related to the Format class but not to an individual instance :
# Return the canonical name for a format extension based on some # common values that might be seen " in the wild " def check_extension ( extension ) : if extension == ' text ' or extension == ' txt ' or extension == '.csv ' : return ' text ' if extension.
lower ( ) == ' epub ' or extension == ' zip ' : return ' epub ' if ' htm ' in extension : return ' html ' raise Exception ( ' Did not get known extension ' )
This code does n't take or return an instance of the Format class , so it is n't appropriate as an instance method .
You could add it to a FormatManager , but because it does n't access the database at all , it does n't feel right to put it there .
One solution is to add it to the Format class and declare it as a static method using the @staticmethod decorator , as shown below .
Listing 10 .
Adding a utility function as a static method on a model class
class Format ( models .
Model ) : type = models .
CharField ( choices= ( ( ' Text file ' , ' text ' ) , ( ' ePub ebook ' , ' epub ' ) , ( ' HTML file ' , ' html ' ) ) , max_length=10 ) @staticmethod def check_extension ( extension ) : if extension == ' text ' or extension == ' txt ' or extension == '.csv ' : return ' text ' if extension.
lower ( ) == ' epub ' or extension == ' zip ' : return ' epub ' if ' htm ' in extension : return ' html ' raise Exception ( ' Did not get known extension ' ) def __unicode__( self ) : return self .
type
This method would be called as Format.check_extension( extension ) without requiring an instance of Format or the creation of a manager .
Python also offers the @classmethod decorator , which generates methods on classes that take the class itself as the first argument .
This might be useful in cases where you want to perform some introspection on the class object itself without instantiating it .
Aggregation queries in Django V1.1
In V1.1 , Django 's ORM includes powerful query methods that provide functionality previously only available via raw SQL .
For Python developers leery of SQL — and for anyone wanting to keep his or her Django applications usable across multiple database engines — this is a real boon .
In today 's socially mediated applications , it 's extremely common to order items not just by rigid fields like alphabetical order or creation date but by dynamic data .
For example , in the examples application , you may want to list documents by popularity , based on the number of comments made on each one .
Prior to Django V1.1 , you could do such a thing only by writing some custom SQL code , creating a nonportable stored procedure , or — worst of all — writing some inefficient object - oriented queries .
Another approach was to define a dummy database field that would contain the desired value by which to count ( for example , the number of Comment rows ) and update that manually by overriding the document 's save ( ) method .
Django aggregation removes the need for all of this .
You can now order documents by the number of comments they receive with just one QuerySet method : annotate ( ) .
Listing 11 provides an example .
Listing 11 .
Using aggregation to order results by number of comments
from django.db.models import Count # Create some sample Documents unpopular = Document.objects.create(name= ' Unpopular document ' , format=format_html ) popular = Document.objects.create(name= ' Popular document ' , format=format_html ) # Assign more comments to " popular " than to " unpopular " for i in range ( 0,10 ) : Comment.objects.create(document=popular ) for i in range ( 0,5 ) : Comment.objects.create(document=unpopular ) #
If we return results in the order they were created ( id order , by default ) , we get # the " unpopular " document first .
In [ 1 ] : Document.objects.all( ) Out [ 1 ] : [< Document : Unpopular document > , < Document : Popular document > ]
#
If we instead annotate the result set with the total number of # comments on each Document and then order by that computed value , we # get the " popular " document first .
In [ 2 ] : Document.objects.annotate ( Count( ' comments ')).order_by ('- comments__count ') Out [ 2 ] : [< Document : Popular document > , < Document : Unpopular document >]
The annotate ( ) QuerySet method does not perform any aggregation by itself .
Instead , it directs Django to assign the value of the passed expression to a pseudo - column in the result set .
By default , that column name will be the supplied field name ( here , the value of Comment.document.related_name( ) ) prepended to the name of the aggregation method .
This code is calling django.db.models .
Count , which is one of the simple mathematical functions available in the aggregation library .
( For the complete list , see Related topics . )
The result of Document.objects.annotate ( Count( ' comments ' ) ) is a QuerySet to which a new property — comments__count — has been added .
If you want to override that default name , you can pass the name as a keyword argument .
Document.objects.annotate(popularity=Count(' comments ' ) )
Now that the intermediate QuerySet contains a count of all the comments associated with each document , you can order by that field .
Because you want the documents with the most comments to appear first , use descending order , as .order_by ( '- comments__count ' ) .
Using aggregation not only reduces the amount of code you need to write but it also guarantees that these operations will be fast , as they 're relying on the database engine to do the mathematical calculations .
This process is much more efficient than extracting all the relevant data through the ORM and calculating over the result set manually .
Other types of aggregation in Django V1.1
The new aggregation library does n't just allow for returning more complex result sets .
You can also return non- QuerySet results extracted directly out of the database .
For example , to get the average number of comments for all the documents in the database , use this code :
In [ 1 ] : from django.db.models import Avg In [ 2 ] : Document.objects.aggregate( Avg(' comments ' ) ) Out [ 2 ] : {' comments__avg ' : 8.0}
You can apply aggregation to filtered or unfiltered queries , and columns generated with annotate can themselves be filtered on like normal fields .
You can also apply aggregation methods across joins .
For example , you could aggregate documents based on ratings assigned to comments , as in a Slashdot - style site .

Conclusion
One charge leveled at object - relational mappers is that they abstract away so much of the database engine that writing efficient , scalable applications with them is impossible .
For some kinds of applications — those with millions of accesses and highly interrelated models — this assertion is often true .
The vast majority of Web applications never reach such huge audiences and do n't achieve that level of complexity .
ORMs are designed to get projects off the ground quickly and to help developers jump into database - driven projects without requiring a deep knowledge of SQL .
As your Web site gets bigger and more popular , you will certainly need to audit performance as described in the first section of this article .
Eventually , you may need to start replacing ORM - driven code with raw SQL or stored procedures .
Happily , the capabilities of easy - to - use ORMs like Django 's continue to evolve .
Django V1.1 's aggregation library is a major step forward , allowing efficient query generation while still providing a familiar object - oriented syntax .
For even greater flexibility , Python developers should also look at SQLAlchemy , especially for Python Web applications that do n't rely on Django .

Search teams have recovered bodies and wreckage from the plane
The Brazilian military says it has ended its search for bodies from the Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic almost a month ago .
Fifty - one bodies have been recovered since the plane went down on 1 June .
A total of 228 people were on board .
A Brazilian spokesman said the recovery of any more of the bodies was " impossible " .
But a French - led search for the plane 's black boxes - which will emit signals until at least 2 July - will continue .
The cause of the accident has not yet been established .
The Airbus 330 was flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris when it plunged into the sea .
" It has been nine days since we have located bodies , " Brazilian air force spokesman Lt Col Henry Munhoz told journalists .
Searchers had concluded that " it is impossible to recover more dead bodies or remains in the search area " , he said .
Several French vessels , including a nuclear submarine , will continue to listen out for signals from the plane 's flight recorders .
They emit signals for at least 30 days after a crash .
The crash was the worst in Air France 's history .
There has been speculation that faulty data on the old - style speed sensors may have been the cause , but French investigators have warned against drawing early conclusions .
An initial report by France 's Investigation and Analysis Bureau ( BEA ) is to be released on 2 July .
( CNN ) -- Concerned about her family 's finances , a university student in Australia cashed some long - forgotten lottery tickets this week -- hoping the money would help her parents .
Have you ever won big after mislaying a lottery ticket ?
Tell us -- click on Sound Off below .
She discovered their worries are over .
The university student won $ 10 million ( A$ 13 million ) -- and helped solve a lottery mystery that has made headlines in Western Australia for 10 months .
" People had been wondering for months , who is this mystery winner ?
Do they know about this ticket ? " said Jodi Eastman , spokeswoman for Lotterywest , the state lottery .
" We have a 12 month expiry on lottery tickets .
And people thought it might end up expiring and go unclaimed . "
Have you ever won big on an old lottery ticket ?

It would have , too , had the student -- who is in her 30s and asked lottery officials to keep her anonymous -- not woken up earlier this week , suddenly remembering the bundle of lottery tickets collecting dust in a drawer .
She did n't know that among them was a gift from her father , who had purchased a ticket to test the family 's luck when the Oz Lotto jackpot climbed to $ 39 ( A$ 50 million ) million last July .
" She said she thought , ' If I can win some money on these tickets , I can possibly help the family out , " Eastman said .
The first couple of tickets yielded small amounts -- $ 16 total .
" She was pretty excited , " Eastman said .
Then the woman had the clerk check the gift from her father .
At first glance , she thought she 'd won $ 10,000 ( A$ 13,000 ) .
No , the retail store clerk told her , it 's $ 10 million ( A$ 13 million ) .
" I checked the commas and decimal places and then I realized , " the woman told Lotterywest .
" I always remember Mum telling me that if I won the Lotto , not to start jumping up and down in the shopping center , " she added .
Had she waited two more months , she would have missed the fortune .
The woman told lottery officials she 's not planning a spending binge .
" The people close to me will be looked after and I might give some to research or a charity of some kind , " she told Lotterywest .
" It 's nice to have this much to fulfill my dreams and the dreams of the people around me . "
The winning ticket cost $ 6.70 ( A$ 8.70 ) .
The odds she beat : 1 in 45 million .

If marijuana were to be legalized for recreational use , it would raise nearly $ 1.4 billion for the California , announced a state tax board yesterday .
The numbers were from an analysis of a bill , AB390 , introduced earlier this year by San Francisco Assemblymember Tom Ammiano .
Under the legislation , which was originally estimated to raise around $ 1 billion , those aged 21 and over could purchase marijuana for recreational use .
It would be sold with a $ 50 per ounce fee in addition to sales taxes .

Archaeologists think the town was destroyed at the hands of Boudicca
Enlarge Image
Archaeologists from Berkshire say they have discovered evidence of an Iron Age town underneath the remains of a Roman settlement in north Hampshire .
The University of Reading 's Archaeology Department has been excavating at the Silchester Roman site , Calleva Atrebatum , since 1997 .
Now the team believe they have found evidence of one of Britain 's earliest Iron Age towns with a planned layout .
A street - grid was found to have been in place before the Romans came in AD 43 .
Archaeologists have also discovered evidence of widespread burning at the site .
Town burnt down
They believe this , along with other finds , suggests the site could have been destroyed at the hands of queen Boudicca , who in AD 60/61 led a major uprising against the occupying Roman forces .
Professor Michael Fulford , director of the Silchester Town Life Project , said : " After 12 summers of excavation we have reached down to the 1st Century AD and are beginning to see the first signs of what we believe to be the Iron Age and earliest Roman town .
They want to find out what changed when the town became Roman " The discovery of the underlying Iron Age settlement is extremely exciting .
" While there are traces of settlement beneath Roman Verulamium ( today 's St Albans ) and Canterbury and close to the site of Roman Colchester , none of these resembles the evidence that we have here at Calleva of a planned town . "
The completely new street grid implemented later by the Romans could have been a " thumbs down on the British arrangement " , he said .
Prof Fulford added : " We now have evidence that the town was burnt down sometime after AD 50 and before AD 80 .
" The possibility that this was at the hands of Boudicca when leading the largest British uprising during the Roman occupation is hugely significant .
It was not thought the revolt passed this way . "
Visitors can watch the excavation in progress at the site every day except Fridays , until 9 August .

マルコフ連鎖を使って作曲する試み。
文章にしろ曲にしろ、マルコフ連鎖を使って何かを生成する場合、マルコフ連鎖自体、つまり状態と遷移確率行列に相当するデータを準備する必要がある。このデータが最終的な出力の質のかなりの部分を左右する。このデータを準備すれば、生成の部分は特に凝ったことをしない限り、サイコロを転がす程度のことで済む。
実際にある文章や曲を元にデータを作ろうと思うと、状態の切り出しが難しい場合がある。英語の文章の場合は、最初から単語で分かち書きされているから楽だ。日本語の文章の場合は、形態素を状態とすると、状態の切り出しはMeCabなどの形態素解析プログラムに任せることができる。曲の場合は、多分今のところ簡単で汎用的な方法はない。本格的に研究するなら用意した曲の音響分析をしたりするのかもしれないけど、音響分析なんて全然知らないし、今回は実際にある曲を元にデータを作るつもりでも気軽に試したいだけだったから、状態の切り出しは手作業でやった。
データの準備の流れ。マルコフ連鎖の状態は、楽譜上のひとつの音符（休符）と同程度の情報ということで、音高と音価の組み合わせとした。手作業でやったのは、ある短い曲の楽譜上の音符（休符）をそれぞれ符号化してテキストファイルに落とし込んだこと。この段階で状態の切り出しは終わった。後はそのテキストファイルを入力として受け取って、状態と遷移確率行列に相当するデータを出力するスクリプトを書いて、実行。出力されたデータはChucKの曲生成プログラムに埋め込む。
出力されたデータを可視化したもの。各状態の中に書いてある文字と数は、それぞれ音名（" rest"は例外で休符）と音価を表す。各状態間の矢印の太さは、その状態間の遷移確率の大きさを表す。

Republican Senators hit the Sunday news show airwaves today to defend former Vice President Dick Cheney and the secret CIA domestic spying program .
Senators Judd Gregg , Lamar Alexander , John Kyl , and John Cornyn all defended Cheney in some way , and they accused the Democrats of trying to use the story to provide political cover for Speaker Nancy Pelosi , and President Obama .
Here is a video compilation of all of Cheney defenders from < a href=
http://thinkprogress.org/2009/07/12/gop-cheney-congress/>Think Progress :
Advertisements
On CBS ’ Face the Nation , Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R - AL ) tried to discredit the New York Times story while defending Cheney , “ Well , I– I ’m sure it will be .
But I would just say that sometimes leaked stories from unnamed sources do n’t turn out to be quite what they appear to be .
Maybe they do n’t know the full facts and – and so forth in these matters .
Some of the Intelligence Committee people are pushing back on those stories .
I do n’t know what the facts are .
But I believe that Vice President Cheney served his country with as much fidelity as he could possibly give to it .
And he tried to serve us in an effective way .
And I hope that nothing like this would impact on his outstanding record . ”
Sen . John Cornyn said on Fox News Sunday , “ This of course comes on the heels of a statement , unproven by the way , of Speaker Pelosi that the CIA had lied to her about enhanced interrogation techniques , and this looks to me suspiciously like an attempt to provide political cover to her and others . ”
On CNN ’s State of the Union Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - NH ) said , “ The only way we ’re going to get that information is through intelligence gathering .
We have to have an extraordinarily robust and strong CIA , an extraordinarily and robust intelligence gathering organization .
And this national attempt by some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to basically undermine the capacity to protect and develop intelligence is , I think , going to harm us in the long run . ”
Also on CNN , Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) said , “ Well , let ’s — we do n’t know whether it was appropriate .
The CIA is in the secrecy business .
And what I hear from the Democratic members of Congress is they want the CIA to tell more of them what ’s going on .
The best way to ruin a secrecy business is to tell -”
Nobody took their defense of Bush and Cheney quite as far as Sen. John Kyl ( R - TX ) who said on ABC’s This Week , “ Look the president and the vice president are the two people who have responsibility ultimately for the national security of the country .
It is not out of the ordinary for the vice president to be involved in an issue like this .
What if it ’s a top secret program ?
Of course he and the president would both be responsible for that .
Let ’s do n’t jump to conclusions is what I ’m saying . ”
The Republicans want people to believe that it is no big deal that former vice president Dick Cheney was involved in covering up a massive CIA domestic spying program .
In fact , they want to blame the Democrats , and claim that by investigating this story , Democrats will be somehow harming US national security .
It is stunning that Republicans continue to defend Cheney .
If they were smart , they would call for a non-partisan investigation .
By doing this Republicans could use the findings of a report to either defend Cheney or distance themselves from him , because despite what John Kyl wants to believe , it is n’t ok for the vice president to conceal secret domestic spying programs .
If this story is true , then Cheney abused his office like nothing we have seen since the days of Richard Nixon , who Cheney worked for .
The Obama administration has expressed an underwhelming lack of desire to investigate the Bush administration , but as the evidence mounts , the administration may have no choice , but to explore the activities of Dick Cheney while he was vice president .
Some 95 percent of male mammals have little to no interaction with their children .
Homo sapiens are one of the most notable exceptions , leading some scientists to think fatherhood is an important part of what makes us human .
Most theories for the family involvement of fathers invoke the familiar " Man the Hunter " characterization , in which dad protects and provides for his young .
While fathers do play key roles in securing the physical health of their children , they also can be important for the optimum development of psychological and emotional traits considered to be primarily human , such as empathy , emotional control and the ability to navigate complex social relationships .
Unlike many other animals , humans need their fathers well beyond the act that leads to conception , researchers are coming to realize .
Paternal prep school
There is plenty of time for this emotional hand - off .
While other primate babies can fend for themselves in roughly a decade , human childhood stretches 18 to 20 years , said David Geary of the University of Missouri and author of " Male , Female : Evolution of Human Sex Differences " ( American Psychological Association , 1998 ) .
Also , anthropologists speculate that the relative helplessness of human children has made multiple caregivers a vital necessity — that encourages bringing dad into the picture .
Even today , in both traditional and industrialized communities , a father 's presence correlates with improved health and decreased child mortality , Geary said .
Evolutionarily speaking , he added , the kid - phase probably lengthened as dads got more involved .
With an extra person dedicated to caring for them , kids have no need to rush towards adulthood .
Perhaps out of worry for their kids ' future financial security , dads across human cultures mostly focus on preparing children to compete within society .
They give advice , encourage academic success and stress achievement , Geary said .
But it is not all lesson plans and lectures .
Kids also learn from fathers during a unique form of papa play .
Unlike mothers , fathers tend to roughhouse with their children .
" They rile them up , almost to the point that they are going to snap , and then calm them down , " Geary said .
This pattern teaches kids to control their emotions — a trait that garners them popularity among superiors and peers , he said .
Parenting for the grandkids
Good fathers are rewarded with quality family relationships across the board , Geary said .
When children have warm relationships with their father , as well as calm home lives , they tend to sexually mature later .
Their bodies intuit they are safe and time is taken perfecting social skills before entering the real world , Geary said .
The extra practice gives children a competitive edge .
As adults , they are more likely to form secure relationships , achieve stable social standing and become able parents .
In this sense , a father who takes care of his children also gives his grandchildren a leg up .
Not that involved dads must wait to be grandpas to reap rewards from pitching in with childcare .
In addition to experiencing the tenderness of the father - child bond , many dads gain a feeling of camaraderie by providing support for mom .
Also , the more help a mother receives after giving birth , the faster she becomes fertile again .
Being raised by more than one person also enhances social skills , theorizes anthropologist Sarah Hrdy , author of " Mothers and Others " ( Belknap Press , 2009 ) .
Children not only grow up more emotionally secure , they are better at taking another 's perspective — a skill critical to our socially - reliant species .
In traditional communities , especially during infancy , extra caregivers are usually female kin , such as grandmothers and aunts , Hrdy writes .
But in nuclear families , fathers play this role .
When father - child relations are strained or chaotic , the insecurity can translate biologically as a message to grow up fast , Geary said .
There is an unconscious sense that " if you are going to reproduce at all , you better start early , " he said .
As a result , girls reach menarche sooner and form clingy relationships , while boys become aggressive and sexually exploitive .
This rarely bodes well for the next generation .
Biological roots of paternalism
The emotional contribution of dads might have some biological roots .
Despite conventional wisdom , men experience biological changes during a pregnancy , albeit not as extensively as women do .
Men who are emotionally close to — and usually cohabiting with — a pregnant woman , go through their own hormonal surges , especially just before and after birth , said David Bjorklund of Florida Atlantic University .
For example , a new father has elevated levels of the hormone prolactin — usually associated with lactation in women — that trigger his nurturing instinct .
This may be evolution 's way of ensuring more constant care for a baby that is more dependent and demanding than any other newborn in the animal kingdom .

Top 10 Worst Hereditary Conditions
The Origins of Father 's Day
Five days into the vast and sometimes violent street demonstrations over Friday 's contested presidential election , Iran blamed the United States for " intolerable " interference in its domestic affairs .
President Barack Obama had specifically said he was avoiding being seen as meddling , saying it was " not productive , given the history of US - Iranian relations . "
State television has portrayed the violence at rallies supporting defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi as the act of " hooligans . "
But as more video footage and news of peaceful daytime rallies and violent nighttime clashes break out through the restrictions placed upon the foreign media in Iran ( most of it reaching the world anonymously through YouTube and Twitter ) , the contours of the power struggle have been coming clearer .
Three days after the Revolutionary Guards of the Sahrallah base took control of security of the capital from the police , according to sources in Tehran , a large pro-reformist rally packed a central Tehran avenue on Wednesday .
In another sign of the scale of unrest , five players and the captain of Iran 's national soccer team wore wristbands of green – the color of Mousavi 's movement – during the first half of their World Cup qualifying match in South Korea .
The BBC reported they were told to take them off .
The protests are turning into an outlet for the myriad frustrations of Iranians , beyond rejecting the election result .
State news services reported that the Revolutionary Guards had acted against " deviant news sites " backed by the US , Britain , and Canada that were encouraging unrest .
Grainy footage showed protesters carrying a wounded comrade as they raced from a clash .
Another scene show a young man with a bleeding arm , and others rushing to bandage him .
The magnitude of the protests have prompted Iran 's supreme leader Ayatollah Sayed Ali Khamenei – who will reportedly give the sermon himself at this week 's Friday prayers – to call for calm .

The Texas State Board of Education is moving toward removing Cesar Chavez and Thurgood Marshall from the social studies curriculum taught to its 4.7 million public school students .
According to one of the six “ expert reviewers ” revising the 1997 curriculum , Chavez “ lacks the stature , impact and overall contributions of so many others ; and his open affiliation with Saul Alinsky ’s movements certainly makes dubious that he is praiseworthy . ”
Another reviewer concluded that Marshall , a Supreme Court justice who as an attorney argued the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education case , is “ not an appropriate example as a historical figure of influence . ”
These are not the rantings of powerless and fringe people ; they are statements from those recommending a new curriculum to the full Board .
And so during a week in which an African - American President ’s appointee of the first Latino to the Supreme Court dominates the news , we have Texas – whose Governor spoke of “ secession ” earlier this year – trying to turn back social and racial progress .
Texas has an elected 15 - member Board of Education , seven of which are viewed as social conservatives .
The Board ’s panel of experts to recommend new curriculum standards reflects this conservative perspective , which could soon result in a social studies classroom in which Cesar Chavez and Thurgood Marshall are ignored but the motivational role of the Bible in the nation ’s founding is highlighted .
Texas ’ Chavez - Alinsky Connection
Although Cesar Chavez advocated for Texas farmworkers , conservative opposition to him in the state is primarily linked to Chavez getting his start as an organizer with the Community Services Organization , which was affiliated with Saul Alinsky ’s Industrial Areas Foundation .
The Texas IAF has been extremely successful over the years , and its COPS / Metro Alliance in San Antonio has often been hailed as model for enlisting Latino participation in the democratic process .
But many conservatives do n’t want Latinos attending public hearings or voting .
This is particularly true in Texas , where increased Latino voting could soon swing the once solidly red state to blue .
The last thing these conservatives want is for millions of young Latinos to learn how Cesar Chavez preached the virtues of democratic participation — and even more dangerous is the fact that Chavez was a deeply religious man whose faith motivated him to organize workers and fight injustice .
What these social conservatives fear the type of faith - based activism that Texas - IAF groups have used to promote greater social justice .
People of faith marched , picketed , and engaged in civil disobedience to help the farmworker cause ; if the Board ’s goal really were to show how religious values helped build the nation , Chavez and the UFW would be central to the curriculum .
Thurgood Marshall ’s Historical Impact
While Cesar Chavez has been under conservative attack since he launched the farmworkers movement in 1962 , legendary African - American attorney and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall has rarely been viewed as a “ radical . ”
In fact , Marshall and the NAACP practiced the “ work through the system ” approach that conservatives typically applaud – until , of course , it produces court rulings or elects candidates it opposes .
The fact that experts appointed by the Texas Board of Education believe Thurgood Marshall is not an “ appropriate figure of influence ” shows their complete disconnection from historical reality .
As Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network puts it , “ The board has appointed completely unqualified political activists who are creating blacklists of people who they want censored and stricken from our history books . ”
While Quinn ’s group fights for “ a mainstream agenda of religious freedom and individual liberties , ” Ken Mercer , the Board of Education ’s vice chair of the committee on instruction claims the Freedom Network has a “ radical agenda . ”
Mercer argues that Quiinn and his allies are “ attempting to steal the textbook process away from our 24 million Texans and indoctrinate students with their politically revised version of American history . ”
Of course , it is Mercer ’s allies who are seeking to drastically revise the social studies curriculum by removing Cesar Chavez and Thurgood Marshall .
Its akin to attacks on Judge Sotomayor ’s alleged “ judicial activism ” in the New Haven white firefighters case ; it was Sotomayor and her colleagues who followed existing law , while Justice Roberts and his conservative Supreme Court allies revised the law to obtain their desired result .
Although increased Latino voting will soon reduce the clout of the Texas right wing , the curriculum standards now being updated will stay in place for a decade .
So unless activists and editorial boards get busy , public school students in Texas will be taught a right - wing , Christian fundamentalist perspective on United States history .
Chavez Victory in Portland
While Cesar Chavez takes his lumps in Texas – and the Dallas street renaming in his honor appears dead — the Portland City Council ended a multi- year battle and voted unanimously last week to rename 39th Ave. to Cesar Chavez Blvd .
The Oregonian newspaper opposed the renaming , and the “ Save 39th Avenue ” committee now has the option of gathering 19,335 signatures in the next 30 days to place a referendum on the name change on the ballot .
Congrats to Marta Guembes and her fellow activists for waging what often appeared a hopelessly uphill fight for the renaming of a street for Cesar Chavez .
Activists overcame the defeat of the first street selected for renaming , and backed the Council ’s public process to find a more acceptable street .
The “ Si Se Puede ” spirit ultimately prevailed .

For O’Brien , the open landscape of California may be both inspiring and isolating .
In his “ Late Night ” show in New York , O’Brien was able to define himself as a smart outsider , but “ The Tonight Show ” is , by its nature , a different game for a different crowd .
Traditionally , it has mirrored the mood of the country .
“ Johnny ’s the one I look back to , ” O ’Brien continued .
“ The constant is Johnny .
He was very sophisticated , but he was also a clown .
As a kid , I was fascinated by the fact that while he was clearly the coolest guy in America , he could dress up like an old woman or have a raccoon crawl on his head .
He surrendered his dignity , and it only made him cooler .
There are n’t a lot of hosts who will put on a skimpy bathing suit and jump into a hot tub with Don Rickles . ”
O’Brien picked up a guitar .
“ When I first got ‘ Late Night , ’ ” he said , “ I was whisked to John Cheever Connecticut to a 50th birthday party for Bob Wright , who was then the head of NBC .
They said , ‘ We want you to get up and be funny . ’
And then I realized that Johnny Carson was there , too .
I was petrified .
Johnny was wearing dark glasses and he was ramrod straight and perfectly coiffed .
He was very shy .
I wanted to kill myself .
And I had to go first .
I had prepared a thing — the idea was I did n’t know who Bob Wright was — and it worked .
People really laughed .
And Johnny nodded .
Then he got up , made his toast and blew the roof off the place .
Afterward , he came over to me and said , ‘ Good luck to you . ’
He said , ‘ Just be yourself — that ’s the only way it can work . ’ ” O’Brien paused , “ There ’s an opportunity to put my stamp on this show .
I ’ve got an ego , and I want to do my ‘ Tonight Show . ’ ”
O’Brien was interrupted by Jeff Ross , who wanted him to go downstairs to the stage .
When the set was being designed , O’Brien ’s main concern was that the space not feel too big .
“ We want to have a parade of elephants if we need it , ” Ross explained as we went through the stage doors , “ but we still want the audience to feel like they ’re close to Conan . ”
These decisions matter : for the first two years of Leno ’s tenure , Letterman was regularly beating him .
Then Leno changed studios , switching from Carson ’s old arrangement , which put him at a distance from the audience , to a closer configuration .
As a stand - up comedian , Leno played more to the crowd and needed to see faces .
It may have been a coincidence or a national change in taste , but when he altered his set , Leno started to win in the ratings .
And then , in 1995 , Hugh Grant was arrested for soliciting a prostitute and did n’t cancel his “ Tonight Show ” booking .
When an abashed Grant sat down , Leno asked , “ What the hell were you thinking ? ”
There was a huge laugh , and ratings soared .
From then on , Leno was No. 1 .
“ Do you think it was the set or Hugh ? ” I asked Ross .
“ Well , ” he said , “ I could n’t come up with five names living that will guarantee a rating .
News - generated guests will be big , but everything has been diluted by the entertainment shows .
Everyone is everywhere four or five times a day .
So unless you have a sitting president like Barack Obama on , or a big scandal , you ’re better off with a set that helps . ”
The new “ Tonight Show ” set has the usual elements : band shell stage left , desk stage right and a mesh curtain made of metal in the center .
But the curtain is curved and , like the rest of the set , is deco in style .
It evokes the mood of 30 Rockefeller Plaza but is much grander than O’Brien ’s former set in Studio 6A .
There are nearly double the number of seats , and there are many more lights flashing .
“ I liked the set , ” Lorne Michaels told me later , “ but I wonder if it ’s the movie version of a talk show . ”
As he wandered around the stage , O’Brien looked comfortable , at home .
“ The hardest thing in L.A. is a destination , ” he said .
“ I ’m spoiled .
I ’ve had the destination in New York : Rockefeller Center .
It ’s the high temple of American TV , and we were smack - dab in the middle of it .
L.A. is different .
Everything can feel like the lunar landscape out here . ”
He paced around the set .
The set was n’t finished : there were at least 25 workers installing lights or checking plans or hammering .
“ I ’m happy when I ’m in the studio , ” O’Brien said .
“ I ’m eating my meals here now . ”
O’Brien ’s desk was n’t finished yet , and there were three folding chairs where the guests would be .
“ I miss doing the show , ” he said .
“ I miss the audience .
The other day , I was at my daughter ’s school to read to the kids , and I started acting out all the characters .
I ran into Liza on my way out , and she said , ‘ How did it go ? ’
I said , ‘ I killed in there ! ’
She looked at me and said : ‘ They ’re a bunch of 4 - year - olds .
You ’re just supposed to read the book . ’ ”
O’Brien laughed .
He walked over to an X that had been taped to the floor .
When the show starts , that will be where he ’ll stand when he emerges from the curtain to address the audience .
“ I come here at night , after everyone ’s gone home , and I practice giving the monologue , ” he said .
“ Every night .
For hours .
I just stand on the X and imagine the rest . ”

Socialist Voice : The Australian left founded a project of left unity and activism in 2001 .
Can you describe the early years of that project and what it achieved ?
Peter Boyle : The Socialist Alliance was formed in 2001 on the back of great optimism about the prospects for left revival in the wake of the rise of a movement at that time against capitalist globalisation .
Some 20,000 people had participated in a three - day long blockade of a summit of the World Economic Forum in Melbourne the previous year .
That was Australia ’s “ Seattle ” [ 1 ] and it was followed up on May 1 , 2001 with mass blockades of the stock exchanges in all the capital cities of the country .
The formation of the Socialist Alliance was just one of a number of initiatives at the time to take this political momentum forward .
While it has not had a smooth road since then , the Socialist Alliance is the only one of these initiatives surviving today in Australia .
Regroupment projects inspired by anarchist ideology and attempts to create local social forums all proved short - lived .
The Socialist Alliance experience has been shaped by the ebbs and flows of the social movements .
It became clear after the forward momentum of the post - Seattle anti-capitalist movement was cut off - after the failure of the global mass movements to stop the 2003 invasion of Iraq - that we were overoptimistic in 2001 .
We have seen movement retreats since then .
But there have been some advances , too .
We should also see the connections between the global wave of anti-capitalist sentiment a decade ago and the new rise of anti-capitalist sentiment today : one builds on the other .
SV : What political forces initiated Socialist Alliance , and what new forces have been won to it ?
The Socialist Alliance was initiated by the Democratic Socialist Party ( the predecessor to the Democratic Socialist Perspective of today ) and the International Socialist Organisation .
A handful of smaller left groups joined in .
Other left groups , such as the Communist Party of Australia and Socialist Alternative , were invited but declined to join the Alliance .
The groups that did join the Alliance agreed on a common political platform focused on immediate class struggle responses to neo-liberalism .
It was also explicitly socialist .
We agreed not to make the historical and theoretical differences between the groups a barrier to working together around what we agreed on .
At the same time , the Socialist Alliance created forums for ongoing public discussion and debate .
The basic idea was that we did n’t have to have resolve all the ideological and historical disputes that divided the various factions of the left before agreeing to organise together on a fighting program against capitalist attacks and for socialist solutions to the urgent problems society faces today .
Indeed , we were more likely to resolve these differences after we had gone through an extended experience of working together around what we agreed on - which was substantial .
Stress on inclusivity
We agreed on a basic structure and constitution which put the emphasis on inclusivity .
As the biggest of the groups that founded the Alliance , the DSP made concessions which restricted itself to a minority vote on leadership bodies and in conferences .
We saw this as an interim confidence - building measure .
The unprecedented unity of these left groups , which until then had spent lots of energy criticising each other , made a significant impact on the much broader layer of left activists who had not joined any of the pre-existing socialist groups .
Hundreds of them joined the Socialist Alliance , quickly becoming the majority of its members .
Among those who joined were a number of militant trade unionists .
These included shop - floor delegates as well as a few elected leaders of militant unions .
One of these leaders was Craig Johnston , the former Victorian state secretary of the powerful manufacturing workers union .
Craig was later jailed for several months [ 2 ] for leading militant industrial action and lost his old leadership position .
He remains an active delegate in the construction industry and is still a proud member of the Alliance .
The formation of the Socialist Alliance was preceded by a sequence of political collaborations of the militant trade unions with the radical left between 1998 to 2001 .
These occurred in the state of Victoria in particular , but also in the state of Western Australia .
They included militant mass picketing against the Liberal - National government ’s failed attempt to destroy the Maritime Union of Australia ( MUA ) in the late 1990s , and the anti-globalisation protests mentioned above .
These were political collaborations that extended outside industrial struggles .
They posed the challenge of building a common political party .
Every national conference of the Socialist Alliance since its formation has been attended by leading militant leaders in the trade union movement , some of whom are Alliance members and others are still in the Labor party or not in any party .
A number of these conferences have had their venues paid for by militant unions , and the Alliance also received the first public donations by unions to a socialist organisation in decades .
Indigenous struggle
Sam Watson , a respected and militant leader in the Aboriginal community also joined the Alliance , and remains its spokesperson on Indigenous affairs .
He has stood as a Socialist Alliance candidate in state and national parliamentary elections .
Since then several other leading Aboriginal activists have also joined the Alliance .
The Indigenous struggle is very important in Australian politics because the social legacy of the colonial dispossession of the Aboriginal people is horrible .
Aboriginal people suffer racism , extreme economic marginalisation and Third World health and housing conditions .
This in a one of the richest countries in the world .
The indigenous struggle has massive moral weight and points to an alternative way of living based on sharing and working with nature .
Solidarity with the aboriginal rights struggle has an added urgency ever since the adoption by the federal government in 2007 of “ emergency ” legislation , known as the “ Intervention , ” which authorises police and social agencies to intervene with draconian powers against the political , social and communal rights of Indigenous people in the Northern Territory .
This attack continues under the newly elected Labor Party government and is being extended into other states in the country .
Apart from movement leaders , a number of left - wing intellectuals also joined the Alliance .
These included one of Australia ’s most prolific Marxist historians , Humphrey McQueen .
A number of former Labor party members , former Communist Party members and a few former Greens members , including one former state secretary of the Greens , also joined the Socialist Alliance .
Test for left groupings
This was an important opening for the left in Australia , which was ( and remains ) small and relatively isolated in the labour movement .
Would the left seize this as a chance to build a multi-tendency socialist party with a significant connection to the labour movement and other key social movements ?
This was clearly the wish of the large majority of Alliance members who were not members of any of the founding affiliate groups , and the DSP agreed with them .
However , all the other affiliated revolutionary socialist groups disagreed .
Each thought their own “ correct ” programs would be liquidated if they built the Alliance as our common party .
They could conceive of the Alliance only as a site for their “ real ” revolutionary parties to intervene in or , at best , as a “ united front of a special kind ” .
This view , which is sectarian because it spurned a chance to unite politically with a broader layer of left leadership in the movements , was rejected by the majority of Alliance members in at least three national conferences in a row ( in a situation where the DSP restricted its representation in both delegates and elected leadership bodies ) .
SV : Some groups and individuals who were a part of the founding of the Socialist Alliance or of its early years then departed .
Were their departures justified , and did they end the project ?
Their departures were not justified and these departures did not kill off the Socialist Alliance .
By the Socialist Alliance ’s May 2005 national conference , it was clear that all the other revolutionary groups affiliated to the Alliance were opposed to taking the Alliance forward .
At most they were willing to participate in the Alliance as a loose electoral front in which a minority retained veto powers by right of their group affiliate status .
They began to pull back even the relatively modest resources they put into the Alliance .
By 2007 , all the founding affiliates aside from the DSP and Resistance , a youth organisation allied to the DSP , had formally left the Alliance .
Also in 2005 , a minority emerged in the DSP which essentially agreed with the sectarian approach of other affiliates who opposed building the Socialist Alliance as a new multi-tendency socialist party .
The DSP majority decided that it was be wrong to abandon the Socialist Alliance , arguing that the large majority of people who had joined and were not members of the founding affiliate groups still saw the Alliance as their party and that the Alliance had won a modest but significant broader recognition and respect in the labour movement .
The DSP then underwent a protracted three - year - long internal faction fight , which took significant energy away from building the Socialist Alliance .
But through all this the majority of the non-affiliate group membership of the Socialist Alliance continued to see the Alliance as their party .
Craig Johnson and Sam Watson are still members , as are most of the militant trade union shop - floor delegates and social movement activists .
Others have joined the Socialist Alliance since .
A group of Sudanese communists affiliated to the Alliance last year .
They produce Green Left Weekly ’s Arabic - language supplement ( a significant gain , as Arabic is one of the major minority language groups in Australia today ) . [ 3 ]
A prominent Sinhalese public defender of Tamil rights in Sri Lanka has joined , as have some Salvadoran community supporters of the FMLN .
And there is a small but steady stream of former Labor party members .
Continued growth
The majority of the members of the Socialist Alliance are still not members of any affiliate group .
So the confidence of the DSP majority in the need to keep building the Socialist Alliance has been confirmed .
The Alliance is the biggest socialist organisation in the country , and it is continuing to regroup the left in a modest but nevertheless significant degree .
The groups that left the Alliance did so despite being able to agree on a common political platform and despite years of common experience working effectively together in the trade union and other social movements .
This is the amazing part of our experience , and it should not be missed .
Between 2001 and 2005 , the Alliance proved that the fractious left could work together and that in doing so it could become more effective .
But it also showed us that the political will to do so has to be there as well .
The various left groups that walked out of the Socialist Alliance can work together in the future if they have the will to do so .
Everyone in the left has to confront the following questions sooner or later .
Are you serious about your socialism ?
And what is more important -- preserving many micro-parties , each defending its programmatic shibboleths and the ordained leadership role this is supposed to give them , or struggling to win real leadership authority in a bigger , broader and more effective party of left regroupment ?
By and large , the Australian Greens party still claim most of the progressive vote in this country .
This has discouraged smaller socialist groups from staying in the Socialist Alliance , at least to participate in elections .
The fact is that the Socialist Alliance has usually struggled to get more than 1.5 % in elections , though in local elections in NSW and Victoria last year , Alliance candidates received votes from 4.5 % to as high as 18.9 % .
Under increasingly draconian / exclusive electoral registration regulations , the relative breadth of the Socialist Alliance made it possible to get the word “ socialist ” onto ballot papers in most states / territories and nationally for the first time in decades .
Our modest election campaigns also raised the profile of socialism .
Each one of the alphabet soup of small socialist groups say they ’ll be in a new left party if what is on offer is a new mass party .
They ’d be in such a party even if its politics was reformist or liberal .
The Socialist Alliance is not a mass party , but it is an opportunity to build a bigger party around a class struggle program , like that of the New Anti-Capitalist Party in France [ 4 ] .
I do n’t think the left should pass up on what we have achieved to date .
SV : What role did the Alliance play in last year ’s federal election that saw the Labor Party returned to power ?
A major reason why the Alliance continues to hold the loyalty of forces broader than the smaller socialist groups is that it played an active role in building a mass fightback against a set of draconian anti-union and anti-worker laws introduced by the former Liberal - National federal government .
These were laws that threatened to smash rights won by the labour movement over the last century and it was clear that the previous government had the will and the numbers in parliament to push them through .
The left had two choices at that point .
It could retreat , circle the wagons around the revolutionary program ( or rather their umpteen variations of it ) and survive as little socialist groups living off a few idealistic youth recruits from the campuses .
Or it could try and build the best possible mass fightback in the labour movement and continue with left regroupment .
We had this discussion in the DSP and in the Socialist Alliance , and a majority of members were in favour of fighting for the best mass resistance possible .
Even if a fight could not stop these laws from being passed , a workers ’ movement that put up a mass fightback would come out with the greatest strength to fight again another day .
In May 2005 , alongside the Socialist Alliance national conference , we initiated a broader gathering of militant trade unionists called the Fightback Conference . [ 5 ]
It was a powerful gathering , as all the affiliate groups at the time acknowledged .
The militant section was a minority in the trade union movement at that time , as it is now , but it resolved to fight .
First , it won mass support among union delegates in the state of Victoria , initially for a mass response to the anti-worker laws which were outrageously named “ Work Choices ” by the Liberal - National government .
Mass actions for union rights
The first mass action against Work Choices took place in June , 2005 .
Some 350,000 workers mobilised around the country and did so against the wishes of the top trade union leadership , the Australian Council of Trade Unions ( ACTU ) .
The ACTU leadership had decided that industrial and street action would put off voters and so the trade unions should wage the fight through multi-million dollar television advertisements instead .
But after trade unions in Victoria , Queensland , and Western Australia decided to break from this approach , the ACTU began to crumble .
In the state of New South Wales , a panicked union leadership called mass delegate meetings to try and ram through the ACTU ’s “ clever tactics ” advertising perspective .
But to their horror , the delegates voted for mass action .
The Socialist Alliance was blamed for taking over these meetings .
We wish we had had the strength to do that .
In fact , this was a largely spontaneous expression of rank - and - file wishes .
The second national mobilisation took place in November 2005 .
This time the ACTU backed the call - out and regained control of most of the platforms , though militant unionists still featured in some cities and led the platforms in a couple of regional cities .
About 650,000 workers mobilised in what was the biggest single workers ’ movement mobilisation in Australian history .
There were more mass mobilisations in the next two years , and although the anti-worker laws were passed into law in March 2006 , the Liberal - National ’s Prime Minister John Howard became a widely reviled figure .
Finally , Howard ( who lost his own seat in a blue - ribbon Liberal district ! ) and the Liberal - National government was swept out in the November 2007 elections .
Since then , we ’ve had a chance to test the theory that putting up a fight against the anti-union laws preserves the strength of the labour movement ( and other social movements ) .
We ’ve done so in the more difficult context of the new , Labor Party federal government that remains very popular , in part because of the memory of the anti-worker actions of the previous government .
The Labor government is trying to preserve as much of the neo-liberal measures implemented by previous governments ( both Liberal - National and Labor ) while appearing to stand for change .
Labor PM Kevin Rudd is like an Obama without the charisma !
It is very clear already that on the fronts of workers ’ rights , Indigenous rights , climate change , and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the Rudd Labor government is betraying its promises to the people who swept it into government .
It is working hard to minimise opposition to its betrayals .
It retains a huge influence over most trade union officials as well as the loyalty of a conservative top leadership of the environmental movement and influential but conservative Aboriginal figures .
We are seeing growing dissent on all these fronts , and Socialist Alliance continues to be among the activists in each of these struggles .
However , most of the left outside the Alliance is still in the mode of retreat and abstention .
On April 28 , some 15,000 workers in the construction industry took to the streets in Melbourne to protest Labor ’s failure to remove anti-worker laws dating from the Work Choices era that specifically target unions in this industry .
These workers are in the forefront of workers ’ struggles today and they are an example of the future coming toward us .
The most militant sections of this struggle is in the state of Victoria again , because this is where the militant section of the trade unions is strongest .
They have a strong base at the shop - floor level in several industries .
This is in part a legacy of the struggle of an earlier generation of socialists , led by militants influenced by Maoism the 1970s .
But Socialist Alliance is now part of that section of militant unionists .
Another significant victory this year was at a national meeting of climate change groups in Canberra in February where the radical platform supported by Socialist Alliance and a number of other environmentalists , including a section in the Greens Party , was adopted .
The first round of national mass mobilisations initiated through this process will take place in June to mark World Environment Day .
Climate change is a critical political issue which the left needs to prioritise today .
SV : Your party has been reporting favourably on new parties of left regroupment and expansion in the Philippines , Indonesia , Venezuela and other countries .
Are you encouraged by developments there , and are there lessons for the peoples of other countries ?
Australia is a rich imperialist country that is relatively isolated from the rest of the world .
So in the DSP we have always attached great importance to staying in touch with struggles overseas .
We seek to learn from these struggles as well as to make a modest contribution to the popularisation of all struggles of resistance and progressive change -- particularly in the Asia - Pacific region .
Our international collaboration has kept us inspired and also as open Marxists -- Marxists who take seriously Marx ’s own warning not to treat his powerful ideas as a religion .
The Venezuelan revolution is shaping the movement for socialism in the 21st century .
Every real step forward for the socialist movement is worth more than a thousand paper manifestos .
We are determined to learn from the experiences of the revolutions today .
That is why we have DSP comrades in Venezuela and in Nepal , making links and facilitating deeper study of the revolutionary experiences there .
That is why our comrades play a major role in leading brigades to Venezuela twice a year since 2005 .
I recently traveled to the Philippines in order to learn about and report on the new , mass party of the left that has been formed there , called the “ Party of the Masses ” .
We maintain fraternal ties with it and with parties and activists in Indonesia , Malaysia , Pakistan , India and many other countries .
Party - building perspectives
Over the next six months , in the lead - up to a DSP congress scheduled for January 2010 , members of the DSP are going to have a serious discussion about party - building perspectives .
How do we best build on the gains we have made through the DSP and the gains made through the Socialist Alliance ?
We ’ll be involving Socialist Alliance members who are not members of the DSP in this discussion .
It will be public .
My personal opinion is that it is time for the DSP to make a decisive turn towards building the Socialist Alliance as our new party .
We ’ve been held back by the hesitations of former Alliance affiliates and a former minority in the DSP for too long already .
That ’s behind us now and it is time we moved forward .
This opinion has been strengthened through many discussions with a broad range of our international collaborators who participated in the recent World at a Crossroads Conference in Sydney . [ 6 ]
The DSP ’s broad international work allows us to think more creatively about what we can do to build a bigger and stronger socialist movement in our country .
SV : Could you explain what are some of the next steps that you might take in this direction ?
The DSP is serious about left regroupment and we are serious about revolutionary socialism .
We do n’t have the infantile delusion that the DSP is the vanguard party of the revolution .
A real revolutionary vanguard has to be built through a process of regroupment / s and accumulation of political experience and actual political authority in the labour movement .
What we have done in our tendency over the last four decades is but one small part of this process .
This is not to minimise what we ’ve done since our beginning as a party project in the early 1970s , but rather to have a sense of the true proportion of the work we have done and what has yet to be done .
We confront the challenge of left regroupment in a time of severe , triple crisis of capitalism .
First , the climate change crisis , which threatens human survival on a global level ; second , the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression ( though it is hitting Australia later than countries ) ; and third , the widespread crisis of legitimacy of capitalist neo-liberalism .
The legitimacy crisis of capitalist neo-liberalism is not a new phenomenon .
It has been mounting up for more than a decade and underpins the revolutionary advances in Latin America and elsewhere , as well as wave of anti-capitalist globalisation at the turn of the century .
The left in Australia is too small to force the pace of the movements needed to fight the capitalist “ solutions ” to these crises that are being prepared and beginning to be imposed .
We have to be in the growing resistance to these capitalist “ solutions . ”
Any left group that is content to just shout from the sidelines “ Capitalism has failed , embrace socialism ! ” is doomed to become ever more sectarian .
Discussion on popular power
That said , there is also an expanded room for political discussions about capitalism and socialism .
If the left does this well , it will strengthen the forces that are building resistance movements to the triple crisis .
So we need to put our minds to this challenge .
Coming out of the World at a Crossroads Conference , we had some informal discussion about what to build in Australia as a next major international conference of socialist discussion , debate and collaboration .
Michael Lebowitz , one of our guest speakers , suggested that we hold a conference next year about historical experiences in popular power and participatory democracy that takes in experiences ( contemporary and historical ) from around the world .
We ’ve forged growing links with the comrades leading the communal councils / commune process in Venezuela , which seeks to become a new base institution of popular power .
We ’ve got links with numerous socialists who have studied the real experiences of the Soviet system , the Cuban democratic system , and other such historical experiences of popular power .
We ’ve got links with socialists involved in workers ’ management or who have done real studies in previous such experiments .
We have links with militant trade unionists in Australia with years of real experience in militant shop - floor and delegate organising .
We have links with local government activists who have explored participatory democracy at that level , and so on .
Can we bring all these comrades together in a common discussion ?
Well , we are discussing this and other ideas with a broad range of collaborators .
History has shown that the biggest problem for the world ’s oppressed majority is not coming to an awareness of the failures and injustices of the capitalist system but developing the confidence that the majority can exercise its democratic power in a participatory and sustainable way .
It remains the key ideological question upon which turns the prospects for the transformation of socialism into a mass movement in the 21st century .

WHENEVER
Canadians grow anxious about heightened security at the United States border — as they are now because of America 's new requirement , from June 1st , for passports or other approved identification to be shown at entry points — their news media invariably invoke the twin towns of Stanstead , Quebec , and Derby Line , Vermont .
In these towns , the line that looks so neat on maps is a messy business , running through a factory , a combined library and opera house , and a number of homes .
In some cases it lies between the bedroom and a morning cup of tea .
To Canadians , this pleasing informality underscores their special relationship with Americans , with whom they share the world 's closest country - to - country trade ties as well as bonds of kinship .
Until September 11th 2001 Americans and Canadians crossing the border often only needed to state their nationality .
Even after the attacks a wide range of informal identification documents was accepted .
Such laxity is an anomaly to Janet Napolitano , President Barack Obama 's homeland - security secretary , who wants controls along the United States ' northern border to be brought closer in line with those on the frontier with Mexico .
Speaking to reporters before a two - day visit to Canada , on May 26th and 27th , Ms Napolitano said she wanted to “ change the culture ” along the 8,900 km ( 5,500 - mile ) line to make it clear that “ this is a real border . ”
Her words are a clear sign that the Obama administration will not only uphold but enhance measures introduced since 2001 , despite complaints from both sides of the border that they impede movements of all sorts , particularly trade in goods that was worth $ 1.6 billion a day in 2008 .
Ms Napolitano tried to assuage Canadian concerns during her visit , talking of the need to help trade , jobs and growth .
But her department 's plans to install heat - detecting sensors along the border , put more surveillance drones in the sky and place additional cameras along the St Clair river in Michigan and the Upper Niagara in New York are taken by some frontier communities as a personal affront .
American officials say the millions of new identity documents they have issued should ensure that there will be no big delays at the border after June 1st .
But if their confidence is misplaced , heaping more trouble on Canadian exporters already struggling to cope with the recession , the bilateral relationship is likely to sour .
Some Canadians understand that their southern neighbour has real concerns about security , given the relative openness of its northern border .
“ We 're not going to go back , no matter how much we want to , to the situation before 9/11 , ” says Shirley - Ann George , head of policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce .
“ But we can make it better . ”
The chamber has been working with its American counterpart to propose ways of reducing border delays while maintaining adequate security .
These include clearing shipments and people before they get to crossing - points .
Canadians are already worried at signs of rising protectionism in their neighbour 's Democrat - led Congress , in the form of Buy American provisions in the economic - stimulus package and proposals in a new environmental bill to impose trade sanctions on countries with high levels of greenhouse - gas emissions .
Their indignation has been heightened by two unfortunate incidents .
A contractor at the Camp Pendleton Marine base in California ripped out a section of sewerage pipe because it was Canadian - made ; and a Canadian salesman travelling to an equestrian - products trade show was turned back at the Washington state border on the ground that he was “ stealing ” American jobs .
Tony Clement , Canada 's industry minister , says all this risks provoking a backlash among his countrymen .
It has already begun .
The industry group representing Canadian manufacturers has identified seven bills with protectionist provisions making their way through Capitol Hill and is calling for Canada to threaten retaliatory action .
On May 25th a member of Canada 's left - leaning New Democratic Party introduced a private member 's bill that would require the government to give Canadian companies priority when buying goods or services .
Like many others , Canadians had unrealistic expectations of how much things would change when Barack Obama replaced George Bush .
Ms Napolitano 's words both before and during her visit to Canada have put an end to such optimism .
For the new occupant of the White House , as for his predecessor , the noisy demands of Capitol Hill will always drown out any whimpers from across the border .
The drug has been offered to those with close contact to swine flu Experts have reported the first case of swine flu that is resistant to tamiflu - the main drug being used to fight the pandemic .
Roche Holding AG confirmed a patient with H1N1 influenza in Denmark showed resistance to the antiviral drug .
David Reddy , company executive , said it was not unexpected given that common seasonal flu could do the same .
The news comes as a nine - year - old girl has become the third to die in the UK with swine flu .
It is understood from her doctors at Birmingham Children 's Hospital that she had underlying health conditions .
It is not yet known whether swine flu contributed to her death .
Meanwhile , the Department of Health has announced a big jump in the number of patients in England confirmed with swine flu - up 1,604 since Friday , taking the UK total so far to 5,937 .
Routine sampling in the UK has shown that there is currently no resistance to oseltamivir or zanamivir
A Health Protection Agency spokeswoman Experts have been using tamiflu , also known as oseltamivir , in a bid to stop the H1N1 spreading in communities .
If taken early , it ensures that symptoms are mild and reduces the chance of a victim giving the illness to someone else .
This first reported case of resistance developed in a swine flu patient taking Tamiflu .
Watch and wait Mr Reddy stressed that there were no signs of a tamiflu - resistant strain of H1N1 circulating in the community .
This is in contrast to seasonal H1N1 flu where a Tamiflu resistant strain emerged last year and is now widely circulating .
Experts fear if this were to happen , it could render tamiflu ineffective .
Another antiviral drug , called zanamivir or Relenza , made by GlaxoSmithKline , is also effective against swine flu .
The UK government has been stockpiling these antiviral drugs and currently has enough to treat half of the population , with a contract to bring that up to 80 % as soon as possible .
Supplies of flu vaccine have also been ordered and the first doses could be administered in the autumn .
A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency said : " The Health Protection Agency continues to watch for antiviral resistance and will be carrying out regular sample testing throughout this outbreak .
" We have been monitoring antiviral drug resistance since the beginning of this outbreak .
Routine sampling in the UK has shown that there is currently no resistance to oseltamivir or zanamivir . "
Virologist Professor John Oxford said : " I 'm not surprised about this finding .
The question is whether it is going to spread .
We will soon know the answer . "

Yesterday we mentioned how the National Association of Realtors , and its chief economist Larry Yun , was complaining about " low - ball " appraisals , saying they were hurting the housing market .
Basically , they 're upset about a new law that requires an objective , third - party appraiser and the use of distressed sale prices ( AKA market prices ) in determining the value of a home .
Well , Barry Ritholtz has done more digging into this , and suggests that based on the NAR 's activity , you might almost conclude that the NAR is " pro fraud "
He found this letter from the NAR , detailing its effort to thwart the legislation :
TO : State Association Executive Officers
State Association Presidents
FROM : NAR Government Affairs
DATE : 19 June 2009
RE : Fly - In Head ’s Up
Please note this notice is going to all state executive officers and state presidents .
We will be sending Fly - In details on Monday June 22 , 2009 to the states who have Members of Congress and / or United States Senators on the House Financial Services Committee or Senate Banking Committee .
( list of states at end of memo )
There is growing concern in the real estate industry over the implementation of the Home Valuation Code of Conduct ( HVCC ) and its effect on the use of appraisal management companies ( AMCs ) by lenders .
NAR is taking the following actions : ( Target dates in bold )
1. NAR is scheduling meetings with the Director of Federal Housing Finance Agency , Jim Lockhart to raise concerns about implementation of the HVCC and problems with AMCs and ask for an immediate 18 month moratorium .
Director Lockhart is the conservator over Fannie and Freddie who entered the consent order with the NY Attorney General .
( June 22 , 23 , 24 , or 25th )
2. Government Affairs will conduct a fly in the week of June 22 .
Two members from each Association ( State AE / State President or FPC as appropriate ) to meet with members / staff of the House and Senate Banking / Financial Services Committee .
The ask will be to cosponsor the bill ( item 3 ) and to support an 18 month moratorium .
3 . Our legislative team will work on getting a bill introduced in Congress asking for a 18 month moratorium .
( week of June 22 )
4 . We will ask the Chair and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Banking [ Reps Frank and Bachus / Senators Dodd and Shelby ]
Committees to write Director Lockhart asking him to grant a 18 month moratorium ( week of June 22 )
5 . We will try and get an 18 month moratorium attached to an immediate pending appropriation bill or other similar fast track bill .
( June )
6. Staff will talk to the American Bankers Association who heretofore is fine with the AMC system to see if we can negotiate support . ( June 19 )
NAR will engage a coalition of Appraisal Institute , MBA , Home Builders and other appropriate trade groups .
7. NAR Research is conducting a survey so we have concrete data information to bring to the regulators and the NY Attorney General ’s office .
The survey will also be run through the State Association .
EHS will be released next week and the appraisal issue will be mentioned front and center in NAR ’s release .
Survey release June 22
8. NAR is scheduling a meeting with NYS Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and representatives of NYSAR .
( June 29 . 30 )
9. NAR will conduct a Call For Action if we do not get a moratorium in the next week to 10 days
NAR is aware of multiple petitions calling for an end to the HVCC .
NAR is taking a more tempered and thoughtful approach of asking for a moratorium during this trouble housing economy .
States with Members of Congress and / or United States Senators on the House Financial Services Committee or Senate Banking Committee : AL , CA , CO , CT , DE , FL , GA , HI , ID , IL , IN , KS , KY , LA , MA , MI , MN , MO , MS , MT , NC , NE , NH , NJ , NY , OH , OK , OR
PA , RI , SC , SD , TN , TX , UT , VA , WI , WV
Now , this is what lobbying groups do :
They fight legislation that they think will hurt its constituency .
And it obviously hurts the NAR 's members if homes are n't being given generous appraisals .
But seeing as dishonest appraisals played a big role in inflating the bubble , and since the bubble proved to be so harmful , and since inflated appraisals hurt buyers , this is a ridiculous fight to be picking .
But then , it 's the NAR .
Everyone knows their agenda , and the group has no shortage of critics .
If only a third party could collect some of the stats they do , like existing home sales , there 'd be no reason to give the group any attention .
As it is , they 'll always get the spotlight when they release this data .
Last Monday , May 25th , the annual Cooper 's Hill Cheese - Rolling and Wake was held near Gloucester , England .
In a tradition that dates back at least 200 years , possibly much longer , groups of fearless competitors chase an 8 pound ( 3.5 kg ) round of Double Gloucester Cheese down an extremely steep and uneven hill , with a 1:1 gradient in some parts .
Thousands of spectators gather to watch the five downhill and four uphill races , and to celebrate the winners and console the losers afterward .
Injuries such as broken bones and concussions are commonplace , but the event continues to grow in popularity .
The winner of each race is awarded the delicious round of cheese they were chasing .

As of today the bill now has 223 cosponsors .

Ida , the fossil of an early primate , caused a sensation when she was unveiled last month .
But she is just one of thousands of beautifully preserved ancient creatures that are being unearthed from an old shale quarry in Germany .
Patrick Barkham pays a visit
One day , in an ancient land , a small bat began an incredible journey through time .
Dusk was falling in the forest when he swooped low over a lake .
Suddenly , a belch of noxious gas from a fissure caused him to fall into the water .
Escaping the attentions of small crocodiles , the bat sank nearly 300 m to the bottom of the lake .
Gently , he settled into the sediment , as if his mother had tucked him into bed .
Over 48 m years , continents shifted , the lake silted up and the little bat slept on .
Much later , there was the banging and crashing of new arrivals .
One of these excitable primates discovered shale oil in this small patch of German forest and dug up the sediment .
The remnants of mysterious prehistoric beasts crumbled into pieces like the oil shale around them .
The bat had some near - misses .
When the human primates fought , pilots looked down on the giant smoking crater of the open - cast mine and assumed they had already bombed it .
Later , these quarrelsome humans decided to fill its 60 m crater with rubbish .
Others protested and frantically dug up fossilised anteaters , tapirs and miniature horses before they could be buried again .
Finally , last week , the bat was gently prised from his stone covers by a palaeontologist , and bathed in water so he would not crumble into dust .
Grime was gently brushed from his wings and tiny ears by the team of scientists led by Stephan Schaal from the Senckenberg , the largest natural history museum in Germany .
The bat will be attached to a slab of yellow resin and given a name , and then he will be admired in a museum for the short time these humans walk the earth .
When a rather different fossil , Darwinius masillae , or Ida , was unveiled in New York last month , she caused a sensation .
She was hailed in this paper as " a crucial ' missing link ' between our own evolutionary branch of life and the rest of the animal kingdom " .
While the scientific significance of this celebrity fossil primate will be debated for years , her story was certainly compelling : a broken wrist , a fatal fall , millions of years in the ground and 20 in the clutches of a possessive private collector before she finally came into public view .
Equally amazing , however , are the stories of thousands of other creatures who , like Ida , lived , died and have found an afterlife at Grube Messel , or the Messel Pit , one of the richest repositories of fossilised life in the world .
Unlike Ida the fossil rock star , the Messel Pit is unassuming in the extreme .
Tucked behind an industrial estate 18 miles south of Frankfurt , it is badly signposted and hard to find .
Local office workers shrug their shoulders ; they do n't know where or what it is .
Down a rough lane , between a building site and lorries plundering old heaps of shale , are a couple of portable cabins for a trickle of visitors .
A housekeeper doubles as a security guard .
Beyond a modest fence slumps a spectacularly large crater , 60 m deep and feathery around the sides with birch trees , elder , nettles and ragwort .
At the bottom is a tiny pond from which rises the croak of dozens of frogs .
The frogs would have been croaking 48 m years ago , when Messel was a deep volcanic lake in the subtropical rainforests of the European archipelago .
While lemur - like primates such as Ida clambered through the trees , tapirs , anteaters and primitive hedgehogs snuffled in the forest .
A miniature horse , 50 cm high and pregnant , stood by the water .
Woodpeckers pursued giant ants , crocodiles snapped at perch , turtles mated and a snake that would come to be named after the German Green politician Joschka Fischer weaved along the shore .
Turning up just 2 m years ago , humans tend to look pretty insignificant in the history of the Messel Pit , but Fischer is one person who played a small part in ensuring its survival .
Another is Schaal , who when not cleaning up newly discovered bats must wonder how Ida will affect the future of Messel .
Each discovery triggers dozens of new questions .
Why did species such as tapirs become extinct in Europe ?
Or how did a migratory eel get into the lake ?
" It 's like a puzzle , every year a new piece , " says Schaal .
The unveiling of Ida , however , poses some less scientific riddles .
Will Ida cause the pit , which is open to the public but with excavation restricted to scientists with permits , to be swamped with visitors ?
Will there be a return to the illicit plundering of its treasures ?
And is there another Ida , or something even more spectacular , still buried ?
The first crocodile was pulled from the earth at Messel by miners in 1875 , around the time the extraction of oil shale , used to produce paraffin and later , industrial oils , began in earnest .
Oil shale is a dark , flaky sedimentary rock .
Layers of shale come apart like the pages of a book , exposing rather flattened fossils , often in two halves .
These fossils were amazingly well - preserved .
Because the volcanic lake was so deep , no oxygen circulated at the bottom , and animal carcasses could not be eaten by scavengers .
Slowly , bacteria ate the soft tissue , creating a cast of the creature through the mineral waste they left behind .
As well as bones , you can see outlines of animals , the markings on its feathers , soft skin and even stomach contents .
There was one problem : these beautiful fossils were as ephemeral as a sunset .
When shale is dug from the ground , it quickly dries , turning brittle and crumbly .
Fossils would simply shatter .
In the 1960s , however , a " transfer " technique was developed .
Resin was applied to the fossil found on a slab of shale and the bones and the tracings of its soft tissue would attach themselves to the resin .
" With the transfer method it was possible to get aesthetically pleasing fossils and significantly interesting fossils , " says Norbert Micklich of the Hessen state museum in nearby Darmstadt ( Micklich 's museum and the Frankfurt - based Senckenberg are only institutions currently licensed to excavate the pit ) .
Without this method , says the gruff Micklich , " even Ida would have looked like bullshit " .
Scientists and amateur collectors quickly mastered the technique that could turn Messel 's fossils into collectable treasures ideal for hanging on a living room wall .
The mining may have destroyed thousands of great fossils but , as Schaal points out , " on the other hand , we would n't have the hole .
We would n't be in those layers , we would be 60 m above and we would n't have a single fossil . "
The mining stopped in 1971 and Messel became a mini El Dorado .
At times , 300 fossil - hunters would be digging at random .
" It was like a gold rush .
Many people who were not well equipped went into the pit , " says Micklich .
Exotic primitive relatives of tapirs and anteaters were dug up .
So too were tiny horses ( one with the bones of a foal still visible in its womb ) .
In 1975 , the first primate was discovered .
It was a male : among the remains was the baculum - the penis bone that is found in most mammals .
Many fossil sites serve up one , characteristic kind of fossil .
Messel boasts an unusual diversity : the lake was , in effect , a deadly trap for not just mammals but birds , fish , plants and even insects - brilliant beetles in iridescent orange and metallic turquoise - from 48 m years ago .
" It 's like you open a window and look into a time you do n't know , " says Schaal .
Scientists are building up an amazingly detailed picture of this ancient ecosystem .
In Messel 's fossils , they can calculate the frequency a bat echo - located on from the shape and size of its ears .
Queens and kings of a species of giant ant with a 12 cm wingspan have been found but , oddly , no worker ants .
Sonja Wedmann , a scientist at Senckenberg , believes the queen 's wings would have dragged her under when she fell on the water : humble worker ants , unencumbered by wings , could have scampered across the water to safety .
Turtles the size of dinner plates have often been picked up in pairs , a large one nestled with a smaller one , back - to - back .
These perished in a moment of vulnerable ecstasy : just as they mated .
In the 70s and 80s , at least some part of the febrile excitement around the pit had little to do with a spirit of scientific inquiry .
Nevertheless , even the greed of private collectors had an altruistic flavour when it was the announced the pit would become a rubbish dump .
Every state political party supported the landfill plan , except the Green party ( and Fischer ) .
So " emergency excavations " began .
Museums were permitted to excavate fossils but illegal digging continued too : as Schaal says , people felt it was morally justifiable because it would soon be buried in garbage .
The museums welcomed help from amateurs .
In haste , much may have been lost .
" Everyone tried to get out large mammals .
Insects and smaller things were discarded , " says Micklich .
In the midst of this chaos , in 1983 , someone found Ida .
She came out in two halves .
Whether they were kept together at first is a mystery but secretly , and very expertly , Ida 's better half was preserved in resin .
And so , another riddle at Messel was created : how could someone whisk away the pit 's greatest discovery from under the noses of everyone ?
Relatively easily , say the scientists .
The finder would have needed people to help extract Ida but assistants could have been oblivious to what they were helping with : like most discoveries , before she was cleaned up and examined , her significance may not have been apparent .
Schaal began working at Messel in 1984 .
He joined the campaign to save the pit .
Every time he found a new fossil , he raced to the local paper and urged them to write stories about it .
" The first years were really hard for me .
I got my grey hairs then , " he sighs .
In 1987 , a local court threw out the landfill plan but legal battles continued until 1991 when the state of Hessen bought the site .
Four years later , Unesco crowned it a World Heritage Site .
In Germany , the owner of the land where a fossil is found owns half that fossil .
Rumours of a spectacular discovery swirled among those who worked at Messel for years , but the first step towards the unveiling of Ida came with an amnesty : finds taken before it became a World Heritage Site were declared legal .
" At this moment , private collectors began to show them to scientists , and sell them , " says Schaal .
" It was a very important step for the science . "
Schaal and his colleagues at Senckenberg cultivated relationships with private collectors ; gradually he built up an idea of who had what .
He refuses to judge private hunters .
" You can say it was not legal but it was helpful that they worked here in the pit .
If they were able to prepare them , they were able to produce good fossils , " he says .
His contacts led Schaal to be offered Ida before she was sold .
He calls her " Part A " because " Part B " , the other , less perfect half of Ida , was identified several years ago and purchased by Burkhard Pohl , a German vet turned collector who placed it in his private museum in Wyoming .
( Part A was eventually bought by the palaeontologist Jørn Hurum , the man who paraded her before the press last month . )
" Senckenberg knew about Part A two years ago and they asked if we wanted to buy it and it was too expensive , " says Schaal .
" Of course , museums like to have such a piece but we decided not to buy it , so we do n't regret it now .
This find is important because it 's complete and because the quality is good .
It is good that it is public but I cannot say more about the real significance about whether it's the missing link or not .
The main point is that science has now got the work .
Everybody can look at it and study it .
This is what is important . "
The unspoken implication is that Ida is not as significant as billed , but Schaal wo n't be drawn .
It is not sour grapes : two of what he calls , without irony , the " dream team " of scientists who wrote the academic paper on Ida are from Senckenburg .
Micklich seems rather more unimpressed by the hullabaloo around Ida .
He also looked at Ida around the time she was sold .
" We have seen this specimen , " he says of Ida .
" It is a counterpart of a described specimen [ Part B , the less good half of Ida , in the Wyoming museum ] and we wondered how could a known species now be an unknown species ?
But we could not imagine this hype . "
His colleague , Gabriele Gruber , tactfully adds : " It 's a very fine fossil .
It is very well preserved . "
Will Ida help Messel ?
An exhibition of remarkable Messel finds from Micklich 's museum is currently touring Germany after museums in London and America turned it down .
They probably would not do so again .
Micklich and Gruber agree that Messel 's raised profile may help its scientists find more financial support .
Then again , as scientists have a habit of saying , it may not .
Overhyped palaeontology that panders to our fascination with mammal fossils creates a problem for the likes of Micklich and Gruber , who are studying fish and invertebrates .
" It is dangerous because our work is evaluated by these striking records , " says Micklich .
" If you can't hold a striking press conference every year then people will ask , ' Why are you costing us this money ? ' "
Are there more spectacular finds buried in Grube Messel ?
During the April - September excavation season , every day , on average , Schaal 's team of a dozen researchers will find 10 fish , 10 plants and 10 insects .
Every week they will find a bird or a bat .
Schaal is confident there will be more Idas .
" Every year we find more big mammals .
It is possible we will find the next primate tomorrow , or in 20 years , but as we are digging every summer the chances are quite good .
It 's only a question of time before we find the next primate " .

Essential in life , Google may soon play a part in death .
Earlier this month the company added an option to its Google Health site allowing users – so far only in America – to state their final wishes .
" One of the most important documents you may want to store and share in Google Health is an advance directive , " announced the Google blog .
" An advance directive allows you to determine your end - of - life wishes so that your family and doctor can honor them if you get sick and are unable to communicate .
The decision to sign an advance directive is an important and personal one , and Google Health now makes it a little bit easier . "
Some people will find this sinister .
A company that began by creating a brilliant search tool is straying into the most intimate of areas .
Google has grown by being good at what it does , but also through what it knows .
It tracks search histories , tailors advertising to email , and agglomerates content from every source it can get access to , fulfilling its corporate mission " to organise the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful " .
To that , Google might add profitable , since the way to internet riches is to know the details of users ' lives .
In the Times yesterday David Davis , the former shadow home secretary , turned on his party over reports that British patients might be encouraged to use Google Health and its counterparts , rather than persist with the expensive and much - delayed NHS database .
" Google is the last company I would trust with data belonging to me , " he wrote .
Rather than increase personal control over medical data , he argues that it would end it .
Google is not subject to ministerial orders , or European regulation .
It promises never to sell advertising alongside medical information , but it has done deals with US pharmacy chains under which these groups are encouraging their 100 million customers to lodge their prescription records with Google Health .
The Conservatives , whose independent review on medical IT reports soon , say there is no prospect of NHS records being handed over to Google in bulk .
The party argues that it is simply preparing for an open source world , where individuals will manage and share data more effectively , and cheaply , than government ever can .
If people want to use Google Health , or Microsoft HealthVault , they should be allowed to , on their own terms .
But for individuals to be empowered , they must first be protected .
Data is only guarded by the promises of the organisations that hold it .
Users can protest if the terms of their contracts are changed , but there are no central rules and no central control .
For some , that is the attraction .
But do not mistake this for a right to privacy .
• This article was amended on Tuesday 28 July 2009 .
We said that Google had done deals to get access to the prescription records of 100 million American patients .
In fact , Google has reached agreements with some US pharmacy chains under which these groups are encouraging their 100 million customers to lodge their prescription records with Google Health .
This has been corrected .
The Shadow over Erris : Shell , IRMS and Bolivia mayo | rights , freedoms and repression | feature Friday June 26 , 2009 14:04 Friday June 26 , 2009 14:04 by Andrew - WSM ( personal capacity ) by Andrew - WSM ( personal capacity ) Sometimes monsters do exist Dwyer Posing With Guns In Bolivia
In any country with a half way critical media , the last few months would have been disastrous for Shell .
In a crucial period in Shells imposition of an experimental gas pipeline on the people of Erris it emerges that Michael Dwyer , one of the security guards on this project , was part of an attempt to trigger a civil war in Bolivia .
Soon after that it became clear that at least three others who had worked as security guards at the Shell compound had travelled to Bolivia with Dwyer and were wanted there for questioning .
Some , it emerged , had links to fascist organizations in Eastern Europe .
At least 156 private security personnel work on what Shell calls the ' Corrib Project ' accompanied , according to the Irish Times , by up to  Several hundred Gardaí and the Naval Service .. with the Naval Service deploying one and possibly  two patrol ships .
( 1 ) The level of force being deployed to impose the Shell pipeline project on the local population is a testimony to the long running resistance of the people of Erris , a resistance that so far has not been broken by dozens of arrests , violence and the most vitriolic of attacks from paid hacks in the mainstream media .
At the time of writing everyone is preparing for the return of the pipe laying ship , the Soltaire .
In advance of its return strange events have occurred in the dead of night .
One Shell to Sea protester , Willie Corduff , required hospitalization after an
Lack of investigation
Yet in the same period we have seen both TV and print
At a time when health , education and community programs are being slashed due to lack of funds  surely this is a story ?
Given the history of corruption that has emerged from the tribunals , which involved the same politicians who gave Shell the Gas for free , what might be dug out with a little journalism ?
The material found with a little bit of googling on the topic would make for a Hollywood film script , never mind a major expose in any of the major papers .
Yet that article has yet to appear in any major mainstream media in Ireland .
As we will see more has appeared in the international press .
On the margins of the Irish media some things have been published , but basically as the work of one or two of the dozens of journalists who are supposedly reporting on the David v Goliath confrontation happening in Erris .
Even in these cases too often the names of the companies and sites these men worked for and on have been left out .
Of course we will never know for sure what the facts are behind many of these events and the connection between them .
Decisions to start civil wars or to sink boats are not going to be made and recorded in board rooms .
Shell has a long , long history of imposing projects on local populations and dealing with the consequences of resistance .
While we cannot say what happened we can bring the facts as they are known together and paint a picture that the reader can draw their own conclusions from .
The picture is strange and complex , understanding it requires a little patience but the patience will be rewarded as distinct patterns emerge from what at first seems a bizarre patchwork of colours and shapes sprayed upon a wall by a careless creator .
Dogs of war
In April 2009 Bolivian special forces raided a hotel room in Santa Cruz .
During the course of the raid they shot dead an Irishman Michael Dwyer who had worked at the Shell compound in Erris , Eduardo Rozsa Flores , a Croatian - Bolivian fascist and one other man .
Two others were arrested .
In the following days the Bolivian authorities claimed that the gang around Flores were working to spark a civil war leading to the secession of the gas rich Santa Cruz region .
Testimony was given that they had carried out one bombing and were planning a wave of assassinations .
Not only had weapons been found in the hotel room but so too were pictures of the men posing with a high powered sniper 's rifle capable of hitting a target at 1 km .
Dwyer pictured in Bolivia with Rozsa and some of their stash of weapons
The killing of Michael Dwyer in Bolivia was treated by the Irish media as an oddity that had no particular connection to anything happening in Ireland .
But how did Michael Dwyer who had worked as security at the Shell pipeline building project in Erris , Co Mayo end up being shot dead in Bolivia ?
Within days of the killing it emerged that many of the others wanted for questioning were European fascists , recruited by Flores .
There was another connection , although it was more normally hinted at then spelled out .
Shell used to have a gas pipeline in Bolivia until less than a year before Dywer met his death .
President Morales had announced the nationalization of this pipeline at the start of June 2008 after claiming that the holding company , which Shell had a 25 % stake in , had conspired against his government .
This was four months before Dwyer left the Shell compound in Glengad with a number of his fellow security guards for Bolivia .
( 2 )
The Phoenix was one media outlet that has dared to put some of the connections into print , and that fact that this magazine is read by just about every journalist means that the rest of the media cant plead ignorance of the facts .
In an article titled  Dwyer , IRMS and the Szekler Legion  the Phoenix reports that Dwyer fell in with a group of right wing Hungarians led by one Tibor Revesz , commander of the so called Szekler Legion , a paramilitary movement some of whose members had worked as security at Shells Erris compound .
( 3 ) The Phoenix was being cautious , in a Cork Examiner article Scott Miller described the Szekler Legion as an openly fascist paramilitary group which trains with AK - 47s .  ( 4 )
Big - mouthed fascists
Dwyer it turned out had a fascist tattoo and was known to Irish fascists .
On the Irish section of a fascist organising website ( Name of fascist website removed in line with our ' No Platform ' policy ) a regular poster called  Byzantium Endures  reposted an article about Dwyer 's death on the day it was reported with the note RIP mike  returning a day later to post  He had SS sig runes tattooed on his arm , I know he was a WN . 
( WN stands for  white nationalist  i.e. fascist ) .
 Byzantium Endures  was to go on to make some pretty stunning claims , included in them were facts that were not yet in widespread circulation .
Dwyer showing his tattoo with the SS letters at the bottom
On the following day  Byzantium Endures  posted again to claim that  Mike was in Bolivia working for a private security company , Integrated Risk Management Services ( IRMS ) .
It is owned by Terry Downes and James Farrell .
Both Downes and Farrell are former members of the Irish Army Rangers . 
And later that day  Just to add Mike 's work out there involved doing close quarter protection work for Shell executives , seems Morales is sending a message to those who oppose him . ( 5 )
Fascists , particularly the online version , are notorious fantasists , so these claims need to be taken with a very large pinch of salt .
' Byzantium Endures ' identifies Dwyer as connected with IRMS at around the same point as this was first being raised on indymedia.ie and also identifies the tattoo on his arm as being fascist in character .
 Byzantium Endures  obviously believed Dwyer was still working for IRMS however on April 22nd I - RMS confirmed in a statement to The Irish Times that Mr Dwyer had worked for the company .
It said he was employed as a security guard at the Corrib gas construction site from March to mid-October . 
( 6 ) Presumably this difference in accounts ( Byzantium Endures  version is similar to what it is reported Dwyer had told his parents ) was because Dwyer could hardly tell the folks back home what he was actually up to .
Disappearing websites
A second Phoenix article by  Goldhawk went on to point out that  Coincidentally no sooner had The Irish Times referred to Dwyers work for IRMS than the security companys website was taken offline to be updated and the references to special services  and international armed and unarmed security  were removed before access to the site was again prohibited .
Goldhawk was anxious to get details of this international armed and unarmed activity from IRMS but the company failed to return his call . " ( 7 )
The sequence of changes to the IRSM site that occured after news of Dwyer 's death in Bolivia .
First the references to special services  and international armed and unarmed security  were removed
and then the site was taken off line .
The IRMS website was not the only one that went down after the shootings .
Another site to go down was photosniper .
freedom.hu which was the personal site of Tibor Revesz , the ex-Hungarian army soldier identified in the first Phoenix article as the commander of the so called Szekler Legion . 
Revesz had left Bolivia ahead of the special forces raid that killed Dwyer and since then as Phoenix points out websites appear to have been falling like ninepins , not least that of IRMS itself .
(8 ) The material on Ravesz site relating to Shell and Erris was also removed but not before some of it was spotted and copied by bloggers interested in the story .
They reported reported on indymedia .ie ( 9 ) and politics .ie that Revesz had on his web site souvenir badges , tee shirts and hoodies commemorating two of the glorious battles against the anti-Shell campaigners .
The implication of this is that he thought he had some sort of market to sell these to , presumably other Szekler legion members who had also worked in Erris .
Just how many of these were there , apart from the ones we already know of ?
Two of the badges that Revez had on his website prior to it being taken offline .
Note the similarity with the SS Deaths head skull on right
They also revealed that the Revesz / photosniper site had been used in October 2008 to appeal for volunteers for an expedition to Bolivia ( just 3 months after the nationalization of the Shell pipeline there ) .
October 2008 was also when IRMS claims Dwyer left their employment .
On his CV on the web site Revez said he started work for IRMS on 25.03.2008 but has no end date listed as he had for all his previous employers . ( 10 )
Scott Miller writing in the Irish Examiner got a little more information out of IRMS on June 20 writing " Talking to the Irish Examiner in the Broadhaven Hotel , Mr Farrell confirmed that two Eastern European men who travelled to Bolivia with Mr Dwyer have in recent weeks resigned from his company .
He dismisses speculation of any possible involvement by his company in the South American venture . " ( 11 )
This backs up an earlier Irish Times report from June 2nd that some of those who travelled to Bolivia with Dwyer were still working for IRMS on their return .
In that piece Conor Lally could not find it within himself to even name the security firm the men had worked for never mind mention the name of Shell .
He reported that POLICE IN Bolivia want to interview three men living in Ireland about their movements in Bolivia with Michael Dwyer , ..
The three men .. worked with Mr Dwyer in Ireland .
The men  two Hungarians and a Slovak  travelled to Bolivia with Mr Dwyer last November .
One of the men is still working in the same security company in Ireland where he and Mr Dwyer met .
The other two men worked for the same firm until recently and are still living in Ireland . ( 12 )
Scott Miller had earlier reported in an Irish Examiner article that  Gábor Dudog and Gáspár Dániel , associated with the Szekler Legion are currently missing in Bolivia .
According to reports in the Hungarian press , Mr Dudog worked in Ireland in the security business and spent 6 to 8 six to eight months in Bolivia , protecting deliveries for a major oil company . 
In the light what we now know one wonders just which major oil company 
Dudog was working for .
And why the Irish Examiner , which has been braver in its coverage than most of the Irish papers , felt unable to name that company or to say just where in the security business in Ireland Dudog had worked .
It would be interesting to hear more from IRMS as to who these three men are and the specific dates of when they left IRMS employment .
Naming names
The curious thing about almost all the media coverage is the obvious evasion in the way the sections of the articles that mention or might mention companies and names are written .
Yet this Irish Times piece is still significant in saying that those who travelled with Dwyer were still working for the unnamed security company  and that at the point in the time ( June 2nd ) this article was written , one of them still was !
It would be interesting to know where they were working but then if Conor didnt want to name the company hed hardly want to give us that information .
Conor Lally is one of a number of journalists who has written about the Erris struggle in a manner calculated to portray the protesters in a negative light , its a pity he is so much more cautious when writing about the other side of that struggle .
The international press has not shared this caution .
Here for instance is Saigon Dailys version of events , which is in turn a reprint of the Wall Street Journals coverage .
The first line introduces some new characters in the story , Ill explain their relevance shortly .
 The Morales government says Mr. Marinkovic aided the Rósza gang with money and houses .
In Ireland , Mr. Révész worked as a guard at a pipeline project , according to one friend and one co-worker .
It was the same place where Michael Dwyer , the young Irishman , worked .
Integrated Risk Management Services Ltd. , contractor for security at the pipeline , said Mr. Dwyer was a security guard for six months last year .
The company didnt respond to an email asking about Mr. Révészs employment .  ( 13 )
Marinkovic was a major shareholder with Shell of the nationalized pipeline in Boliva .
The Bolivarian government accuses him of being linked in with Rosza , the apparent commander of the gang .
Marinkovic denies this connection .
Dwyer was of course killed with Rosza in the Santa Cruz hotel .
From the investigations in Bolivia it appears the return flights of 11 people including Dwyer were paid for from Madrid to Bolivia .
La Prensa of June 4 named the eight who actually travelled as  The Irishman Michael Dwyer , the Hungarians Tibor Revesz , Elod Toaso , Daniel Gaspar and Gabor Dudog , the Slovak Ivan Pistovcak , the Romanian Arpad Magyarosi and the Bolivian - Croatian Mario Tadic .  ( 14 )
Of these 8 men Dwyer and Arpad ( a Szekler Legion members ) were killed in the hotel room raid in Bolivia .
Toaso ( also named by the Examiner as a Szekler legion member ) was arrested in the same raid .
Some of the others named , including Revesz have been named in Bolivia as wanted for questioning in connection with the events there .
The Sunday Mail speaks out
The Mail on Sunday exposé of the story , the most complete account so far published in Ireland
In terms of papers published in Ireland the one that perhaps has gone the furthest at this point in time is The Mail .
This is a little surprising as politically it is further to the right than any of the domestic titles that have stayed quiet , but then again , its owner is nt linked into the oil and gas exploration off the west coast .
On May 31st the Mail reported
 It is now known that Kildare - based security firm Integrated Risk Management Services ( I - RMS ) played a part in bringing Dwyer together with right - wing Hungarian elements from a group known as the Szekler Legion - an outfit prepared to use violence to achieve autonomy for ethnic Hungarians in a border region of Romania .
One of those elements was Tibor Revesz , a commander of the Szekler Legion and the owner of its websites - upon which appeals for volunteers for an insurgency campaign in Santa Cruz were advertised late last year .
Both Revesz - who is being sought by Bolivian law enforcement and thought to be still in Ireland - and Dwyer worked for I - MRS protecting the Shell Corrib gas project .
It is here , facing down protests from the Shell to Sea campaign , that the pair are thought to have met .
.. Revesz also used his website to advertise an I - RMS close - protection course that included pistol , carbine and tactical firearms training .
All of Reveszs web pages have been deleted in recent weeks .
I - RMS - based beside the Army Ranger Wing HQ in the Curragh in Co. Kildare - has refused to comment about its role in bringing Dwyer and right - wing fanatics together .
But there is no doubt that any of the foreign - owned oil companies present in Bolivia would certainly have an easier life if something were to happen to Morales .  ( 15 )
The Rangers and Fort Benning
The Mail article introduces a new element , the role of the Irish Rangers in the story .
Who are the Army Rangers ?
The are an elite and secretive special forces unit of the Irish army intended to fill a similar function to the SAS or elite US military formations .
A good first source is the Irish Army website ( 16 ) which despite blurring the faces of Rangers in photos otherwise tells us quite a bit .
For instance under their history of the unit they tell us  In the late 1960s and early 1970s a small number of Defence Forces personnel attended American Army Ranger Courses at Fort Benning , Georgia in the United States .
On their return , these personnel were responsible for organising similar type courses . 
Fort Benning , Georgia is the home of the  School of the Americas often referred to as the  School of the Assassins  because many of its students have been associated with death squads , and coups in Latin American countries  ( 17 ) including Roberto D'Aubuisson who murdered the Salvadorean Archbishop Óscar Romero while he celebrated mass .
In November 1989 Schools of Americas graduates murdered six Jesuit priests , their housekeeper and her daughter .
The SoA trains the special forces units of many of the armies in Central and South America , the equivalent of the Irish Rangers .
School of the Americas Watch says the school taught repressive techniques and promoted the violation of human rights throughout Latin America and around the globe .
The manuals contain instructions in motivation by fear , bounties for enemy dead , false imprisonment , torture , execution , and kidnapping a target 's family members . 
Every year more than 10,000 people demonstrate at the School of the Americas on the anniversary of the killing of the 6 priests , their housekeeper and her daughter .
As a result of the repression of these protests  183 people have collectively served over 81 years in prison . 
The Irish Army website actually situates the formation of the Rangers in the context of the sort of training the SoA provides ( with of course a positive spin ) when it writes  The evolution of the Army Ranger Wing resulted from an increase in international terrorism in the late 1970s and 1980s ..
European and other countries realised that conventional police and military tactics were not suited to dealing with this escalating threat .
Elsewhere their site refers to  Seaborne Interventions  and  Difficult or dangerous specialist tasks on land or at sea under the heading  Aid to the Civil Power .
It would be interesting to know what if any Ranger deployments may have happened on the land and sea around Erris under the excuse of  Aid to the Civil Power .
The strange events in Erris & motivation by fear
Now that we know a bit about Ranger training and their possible scope of operations its worth looking again at some of the stranger events that have been reported from Erris .
What at first seems fantastical seems less so when you take into account who may be deployed down there and just how far the Rozsa group were willing to go in Bolivia .
Really in that context the happenings at Erris are not at all extreme , quite the opposite in fact .
The odd beating or sinking hardly measures up to the bombing of cardinals or assassination of state governors .
Following the mysterious attack by masked men on local activist Willie Corduff at the Shell compound the Mayo News carried the following IN an emotional interview , Mr Corduff recalled how , after spending almost 19 hours lodged under a Shell lorry , he was allegedly assaulted by men in balaclavas ..
 I think they were professionals .
They seemed to be big men .
They put me down on the ground and all I can remember is four of them kneeling on me .
They didnt use their hands , they used their knees .
They squeezed me like a sandwich and they had my airwaves closed off ; and my hands were at the back of my head .  ( 18 )
Then on the night of 11th June local fisherman and activist Pat O'Donnell 's boat the ' Iona Isle ' was boarded by four masked and armed men and sunk out at sea .
A Shell to Sea press release reported the event as follows  At 2 am on Thursday morning , Pat O'Donnell 's boat the ' Iona Isle ' was boarded by four masked men and sunk out at sea , near where Mr. O'Donnell lays his fishing pots off Erris , North Mayo .
Mr. O'Donnell and crewman Martin McDonnell were attacked and held down by some of the men , while others went below deck , where they proceeded to sink the boat .
Both local men have been taken to Castlebar General Hospital , where they are recovering . ( 19 )
Pat later put out an account on indymedia which included  Pat O'Donnell 's fishing boat was boarded by four masked men , two of whom were armed , at approximately two o clock this morning whilst out at sea laying pots .
The two armed men held Mr O'Donnell and his crewman Martin McDonnell in the wheelhouse of the boat while another two went below deck for 20 minutes .
These men returned to the deck and the two crew members were held for one and a half hours until the engine went out .
At this point the masked men alighted onto an unknown vessel that took them away .
None of the men spoke good English .
Mr O'Donnell went down to the engine room and realised that the boat was sinking .  ( 20 )
One aspect of the special forces training described by SoA Watch falls under the heading motivation by fear .
This would seem a reasonable term to describe some of the events in the Erris area , many locals are on record as being afraid of the various mysterious forces active in and around the area .
They havent managed to get clear answers about who has been seen filming them ( and their children ) .
The limited media coverage of their fears has tended to ridicule them as being unreasonable , when you look at the big picture it becomes clear their fears are very reasonable indeed .
What was going on in Bolivia ?
Dwyer 's mission appears to have been to help spark a civil war that would lead to the secession of the Santa Cruz region from the rest of Bolivia .
Much of the mineral wealth , including the gas of Bolivia is in the Santa Cruz region .
Bolivia is currently ruled by Evo Morales , a radical president who was swept to power on the back of a massive social movement and who then part nationalized the gas industry including Shells pipeline .
It is possible the secession of Santa Cruz would see the rise of politicians more compliant with the interests of international energy corporations like Shell .
More in other words like the sort of politicians that gave
Shell the gas royalties for free in Ireland .
Branco Marinkowitz is the politician and large business owner who has been identified in the Bolivian and international press as the main leader of the secessionist movement .
Marinkowitz is a founder ( and president ) of the secessionist Council of Santa Cruz .
Shells connection with Marinkowitz is through that pipeline company that Shell also owned 25 % of until it was nationalized .
four months before Dwyer and the others left the Shell compound in Glengad , Erris .
The Irish mainstream media have almost universally tired to paint Dwyer as an innocent abroad , at worst a Walter Mitty type character caught up in a situation he didnt understand .
Minister Micheal Martin initially played the same game before going quiet once more details started to emerge from Bolivia .
Well look at Dwyers involvement in detail in a while but let there be no doubt that those he was working with were dangerous people .
Eduardo Rozsa Flores
The military organizer of the Bolivian expedition was Eduardo Rozsa Flores , killed with Dwyer .
He left a pre-recorded interview broadcast after his death on Hungarian TV where he said  I have been called to organise the defense of the city and province of Santa Cruz , the Council of Santa Cruz have voted for the creation of a regional security council .
I will go to Brazil and Bolivia and begin to organise Militia .
The organisers will provide funding and arms .. illegally and probably from Brazil ..
I understand there will be a conflict with the Central Government ..
We wont walk with flags , we will do it with arms , we will declare independence and create a new country . 
A picture taken by the gang of Rosza sleeping with his guns
The Belgrade daily , Politika , wrote the following about Eduardo Rozsa Flores in the 1991 Croatian war .. he joined the infamous Croat paramilitary unit Zenga and became the commander of the  International Brigade .
 Reporters without Frontiers  accused him of killing two foreign correspondents in Croatia , Swiss Christian Wurtemberg and British photographer Paul Jenks .  ( 21 )
After the deaths in Bolivia one British journalist in Croatia at the time of these killing published a long description of the events in the right wing Telegraph newspaper ( hardly one with sympathies for Morales )  I spent most of my time that day with a Swiss man called Christian Wurtemberg ..
His was an intelligent and articulate voice amid the mayhem .
So a chill went down my spine when I heard a few days later that he had been killed .
More chilling was the subsequent news that he had been dispatched by strangling - an unusual end in a conflict that claimed tens of thousands of lives .
Various witnesses have since come forward to say that he was tortured and garroted on Flores ' orders as a suspected spy , although the commander claimed he was killed in an ambush .
Two weeks later , Paul Jenks , a freelance British photographer , was shot dead in the same fields that I had stared out at during my visit to Flores ' headquarters .
A single sniper 's bullet to the back of his neck felled him .
..
The back of his head was exposed to the closer positions of Flores ' forces .
And Jenks had reportedly been investigating Wurtemberg 's death when he met his own .  ( 22 )
Dwyer 's involvement
Clearly from his own statements and his past actions Eduardo Flores was a ruthless and dangerous character .
And in the hearings that have been happening in Bolivia the evidence heard does not paint Dwyer as an outsider but rather as Roszas right hand man and possibly his bodyguard .
 According to Bolivian media reports , Mr Gueder Bruno said he attended meetings along with Mr Dwyer during which the killing of local politicians was discussed .
..
This evidence was backed up by a video showing Mr Dwyer at a meeting in which the possible assassination of Bolivias Socialist president , Evo Morales , was discussed by Mr Flores . 
( 23 ) Bolivian TV showed pictures of Dwyer and others posing with a variety of weapons including a high - powered sniper rifle accurate to over a kilometer . ( 24 )
Toaso pictured with the sniper rifle that can hit targets at a range of 1km
Other reports of the testimony reveal that  Gueder Bruno , a member of the far - right Santa Cruz Youth Council ( UJC ) and charged with terrorist crimes , admitted on Thursday that he supplied arms to the group led by the Bolivian - Croat , Eduardo Rozsa , organizer of a cell of international mercenaries who were planning an assassination in Bolivia .
..
 I withdrew from the project of locating weapons when Rozsa said , in the second meeting , that he wanted to target the Governor of Santa Cruz .. Gueder Bruno said that the Paraguayan Mendoza Malavi , and also Magyarosi Arpad , Michael Dwyer and Eduardo Rozsa Flores were at both meetings .  ( 25 )
Perhaps most damning off all was the La Prensa report that  the statement of the arrested Mario Tadic .. said the people who carried out the attack on the house of Cardinal Terrazas July were Eduardo Rózsa Flores and Michael Martin Dwyer .
In one paragraph he stated that  The day the thing exploded at the home of the Cardinal , Eduardo and Mike arrived at about one o'clock in the morning and boasted of what was done : ' We threw that one at him and now we 'll see what will happen ' .
Mike 's face was frightening in his joy " . 
( 26 ) The day before Dwyer was shot the home of the Cardinal of Santa Cruz had been attacked with dynamite .
The Cardinal was actually a supporter of the sucessionists , the purpose of the attack appears to have been to stir up their own supporters .
Why the fascist involvement ?
This is a complex story .
One that stretches from the isolation of western Ireland to Bolivia , from the elite wing of the Irish Army to shadowy eastern European fascist organizations and far right mercenary plots .
It reads like a bad B - movie plot .
But the bodies in the Santa Cruz hotel room are real enough as are the sinister and strange events in Erris around the Shell compound there .
There are two common aspects to these geographically separate stories .
In both a Shell pipeline plays a significant role .
In both some of the foot soldiers are recruited from fascist organizations to fight and in the Bolivian case die for interests they perhaps did not fully understand .
But what would a load of European fascists be doing getting involved in a Bolivian coup ?
An article published on indymedia.ie by Fionuala Cregan shortly after Dwyer 's death explains this in detail .
She wrote that the secessionist groups include  the Unión Juvenil Cruceña ( Union of Cruzeno Youth ) : a youth group with open neo -Nazism sentiments and which has been involved in frequent violent mob attacks against the local indigenous population , and Nacion Camba , an openly racist organization formed of local intellectuals .
The Nacion Camba web site is quoted to illustrate this as follows  In general Bolivia is perceived to be a fundamentally Andean country made up of aymara and quechua  a backward and miserable ethnicity .. whose bureaucratic centre in La Paz exploits our economic wealth , condemning us to backwardness .. but there is another side to Bolivia , the 30 % of the population who are based in the east and who are made up Mestizos ( mixed race European and indigenous ) . 
It s a common fantasy among many fascists of carrying out acts of provocation which will spark off a race war .
It appears that circumstances in Bolivia probably gave Flores a recruiting argument that went beyond financial reward .
Certainly Dwyers friend on a fascist website ( Name of fascist website removed in line with our ' No Platform ' policy ) had been exposed to these arguments when he wrote  Whites in Bolivia are under seige from the commie govt , no different then in South Africa , thankfully they are getting organised and trying to create their own homeland .
Most Whites in Bolivia are v racially aware .
Mike was just unlucky murdered by a commie despot to justify further anti White oppression . 
These fascists are simply useful idiots in the global corporate game of gaining control over energy resources .
They are something of a distraction from the real story here , except as an illustration of just how careless IRMS were in terms of recruitment for the Corrib site .
A carelessness that may not have ended with the deaths in Santa Cruz for the News of the World of June 6th carried an article on a secret fascist meeting in Dublin where they reported  Another attendee , Thor , claimed he worked in security on the Corrib project in Co.
Mayo , where he regularly " bust heads " .
He also claimed he had contacted members of the far - right linked to the recent failed assassination plot , which ended in the death of Irishman Michael Dwyer .  ( 27 )
He posts as thor1488 on the fascist website ( Name of fascist website removed in line with our ' No Platform ' policy ) where he taunted other fascists in one post that " you advocate the political route , the legal , above board , public face of the wn cause , while i am a member of the underground who is willing to use direct action against the antifa , swp and the rest of the unwashed . " ( 28 )
None of the events in Bolivia directly involve Shell .
The corporation is always at least one step , if not more , removed from events on the ground .
Outside of Name of fascist website removed in line with our ' No Platform ' policy that fascist site ( hardly the most reliable of sources ) none of the Bolivian plotters have been named as directly working for the corporation at that point in time .
That said we dont know who the major oil company  that Dudog worked for in Bolivia and to who Scott Miller referred to in the Irish Examiner is .
Shell , Nigeria and the New York settlement
Shell have just settled out of court in New York to avoid a trial for complicity in the decision to hang Ken Saro - Wiwa , Dr. Barinem Kiobel , John Kpuinen , Baribo Bera , Saturday Dobee , Felix Nwate , Nordu Eawo , Paul Levura and Daniel Gboko in Nigeria . ( 29 )
The settlement means the evidence will not now be heard but in advance of the trail Reuters reported that  Lawyers for the plaintiffs say evidence in the trial will include documents in which Shell called Saro - Wiwa a threat that should be eliminated .
According to a Bloomberg report  The plaintiffs claim Shells Nigerian unit assisted the government in the abuse and murder of opponents of the companys operations in the Niger Delta . ..
Shell recruited Nigerian police and military to attack villages and suppress the movement .  ( 30 )
Rather unsurprisingly in advance of the trial Shell spokeswoman Robin Lebovitz said the allegations are " without merit . "
After the 15.5 million dollar settlement by Shell The Guardian wrote that " What it suggests is that Shell wants to bury the facts about what was happening on the Niger delta in the 1970s and 1980s ..
The settlement stops the world knowing exactly what was the company 's relationship with the national government and the military , and the extent of Shell 's involvement in the human rights abuses that led to Ken Saro - Wiwa 's execution . " ( 31 )
Shells PR buys results
Shell spends huge amount of money on PR , in 1998  Shell spent US $ 30 million on contracts with PR company Fishburn & Hedges alone . ( 32 ) The article  Irish Times Shell PR  in the May 22 issue of the Phoenix looks at how in Ireland Shell have successfully changed the line of the Irish Times over the last two years to the point where now the Irish Times now frequently send their crime correspondent to cover protests in Erris .
The Irish Times is not unique in this respect , media outlet after media outlet considers it suitable to send crime correspondents to cover the protests despite not only the bias this reveals but also the fact that crime correspondents depend on developing and maintaining positive relations with the Gardaí to continue to get news stories .
If they want to continue to get the scoops their jobs depend on they are not in a position to bite the hand that feeds them such stories .
Such is the success of Shells PR machine that when Colm Rapple , a guest on RTEs  Marian Finucane  show managed to slip in a mention of the Bolivian story Cathal McCarthy howled in anguish in The Independent going so far as to threaten that it might be unwise of RTE to allow anyone to suggest outlandish and ruinous speculative motives to what was , at the very least , the violent killing of an Irish citizen in the most dubious circumstances of which it is possible to conceive .  ( 33 )
The Independent is controlled by the OReillys , pre-crash billionaires who coincidentally holds a  40 % stake in Providence Resources Plc , the Irish based oil and gas exploration and development company .  ( 34 ) The Independent group also owns the Evening Herald , Irish Independent , Sunday Independent , Sunday World and the Irish Daily Star , as well as 14 regional titles and two free newspapers .
Plus a 98 % stake in the Sunday Tribune .
The observant reader will perhaps notice that none of these titles have named names on the Shell  IRMS  Bolivia story although most if not all of these titles have been happy enough to throw all manner of weird and wonderful accusations at the locals who oppose the Shell pipeline and their supporters .
You can see why journalists in this country are not prepared to commit hari kari on their career by naming names in this story .
Even if your not a journalist currently working for an Independent title youd want to be careful of pissing off the family who own a 40 % state in an Irish oil and gas exploration company as you may well be looking for a job at one of those titles in the future .
And its not like what it left of the Irish media has been a whole lot better with the honorable exception of The Phoenix and the Irish Examiner , both of which are sadly rather small circulation niche titles .
Another consequence of Shells highly successful PR offensive is the routine appearance of articles in the media that seek to portray the locals and their supporters as subversives .
Sometimes this can be quite farcical , for example the Phoenix points to the Irish Times Peter Murtagh getting away with publishing an article in March where he links the struggle to  notorious INLA murderer 
Dominic McGlinchy  on the weird grounds that his son supports the protests .
While there have been acres of coverage in the media on that sort of basis the facts revealed in the aftermath of the killing of Dwyer have received scant coverage .
Semi-state bodies
A large part of this story revolves around Integrated Risk Management Services ( IRMS ) .
The company that at least four or five of the men who travelled to Bolivia had worked for and for whom two or three continued to work for on their return , at least for a while .
The Phoenix has been looking at IRMS over a number of issues and has concluded that clearly the company has good connections in establishment circles , security and political .  ( 35 ) The meaning of political is clear enough and IRMS have provided security for several of the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheiseanna .
But what about security ?
We know IRMS were founded by a couple of retired Irish Rangers and that their offices are located beside the HQ of the Rangers .
The location alone suggests some sort of ongoing connection , perhaps of an informal kind .
After all men who served together in elite units often form a bond that goes beyond the period of service .
Yet the Rangers traditionally strongly discourage not only any sort of nixer ( work on the side ) but also any involvement in politics , two barriers involvement in IRMS would obviously cross .
Retired Rangers are no longer under these restrictions , indeed many go into one form or another of security  work , not just in Ireland but around the globe .
Their training provides them with a skill set that is useful for many corporate requirements .
Is it also useful for the Irish state to maintain an informal ongoing relationship both through individual politicians and serving members of the security forces ?
In Erris it would make no sense if there were not ongoing and constant contacts between IRMS and the Garda and Navy commanders on the scene .
IRSM director and ex Irish Ranger Jim Farrell at a protest in Erris
Is this part of the growing pattern in western militaries where certain tasks are out sourced to private companies who dont operate under the same constraints as the state security forces proper do ?
The most infamous of these is Blackwater , which deployed 20,000 to 30,000 armed security contractors to Iraq during the ongoing occupation there .
Many of its employees were drawn from a database of 21,000 former Special Forces operatives , soldiers , and retired law enforcement agents .
If the US state found it useful to have a militarily trained private security company on hand could the same not be true of the Irish state ?
On the protests at Erris there is little to distinguish between the Gardai and the IRMS security except that IRMS mostly stay inside the compound .
The exception being the Shell security boats which are crewed by Gardaí and presumably IRMS personnel with training in difficult or dangerous specialist tasks on land or at sea . 
Apart from the boat crews the IRMS role at the Shell compound clearly goes beyond that of static security , at the very least it also includes intelligence gathering .
On a walk around the compound one evening in early June three friends and myself were filmed by at least five different private security inside the Shell compound and larger numbers have been observed filming protests at the compound .
Somewhat chillingly after the death of Dwyer in Bolivia photos were discovered that appear to show Dwyer and Revez caught in the act of videoing protesters at the Shell compound .
It s hard to be 100 % sure of this identification because , as is often the case with security there , the headgear and sunglasses of the man who may by Dwyer obscures his identity .
Are IRMS providing a role beyond the dozens of sometimes - masked security that line the fences of the Shell compound ?
A picture taken at a protest in Erris that appears to show Dwyer and Revez in the act of filming protesters .
The inset images are pictures of the two men for comparison with those pictured
The government 's Private Security Authority chief executive Geraldine Larkin 's reaction to what has appeared in the media and to complaints made in Erris about IRMS was reported by the Irish Times as being that the ( unnamed ) security firm working for Shell on the Corrib gas project is the most monitored  security company in the State .  ( 36 )
It is not clear what this monitoring means in real terms in relation to Erris .
Michael Dwyer not even have the appropriate Private Security Authority ( PSA ) license for his static security work for Shell in Mayo .
The Phoenix revealed that some of the other IRMS personnel named in recent Erris court cases do not appear to be listed in the PSA database . ( 37 )
In a court report the May 1st Mayo Advertiser wrote that  Judge Devins said in light of recent media reports about the connection between IRMS staff and issues in Bolivia the superintendent would go back to the DPP about the credibility of the two IRMS witnesses as the DPP may direct that it was now time for their employers to come into court .  ( 38 ) The government appointed DPP subsequently ruled that any involvement of the security company outside the jurisdiction should not be examined .
The Phoenix report concludes with some questions they would like IRMS to answer , reproduced below
 Why has the IRMS website remained offline since shortly after the death in Bolivia of the firms former employee Michael Dwyer ?
When did the firm cease to employ the Hungarian Tibor Revesz , whose web address was used to recruit for the Bolivian escapade and featured a notice concerning an IRMS course involving arms training ?
And what precisely is meant by services formerly advertised on IRMSs own website described as international armed and unarmed security . ( 39 )
A segment of the IRMS website before it was taken offline
We also know that the armed Garda Emergency Response Unit ( ERU ) has been deployed in Erris on at least one occasion and it is rumored that the operation down there is now being run by a guard who previously headed up the ERU .
This is a very curious choice for the policing of protest , the armed ERU was designed for shoot outs with armed criminals and paramilitaries , not policing protests of farmers and fishermen .
The Gardai have been operating as if they were at war , among an occupied population .
They have shown little interest in investigating any of the strange occurrences in the area .
The Mayo News of 22 June quoted a letter from local campaign group to the Minister of Justice which read  Law and order is being subverted in our community by a sinister , unknown group that is targeting well - known opponents of the Corrib gas project .
Senior officers continue to publicly belittle us when we report incidents and to dismiss the gravity of these events .  ( 40 )
The Phoenix points out Gardai reaction to the sinking of Pat ODonnells boat was very odd .
The Gardai press release , circulated after Pat had said the assailants boat had escaped to the north insisted for a reason no one understands that it would have had to escape to the south - east .
And their first action was to demand Pats clothes as if he was their suspect rather than the victim of the crime .
This follows on from Gardai actions last summer when the repeatedly arrested Pat under the pretext of Public Order act simply in order to get his boat out of Broadhaven Bay to make room for the Solitaire .
As the Mayo News explained  On one occasion he was released from Belmullet Garda Station two minutes before his lawyers in Dublin were due to present papers to the High Court for an inquiry into his arrest under Article 42.4.2 of the Constitution . 
( 41 ) Because he had been released the High Court refused to proceed with the inquiry !
His arrest , and the prefect timing of his release , was just one example of how the Gardai in Erris have been making up the law as they go along in order to fill Shells needs safe in the knowledge that those further up the chain have their backs .
Reviewing YouTube videos of various protests at Erris shows an often shocking level of Gardai violence towards the local population , some of them quite elderly or very young .
Unsurprizingly almost none of the hundreds of complaints about Gardai violence have been upheld .
Now few in Erris bother lodging complaints anymore .
The Great Gas Giveaway
Something I have observed in my involvement in the campaign is how people on getting involved and making their first fact finding  trip to the area return full of suggestions about how the campaign needs to get the media to cover the story .
The reasonable assumption they make is that the campaign has been failing to issue press releases etc such is the yawning gap between what the have read in the newspaper and seen on TV and the reality on the ground .
Why is the media , even outside of the Independent group titles so silent ?
Perhaps it is fear of a libel action backed by the deep pockets of Shell ?
Or simply that many of these journalists have been wined and dined by Shell .
For instance according to the Phoenix , Paul Williams whose documentary  on the project was a single minded attack on the protesters was the guest of Shell at the 2007 England Rugby match at Croke Park , part of what Shell told the Phoenix was their stakeholder engagement list .
And the state media is controlled by the same state that is deploying hundreds of Gardai and the Irish Navy to force the corporate project through against the resistance of Irish citizens .
The media silence extends beyond the Bolivian story to the Gas Giveaway itself , the process by which Irish politicians , one of whom was subsequently convicted of corruption , changed the law in Shells interests so that the corporation will not now be required to pay a single cent of royalties on the gas it extracts .
The depth of the capitalist crisis and perhaps even some guilt about what Shell has got away with has started to see a minor breaking of ranks .
The Irish Times carried an opinion piece  June 19 from Andy Storey that pointed out the scale of the rip off and the fact that  If the Government were to take only a modest 10 per cent stake in these discoveries then the exchequer would stand to gain a staggering 5 billion . 
And that this would mean there would be no need for such measures as the closure of three wards in Crumlin childrens hospital because of a  9.6 million deficit .  ( 42 )
Indeed Storeys estimate of the value of the gas and oil offshore is very conservative .
Official estimates of reserves at the high prices of gas and oil of two years back would give potential values up to 950 billion .
A 10 % royalty on a real value of even a quarter of this would be sufficient to reverse every single cut in services and wages that has come about so far in the recession and to cancel all the future planned ones .
And some estimates of the total off shore energy reserves have been as high as 3,500 billion !
That is the scale of the Great Gas Giveaway and explains why both the political parties that changed the law to allow the giveaway and the corporations that benefit it are willing to go to extraordinary lengths to protect such incredible wealth from those who need it most .
What stands in their way are the local people of Erris who are concerned about the risk the penny pinching of Shell is exposing them to ( sending  Shell to Sea would only cost 100 million of these hundreds of billions ) .
And the small but determined number of people from all over Ireland who have looked at their story and looked at the Gas Giveaway and determined to stand up to the behemoth that is bearing down on them .
Vast quantities are being spent on PR and policing because Shell and the state knows it can win as long as those resisting are kept isolated , as long as the mass of the population of the Ireland is kept in confusion over the issues .
Their weakness is the risk that outrage at the scale of the huge rip - off that the abolition of royalties amounts to will spread among people in Ireland .
That we will become aware that the money which could have funded our health and education needs and headed off many of the deep cuts on our wages and standard of living is instead to flow into the coffers of a multi-national .

The Politics ie thread at
For background information on the struggle in Erris or to find out how you can help to fight the Great Gas Giveaway see
A video based on this article has been made by Revolt Video .
It is available below .
At least 156 private security personnel work on what Shell calls the ' Corrib Project ' accompanied , according to the Irish Times , by up to  Several hundred Gardaí and the Naval Service .. with the Naval Service deploying one and possibly  two patrol ships .
( 1 ) The level of force being deployed to impose the Shell pipeline project on the local population is a testimony to the long running resistance of the people of Erris , a resistance that so far has not been broken by dozens of arrests , violence and the most vitriolic of attacks from paid hacks in the mainstream media .
At the time of writing everyone is preparing for the return of the pipe laying ship , the Soltaire .
In advance of its return strange events have occurred in the dead of night .
One Shell to Sea protester , Willie Corduff , required hospitalization after an encounter with masked men at the Shell compound at 4 am on Thursday April 23rd .
The fishing boat of another key Shell to Sea activist , Pat ODonnell , was boarded at 2 am on Thursday 11th June by four masked and armed men who proceed to sink the boat , leaving the two men on board to fend for themselves .
What is striking is the almost complete failure of the Irish media to investigate any of these stories in a serious way or to explore the elements that link events in Bolivia and Erris .
Yet in the same period we have seen both TV and print investigations  of the situation in Erris where the pipeline is being imposed .
Bizarrely these have targeted the under resourced locals and their supporters as some sort of dark force in the whole struggle and treated Shell as if its some sort of squeaky clean neutral force whose every utterance ( including the off the record ones ) can be treated as statements of fact .
And just as extraordinarily these journalists  have chosen to leave out the fact that known corrupt politicians changed the rules to allow Shell access to the gas royalty free .
At a time when health , education and community programs are being slashed due to lack of funds  surely this is a story ?
Given the history of corruption that has emerged from the tribunals , which involved the same politicians who gave Shell the Gas for free , what might be dug out with a little journalism ?
The material found with a little bit of googling on the topic would make for a Hollywood film script , never mind a major expose in any of the major papers .
Yet that article has yet to appear in any major mainstream media in Ireland .
As we will see more has appeared in the international press .
On the margins of the Irish media some things have been published , but basically as the work of one or two of the dozens of journalists who are supposedly reporting on the David v Goliath confrontation happening in Erris .
Even in these cases too often the names of the companies and sites these men worked for and on have been left out .
Of course we will never know for sure what the facts are behind many of these events and the connection between them .
Decisions to start civil wars or to sink boats are not going to be made and recorded in board rooms .
Shell has a long , long history of imposing projects on local populations and dealing with the consequences of resistance .
While we cannot say what happened we can bring the facts as they are known together and paint a picture that the reader can draw their own conclusions from .
The picture is strange and complex , understanding it requires a little patience but the patience will be rewarded as distinct patterns emerge from what at first seems a bizarre patchwork of colours and shapes sprayed upon a wall by a careless creator .
In April 2009 Bolivian special forces raided a hotel room in Santa Cruz .
During the course of the raid they shot dead an Irishman Michael Dwyer who had worked at the Shell compound in Erris , Eduardo Rozsa Flores , a Croatian - Bolivian fascist and one other man .
Two others were arrested .
In the following days the Bolivian authorities claimed that the gang around Flores were working to spark a civil war leading to the secession of the gas rich Santa Cruz region .
Testimony was given that they had carried out one bombing and were planning a wave of assassinations .
Not only had weapons been found in the hotel room but so too were pictures of the men posing with a high powered sniper 's rifle capable of hitting a target at 1 km .
The killing of Michael Dwyer in Bolivia was treated by the Irish media as an oddity that had no particular connection to anything happening in Ireland .
But how did Michael Dwyer who had worked as security at the Shell pipeline building project in Erris , Co Mayo end up being shot dead in Bolivia ?
Within days of the killing it emerged that many of the others wanted for questioning were European fascists , recruited by Flores .
There was another connection , although it was more normally hinted at then spelled out .
Shell used to have a gas pipeline in Bolivia until less than a year before Dywer met his death .
President Morales had announced the nationalization of this pipeline at the start of June 2008 after claiming that the holding company , which Shell had a 25 % stake in , had conspired against his government .
This was four months before Dwyer left the Shell compound in Glengad with a number of his fellow security guards for Bolivia .
( 2) The Phoenix was one media outlet that has dared to put some of the connections into print , and that fact that this magazine is read by just about every journalist means that the rest of the media cant plead ignorance of the facts .
In an article titled  Dwyer , IRMS and the Szekler Legion  the Phoenix reports that Dwyer fell in with a group of right wing Hungarians led by one Tibor Revesz , commander of the so called Szekler Legion , a paramilitary movement some of whose members had worked as security at Shells Erris compound .
( 3 ) The Phoenix was being cautious , in a Cork Examiner article Scott Miller described the Szekler Legion as an openly fascist paramilitary group which trains with AK - 47s . 
( 4 ) Dwyer it turned out had a fascist tattoo and was known to Irish fascists .
On the Irish section of a fascist organising websitea regular poster called  Byzantium Endures  reposted an article about Dwyer 's death on the day it was reported with the note RIP mike  returning a day later to post  He had SS sig runes tattooed on his arm , I know he was a WN . 
( WN stands for  white nationalist  i.e. fascist ) .
 Byzantium Endures  was to go on to make some pretty stunning claims , included in them were facts that were not yet in widespread circulation .
On the following day  Byzantium Endures  posted again to claim that  Mike was in Bolivia working for a private security company , Integrated Risk Management Services ( IRMS ) .
It is owned by Terry Downes and James Farrell .
Both Downes and Farrell are former members of the Irish Army Rangers . 
And later that day  Just to add Mike 's work out there involved doing close quarter protection work for Shell executives , seems Morales is sending a message to those who oppose him .
( 5 ) Fascists , particularly the online version , are notorious fantasists , so these claims need to be taken with a very large pinch of salt .
' Byzantium Endures ' identifies Dwyer as connected with IRMS at around the same point as this was first being raised on indymedia.ie and also identifies the tattoo on his arm as being fascist in character .
 Byzantium Endures  obviously believed Dwyer was still working for IRMS however on April 22nd I - RMS confirmed in a statement to The Irish Times that Mr Dwyer had worked for the company .
It said he was employed as a security guard at the Corrib gas construction site from March to mid-October . 
( 6 ) Presumably this difference in accounts ( Byzantium Endures  version is similar to what it is reported Dwyer had told his parents ) was because Dwyer could hardly tell the folks back home what he was actually up to .
A second Phoenix article by  Goldhawk went on to point out that  Coincidentally no sooner had The Irish Times referred to Dwyers work for IRMS than the security companys website was taken offline to be updated and the references to special services  and international armed and unarmed security  were removed before access to the site was again prohibited .
Goldhawk was anxious to get details of this international armed and unarmed  activity from IRMS but the company failed to return his call . "
( 7 ) The IRMS website was not the only one that went down after the shootings .
Another site to go down was photosniper .
freedom.hu which was the personal site of Tibor Revesz , the ex-Hungarian army soldier identified in the first Phoenix article as the commander of the so called Szekler Legion . 
Revesz had left Bolivia ahead of the special forces raid that killed Dwyer and since then as Phoenix points out websites appear to have been falling like ninepins , not least that of IRMS itself .
(8 ) The material on Ravesz site relating to Shell and Erris was also removed but not before some of it was spotted and copied by bloggers interested in the story .
They reported reported on indymedia .ie ( 9 ) and politics .ie that Revesz had on his web site souvenir badges , tee shirts and hoodies commemorating two of the glorious battles against the anti-Shell campaigners .
The implication of this is that he thought he had some sort of market to sell these to , presumably other Szekler legion members who had also worked in Erris .
Just how many of these were there , apart from the ones we already know of ?
They also revealed that the Revesz / photosniper site had been used in October 2008 to appeal for volunteers for an expedition to Bolivia ( just 3 months after the nationalization of the Shell pipeline there ) .
October 2008 was also when IRMS claims Dwyer left their employment .
On his CV on the web site Revez said he started work for IRMS on 25.03.2008 but has no end date listed as he had for all his previous employers .
( 10 ) Scott Miller writing in the Irish Examiner got a little more information out of IRMS on June 20 writing " Talking to the Irish Examiner in the Broadhaven Hotel , Mr Farrell confirmed that two Eastern European men who travelled to Bolivia with Mr Dwyer have in recent weeks resigned from his company .
He dismisses speculation of any possible involvement by his company in the South American venture . "
( 11 ) This backs up an earlier Irish Times report from June 2nd that some of those who travelled to Bolivia with Dwyer were still working for IRMS on their return .
In that piece Conor Lally could not find it within himself to even name the security firm the men had worked for never mind mention the name of Shell .
He reported that POLICE IN Bolivia want to interview three men living in Ireland about their movements in Bolivia with Michael Dwyer , ..
The three men .. worked with Mr Dwyer in Ireland .
The men  two Hungarians and a Slovak  travelled to Bolivia with Mr Dwyer last November .
One of the men is still working in the same security company in Ireland where he and Mr Dwyer met .
The other two men worked for the same firm until recently and are still living in Ireland .
( 12 ) Scott Miller had earlier reported in an Irish Examiner article that  Gábor Dudog and Gáspár Dániel , associated with the Szekler Legion are currently missing in Bolivia .
According to reports in the Hungarian press , Mr Dudog worked in Ireland in the security business and spent 6 to 8 six to eight months in Bolivia , protecting deliveries for a major oil company . 
In the light what we now know one wonders just which major oil company 
Dudog was working for .
And why the Irish Examiner , which has been braver in its coverage than most of the Irish papers , felt unable to name that company or to say just where in the security business in Ireland Dudog had worked .
It would be interesting to hear more from IRMS as to who these three men are and the specific dates of when they left IRMS employment .
The curious thing about almost all the media coverage is the obvious evasion in the way the sections of the articles that mention or might mention companies and names are written .
Yet this Irish Times piece is still significant in saying that those who travelled with Dwyer were still working for the unnamed security company  and that at the point in the time ( June 2nd ) this article was written , one of them still was !
It would be interesting to know where they were working but then if Conor didnt want to name the company hed hardly want to give us that information .
Conor Lally is one of a number of journalists who has written about the Erris struggle in a manner calculated to portray the protesters in a negative light , its a pity he is so much more cautious when writing about the other side of that struggle .
The international press has not shared this caution .
Here for instance is Saigon Dailys version of events , which is in turn a reprint of the Wall Street Journals coverage .
The first line introduces some new characters in the story , Ill explain their relevance shortly .
Marinkovic was a major shareholder with Shell of the nationalized pipeline in Boliva .
The Bolivarian government accuses him of being linked in with Rosza , the apparent commander of the gang .
Marinkovic denies this connection .
Dwyer was of course killed with Rosza in the Santa Cruz hotel .
From the investigations in Bolivia it appears the return flights of 11 people including Dwyer were paid for from Madrid to Bolivia .
La Prensa of June 4 named the eight who actually travelled as  The Irishman Michael Dwyer , the Hungarians Tibor Revesz , Elod Toaso , Daniel Gaspar and Gabor Dudog , the Slovak Ivan Pistovcak , the Romanian Arpad Magyarosi and the Bolivian - Croatian Mario Tadic .  ( 14 )
Of these 8 men Dwyer and Arpad ( a Szekler Legion members ) were killed in the hotel room raid in Bolivia .
Toaso ( also named by the Examiner as a Szekler legion member ) was arrested in the same raid .
Some of the others named , including Revesz have been named in Bolivia as wanted for questioning in connection with the events there .
In terms of papers published in Ireland the one that perhaps has gone the furthest at this point in time is The Mail .
This is a little surprising as politically it is further to the right than any of the domestic titles that have stayed quiet , but then again , its owner is nt linked into the oil and gas exploration off the west coast .
On May 31st the Mail reported The Mail article introduces a new element , the role of the Irish Rangers in the story .
Who are the Army Rangers ?
The are an elite and secretive special forces unit of the Irish army intended to fill a similar function to the SAS or elite US military formations .
A good first source is the Irish Army website ( 16 ) which despite blurring the faces of Rangers in photos otherwise tells us quite a bit .
For instance under their history of the unit they tell us  In the late 1960s and early 1970s a small number of Defence Forces personnel attended American Army Ranger Courses at Fort Benning , Georgia in the United States .
On their return , these personnel were responsible for organising similar type courses .
Fort Benning , Georgia is the home of the  School of the Americas often referred to as the  School of the Assassins  because many of its students have been associated with death squads , and coups in Latin American countries  ( 17 ) including Roberto D'Aubuisson who murdered the Salvadorean Archbishop Óscar Romero while he celebrated mass .
In November 1989 Schools of Americas graduates murdered six Jesuit priests , their housekeeper and her daughter .
The SoA trains the special forces units of many of the armies in Central and South America , the equivalent of the Irish Rangers .
School of the Americas Watch says the school taught repressive techniques and promoted the violation of human rights throughout Latin America and around the globe .
The manuals contain instructions in motivation by fear , bounties for enemy dead , false imprisonment , torture , execution , and kidnapping a target 's family members . 
Every year more than 10,000 people demonstrate at the School of the Americas on the anniversary of the killing of the 6 priests , their housekeeper and her daughter .
As a result of the repression of these protests  183 people have collectively served over 81 years in prison .
The Irish Army website actually situates the formation of the Rangers in the context of the sort of training the SoA provides ( with of course a positive spin ) when it writes  The evolution of the Army Ranger Wing resulted from an increase in international terrorism in the late 1970s and 1980s ..
European and other countries realised that conventional police and military tactics were not suited to dealing with this escalating threat .
Elsewhere their site refers to  Seaborne Interventions  and  Difficult or dangerous specialist tasks on land or at sea under the heading  Aid to the Civil Power .
It would be interesting to know what if any Ranger deployments may have happened on the land and sea around Erris under the excuse of  Aid to the Civil Power .
Now that we know a bit about Ranger training and their possible scope of operations its worth looking again at some of the stranger events that have been reported from Erris .
What at first seems fantastical seems less so when you take into account who may be deployed down there and just how far the Rozsa group were willing to go in Bolivia .
Really in that context the happenings at Erris are not at all extreme , quite the opposite in fact .
The odd beating or sinking hardly measures up to the bombing of cardinals or assassination of state governors .
Following the mysterious attack by masked men on local activist Willie Corduff at the Shell compound the Mayo News carried the following IN an emotional interview , Mr Corduff recalled how , after spending almost 19 hours lodged under a Shell lorry , he was allegedly assaulted by men in balaclavas ..
 I think they were professionals .
They seemed to be big men .
They put me down on the ground and all I can remember is four of them kneeling on me .
They didnt use their hands , they used their knees .
They squeezed me like a sandwich and they had my airwaves closed off ; and my hands were at the back of my head . 
( 18 ) Then on the night of 11th June local fisherman and activist Pat O'Donnell 's boat the ' Iona Isle ' was boarded by four masked and armed men and sunk out at sea .
A Shell to Sea press release reported the event as follows  At 2 am on Thursday morning , Pat O'Donnell 's boat the ' Iona Isle ' was boarded by four masked men and sunk out at sea , near where Mr. O'Donnell lays his fishing pots off Erris , North Mayo .
Mr. O'Donnell and crewman Martin McDonnell were attacked and held down by some of the men , while others went below deck , where they proceeded to sink the boat .
Both local men have been taken to Castlebar General Hospital , where they are recovering . ( 19 ) Pat later put out an account on indymedia which included  Pat O'Donnell 's fishing boat was boarded by four masked men , two of whom were armed , at approximately two o clock this morning whilst out at sea laying pots .
The two armed men held Mr O'Donnell and his crewman Martin McDonnell in the wheelhouse of the boat while another two went below deck for 20 minutes .
These men returned to the deck and the two crew members were held for one and a half hours until the engine went out .
At this point the masked men alighted onto an unknown vessel that took them away .
None of the men spoke good English .
Mr O'Donnell went down to the engine room and realised that the boat was sinking . 
( 20 ) One aspect of the special forces training described by SoA Watch falls under the heading motivation by fear .
This would seem a reasonable term to describe some of the events in the Erris area , many locals are on record as being afraid of the various mysterious forces active in and around the area .
They havent managed to get clear answers about who has been seen filming them ( and their children ) .
The limited media coverage of their fears has tended to ridicule them as being unreasonable , when you look at the big picture it becomes clear their fears are very reasonable indeed .
Dwyer 's mission appears to have been to help spark a civil war that would lead to the secession of the Santa Cruz region from the rest of Bolivia .
Much of the mineral wealth , including the gas of Bolivia is in the Santa Cruz region .
Bolivia is currently ruled by Evo Morales , a radical president who was swept to power on the back of a massive social movement and who then part nationalized the gas industry including Shells pipeline .
It is possible the secession of Santa Cruz would see the rise of politicians more compliant with the interests of international energy corporations like Shell .
More in other words like the sort of politicians that gave
Shell the gas royalties for free in Ireland .
Branco Marinkowitz is the politician and large business owner who has been identified in the Bolivian and international press as the main leader of the secessionist movement .
Marinkowitz is a founder ( and president ) of the secessionist Council of Santa Cruz .
Shells connection with Marinkowitz is through that pipeline company that Shell also owned 25 % of until it was nationalized .
four months before Dwyer and the others left the Shell compound in Glengad , Erris .
The Irish mainstream media have almost universally tired to paint Dwyer as an innocent abroad , at worst a Walter Mitty type character caught up in a situation he didnt understand .
Minister Micheal Martin initially played the same game before going quiet once more details started to emerge from Bolivia .
Well look at Dwyers involvement in detail in a while but let there be no doubt that those he was working with were dangerous people .
The military organizer of the Bolivian expedition was Eduardo Rozsa Flores , killed with Dwyer .
He left a pre-recorded interview broadcast after his death on Hungarian TV where he said  I have been called to organise the defense of the city and province of Santa Cruz , the Council of Santa Cruz have voted for the creation of a regional security council .
I will go to Brazil and Bolivia and begin to organise Militia .
The organisers will provide funding and arms .. illegally and probably from Brazil ..
I understand there will be a conflict with the Central Government ..
We wont walk with flags , we will do it with arms , we will declare independence and create a new country .
The Belgrade daily , Politika , wrote the following about Eduardo Rozsa Flores in the 1991 Croatian war .. he joined the infamous Croat paramilitary unit Zenga and became the commander of the  International Brigade .
 Reporters without Frontiers  accused him of killing two foreign correspondents in Croatia , Swiss Christian Wurtemberg and British photographer Paul Jenks .  ( 21 ) After the deaths in Bolivia one British journalist in Croatia at the time of these killing published a long description of the events in the right wing Telegraph newspaper ( hardly one with sympathies for Morales ) Clearly from his own statements and his past actions Eduardo Flores was a ruthless and dangerous character .
And in the hearings that have been happening in Bolivia the evidence heard does not paint Dwyer as an outsider but rather as Roszas right hand man and possibly his bodyguard .
According to Bolivian media reports , Mr Gueder Bruno said he attended meetings along with Mr Dwyer during which the killing of local politicians was discussed .
..
This evidence was backed up by a video showing Mr Dwyer at a meeting in which the possible assassination of Bolivias Socialist president , Evo Morales , was discussed by Mr Flores . 
( 23 ) Bolivian TV showed pictures of Dwyer and others posing with a variety of weapons including a high - powered sniper rifle accurate to over a kilometer .
( 24 ) Other reports of the testimony reveal that  Gueder Bruno , a member of the far - right Santa Cruz Youth Council ( UJC ) and charged with terrorist crimes , admitted on Thursday that he supplied arms to the group led by the Bolivian - Croat , Eduardo Rozsa , organizer of a cell of international mercenaries who were planning an assassination in Bolivia .
..
 I withdrew from the project of locating weapons when Rozsa said , in the second meeting , that he wanted to target the Governor of Santa Cruz .. Gueder Bruno said that the Paraguayan Mendoza Malavi , and also Magyarosi Arpad , Michael Dwyer and Eduardo Rozsa Flores were at both meetings . 
( 25 ) Perhaps most damning off all was the La Prensa report that  the statement of the arrested Mario Tadic .. said the people who carried out the attack on the house of Cardinal Terrazas July were Eduardo Rózsa Flores and Michael Martin Dwyer .
In one paragraph he stated that  The day the thing exploded at the home of the Cardinal , Eduardo and Mike arrived at about one o'clock in the morning and boasted of what was done : ' We threw that one at him and now we 'll see what will happen ' .
Mike 's face was frightening in his joy " . 
( 26 ) The day before Dwyer was shot the home of the Cardinal of Santa Cruz had been attacked with dynamite .
The Cardinal was actually a supporter of the sucessionists , the purpose of the attack appears to have been to stir up their own supporters .
Why the fascist involvement ?
This is a complex story .
One that stretches from the isolation of western Ireland to Bolivia , from the elite wing of the Irish Army to shadowy eastern European fascist organizations and far right mercenary plots .
It reads like a bad B - movie plot .
But the bodies in the Santa Cruz hotel room are real enough as are the sinister and strange events in Erris around the Shell compound there .
There are two common aspects to these geographically separate stories .
In both a Shell pipeline plays a significant role .
In both some of the foot soldiers are recruited from fascist organizations to fight and in the Bolivian case die for interests they perhaps did not fully understand .
But what would a load of European fascists be doing getting involved in a Bolivian coup ?
An article published on indymedia.ie by Fionuala Cregan shortly after Dwyer 's death explains this in detail .
She wrote that the secessionist groups include  the Unión Juvenil Cruceña ( Union of Cruzeno Youth ) : a youth group with open neo -Nazism sentiments and which has been involved in frequent violent mob attacks against the local indigenous population , and Nacion Camba , an openly racist organization formed of local intellectuals .
The Nacion Camba web site is quoted to illustrate this as follows  In general Bolivia is perceived to be a fundamentally Andean country made up of aymara and quechua  a backward and miserable ethnicity .. whose bureaucratic centre in La Paz exploits our economic wealth , condemning us to backwardness .. but there is another side to Bolivia , the 30 % of the population who are based in the east and who are made up Mestizos ( mixed race European and indigenous ) .
It s a common fantasy among many fascists of carrying out acts of provocation which will spark off a race war .
It appears that circumstances in Bolivia probably gave Flores a recruiting argument that went beyond financial reward .
Certainly Dwyers friend on a fascist websitehad been exposed to these arguments when he wrote  Whites in Bolivia are under seige from the commie govt , no different then in South Africa , thankfully they are getting organised and trying to create their own homeland .
Most Whites in Bolivia are v racially aware .
Mike was just unlucky murdered by a commie despot to justify further anti White oppression .
These fascists are simply useful idiots in the global corporate game of gaining control over energy resources .
They are something of a distraction from the real story here , except as an illustration of just how careless IRMS were in terms of recruitment for the Corrib site .
A carelessness that may not have ended with the deaths in Santa Cruz for the News of the World of June 6th carried an article on a secret fascist meeting in Dublin where they reported  Another attendee , Thor , claimed he worked in security on the Corrib project in Co.
Mayo , where he regularly " bust heads " .
He also claimed he had contacted members of the far - right linked to the recent failed assassination plot , which ended in the death of Irishman Michael Dwyer .  ( 27 )
He posts as thor1488 on the fascist websitewhere he taunted other fascists in one post that " you advocate the political route , the legal , above board , public face of the wn cause , while i am a member of the underground who is willing to use direct action against the antifa , swp and the rest of the unwashed . "
( 28 ) None of the events in Bolivia directly involve Shell .
The corporation is always at least one step , if not more , removed from events on the ground .
Outside ofthat fascist site ( hardly the most reliable of sources ) none of the Bolivian plotters have been named as directly working for the corporation at that point in time .
That said we dont know who the major oil company  that Dudog worked for in Bolivia and to who Scott Miller referred to in the Irish Examiner is .
Shell have just settled out of court in New York to avoid a trial for complicity in the decision to hang Ken Saro - Wiwa , Dr. Barinem Kiobel , John Kpuinen , Baribo Bera , Saturday Dobee , Felix Nwate , Nordu Eawo , Paul Levura and Daniel Gboko in Nigeria . ( 29 )
The settlement means the evidence will not now be heard but in advance of the trail Reuters reported that  Lawyers for the plaintiffs say evidence in the trial will include documents in which Shell called Saro - Wiwa a threat that should be eliminated .
According to a Bloomberg report  The plaintiffs claim Shells Nigerian unit assisted the government in the abuse and murder of opponents of the companys operations in the Niger Delta . ..
Shell recruited Nigerian police and military to attack villages and suppress the movement . ( 30 ) Rather unsurprisingly in advance of the trial Shell spokeswoman Robin Lebovitz said the allegations are " without merit . "
After the 15.5 million dollar settlement by Shell The Guardian wrote that " What it suggests is that Shell wants to bury the facts about what was happening on the Niger delta in the 1970s and 1980s ..
The settlement stops the world knowing exactly what was the company 's relationship with the national government and the military , and the extent of Shell 's involvement in the human rights abuses that led to Ken Saro - Wiwa 's execution . "
( 31 ) Shell spends huge amount of money on PR , in 1998  Shell spent US $ 30 million on contracts with PR company Fishburn & Hedges alone . ( 32 ) The article  Irish Times Shell PR  in the May 22 issue of the Phoenix looks at how in Ireland Shell have successfully changed the line of the Irish Times over the last two years to the point where now the Irish Times now frequently send their crime correspondent to cover protests in Erris .
The Irish Times is not unique in this respect , media outlet after media outlet considers it suitable to send crime correspondents to cover the protests despite not only the bias this reveals but also the fact that crime correspondents depend on developing and maintaining positive relations with the Gardaí to continue to get news stories .
If they want to continue to get the scoops their jobs depend on they are not in a position to bite the hand that feeds them such stories .
Such is the success of Shells PR machine that when Colm Rapple , a guest on RTEs  Marian Finucane  show managed to slip in a mention of the Bolivian story Cathal McCarthy howled in anguish in The Independent going so far as to threaten that it might be unwise of RTE to allow anyone to suggest outlandish and ruinous speculative motives to what was , at the very least , the violent killing of an Irish citizen in the most dubious circumstances of which it is possible to conceive . 
( 33 ) The Independent is controlled by the OReillys , pre-crash billionaires who coincidentally holds a  40 % stake in Providence Resources Plc , the Irish based oil and gas exploration and development company .  ( 34 ) The Independent group also owns the Evening Herald , Irish Independent , Sunday Independent , Sunday World and the Irish Daily Star , as well as 14 regional titles and two free newspapers .
Plus a 98 % stake in the Sunday Tribune .
The observant reader will perhaps notice that none of these titles have named names on the Shell  IRMS  Bolivia story although most if not all of these titles have been happy enough to throw all manner of weird and wonderful accusations at the locals who oppose the Shell pipeline and their supporters .
You can see why journalists in this country are not prepared to commit hari kari on their career by naming names in this story .
Even if your not a journalist currently working for an Independent title youd want to be careful of pissing off the family who own a 40 % state in an Irish oil and gas exploration company as you may well be looking for a job at one of those titles in the future .
And its not like what it left of the Irish media has been a whole lot better with the honorable exception of The Phoenix and the Irish Examiner , both of which are sadly rather small circulation niche titles .
Another consequence of Shells highly successful PR offensive is the routine appearance of articles in the media that seek to portray the locals and their supporters as subversives .
Sometimes this can be quite farcical , for example the Phoenix points to the Irish Times Peter Murtagh getting away with publishing an article in March where he links the struggle to  notorious INLA murderer 
Dominic McGlinchy  on the weird grounds that his son supports the protests .
While there have been acres of coverage in the media on that sort of basis the facts revealed in the aftermath of the killing of Dwyer have received scant coverage .
A large part of this story revolves around Integrated Risk Management Services ( IRMS ) .
The company that at least four or five of the men who travelled to Bolivia had worked for and for whom two or three continued to work for on their return , at least for a while .
The Phoenix has been looking at IRMS over a number of issues and has concluded that clearly the company has good connections in establishment circles , security and political .  ( 35 ) The meaning of political is clear enough and IRMS have provided security for several of the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheiseanna .
But what about  security  ?
We know IRMS were founded by a couple of retired Irish Rangers and that their offices are located beside the HQ of the Rangers .
The location alone suggests some sort of ongoing connection , perhaps of an informal kind .
After all men who served together in elite units often form a bond that goes beyond the period of service .
Yet the Rangers traditionally strongly discourage not only any sort of nixer ( work on the side ) but also any involvement in politics , two barriers involvement in IRMS would obviously cross .
Retired Rangers are no longer under these restrictions , indeed many go into one form or another of security  work , not just in Ireland but around the globe .
Their training provides them with a skill set that is useful for many corporate requirements .
Is it also useful for the Irish state to maintain an informal ongoing relationship both through individual politicians and serving members of the security forces ?
In Erris it would make no sense if there were not ongoing and constant contacts between IRMS and the Garda and Navy commanders on the scene .
Is this part of the growing pattern in western militaries where certain tasks are out sourced to private companies who dont operate under the same constraints as the state security forces proper do ?
The most infamous of these is Blackwater , which deployed 20,000 to 30,000 armed security contractors to Iraq during the ongoing occupation there .
Many of its employees were drawn from a database of 21,000 former Special Forces operatives , soldiers , and retired law enforcement agents .
If the US state found it useful to have a militarily trained private security company on hand could the same not be true of the Irish state ?
On the protests at Erris there is little to distinguish between the Gardai and the IRMS security except that IRMS mostly stay inside the compound .
The exception being the Shell security boats which are crewed by Gardaí and presumably IRMS personnel with training in difficult or dangerous specialist tasks on land or at sea .
Apart from the boat crews the IRMS role at the Shell compound clearly goes beyond that of static security , at the very least it also includes intelligence gathering .
On a walk around the compound one evening in early June three friends and myself were filmed by at least five different private security inside the Shell compound and larger numbers have been observed filming protests at the compound .
Somewhat chillingly after the death of Dwyer in Bolivia photos were discovered that appear to show Dwyer and Revez caught in the act of videoing protesters at the Shell compound .
It s hard to be 100 % sure of this identification because , as is often the case with security there , the headgear and sunglasses of the man who may by Dwyer obscures his identity .
Are IRMS providing a role beyond the dozens of sometimes - masked security that line the fences of the Shell compound ?
The government 's Private Security Authority chief executive Geraldine Larkin 's reaction to what has appeared in the media and to complaints made in Erris about IRMS was reported by the Irish Times as being that the ( unnamed ) security firm working for Shell on the Corrib gas project is the most monitored  security company in the State .  ( 36 )
It is not clear what this monitoring means in real terms in relation to Erris .
Michael Dwyer not even have the appropriate Private Security Authority ( PSA ) license for his static security work for Shell in Mayo .
The Phoenix revealed that some of the other IRMS personnel named in recent Erris court cases do not appear to be listed in the PSA database . ( 37 )
In a court report the May 1st Mayo Advertiser wrote that  Judge Devins said in light of recent media reports about the connection between IRMS staff and issues in Bolivia the superintendent would go back to the DPP about the credibility of the two IRMS witnesses as the DPP may direct that it was now time for their employers to come into court .  ( 38 ) The government appointed DPP subsequently ruled that any involvement of the security company outside the jurisdiction  should not be examined .
The Phoenix report concludes with some questions they would like IRMS to answer , reproduced below Why has the IRMS website remained offline since shortly after the death in Bolivia of the firms former employee Michael Dwyer ?
When did the firm cease to employ the Hungarian Tibor Revesz , whose web address was used to recruit for the Bolivian escapade and featured a notice concerning an IRMS course involving arms training ?
And what precisely is meant by services formerly advertised on IRMSs own website described as international armed and unarmed security . ( 39 ) We also know that the armed Garda Emergency Response Unit ( ERU ) has been deployed in Erris on at least one occasion and it is rumored that the operation down there is now being run by a guard who previously headed up the ERU .
This is a very curious choice for the policing of protest , the armed ERU was designed for shoot outs with armed criminals and paramilitaries , not policing protests of farmers and fishermen .
The Gardai have been operating as if they were at war , among an occupied population .
They have shown little interest in investigating any of the strange occurrences in the area .
The Mayo News of 22 June quoted a letter from local campaign group to the Minister of Justice which read  Law and order is being subverted in our community by a sinister , unknown group that is targeting well - known opponents of the Corrib gas project .
Senior officers continue to publicly belittle us when we report incidents and to dismiss the gravity of these events . 
( 40 ) The Phoenix points out Gardai reaction to the sinking of Pat ODonnells boat was very odd .
The Gardai press release , circulated after Pat had said the assailants boat had escaped to the north insisted for a reason no one understands that it would have had to escape to the south - east .
And their first action was to demand Pats clothes as if he was their suspect rather than the victim of the crime .
This follows on from Gardai actions last summer when the repeatedly arrested Pat under the pretext of Public Order act simply in order to get his boat out of Broadhaven Bay to make room for the Solitaire .
As the Mayo News explained  On one occasion he was released from Belmullet Garda Station two minutes before his lawyers in Dublin were due to present papers to the High Court for an inquiry into his arrest under Article 42.4.2 of the Constitution . 
( 41 ) Because he had been released the High Court refused to proceed with the inquiry !
His arrest , and the prefect timing of his release , was just one example of how the Gardai in Erris have been making up the law as they go along in order to fill Shells needs safe in the knowledge that those further up the chain have their backs .
Reviewing YouTube videos of various protests at Erris shows an often shocking level of Gardai violence towards the local population , some of them quite elderly or very young .
Unsurprizingly almost none of the hundreds of complaints about Gardai violence have been upheld .
Now few in Erris bother lodging complaints anymore .
Something I have observed in my involvement in the campaign is how people on getting involved and making their first fact finding  trip to the area return full of suggestions about how the campaign needs to get the media to cover the story .
The reasonable assumption they make is that the campaign has been failing to issue press releases etc such is the yawning gap between what the have read in the newspaper and seen on TV and the reality on the ground .
Why is the media , even outside of the Independent group titles so silent ?
Perhaps it is fear of a libel action backed by the deep pockets of Shell ?
Or simply that many of these journalists have been wined and dined by Shell .
For instance according to the Phoenix , Paul Williams whose documentary  on the project was a single minded attack on the protesters was the guest of Shell at the 2007 England Rugby match at Croke Park , part of what Shell told the Phoenix was their stakeholder engagement list .
And the state media is controlled by the same state that is deploying hundreds of Gardai and the Irish Navy to force the corporate project through against the resistance of Irish citizens .
The media silence extends beyond the Bolivian story to the Gas Giveaway itself , the process by which Irish politicians , one of whom was subsequently convicted of corruption , changed the law in Shells interests so that the corporation will not now be required to pay a single cent of royalties on the gas it extracts .
The depth of the capitalist crisis and perhaps even some guilt about what Shell has got away with has started to see a minor breaking of ranks .
The Irish Times carried an opinion piece  June 19 from Andy Storey that pointed out the scale of the rip off and the fact that  If the Government were to take only a modest 10 per cent stake in these discoveries then the exchequer would stand to gain a staggering 5 billion . 
And that this would mean there would be no need for such measures as the closure of three wards in Crumlin childrens hospital because of a  9.6 million deficit . 
( 42 ) Indeed Storeys estimate of the value of the gas and oil offshore is very conservative .
Official estimates of reserves at the high prices of gas and oil of two years back would give potential values up to 950 billion .
A 10 % royalty on a real value of even a quarter of this would be sufficient to reverse every single cut in services and wages that has come about so far in the recession and to cancel all the future planned ones .
And some estimates of the total off shore energy reserves have been as high as 3,500 billion !
That is the scale of the Great Gas Giveaway and explains why both the political parties that changed the law to allow the giveaway and the corporations that benefit it are willing to go to extraordinary lengths to protect such incredible wealth from those who need it most .
What stands in their way are the local people of Erris who are concerned about the risk the penny pinching of Shell is exposing them to ( sending  Shell to Sea would only cost 100 million of these hundreds of billions ) .
And the small but determined number of people from all over Ireland who have looked at their story and looked at the Gas Giveaway and determined to stand up to the behemoth that is bearing down on them .
Vast quantities are being spent on PR and policing because Shell and the state knows it can win as long as those resisting are kept isolated , as long as the mass of the population of the Ireland is kept in confusion over the issues .
Their weakness is the risk that outrage at the scale of the huge rip - off that the abolition of royalties amounts to will spread among people in Ireland .
That we will become aware that the money which could have funded our health and education needs and headed off many of the deep cuts on our wages and standard of living is instead to flow into the coffers of a multi-national .--- The Politics ie thread at http://www.politics.ie/foreign-affairs/61194-irish-invo....html was invaluable in researching this article , great thanks is due to the people who spent a lot of time ferreting out much of the information I use .

Super Mario Brothers Teach You How to Get Women
Many might have seen the Super Mario Brothers Nintendo game as a useless pastime that simply provided a source of entertainment .
However , the t- shirt pictured above seems to be proving us all wrong .
The ' Money Power Woman ' tee from Split Reason uses Super Mario characters to get across their important message : â€ œFirst you get the money , then you get the power , then you get the woman.â€ 
Implications -
With the idea of games pertaining to geeks , consumers are looking for items that paint a different picture of the technologically integrated .
Products that announce a hipper customer appeal to shoppers who want to stay attractive despite their unattractive tendencies .
Developing these items could help a company speak to an audience that is usually not integrated with fashion .
Sequencing the Sugarcane Genome : The Holy Grail of Biofuel ?
July 8th , 2009 by Bryan Nelson
Australian scientists are aiming to finish sequencing the genome for sugarcane by this time next year .
Once completed , it could lead to the development of a super biofuel .
Sugarcane is already being widely harvested as a biofuel , but with the genome mapped researchers could pinpoint exactly where in its DNA specific traits are found .
Those traits could then be more precisely manipulated to create “ supercane ” – sugarcane richer in energy and more suitable for transformation into biofuel .
[ social_buttons ]
According to Robert Henry , one of the project ’s researchers : “ Energy canes have been touted , both here and internationally , as one of the most efficient future options for producing plant - based fuels , plastics and many sought - after bio-products . ”
For instance , Brazil ’s fuel independence is a shining example of how sugarcane - based ethanol could one day replace petroleum in places where the crop can be widely grown .
Even so , until now the complex nature of sugarcane ’s genetic structure has been a hindrance to scientists hoping to tap its full potential .
“ This will be an outstanding outcome , and the resulting database will include sought after , significant genetic information , ” said Henry .
The finished draft of the sequence is expected to be available by mid-2010 .

Sell A Used Game In Florida , Leave Your Thumbprint
The sheriff of Broward County , Fla. ( Fort Lauderdale ) says Florida law requires him to treat used games the same as merchandise sold at pawn shops .
That means sellers ca n’t go home with their cash ( or store credit ) without leaving a greasy smudge .
According to the New Times of Broward - Palm Beach , the sheriff sent deputies to every game store in the county in October , telling them to get thumbprints from all used - game sellers .
A GameStop manager breaks it down pretty succinctly when asked why he complied : “ They have guns .
I do n’t argue with people with guns . ”
That ’s exactly what law enforcement wants to hear , son .
A sheriff ’s spokeswoman said the requirement is part of a state law passed in 2007 .
That law also requires sellers to put a 15 - day hold on the items before they can resell them , but as you can guess , probably no one is complying with that .
The GameStop manager said that most customers do n’t care about the requirement , although some have left the store without selling games .
Of course it ’s meant to cut down on people selling stolen merch , and games and game systems are top items in that category .
It ’s also another way to make law abiding private citizens feel like they ’re criminals .

“ This is about consumer choice and introducing competition in the health insurance market .
Private health insurers always manage to stay ‘ one step ahead of the sheriff ’-- finding new ways to limit care and pass costs along to the consumer .
Giving Americans the choice of a quality , federally - backed , health insurance option will keep private insurers honest and make health care affordable . ”
Using Sen. John McCain's ( R - AZ ) health care plan as a foundation , the Patients ' Choice
Act proposes taxing the full value of employer health benefits , issuing refundable tax credits ( $ 2,290 per individual or $ 5,710 per family ) , and expanding the use of Health Savings Accounts .
States are encouraged to " establish rational and reasonable consumer protections " by forming State Health Insurance Exchanges to give Americans a choice of " different " private " health insurance policies " and issue standard benefits , offering " coverage to any individual regardless of age or health . "
The act places the 158 million Americans who receive their health care through their jobs in danger of losing coverage and provides an inadequate safety net for the newly - uninsured .
As Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein points out , " the minimum benefit package is too stingy .
There are n't sufficient subsidies for low - income consumers .
The plan controls costs by encouraging people to purchase less comprehensive insurance . "
Indeed , Americans can choose a private health insurance plan from the State Health Insurance Exchanges , but that does n't mean they 'll be able to afford it .
The $ 5,710 tax subsidy for families proposed in the Republican plan is less than half of the $ 12,680 that the average American family paid for health care in 2008 , and the proposal allows private plans to charge sicker Americans higher rates for coverage .
Republicans include a European - style " non-profit independent board " that " would penalize insurance companies that cherry pick healthy patients while rewarding companies that seek patients with pre-existing conditions , " but they do nothing to prevent higher prices based on sex , age , occupation , or medical condition .
While the ridiculous and untrustworthy AFSCME has gotten into a pie fight battle of the radio ads with Senator Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) over health care reform , the crucial showdown on real reform -- what 's called " the public option " -- is approaching .
The Insurance Industry and HMOs and their paid congressional shills , virtuallythe Republicans and more than a few Democrats , will do anything they can to prevent this .
If there 's one thing it means to be a Republican or a Blue Dog type Democrat in 2009 it's that you will never agree to allow your constituents to have the same healthcare that you have .
But the 16 senators who were originally pushing for the public option has now grown considerably and there are now 28 senators -- out of 99 -- who are on the side of the people instead of on the side of corporate health care and for - profit insurance campaign contributors .
Actually , there are more than 28 .
The 28 , though , got together yesterday and introduced a resolution demanding something that paid - off insurance business whore Max Baucus has conspired with Mitch McConnell and the Republicans to prevent : the inclusion of a federally - backed health insurance option in whatever health care reform Congress patches together .
The 28 backers are Sherrod Brown ( D - OH ) , Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) , Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) , Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) , Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) , Barbara Mikulski ( D - MD ) , Tom Harkin ( D - IA ) , Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) , Jack Reed ( D - RI ) , Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , Robert Menendez ( D - NJ ) , Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) , Debbie Stabenow ( D - MI ) , Bob Casey ( D - PA ) , Kirsten Gillibrand ( D - NY ) , Jeff Merkley ( D - OR ) , Tom Udall ( D - NM ) , Daniel K. Inouye ( D - HI ) , Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) , Ted Kaufman ( D - DE ) , Roland W. Burris ( D - IL ) , Frank R. Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) , Claire McCaskill ( D - MO ) , Jeanne Shaheen ( D - NH ) , and Ben Cardin ( D - MD ) .
Their resolution is unambiguous and demands that any reform of our nation ’s health care system should give consumers a choice of an affordable , federally - backed option to introduce competition in the health insurance market and contain health care costs .
Sherrod Brown is completely identified with working for consumers and ordinary American families .
His statement does n't come as a surprise :
However , other senators , like Rockefeller and Schumer , are less dependable allies for working families .
Rockefeller , who 's the chairman of the Senate Finance subcommittee on Health Care , did n't sign on to the resolution but claims he 's still down with the concept : " I strongly support including a public health insurance option in health reform .
We need to provide quality , affordable coverage for the millions of Americans the insurance industry has failed -- a federally - backed health insurance option is the only reliable way to do just that .
” In another undeniable step away from her Blue Dog allies Kirsten Gillbrand did sign on and is taking an active part in making sure the public option does n't get axed by Republicans and the Democrats who act like Republicans .
“ Ensuring that every American has access to quality , affordable health care is a national priority , ” she said .
“ With more than 47 million uninsured Americans and millions of families and businesses struggling with rising health care costs , the time to act is now .
We cannot have a system in which the only choice is private plans .
Everyone should have the option of buying into a not - for profit public plan at a rate that they can afford .
I am proud to join with my colleagues to fight for the inclusion of a public plan option in health care reform .
” Tonight Bill Moyers will be on PBS discussing single payer health care , the option that Baucus , McConnell and the Insurance Industry have kept out of the debate .
The Republicans have two plans -- an extreme right wing plan the kooks and fascists are backing that was put together by anti-working family fanatics Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) , Devin Nunes ( R- CA ) , Richard Burr ( R - NC ) and Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) -- and the a slightly less extremist plan by Mark Kirk ( R - IL ) and Charlie Dent ( R - PA ) .
Ryan 's bill , the Patients ' Choice Act , is primarily a scare tactic platform so that Republicans who oppose health care for working families will have something to point to that they can claim is a positive step , even though it is far from positive or a step .
According to the Center for American Progress all Ryan has done is cobble together a batch of McCain 's rejected excuses for not helping working families .
Right now I 'm trying to persuade one of America 's foremost health care advocates to take on Ryan in 2010 .
I think she 's concerned about the huge amounts of corporate money he always manages to bring in from the banksters and Big Pharma , HMOs , Insurance , etc .

People holding California state IOUs -- including taxpayers , vendors and local governments -- will soon have a tougher time redeeming them , as most major banks are standing firm on a vow not to cash the vouchers after today .
Many credit unions say they will continue to redeem the IOUs for customers .
But without mainstream banks as an option , recipients of the IOUs who need cash immediately could be tempted to sell them at a discount to third - party speculators , including ones popping up on the Internet .
Responding to that potential , the Securities and Exchange Commission determined Thursday that the IOUs are securities under federal law , which will generally require anyone trading them for profit to be a registered securities dealer .
The move is aimed at limiting the risk that IOU recipients could be defrauded by individuals or companies that offer to buy the scrip .

“ The SEC ’s action has the potential to , at least a bit , reduce the shark factor and potential for taxpayers to get defrauded , ” said Tom Dresslar , spokesman for State Treasurer Bill Lockyer .
As lawmakers continue to butt heads over a $ 26 - billion budget deficit , the state ’s payment system is expected to crank out nearly $ 3 billion this month in interest - bearing IOUs , also known as registered warrants .
In the last week , State Controller John Chiang ’s office issued 91,000 IOUs worth $ 354 million to people expecting tax refunds , as well as to state vendors and local governments , said spokeswoman Hallye Jordan .
The state will pay an annual tax - free interest rate of 3.75 % on the IOUs , which creditors can redeem Oct. 2 when they are scheduled to mature .
But if they need the funds immediately , they now may need to turn to credit unions and check - cashing companies .

Most major banks reiterated that customers could not deposit the IOUs after today .
Others , such as City National Corp. , said they would continue accepting the registered warrants but could stop taking them at any time .
The last time the state sent out IOUs , during a 1992 impasse between then - Gov. Pete Wilson and legislators , banks also eventually rejected the registered warrants .
“ We agreed to help customers and clients on an immediate basis , but it does n’t provide an incentive for the state to reach an agreement if we just accept the IOUs through perpetuity , ” said Bank of America Corp. spokeswoman Britney Sheehan .
Last week , Bank of America said it would do the state a favor by redeeming IOUs from current customers at full value -- but only until today .
Other major banks quickly and begrudgingly followed suit .

Wells Fargo & Co. was “ pretty reluctant to accept the warrants in the first place , ” said spokeswoman Mary Trigg .
The bank also will reject the IOUs starting Saturday , but it will work with customers on a case - by - case basis to manage short - term financial needs , she said .
“ We feel the state of California has to be responsible for living within its means , ” Trigg said .
“ The banks are n’t the solution to the state ’s budget problems .
We ’re trying to strike a balance between how grave the situation is and the needs of our customers . ”
Bank of America will try to use existing services and strategies , such as waiving account maintenance fees or clearing overdraft fees , to help customers who depend on state checks , Sheehan said .

Other banks may offer temporary lines of credit or short - term loans , said Beth Mills , a spokeswoman for the California Bankers Assn .
Several smaller banks are planning to continue accepting the warrants ; others may accept IOUs for some customers but not others .
Still , some say the banks are stranding their customers in desperate times .
Lockyer ’s office intends to call banks that have set a cutoff for today and urge them to continue cashing the scrip .
“ We would urge financial institutions to do right by their customers , ” Chiang spokeswoman Jordan said .
“ Private businesses and citizens are receiving these IOUs through no fault of their own , so why penalize them further ? ”
At least 60 California credit unions have agreed to accept IOUs , according to the California Credit Union League trade group .
Most will not set a deadline to deposit the IOUs , and all will redeem the registered warrants at face value , said league spokesman Henry Kertman .

Though some of the member - owned credit unions may decide to redeem IOUs only for current account holders , many others hope to grab some market share from banks no longer honoring the IOUs , Kertman said .
“ Some are looking at the situation as an opportunity to differentiate themselves and open their doors to more consumers , ” he said .
One advantage for many credit unions , which mostly avoided the risky loans that burdened banks , is that they can afford to sit on the IOUs until the state pays them off .
SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union , one of the largest in the nation with more than 400,000 members , will accept IOUs until the end of the month , said Derek Longshore , vice president of marketing .
Then the credit union will reevaluate its position month by month before deciding whether to continue .

“ We ’ll be eating up capital when we do that , but we have conservative financial practices and have been able to amass a great deal of capital , ” Longshore said .
“ I do n’t know whether secondary markets are charging fees , but we definitely are not . ”
Check - cashing companies also are an option , though they are more likely to redeem the IOUs at a discount .
Some , like Cash America , said they did n’t intend to accept the registered warrants at all .
Nix Check Cashing in Manhattan Beach also will reject the IOUs at its store locations because its correspondent bank , one of the largest operating in Southern California , refuses to accept the scrip , said spokeswoman Laura Oberhelman .
But Nix customers also could go to Nix ’s parent company , Kinecta Federal Credit Union .
Kinecta still welcomes IOU deposits .

“ It was important that we continue to do this for our members , especially since we put in certain requirements to mitigate the risk , ” Oberhelman said .
“ They need this , so we wanted to make it available to them so they do n’t have to go somewhere else . ”

New Non-Melting Chocolate Bars Are 90 Percent Lower Calorie Than Normal
The Swiss chocolate company Callebaut has invented a non-melting , low - calorie chocolate bar : in other words , the perfect treat .
It ’s tough not to salivate over chocolate cheesecakes , flourless chocolate tortes , and decadent chocolate lava cakes when you go out for a meal .
Such mocha concoctions are sure to be delicious , but considering that a single slice of chocolate cheesecake can often fulfill your entire calorie quota for the entire day , it ’s probably wise to pass it up .
Calories are n’t your only concern when it comes to chocolate : how many times have you unwrapped a tasty chocolate bar only to discover that the chocolate has melted all over the wrapper after just a few minutes in the sun ?
Sure , it still tastes good , but it ’s tough to eat it without looking like a messy two - year - old — not a great look when you ’re headed to a business meeting , or any other time time , really .
But now , the premium Swiss chocolate company Callebaut claims to have solved both of these chocolate conundrums with the invention of a brand new confection known as the Vulcano .
What ’s so special about the product ?
According to founder Barry Callebaut , the new bar is completely melt - resistant to hot weather : it ’s able to withstand temperatures up to 131 degrees Fahrenheit without getting sloppy .
Even better , the new chocolate , which will be available in both bar and cookie form , will contain up to 90 percent less calories than a typical piece of chocolate .
It sounds revolutionary , but the question , of course , is the taste .
Is there any possibility that a Vulcano chocolate could compare to the luscious flavor of your favorite Lindt bar ?
Callebaut claims that it can — and , if the company ’s right , they may have struck ( black ) gold .
“ It ’s nice and chocolatey , with a strong aroma , and crispy rather than creamy , ” a Callebaut spokesperson , Gaby Tschofen , told The Guardian .
“ It does melt in the mouth , but it is the enzymes in saliva rather than the heat of the tongue that causes it to dissolve . ”
Sadly , the Vulcano bar is still in testing stages , but it should be appearing on grocery store shelves in about two years .
We ’ve got a feeling we ’d better line up now to buy the new chocolates — if they ’re as amazing as they seem , chocoholics the world over will pillage the stock within seconds .
• US accounts for more than half total increase to $ 1.4tn • China now second biggest spender in world league table
Worldwide spending on weapons has reached record levels amounting to well over $ 1tn last year , a leading research organisation reported today .
Global military expenditure has risen by 45 % over the past decade to $ 1.46tn , according to the latest annual Yearbook on Armaments , Disarmament , and International Security published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( Sipri ) .
Though the US accounts for more than half the total increase , China and Russia nearly tripled their military expenditure over the decade , with China now second only to the US in the military expenditure league table .
" China had both the largest absolute and the largest relative increase , " says the Sipri report .
The increase " has roughly paralleled its economic growth and is also linked to its major power aspirations , " it adds .
Other regional powers , including India , Brazil and Algeria , also substantially increased their spending on arms , the report says .
Despite increasing its military expenditure by 3 % in real terms in 2008 and by 21 % since 1999 , Britain faces a significant military budget shortfall .
Sipri says this is due partly to the UK 's involvement in two conflicts , in Afghanistan and Iraq , which are projected to have cost a total of £ 12bn ( $ 18 bn ) .
It is also partly due to commitments to numerous large weapons procurement projects that cannot be funded under current budget plans .
To close the budget shortfall , the MoD decided last year to reduce or postpone , but not cancel , large projects including plans to build two aircraft carriers , and high - tech armoured cars for the army .
" The idea of the ' war on terror ' has encouraged many countries to see their problems through a highly militarised lens , using this to justify high military spending , " said Dr Sam Perlo - Freeman , head of Sipri 's military expenditure project .
" Meanwhile , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have cost $ 903bn in additional military spending by the USA alone . "
Sipri's yearbook also lists the top 100 arms producing companies , excluding Chinese ones , for which figures were unavailable .
Boeing remained the top arms producer in 2007 – the most recent year for which reliable data is available – with arms sales worth $ 30.5 bn .
All the top 20 companies are American or European .
Their aggregate arms sales amounted to $ 347bn in 2007 , an increase of 5 % in real terms over 2006 .
Sipri estimates that in total there are about 8,400 operational nuclear warheads in the world , of which almost 2,000 are kept on high alert and capable of being launched in minutes .
Counting spare warheads , those in storage and those due to be dismantled , there are 23,300 nuclear weapons in the arsenals of eight states – the US , Russia , China , the UK , France , India , Pakistan and Israel , according to the yearbook .
The number of people forcibly displaced by conflict has also increased in recent years , with internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) reaching 26 million , more than twice the number of refugees , says the Sipri report .
" For a large share of these people , no sustainable solution is in sight .
Mass population displacement is often a result – and even a goal – of violence against civilians . "
Top 10 military spenders in 2008 ( $bn )
USA 607
2 China 84.9
3 France 65.7
4 UK 65.3
5 Russia 58.6
6 Germany 46.8

Outside of Virginia , there was little reason to notice that Creigh Deeds won the state 's Democratic primary for governor .
But here 's something that political campaigns and marketers across the country should pay attention to :
He did it partly with a technology called Google Blasting , an eleventh - hour strategy to blanket Google - affiliated webpages in an area with a single ad campaign to impact voters ' final decision .
This is now the second time in three months that a Democratic underdog has used Google blasts to seal a surprising victory .
Goodbye robocalls , hello Google surges ?
First , let 's understand what happened with Creigh Deeds , who just a month ago was running a distant third in the VA primary .
First the Washington Post endorsed him , creating a huge boost in northern Virginian support .
But with most polls predicting a neck - in - neck race , even the outliers had Deeds in the low 40s .
He ended up trouncing Terry McAuliffe and Brian Moran by more than 20 points , capturing 50 % of the vote .
How can we explain the incredible surge ?
Was it Google ?
The Washington Post lays out the argument :
Starting at 3 p.m EST
Monday , hours before polls opened across Virginia , Deeds 's campaign bought what 's called a ' Google blast . '
Or , more appropriately , a Google attack .
If you live in Northern Virginia ( or , like many voters , work in D.C. but live in NoVa ) , Deeds has been almost inescapable on highly - trafficked sites such as washingtonpost.com , the blog Talking Points Memo and Oxygen.com , which is popular among women .
Capitalizing on his Post endorsement , he peppered those sites with banner ads reading ' The Washington Post endorsed one Democrat -- Creigh Deeds ' until polls closed .
As Taegan Goddard 's Political Wire points out , the same strategy was used by Democrat Scott Murphy in his upset victory in the New York Congressional seat vacated by Hillary Clinton 's replacement , Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand .
In that election surprise , Murphy covered Google content network pages in the New York 's 20th district with promotions , something operatives called a " Google Network Blast " or " Google Surge . "
Although most polls in the month leading up to his win had him behind , Murphy won the election by less than 1000 votes .
So how can this change elections going forward ?
I would wager that Google blasting works best in elections precisely like Virginia 's Democratic primary for governor , when most potential voters had low barriers - to - persuasion and some might not even be aware of the significant differences between the candidates until a few days before the election .
But maybe I 'm overestimating the ability of voters to make up their minds early for major elections , too .
I was consistently surprised to hear about the supposed legions of undecided voters in 2008 and anybody who has worked on a campaign knows operatives never underestimate the power of last - minute pushes in toss - up areas , like North Carolina and Missouri in 2008 .
An effective Google surge would like dispatching thousands of volunteers to paper entire districts with fliers , minus the eye - sore and littering .
It 's just one more reason to either fear Google or learn to appreciate its awesome power .
The US Congress has begun moves to outlaw so - called " vulture funds " , which buy up the sovereign debt of poor countries at a knock - down price and then go to court to enforce full payment .
A Democrat congresswoman , Maxine Waters , has introduced the Stop Vulture Funds Act , designed to protect impoverished countries from lawsuits by vulture funds .
Waters said : " Over the past year , we have seen how the actions of a small number of unscrupulous and exploitative investors can hurt innocent people and cause economic chaos .
We cannot allow the world 's poorest countries to be exploited by these bad actors . "
Most vulture funds are based either in the US or offshore centres such as the Cayman Islands .
The act would make it illegal for vulture funds to sue poor countries in US courts to obtain usurious payment .
" Usurious " is defined as anything more than the purchase price of the debt plus 6 % a year interest .
Vultures often buy poor country debt on secondary markets at , say , 10 cents on the dollar and then try to recoup the full face value in court – a practice which can be very lucrative .
" The act would protect impoverished countries from the predatory practices of vulture funds and allow these countries to use their limited resources to meet the needs of their people , " added Waters .
" I am proud of my work in Congress to cancel poor countries ' debts .
We cannot allow vulture funds to erode the progress that has enabled many of the world 's most impoverished nations to reduce poverty . "
Her bill echoes a similar move made by a cross-party group of MPs in the UK last month led by Labour 's Sally Keeble .
They called for a Developing Country Debt ( Restriction of Recovery ) bill that would ban hedge funds and other creditors from taking legal action to make large profits out of poor countries ' debts .
Such funds often use British courts and law firms to pursue claims .
At least 54 companies are known to have taken legal action against 12 of the world 's poorest countries in recent years , for claims amounting to $ 1.8 bn ( £ 1.1bn ) .
Vulture action is ongoing against Ethiopia , Cameroon , Argentina , the Democratic Republic of the Congo and others , according to World Bank reports .
In 2007 , Donegal International , based in the British Virgin Islands , won a $ 15.5 m repayment in the high court for Zambian debt it had bought several years earlier for $ 3.3 m .
Two - thirds of Zambians live on less than $ 1 a day , and debt relief was intended to free up vital resources for healthcare and education .
Poor countries , though , have been taking action to defend themselves .
In April the Liberian government announced a deal with its commercial creditors to pay off its vast commercial debt at a rate of three cents in the dollar .
The total cost of the buyback of $ 1.2bn in commercial debt was $ 38 m and was financed by the debt reduction facility of the World Bank , with contributions from the International Development Association , the US , Norway , Britain and Germany .
Almost all Liberia 's commercial creditors took part , meaning vulture funds have in effect been barred from taking action against the country in future .
( CNN ) -- Joaquin " El Chapo " Guzman Loera , a 54 - year - old drug cartel leader whose nickname means " Shorty , " is the most wanted man in Mexico .
He 's also one of the most wanted men in the United States .
Joaquin " El Chapo " Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel , which is battling for turf along the border .
For five years , the State Department has kept a $ 5 million bounty on his head , calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security .
Guzman , who leads the Sinaloa cartel , is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border .
He recently upped the stakes , ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors , according to the Los Angeles Times .
The cartel 's tentacles and those of its chief rival , the Gulf cartel , already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta , Georgia ; Chicago , Illinois ; Seattle , Washington ; St. Louis , Missouri ; and Charlotte , North Carolina , Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March .
" No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does , " said Arabit , who heads the DEA 's office in this year 's border hot spot , El Paso , Texas .
See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S .
A December 2008 report by the Justice Department 's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities .
So far , the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico , where the cartels ' running gunbattles with police , the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year .
It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007 .
Once again , drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year , Arabit said .
See who the key players are »
The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker - on - trafficker , DEA agents say .
But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire .
" It 's coming .
I guarantee , it 's coming , " said Michael Sanders , a DEA spokesman in Washington .
Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman 's shoot - to - kill instructions are n't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals ; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials , the Los Angeles Times reported , citing sources and intelligence memos .
The move is seen as dangerously brazen , the newspaper reported .
In the past , the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement .
U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border .
The Obama administration committed to spending an additional $ 700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border .
But $ 700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target .
Guzman , who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel , is said to be worth $ 1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade .

He made this year 's Forbes list of the richest of the rich , landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell 's Soup fortune .
Popular Mexican songs , called narcocorridos , embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader .
" Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico , " said security consultant Scott Stewart , invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993 .
Stewart , a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor , a Texas - based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman 's worth .
Just a decade ago , Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians , moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean .
But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe 's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels .
The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back .
Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits .
Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States , according to the DEA .
Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine .
Marijuana became the cartels ' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007 , bringing in $ 8.5 billion .
Cocaine came in second , at $ 3.9 billion , and methamphetamine earned $ 1 billion , a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year .
Watch how marijuana became the cartels ' top cash crop »
The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels , but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border , according to the DEA agents , local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN .
The cartels ' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa , Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence .
The status and alliances of the players continue to shift .
Although the DEA and some analysts disagree , others say the Zetas , a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police , are now running the Gulf cartel .
" From what we 've seen , the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel , " analyst Stewart said .
" In violent times , soldiers tend to rise to the top . "
These soldiers are incredibly well - armed , police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime " Hummer " Gonzalez Duran .
It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles , including AK - 47s ; 287 grenades ; two rocket launchers ; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition .
At the very least , the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table .
The DEA 's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate .
Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano , a former military man who is also known as " El Lazco , " or " The Executioner . "
The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border 's lucrative drug - trafficking corridors .
The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez , across the border from El Paso , Texas ; Sonora Nogales , across from Nogales , Arizona ; and Tijuana , across the border from San Diego , California .
Two years ago , the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo , across the border from Laredo , Texas .
It 's all about the highways that help move the drugs .
Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor , and Juarez has easy access to I - 10 , a major east - west interstate , and I - 25 , which runs north to Denver , Colorado .
Tijuana is also conveniently near I - 10 and I - 5 , which heads north all the way to the Canadian border .
Some of the battles are internal , Arabit said .
Some are with other cartels .
And some , he said , can be attributed to the cartels ' " desperate " attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon 's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers .
As soon as he took office in January 2007 , Calderon called out the cartels .
He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and , in some cases , do the job of local police .
Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office .
The violence involves beheadings , running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches .
Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight .
The cartels ' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets .
" The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq , " analyst Stewart said .
" It was simple machismo .
The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas . "
When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s , the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant , beneficiaries of their location .
Today , they are shadows of their former selves , weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders .
Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997 .
Known as " The King of the Skies " for his fleet of cocaine - carrying planes , he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance - altering procedures to avoid arrest .
Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery .
Two of them later were killed .
His death , along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen , set the stage for the ongoing turf battle .
When Cardenas was extradited in 2007 , Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez as well as Nogales .
Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston , Texas , where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros , Mexico .
Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano - Felix Organization in Tijuana , and last year , Guzman made a move on that plaza as well .
" Right now , they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar , " said the DEA 's Elizabeth Kempshall , who heads the agency 's office in Phoenix , Arizona .
Phoenix has become the nation 's kidnapping capital , largely because of the cartels ' increasing presence .
Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition : " That is the worst thing for any cartel leader , to face justice in the United States . "

Three wind turbines can make £ 15,000 a year for a village Households which contribute electricity to the National Grid are to receive payments under a new government scheme .
Communities will be encouraged to generate wind , water and solar power , and be paid for how much they produce .
Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband said the project would " help create the clean energy of the future " .
He denied reports the government 's energy strategy would cost each UK family £ 230 a year but admitted there would be " upward pressures " on prices .
Mr Miliband also told BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show an agreement at the G8 summit that global temperatures should not rise more than 2C above 1900 levels was " very significant " , because it meant governments will have to " put offers on the table to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions " .
' Feed - in tariffs '
The Sunday Mirror newspaper reported that plans to cut carbon dioxide emissions in the government 's Renewable Energy Strategy - due to be unveiled on Wednesday - would mean an average annual increase of £ 230 on household fuel bills .
Mr Miliband said he did not believe the figure was accurate , but acknowledged that " whatever route we go down " , prices were likely to rise .
Individuals and communities can both play their part in the kind of clean energy revolution that we need
Ed Miliband
He said the " high - carbon route " would mean a greater dependence on imports and exposure to price fluctuations , while the alternative " low carbon future " - which he said was " the right way to go " - would mean " mean some costs to transition " .
Mr Miliband added : " My job is to counter those effects as much as I possibly can - helping people with energy efficiency , and having tough regulation for example . "

Speaking earlier , Mr Miliband told the BBC that the plan to give payments to households for contibuting electricity to the National Grid from April 2010 will mean " we can harness people 's enthusiasm for getting involved " in tackling climate change .
He added : " Individuals and communities can both play their part in the kind of clean energy revolution that we need . "
At present , anyone in the UK who feeds electricity into the National Grid can get a reduction on their fuel bills through smart meters .
But ministers hope that the promise of cash in people 's pockets will encourage them to seek new ways of generating their own power .
Similar " clean energy cash back " schemes already operate in 19 European countries including Germany .
Critics warn that small - scale production is expensive and projects may require government subsidy .
In Germany , whole towns have grouped together to buy wind turbines , build biomass plants and erect solar panels on all private houses .
They are then paid a guaranteed fixed price for every kilowatt hour of energy they produce - a higher sum than for electricity made from fossil fuels in traditional power stations .
Three wind turbines can make £ 15,000 a year for a single village .
Since so - called " feed - in tariffs " were introduced in Germany , some 400,000 homes , particularly in the sunnier south of the country , have installed solar panels .
But the government has had to subsidise such projects in order to keep them viable .
At present , only about 2 % of Britain 's energy comes from renewable sources , but the government has pledged to increase that to 15 % within the next 12 years .
Mike Childs , campaigns director at Friends of the Earth , said such schemes could play a significant part in meeting the UK 's climate change targets .
" But the payments have to be generous enough to reward people for investing in green power , " he added .

10 % of Americans still believe Barack Obama is a Muslim .
And here is the fun bit : a new study suggests that attempts to correct that misperception only reinforce it .
Blogger Brendan Nyhan conducted the study with students from Duke .
His hypothesis : a negatively phrased correction ( " he is not a Muslim " ) would be less effective than a positive one ( " he is a Christian " ) .
But , hah , neither one was remotely effective at convincing participants that the President is a Christian .
Until they added ... a black person !
However , our hypothesis that the corrective affirmation would successfully reduce misperceptions was only supported when a non-white experimental administrator was present , suggesting a strong social desirability effect on the acceptance of corrective information .
In addition , three - way interactions between the corrective affirmation , race of administrator , and party identification suggest that social desirability effects were more prevalent among Republicans .
But when fellow typical white people tried to convince Republicans that Barack Obama is a Christian , it " caused a backfire effect in which GOP identifiers became more likely to believe Obama is Muslim and less likely to believe he was being honest about his religion . "
So , you know , cheers to The Washington Times and Fox .

Today I randomly ran across a two year old comment I left on Katya ’s Non-Profit Marketing Blog .
Katya Andresen ’s colleague Jono Smith had written a post arguing for nonprofit fundraisers to appeal to “ the heart , not the head ” when approaching donors .
Smith wrote : Feelings , not analytical thinking , drive donations .
According to a new study ( PDF link ) conducted by Deborah Small , a Wharton marketing professor , and colleagues George Loewenstein & Paul Slovic , if organizations want to raise money for a charitable cause , it is far better to appeal to the heart than to the head .
From Knowledge@Wharton
One pitch for charity described the needs of Rokia , a young girl in Africa who is desperately poor and faces starvation .
Another pitch talks about food shortages affecting more than three million children , many of whom are homeless .
Which pitch is more effective ?
Not surprisingly , it ’s the first .
That people would want to give money to identifiable victims like Rokia rather than unnamed famine victims may not seem all that surprising .
But Small and her colleagues , in a series of field experiments , delved deeper into the issue of sympathy and how it relates to charitable giving .
The researchers found that if people are presented with a personal case of an identifiable victim along with statistical data about similar victims caught up in a larger pattern of illness , hunger or neglect , overall donations actually decline .
In addition , they found that if people are told about the inconsistent levels of sympathy evoked by identifiable and statistical victims — the “ identifiable victim effect , ” in the words of the researchers — people reduce their giving to identifiable victims but do not increase their giving to statistical victims .
This study is also highlighted in the book I ’m reading right now titled “ Made to Stick : Why Some Ideas Survive and Some Die ” .
The book explains that when the analytical part of our brain is activated , even by unrelated math problems , our empathy / altruism declines .
Essentially the authors argue that the analytical part of the brain is separate from the emotional part of the brain and when analytics are activated the intensity of our emotional reactions decline .
But this does n’t mean that money is best raised by offering donors empty emotional calls to action !
The authors of Made to Stick are focused on what makes ideas have an impact on people and stay with them ( from urban legends to Jared the Subway Diet Guy to The Girl Effect Video ) .
Their point is not that people are best manipulated by emotions , it is that humans are better at absorbing and preserving certain types of information better than others .
One of the best ways that humans process information is when it is presented in a story format .
Good stories offer compelling evidence for their underlying truth .
But not by bombarding the listener with statistics .
Instead good stories use narrative to build a convincing case .
This idea is often summed up in the philanthropy world as “ No Stories Without Numbers and No Numbers Without Stories ” ( I ’ve said this myself in the past ) .
But I think this is actually wrong .
Numbers are not the key .
In fact the evidence suggests numbers may be the wrong way to go in this case .
I think instead it is No Stories Without Truth and No Truth Without Stories .
The reason the Rokia Study bothers some people is it seems to imply that we should just feed donors tear jerker stories to get them to open their wallet .
Instead , I think the message is that when you are trying to convince someone of the importance of a philanthropic effort , you should figure out how to present the truthful core of your message in a story format .
It is only authentic stories that hold real truths about the world that “ stick ” over time .
These kinds of stories are like wonderful , filling meals compared to the artificially flavored “ candy ” of the tear jerker that is just meant to extract money from donors .
Bloggers are gaining power all over the world ; they have created their own communities and are excelling in different social media and networking media channels that in turn allow them to reach more and more people .
This gain of status made bloggers a target for PR people to help promote different products / services / ideas .
A recent survey by PR agency Text 100 claimed that the majority of bloggers prefer to be treated as influencers rather than as journalists .
While I do n’t see the contradiction here – one does n’t negate the other – I do understand why bloggers favor the influencing label .
It implies power and spare them the hectic and liability that comes for being a journalist .
But , I can also see why journalists as well aspire to becoming influencers .
It is a privilege to be able to affect people in a way or another .
But who is really a blogger and who is a journalist ?
More journalists are having blogs of their own , and more bloggers – through their blogs – end up working as journalists for established newspapers / magazines .
There are also people like Danny Sullivan , who is a self identified journalist who uses his blog as his publishing platform .
Is it about publishing platforms ?
or about the way of writing and level of credibility ?
We all know that journalism is a tough job .
It is about trying to get it right every single time .
There is a level of liability that defines being a journalist which is much higher than the one set for an average blogger .
After all , a journalist usually represents , besides himself , an entire organization which has a unique image , policy and character to uphold !
That brings us to the question of : Being an influencing voice , how ethical it is for a blogger to get paid in order to post information ?
Some bloggers seek out some financial gain out of their own blogs , others need the money in order to support their blogging , but is this justified ?
Should every blogger mention clearly to his readers that he is getting paid to post specific information ?
One aspect of blogging that people relate to the most is the personal and emotional take on things .
It may not match the credibility of journalism , but it does catch our attention and stir our emotions .
Yet , there are many things that blogger can learn from journalists in order to raise the level of their blog credibility and improve their blogging skills .
I like what Andrew Lih , an editor / administrator at Wikipedia , said about journalism : “ To the prospective journalist : there is no better place to start researching a story than Wikipedia , and probably no worse place to stop and use as a final word . ” – although Google seems to disagree .
Whether it is a joke , a fabricated story , a fairy tail , or a comprehensive coverage of a story , people like what they like .
They want variety , and many opinions to pick which one makes the most sense .
Social media and blog comments all allow readers to say their opinions aloud .
So , if an article is pure rubbish , people will end up giving corrections , or mocking the writer / blog .
So , does it really matter if you identify yourself to be a journalist or an influencer ?
Or maybe just a blogger with no other tags ?
What do you think ?

A Russian woman has set a new world record , lifting a 14 - kg. glass ball with her vagina muscles .
Tatiata Kozhevnikova of Novosibirsk , aged 42 , has been exercising her intimate muscles for fifteen years , and has already made her entrance into the Guinness Book of Records as the possessor of the world ’s strongest vagina , she proudly told Life.ru .
“ After I had a child , my intimate muscles got unbelievably weak .
I read books on Dao and learned that ancient women used to deal with this problem using wooden balls , ” she said .
“ I looked around , saw a Murano glass ball and inserted it in my vagina .
It took me ages to get it out ! ”
The embarrassing first experience did not scare Tatiana off .
She developed quite a taste for vagina fitness , and now she has her exercising balls custom - made .
“ You insert one of the balls in your vagina , and it has a string attached to it with a little hook at the very end .
You fix a second ball onto this hook . ”
The Russian recommends vaginal exercises to all women who want to improve their sex life .
“ It ’s enough to exercise your vagina five minutes a day , ladies , and in just one week you ’ll be able to give yourself and your man unforgettable pleasure in bed , ” she says .
" It appears to be a warning about the world coming to an end when the calendar does .
For the ancient Maya , reaching the end of a cycle was a momentous event , so we are taking this crop circle very seriously as an indicator of a possibly huge event in 2012 . "
During what was supposed to be a three - hour tour , the S.S. Minnow is shipwrecked on an uncharted tropical island following a typhoon .
The seven castaways include the blustery captain , his bumbling first mate Gilligan , a millionaire couple named the Howells , curvaceous movie star Ginger Grant , sexy farm girl Mary Ann Summers , and a science professor known as the Professor .
Despite their dire situation , they managed to survive on a diet made up of fish and coconut cream pie , and were aided by their trusty transistor radio and a seemingly never - ending parade of guest stars who managed to drop by their " deserted " island ( including a big game hunter , a movie producer , a mad scientist , a rock band , Russian cosmonauts , foreign spies , and a jungle boy ) , yet never managed to bring them to safety .

Fearing a new , more formidable opponent than the often buffoonish and macho cowboy George W. Bush , the two leaders of al Qaeda have tag teamed Barack Obama with twin audiotapes condemning him .
Unlike Bush–who made little effort to understand the Islamic world and whom al Qaeda could easily bait into reckless acts that raised its stature among Muslims –Obama is more thoughtful and empathetic to Muslims and consulted many experts , including scholars on the Islamic world and actual Muslims , before delivering his much - promoted speech on U.S. - Islamic relations in Cairo , Egypt .
The twin audiotapes indicate that Osama bin Laden and his sidekick , Ayman al - Zawahiri , are worried about Obama .
Instead of blundering into talk of spreading democracy in the lands of “ evil - doers ” through “ crusades ” as Bush did , Obama , being the son and grandson of Muslims and growing up in Islamic Indonesia , gets the benefit of the doubt , at least initially , from many Muslims .
Unfortunately , I do n’t think bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri need be as worried as they appear to be .
In the Islamic world , talk is cheap and actions do matter .
Although Obama presents a more reasonable , less scary , and more empathetic image towards Muslims , the actual policy disagreements between the Bush and Obama administrations have been overstated .
In any presidential campaign , to win votes , Democrats and Republicans magnify their differences in approach .
Al Qaeda successfully baited George W. Bush into overreacting to the 9/11 attacks–a typical ploy by guerrillas and terrorists vis -Ã - vis a more powerful enemy to win more money and support within their own communities .
George W. Bush not only launched a very public “ war on terror ” centered in Afghanistan–instead of using more effective and lower - profile intelligence , law enforcement , and occasional secret Special Forces activities –he also invaded and occupied another unrelated Muslim country .
The bonus of a U.S. occupation of Iraq must have made bin Laden and al - Zawahri ecstatic .
Given his more sober inclinations , Obama , in the same situation as Bush after 9/11 , might very well have avoided this trap .
Yet , Obama ’s problem is that he inherited the twin occupations from Bush and is attempting , as many operatives in Washington do , to spin his way out of the difficulty using a public relations campaign .
And obviously , Obama is a much more skilled P.R. man than Bush was .
Yet , feeling Muslims ’ pain rhetorically does nothing about the primary reasons for radical Islamist militancy and terrorism toward the United States –U.S. ( that is , non-Muslim ) occupation of and meddling in Islamic lands .
Bin Laden originally went to war against the United States for this reason and mentions it yet again in his most recent threatening audiotape :
“ Obama has followed the footsteps of his predecessor in increasing animosity toward Muslims and increasing enemy fighters and establishing long - term wars .
So the American people should get ready to reap the fruits of what the leaders of the White House have planted throughout the coming years and decades . ”
Obama has pledged to fulfill the Bush administration ’s agreement with Iraq that the United States will withdraw all U.S. forces from there by the end of 2011 .
However , because the United States has had difficulty leaving the Persian Gulf , Korean peninsula , and Europe after conflict or Cold War ended , the Islamic world cannot be blamed for taking a “ seeing is believing ” attitude toward this promise .
In addition , instead of winding down Bush ’s nation - building quagmire in Afghanistan and focusing on neutralizing al Qaeda , Obama is escalating this un-winnable war .
The war in Afghanistan has already fueled dangerous Islamist militancy in Pakistan and had helped al Qaeda find more recruits .
Unfortunately , Obama is not the only person in the United States who fails to understand this key cause of anti-U.S. terrorism originating from the Islamic world .
The foreign policy establishment –both Democratic and Republican elements –believes that the United States must solve all of the Islamic / Arab world ’s problems to turn things around there .
For example , the establishment New York Times , in a news article on Obama ’s Cairo speech , pontificated :
For Mr. Obama to win favor , . . . he needs to address the challenges facing the Arab world , from poverty and inadequate education systems to limits on democracy and human rights .
That is exactly wrong and a complete misunderstanding of the roots of the basic problem .
The imperial mentality of solving all such problems got the United States into its current riff with the Islamic world .
To get rid of this dangerous source of friction , the United States should just stop meddling in that part of the world .
David Bain has been found not guilty on all five counts of murder and is free to go home .
The jury in New Zealand 's most sensational trial has found David Bain not guilty of murdering his family 15 years ago after five hours and 50 minutes of deliberations .
Outside court an emotional David Bain thanked his supporters , particularly Joe Karam .
" Without Joe and his solid strength ... I would n't have made it through this far , " Bain said .
" Joe 's been there through everything for me " .
The seven women and five men returned to the High Court in Christchurch about 4.45 pm and delivered the not guilty verdict on all five murder charges .
Cheering from the gallery greeted the verdict .
Karam said the truth had , " finally fallen where it has always been " .
He went on to blame " various authorities " for allowing the case to drag on so many years .
The trial would go down as the “ criminal trial of New Zealand ’s history ” , Karam said .
VICTORY : David Bain and Joe Karam outside court after today 's not guilty verdicts
“ What has really mattered is the truth - as I said 13 years ago [ and it ] has finally fallen where it has always been .
“ Unfortunately due to the attitude by various authorities that has caused this thing to last to 2009 and put this poor man here , what he ’s been through … ”
Karam said Bain had been an “ innocent man beaten down by a while lot of myths and legends . ”
“ There ’s nothing more than smoke with no fire . ”
Michael Reed QC thanked David .
“ He is totally overcome .
Freedom is not there yet , it has not dawned on him . ”
He said the trial never should have gone ahead .
“ Millions have been spent … it is quite a tragedy really . ”
He said without doubt David should apply for compensation , but “ that ’s something in the future . ”
Inside the court , the jury forewoman read out the not guilty verdicts for each of Bain 's family members .
Each verdict was greeted with cheers and applause .
Bain met the verdicts calmly , smiling broadly at his supporters .
He then went straight into a room , where he was described as being very emotional .
Karam mouthed a thank you , as did Michael Reed QC Bain 's lawyer .
As the judge left the room , further clapping broke out and more cheering and laughter could be heard .
Bain , 37 , who had been charged with shooting his parents Robin , 58 , Margaret , 50 , and his three siblings Arawa , 19 , Laniet , 18 and Stephen , 14 , on 20 June , 1994 , heard the verdict from the dock after a 13 week retrial .
His convictions for the murders after a four week trial in Dunedin in 1995 were overturned by the Privy Council in May , 2007 , and a new trial was ordered .
He was about 13 years into a 16 - year non-parole sentence when the convictions were quashed .
He has been on bail since May , 2007 after being in custody since June 24 , 1994 .
The trial has captured the public imagination like no other trial in New Zealand 's history .
Television coverage of the verdict today matched the media flurry attracted by President Clinton 's visit in 1999 .
About 50 media personnel were at the High Court to cover the verdict which was a mass of cameras , high profile journalists and support staff .
The trial has presented a classic whodunnit and implied much more serious questions about the police and the New Zealand justice system .

How do Python generators differ from Lua coroutines ?
The most important feature is that in Lua , coroutine.yield ( ) is an ordinary function which can be invoked anywhere in the dynamic extent of a coroutine .
resume ( ) with the limitation that you cannot yield through a C callback ( unless you use MikePall 's [ Coco ] library . )
In Python , yield is syntactic , and can only be in the lexical body of the generator function .
This means that Python generators must be written as generators , and cannot easily be factored into smaller functions ; nor can they easily be recursive .
You can achieve recursion by a form of chaining ; a message on the [ Python mailing list ] describes both the mechanism :
! Python def inorder (t ) : if t : for x in inorder ( t.left ) : yield x yield t.label for x in inorder ( t.right ) : yield x
In Lua , one might write a more agnostic inorder function as a higher - order function :
function inorder(f , t ) if t then inorder ( f , t.left ) f( t.label ) return inorder ( f , t.right ) end end
The Lua function could then be used either as the iterator in a for loop :
for label in coroutine . wrap ( inorder ) , coroutine . yield , t do end
or as a sort of foreach function :
inorder ( print , t )
In an attempt to reduce the comparison of recursive generators to its minimum , I wrote a pair of simple programs which generate the infinite [ Ruler function ] .
( A more interesting page about this function is Michael Naylor 's [ Abacaba - Dabacaba ] which includes a musical exploration . )
The ruler function can be generated non-recursively , but in this example it 's standing in for something like a depth - first search , so we 'll just look at the recursive implementation .
The programs generate the first 2^k values in the sequence and add them up as a sort of validity test , since it 's easy to show that the sum of the first 2^k elements of the ruler function is 2 ^ ( k+1 ) - 1 .
Python 's built - in functions and standard library were handy here ; in Lua , I had to implement the sum and islice ( first k elements of a sequence ) functions myself , but fortunately that 's not difficult .
So here 's the Lua implementation :
function ruler ( put , k ) for i = 1 , k do put ( i ) ruler ( put , i - 1 ) end end function eachruler ( ) return coroutine .
wrap ( function ( ) return ruler ( coroutine .
yield , 100 ) end ) end function sumseq ( k , f , o , s ) local sum = 0 for v in f , o , s do k , sum = k - 1 , sum + v if k <= 0 then break end end return sum end local howmany = tonumber ( arg [ 1 ] ) or 24 local now = os.clock ( ) local sum = sumseq ( 2^howmany , eachruler ( ) ) local took = os.clock ( ) - now print (( " % 2i : %7.3 f seconds %i check % i " ) : format ( howmany , took , sum , 2 ^ ( howmany + 1 ) - 1 ) )
and the very similar and somewhat shorter Python implementation :
! Python from itertools import islice from sys import argv from time import clock def ruler ( k ) : for i in range ( 1 , k+1 ) : yield i for x in ruler ( i - 1 ) : yield x howmany = int ( argv [ 1 ] ) now = clock ( ) total = sum( islice ( ruler ( 100 ) , 2** howmany ) ) took = clock ( ) - now print " %2d : % 7.3 f seconds %d check %d " % ( howmany , took , total , 2**( howmany + 1 ) - 1 )
The slightly odd formulation of the recursion is the result of manually changing the tailcall into a for loop , because Python does n't do tailcalls , and the original tailcall implementation put Python at even more of a disadvantage .
Since both programs passed the check , I 'll only paste the comparative timings here ( in seconds as reported above ) .
I do n't believe this is simply a " Lua is faster than Python " benchmark ; I think it shows that coroutines are inherently faster ; the main difference is not having to pass the values up through a chain of yields .

This illustration shows the configuration of a new digital memory storage device consisting of an iron nanoparticle shuttle that moves through a carbon nanotube when a voltage is applied .
This memory device can pack a trillion bits of data into one square inch of medium and retain that data for a billion years .
( Image from the American Chemical Society )
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Berkeley Lab researchers have created a unique ultra- high density memory storage medium that can preserve digital data for a billion years .
When it comes to data storage , density and durability have always moved in opposite directions - the greater the density the shorter the durability .
For example , information carved in stone is not dense but can last thousands of years , whereas today 's silicon memory chips can hold their information for only a few decades .
Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) and the University of California ( UC ) Berkeley have smashed this tradition with a new memory storage medium that can pack thousands of times more data into one square inch of space than conventional chips and retain this data for more than a billion years !
" We 've developed a new mechanism for digital memory storage that consists of a crystalline iron nanoparticle shuttle enclosed within the hollow of a multiwalled carbon nanotube , " said physicist Alex Zettl who led this research .
" Through this combination of nanomaterials and interactions , we 've created a memory device that features both ultra- high density and ultra-long lifetimes , and that can be written to and read from using the conventional voltages already available in digital electronics . "
Zettl , one of the world 's foremost researchers into nanoscale systems and devices , holds joint appointments with Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division ( MSD ) and the Physics Department at UC Berkeley , where he is the director of the Center of Integrated Nanomechanical Systems .
He is the principal author of a paper that has been published on - line by Nano Letters entitled : " Nanoscale Reversible Mass Transport for Archival Memory . "
Co-authoring the paper with Zettl were Gavi Begtrup , Will Gannett and Tom Yuzvinsky , all members of his research group , plus Vincent Crespi , a theorist at Penn State University .

The ever - growing demand for digital storage of videos , images , music and text calls for storage media that pack increasingly more data onto chips that keep shrinking in size .
However , this demand runs in sharp contrast to the history of data storage .
Compare the stone carvings in the Egyptian temple of Karnak , which store approximately two bits of data per square inch but can still be read after nearly 4,000 years , to a modern DVD which can store 100 giga ( billion ) bits of data per square inch but will probably remain readable for no more than 30 years .
" Interestingly , " said Zettl , " the Domesday Book , the great survey of England commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086 and written on vellum , has survived over 900 years , while the 1986 BBC Domesday Project , a multimedia survey marking the 900th anniversary of the original Book , required migration from the original high - density laserdiscs within two decades because of media failure . "
Zettl and his collaborators were able to buck data storage history by creating a programmable memory system that is based on a moveable part - an iron nanoparticle , approximately 1/50,000th the width of a human hair , that in the presence of a low voltage electrical current can be shuttled back and forth inside a hollow carbon nanotube with remarkable precision .
The shuttle 's position inside the tube can be read out directly via a simple measurement of electrical resistance , allowing the shuttle to function as a nonvolatile memory element with potentially hundreds of binary memory states .
" The shuttle memory has application for archival data storage with information density as high as one trillion bits per square inch and thermodynamic stability in excess of one billion years , " Zettl said .
" Furthermore , as the system is naturally hermetically sealed , it provides its own protection against environmental contamination . "

The low voltage electrical write / read capabilities of the memory element in this electromechanical device
facilitates large - scale integration and should make for easy incorporation into today 's silicon processing systems .
Zettl believes the technology could be on the market within the next two years and its impact should be significant .
" Although truly archival storage is a global property of an entire memory system , the first requirement is that the underlying mechanism of information storage for individual bits must exhibit a persistence time much longer than the envisioned lifetime of the resulting device , " he said .
" A single bit lifetime in excess of a billion years demonstrates that our system has the potential to store information reliably for any practical desired archival time scale . "
The multiwalled carbon nanotube and enclosed iron nanoparticle shuttle were synthesized in a single step via pyrolysis of ferrocene in argon gas at a temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius .
The nanotube memory elements were then ultrasonically dispersed in isopropanol and deposited on a substrate .
A transmission electron microscope provided high - resolution imaging in real time while the memory device was in operation .
In laboratory tests , this device met all the essential requirements for digital memory storage including the ability to overwrite old data .
" We believe our nanoscale electromechanical memory system
presents a new solution to the challenge of ultra- high density archival data storage , " Zettl said .

Forty years ago today , two men walked on the moon .
To celebrate that moment of transcendent ambition and triumph , the world is looking back to July 20 , 1969 : NASA has released restored video footage of the Apollo 11 landing , and a new NASA moon orbiter has taken snapshots of the Apollo landing site , where left - behind gear still sits on the lunar surface .
But for some space buffs , the anniversary has a touch of melancholy to it .
For all the promised " giant leap for mankind " the mission foretold , the prophesied future of moon bases and journeys to Mars , Jupiter and beyond is still science fiction .
The last of six moon landings , bringing two men each time to the lunar surface , was in 1972 .
Since then , no one has left low Earth orbit .
For many advocates , there is a consensus that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is suffering from what President Obama this March called " a sense of drift " [ Washington Post ] .
The Obama administration ordered a review of NASA 's manned spaceflight program , and the panel is expected to return recommendations by the end of August .
NASA officials say they hope those recommendations will support sending humans back to the moon by 2020 , a goal the agency has been preparing for .
NASA official John Olson says the new missions would n't be just a repeat of Apollo ; instead , they would involve
astronauts living on the Moon for months at a time , driving hundreds of miles across the lunar surface and , for the first time , building an outpost on ground that is not Earth .
“ It ’s not just flags and footsteps ” [ The New York Times ] ,
Olson says .
Astronauts could scout for ice buried beneath the regolith in deeply shadowed polar craters , he notes , and could build a telescope on the far side of the moon .
They could even take lunar road trips in an R.V. - sized rover that Olson calls a " ‘ Luna - bago . "
While some wonder if hard economic times will put an end to such far - reaching plans , others believe NASA 's current schemes are n't challenging enough .
Buzz Aldrin , who stepped on to the moon 's surface only minutes after Neil Armstrong , has publicly called for scrapping future moon missions , and shifting focus to a manned trip to Mars .
Yesterday , at a rare reunion of the Apollo 11 crew , both Aldrin and his crew mate Michael Collins pressed that point .
Said Aldrin :
" The best way to honour and remember all those who were part of the Apollo programme is to follow in our footsteps ; to boldly go again on a new mission of exploration . "
Mr Collins , who circled the Moon alone while Mr Armstrong and Mr Aldrin walked on it , said Mars was more interesting than the Moon .
" Sometimes I think I flew to the wrong place .
Mars was always my favourite as a kid and it still is today " [ BBC News ] .

The tobacco bill signed into law by President Obama on June 22 is a compromise that acknowledges a few hard political facts :
More than 43 million Americans remain addicted to the nicotine in tobacco ( indeed , 70 % of smokers say they wish they could quit , and 40 % try yearly ) .
Taxes on the sale of tobacco products are a major source of revenue for states .
Even without adding tobacco to its regulatory portfolio , the Food and Drug Administration is straining to carry out its other responsibilities , including the safety of the nation ’s food , drugs and medical devices .
The law stipulates that the FDA ’s regulation will be underwritten by user fees levied on the tobacco companies .

Finally , regulating tobacco is a pretty tricky job for an agency given the task of protecting the nation ’s health .
Tobacco is simply not like the drugs , medical devices and foods the FDA regulates :
There are no demonstrable health benefits to tobacco against which the FDA can weigh the risks that go along with its use .
In fact , some in Congress argued the FDA has no place in trying to merely limit the damage caused by a product that causes only addiction and harm .
By giving its blessing to the sale of some tobacco products and denying others , they argue , the FDA may lead consumers ( perhaps those who have n’t had contact with the outside world for the last 44 years ) to think those products are safe .
Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the author and champion of the FDA - tobacco bill , acknowledges that this is an unusual role for the FDA .
But short of tobacco prohibition -- which , he says , “ is n’t going to work ” -- the FDA is the only agency equipped to limit and reduce the damage that tobacco use does to the nation ’s health , and stem the recruitment of new smokers among the nation ’s youth .
“ The FDA is the exact agency that should have that authority -- it ’s a scientific organization with regulatory powers , ” Waxman said in an interview .
Advertisement
Here are some of the bill ’s principal provisions , and the FDA ’s plans for carrying out its new mandate .
What are the FDA ’s orders ?
The newly signed law grants the FDA broad authority to require changes in tobacco products currently on the market and those proposed for future sale “ appropriate for the protection of the public ’s health . ”
That broad mandate would allow the FDA to reduce or remove from tobacco products ingredients , additives or constituents that it considers harmful .
Some of the items likely to come under scrutiny -- such as ammonia and formaldehyde -- are probably unfamiliar ingredients to many consumers .
But the list also will include flavorings .
Chocolate and cherry , which enhance the appeal of tobacco to young people , are banned by the new law .
Though menthol is not automatically banned , the FDA ’s new jurisdiction would allow it , if it chose , to place limits on or even ban this flavoring , which is favored by 27 % of all smokers and three - quarters of African American smokers .
The law gives the FDA responsibility for the pre-market approval of new tobacco products , which are defined as any tobacco product that has been introduced on the U.S. market since June 1 , 2003 , or are proposed for marketing here in the future .
Companies sponsoring such products will have to submit to the FDA studies detailing their health effects .
And the Secretary of Health and Human Services can , on the FDA ’s recommendation , deny approval if the sponsoring company fails to show that the marketing of their product “ would be appropriate for the protection of the public health . ”

In short , new cigarettes , cigars or chewed or eaten tobacco products are unlikely to enter the market -- and several current products are likely to be pulled -- if it ca n’t be shown they reduce dependence or limit the harm of tobacco use .
Significantly , that assessment can consider a product ’s ability to reduce harm to those who do not currently use tobacco products -- the bystanders who are affected , for instance , by secondhand smoke .
That may open the way for some so - called bridge products , including smoke - free cigarettes or edible nicotine disks , to enter the market .
What are the limits of the FDA ’s authority ?
The law prohibits the FDA from banning outright all tobacco products or any class of tobacco products -- such as cigarettes , cigars or chew .
The agency may require the reduction of nicotine , tobacco ’s most potently addictive ingredient , but is not permitted to require the chemical ’s total elimination .
Experts agree there are nicotine levels greater than zero that are not addictive but may provide some of the chemical ’s pleasurable and energizing effects .
But plunging more than 45 million Americans into nicotine withdrawal with the stroke of a pen was not considered a viable option .
What limits can the FDA place on tobacco advertising ?
The law gives the FDA broad authority to restrict marketing and promotion “ to the fullest extent permissible ” under the 1st Amendment -- a limit that is certain to be tested in future court cases .
Advertisement
The law gives the FDA specific permission to implement a spate of regulations it had set out in 1996 , when the agency first asserted its right to regulate tobacco products .
Those early rules -- and now the tobacco law -- were very specific about some of the restrictions the agency can impose .
Among those rules was a requirement that all advertising of tobacco products be in stark black - and - white only when it appears outdoors , in and around stores where tobacco is sold , or in publications with significant teen readership .
The content of the advertising messages for tobacco products is also subject to strict FDA regulation under the new law .
Advertisements and packaging touting cigarettes as “ light , ” “ mild ” or “ low ” are banned , unless the manufacturer can prove that the product -- as it is actually smoked or consumed by users -- will significantly reduce the risk of tobacco - related diseases .
How can the FDA regulate the sale or marketing of tobacco to kids beyond the age restrictions on purchase of tobacco products that are already in place ?
The FDA can limit the advertising of tobacco products anywhere it believes that children and teens are the intended or the unintended audience for their pitches .
The FDA ’s 1996 rule banned all outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds , outlawed all remaining tobacco brands ’ sponsorship of sports or entertainment events , and ended any giveaways of goodies with the purchase of a tobacco product .
All of these were marketing practices thought to appeal specifically to young people .
Advertisement
As for selling tobacco to minors , that would now be a federal offense , enforced directly by federal authorities instead of states .
Does the FDA have other powers to influence tobacco use ?
Yes , it has two .
First , the law leaves to the FDA the decision of what future tobacco packaging will look like -- whether cigarette packages , for instance , will be required to carry warning labels in the form of bold language or graphic images depicting the health risks of smoking .
That authority is likely to set up a debate among anti-smoking activists and health experts about the effectiveness of messages that scare or horrify in helping smokers quit .
Another of the FDA ’s most intriguing new powers is the right to demand of tobacco companies details of research they have conducted on the contents and health effects of existing and future products -- and , potentially , to release those findings to the public .
That is likely to bring American consumers further details about the estimated 60 carcinogens and 4,000 toxic substances found in tobacco products or created when they ’re smoked .

It is also likely to bring to light tobacco - sponsored marketing and scientific research on smokers ’ motivations and behavior , and their propensity to addiction , and what ingredients or advertising messages can enhance that propensity .

Roof Jumping Dumbasses
Leg Shattering Roof Jump into Pool
Whatever you do , do n’t run over and get dude out of the pool !
I love how everyone just stands there while this jerkoff is laying in the water with broken legs and stuff .
I understand the point of making sure to get the video footage , but damn , do n’t let the poor bastard drown !
Invisible Pool Jump from Roof . Wait …
What ?
Man , the trouble some people go through for 14 seconds of e-fame .
Remember that 80 ’s anti-drug commercial , maybe it was the 90’s .
I forget .
But it show some strung out girl about to jump into a pool .
But , * GASP * there was no water in the pool ?
Well this mofo must have been on some serious shit , probably just drunk as hell though .
What makes this especially funny , is that he goes all out and pulls some sort of cannonball dive to make sure he lands directly on his kneecaps !
Backyard Wrestling at it ’s Failest
There is just some special about videos with skulls bouncing off of concrete .
Hey buddy , how could you miss so miserably ?
I guess maybe he ’s had his head dribbled on cement a few times before , rendering his depth perception a little wonky .
When Jon Erlandson and his wife , Madonna Moss , were talking about how many children they should have 20 years ago , the exploding world population was front and center in their thinking .
The two anthropologists , now both University of Oregon professors , were teenagers when Paul Ehrlich 's " The Population Bomb " became a non-fiction best - seller .
In the three decades between their birth and their baby - making decision , the world 's population nearly doubled , picking up more than 2 billion people .
So the couple chose to have one child , Erik , who 's now 18 .
But in the two decades since , Erlandson says , the population issue " has kind of dropped off the map . "
" This used to be a big deal ; people used to talk about it a lot , " said Erlandson , whose work includes studying the effects of ancient people on marine systems .
" Now it 's not part of any regular dialogue about the environmental problems humans face . "
Erlandson is one of 160 scientists and thinkers who 've signed up for a " global population speakout " this month .
It 's the brainchild of John Feeney , a Colorado environmental writer who immersed himself in population issues while fighting a residential subdivision .
The participants say it 's time to talk population again .
They 're worried we wo n't make adequate progress on the most crucial environmental goals -- reducing carbon emissions , preventing overfishing and decreasing deforestation , among them -- unless we tackle growth and its ever increasing demands on the planet .
But talking population brings up issues that can offend both sides of the political spectrum .
Abortion .
Immigration control .
The effects on economic growth of cutting population growth .
Race .
The Catholic Church 's opposition to contraceptives .
Human rights .
CONSUMING MAN
The world 's population continues to grow , straining resources .
The United States ' consumption is generally much higher than elsewhere in the world .
Annual levels , per person , for the United States and others :
• CO2 emissions : U.S. 2,789 , World 679
• Coffee , pounds : 9 , 2
• Fish , pounds : 47 , 36
• Electricity , kilowatt hours : 13,636 , 2,596
• Televisions : 0.88 , 0.28
• Beef , pounds : 90 , 20
• Paper , pounds : 655 , 120
• Gasoline , gallons : 432 , 46
• Beer , gallons : 22 , 21
• McDonald's : 0.43 , 0.1
• Passenger cars , per 1,000 people : 474 , 100
The number of kids you have .
" That 's a very personal choice , and I do n't think it 's something the government should be dictating , " said Erlandson , who directs the university 's Museum of Natural and Cultural History .
" But I do think it should be part of the dialogue .
You can reduce your carbon footprint per person , yet if the population keeps growing you 're making no progress . "
Oregon has seen that dynamic at work .
From 1990 to 2004 , the state succeeded in slightly reducing its per person carbon emissions , for example .
But the overall level still rose -- by 22 percent -- the state says , thanks to 700,000 new residents .
Recycling rates have risen most years since 1992 .
But the amount of trash landfilled has still mostly gone up , despite state mandates to reduce it , with population growth and increased consumption to blame .
And the Metro area has become a national leader on containing sprawl .
But the expansion area from which Metro plans to pick future urban development -- to accommodate an expected doubling of the area 's population by 2060 -- includes some of the state 's best farmland and stretches to Sandy to the east , Molalla to the south and nearly to Newberg on the west side .
Population activists have more than just intractable controversies to fight .
There 's some self - inflicted damage : Ehrlich 's famous book was famously wrong in predicting mass starvation by the 1980s .
Affluent countries have seen fertility rates drop .
Agricultural yields and energy efficiency -- along with the standard of living in many countries -- have risen even as population has grown , allowing the planet to absorb more people than doomsayers predicted .
Technologies such as carbon sequestration and water desalination could help stave off future crises .
Then again , the United Nations ' latest medium - range prediction has the world 's population growing to 9.2 billion in 2050 , a spike of about 7 billion people in 100 years .
The Global Footprint Network , which calculates the effect humans have on the environment and translates it to acres of land and water , estimates it would take more than two Earths to support human needs for food , raw materials and energy by 2050 if the U.N. projections are right .
The group figures the human population is already above Earth 's sustainable limit -- the threshold at which humans can use resources without depleting the environment .
" We know we 're not succeeding at that , " said Feeney , the Colorado author and father of two teenagers .
" We are damaging our habitat , whether it 's climate change , deforestation , species extinction or toxic pollution . "
The U.N. projects the U.S. population will grow from about 306 million today to more than 400 million by 2050 , driven largely by immigration .
Metro , the Portland area 's regional government , predicts the population of Portland and surrounding areas , including Clark County , will about double by 2060 , from about 2 million people to 4 million .
Growth in Oregon and the rest of the relatively affluent United States packs a double whammy , said Richard York , a researcher and sociology professor at the University of Oregon who 's also participating in the population speakout .
That 's because increasing affluence , while reducing fertility rates , greatly increases consumption of resources and environmental damage , York says .
But like most other population activists , York and Erlandson steer clear of coercive population policies .
That includes China 's one - child policy , which officially restricts to one the number of children married urban couples can have .
Plenty of population solutions have potentially wide appeal , they say , including improving women 's rights and access to education , improving health care , reducing infant mortality and increasing access to safe and effective birth control .
Also key , Erlandson said : Public -- and private -- discussion .
" My wife and I made a conscious choice about what the size of our family was going to be , " he said , adding that they do n't judge the neighbors and friends who chose differently .
" Everybody 's got to make their own choice . "

Advocates for legalizing marijuana have released a new television advertisement calling for the drug to be decriminalized and taxed to help solve California ’s budget crunch .
But the controversial topic of pot and taxes has proven too hot for several broadcast affiliates to handle , according to the Marijuana Policy Project , the national pro-pot group that is sponsoring the ad campaign .
KTLA -TV Channel 5 and KABC -TV Channel 7 in Los Angeles were among stations citing concerns about the ad ’s content and refusing to put it on the air , said Bruce Mirken , a spokesman for the marijuana advocacy group .
Calls to KTLA and KABC seeking comment were not immediately returned .
Advertisement
The advertisement features what the group calls “ an actual California marijuana consumer , ” Nadene Herndon of Fair Oaks in suburban Sacramento County .
Herndon is shown alone on camera talking about proposed budget cuts to schools , police and state parks , then suggests that Sacramento politicians “ are ignoring millions of Californians who want to pay taxes .
We ’re marijuana consumers . ”
Despite the rejections by some stations , Mirken estimates that the ad will run about 200 times in the next week or so .
Attitudes toward recreational marijuana use have been softening in the decade since California voters approved pot for medical use , according to the advocacy group .
Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) this year introduced a bill that would essentially put marijuana in the same regulatory framework as alcohol .
It has yet to be reviewed by the Legislature .

The recording industry has spent ( and continues to spend ) millions of dollars on its litigation campaign against accused file - swappers , but if two lawyers have their way , the RIAA will have to pay all the money back .
Not content simply to defend Jammie Thomas - Rasset in her high - profile retrial next week in Minnesota , lawyer Kiwi Camara is joining forces with Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson to file a class - action lawsuit against the recording industry later this summer .
The goal is nothing less than to force the industry to pay back the alleged " $ 100 + million " it has collected over the last few years .
Perhaps the RIAA had good reason not to send those settlement letters to Harvard for so long .
Stopping the lawsuits
Ars spoke with Camara on Tuesday as he rode to the airport for the flight to Minneapolis , where he will defend Jammie Thomas - Rasset after only two weeks of preparation .
But the time crunch has in no way restricted his vision ; Camara says that he is intent on dismantling the entire RIAA litigation campaign by going after its legal underpinnings .
Camara 's firm does n't do easy cases , and even in pro bono cases , " we want to fix a problem for a lot of people , including our client . "
That means doing more than getting Thomas - Rasset off without a guilty verdict , and it's why Camara has already gone after the two fundamental pieces of RIAA evidence in these cases .
First up was the evidence from hired investigator MediaSentry , which tracked down IP addresses of file - sharers and provided the only evidence of observed copyright infringement .
Camara has argued that MediaSentry was not licensed as a private investigator in Minnesota , that it ran an illegal " pen register , " and that its evidence should be barred .
Such a move would essentially destroy the RIAA 's main evidence of copyright infringement , and it's no surprise that the trade group has pushed back hard .
But Camara goes even further back in the evidence chain .
To prove copyright infringement , the RIAA needs evidence of that infringement , of course , but it also needs to prove it owns the copyrights in question .
If it ca n't establish that fact , the case also falls apart .
This sounds like a long shot — surely the record labels did something as basic as register their copyrights ?— but Camara tells us that it 's not so simple .
" They basically committed a technical screw - up , " he says of the RIAA .
That 's because lawyers provided the court with " true and correct " copies of their copyright registrations ( perhaps accurate but not " official ) , but these are not the " certified copies " required under federal rules of evidence .
The RIAA seemed taken aback by Camara 's pretrial complaint and asked the judge in the case to simply take " judicial notice " of the validity of its forms .
But , after a telephone conversation on Monday , the judge refused to do that .
He also rejected the RIAA argument that " hey , these forms were good enough for Thomas ' first trial , so they 're good enough now . "
The judge pointed out that " the Court 's Order granting a new trial in this matter granted an entirely new trial on all issues .
The fact that Defendant did not object to Plaintiffs ' evidence of registration in the First Trial does not preclude Defendant from putting Plaintiffs to their burden of proof on this issue in the retrial . "
The RIAA admitted that " it will be difficult and expensive to now attempt to obtain certified copies from the US Copyright Office in time for trial . "
Whoops .
Even if the RIAA comes up with the documents , though , Camara still has objections to their contents ( or lack thereof ) .
The registrations do n't include the actual " specimen , " for one thing ( in this case the actual sound recording filed with the Copyright Office ) , so Camara says he has no way to know what was actually filed and whether it truly is identical with what Thomas - Rasset is accused of sharing .
He will also charge that the registrations are simply invalid , since they were all done in the names of the various record labels , not of the artists .
But the " work for hire " law under which this was done has been improperly applied in these cases , he says , and the registrations are therefore defective .
Taken together , the two lines of attack on the RIAA 's main evidence are an attempt to cripple the recording industry case before it even reaches the question of whether Thomas - Rasset actually " did it . "
Which is probably just as well , since there is some fairly compelling evidence against her , evidence good enough to secure a guilty verdict the first time around .
Getting the money back
But not even this sort of attack on the RIAA 's methods goes far enough for Camara .
He tells
Ars that he and Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson will file a class - action lawsuit against the industry at some point after the conclusion of the Thomas - Rasset case in an effort to make the labels pay back all monies taken in from settlements with file - sharers .
Or , in Camara 's words , he 's going to " get the $ 100 million that they stole . "
( The RIAA tells Ars that the $ 100 million figure is inaccurate , and RIAA general counsel Steven Marks indicated in a recent Ars op - ed that the labels had lost money on the campaign . )
The idea behind the suit is that the RIAA has illegally threatened people , using void copyright registrations , and scared them into paying an average of $ 3,000 or $ 4,000 apiece to fend off the threat of federal litigation .
Big picture thinking
If all of these arguments were n't enough , the Nesson / Camara tag team have a couple more eyepoppers to make : P2P file - sharing of copyrighted material is fair use , and huge statutory damage awards against noncommercial users are unconstitutional .
Clearly , " thinking small " does n't interest either man —Nesson has the nickname " Billion Dollar Charlie " for a reason , and it's not surprising to learn that Camara studied with Nesson at Harvard and calls him " the smartest person that I know . "
Camara , for his part , is a sharp lawyer who was the youngest person ever to enroll in Harvard Law .
As he prepares to fly up to Minnesota today , Camara says , " We 're ready for trial . "
He also says that he plans to win .
IN A Washington Post column calculated to provoke a chorus of incredulous scoffs from talk radio hosts around the country , E.J. Dionne avers that Barack Obama 's policy agenda is hampered by a " media environment that tilts to the right " :
At first blush , this flies in the face of the right 's conventional wisdom — and indeed , of the assessment of journalists themselves : 32 % identify themselves to pollsters as " liberal " , while only 8 % self - describe as " conservative " .
But Mr Dionne 's column also provides a hint at the solution to the contradiction : Democrats themselves have done their best to bolster the perception that Mr Limbaugh — highly unpopular outside the conservative base — is the face of modern conservatism .
This may , as Mr Dionne suggests , be a strategic error , insofar as it shifts the boundaries of what is seen as mainstream political discourse .
But Republican elected officials do n't seem to regard it as a gift either .
They are reluctant to openly criticise the influential Mr Limbaugh , and often seem to find themselves compelled to backpedal when they do .
Yet it seems increasingly clear that party officialdom regards him as something of an albatross .
So is this a sort of perverse conspiracy ?
Liberal journalists helping to raise the profile of Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh as part of a crafty campaign to assist Barack Obama ?
Like most forms of media bias , I suspect it 's more subtle than that .
No journalist with a scintilla of professional pride will consciously introduce a political agenda into his stories , but one 's background worldview does inevitably make a difference when it comes to deciding which stories or claims do n't smell right and require double - checking , as opposed to those it 's safe to run with .
Something similar may influence decisions about who is " newsworthy " on the left and right .
Given that political partisans are apt to have caricaturish views of the other side , consider who a hardcore conservative might seek out to represent the " liberal view " on a given position .
Noam Chomsky ?
Ron Kuby ?
A moderate liberal might regard those folks as interesting , but is likely to be at least faintly embarrassed by them as well .
Someone trapped in a conservative cocoon , for whom " liberals " are scary monsters you only read about , would be more likely to regard them as representatives of the " true " liberal position , even if elected officials are too mealy - mouthed to openly avow it .
It may be that left - leaning journalists make a parallel error , then :
They may enjoy Jon Stewart 's program , but recognise him as an entertainer , not a serious political leader whose views represent any broader movement .
They 're too far from Mr Limbaugh , however , to see him in the same light .
" We are what we pretend to be , " wrote Kurt Vonnegut in his novel " Mother Night " , " so we must be careful about what we pretend to be . "
A political corollary , if this is correct , may be that our opposition becomes who we pretend they are .
If the contest , after all , is framed as one between Barack Obama and Rush Limbaugh , then even those on the right who might otherwise resent the association may feel obliged to defend the radio talker , with the effect of pushing reality to more closely resemble caricature .
The upshot is a thesis you 're unlikely to hear floated on " The O'Reilly Factor " anytime soon :
The liberal media does n't recognise the existence of moderate , reasonable conservatives — which means outrageous blowhards take centre stage .
There may also be something of a feedback - loop effect here .
Consider the following , from a recent article by the Nation 's Chris Hayes :
" Most Republicans are n't waking up every day thinking , How do we kill banking regulation ? " says Goehl .
" Most people who listen to Rush Limbaugh are n't waking up thinking about how do we kill banking regulation .
But the people with the deep pockets who have power in DC are thinking that .
" I sometimes get frustrated because it seems like the left is n't focused on corporate power .
We like to talk about the Sarah Palins and Rush Limbaughs , and meanwhile the American Bankers Association is one of the main entities running the country . "
And while most of us can name the latest moronic utterance from Limbaugh or Michael Steele or Newt Gingrich , the Ed Yinglings of the world remain comfortably anonymous .
" I watch people click , " says a friend who works at a web publication .
" If you put a story on Sarah Palin at the way , way , way bottom of the page and a piece on the ABA in a screaming header on top , the Palin story would get more page views . "
This is , I think , partly a function of two contrasting narratives partisans have about each other .
The left 's narrative about the right is that conservatives are loud , dim , and boorish , and so partisans on the left enjoy reading stories about conservatives who play to type .
The right 's current narrative about the left is that they 're effete snobs who think they know better than everyone else — and there 's nothing quite as satisfying as watching a supercilious facade collapse into anger .
Conservatives who buy this narrative , then , may be more likely than their counterparts to consider it a cardinal virtue that someone is capable of annoying liberals .
The race to the bottom proceeds from this weird symbiosis .

Big Tax Breaks for Natural Gas Vehicles in New Senate Bill
The bipartisan legislation , S. 1408 , would extend and increase tax credits for natural gas vehicles and refueling .
It is sponsored by Senator Robert Menendez , a New Jersey Democrat , with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Senator Orrin Hatch , a Utah Republican as original co-sponsors .
Said Menendez , " We saw last summer how the wild fluctuations in oil prices helped to wreck our economy and we ’ve seen how pollutants from dirty fuels are wrecking our planet .
Our economic crisis has shined a spotlight on the urgent need for alternative , cleaner and cheaper sources of energy that we do n’t have to import .
By making it easier and cheaper to own a vehicle that runs on natural gas , we can help families save money on energy , create new manufacturing jobs and clean our air . "
" Because of new extraction techniques , " Menendez told reporters , " We now have 35 percent more accessible natural gas than we did two years ago . "
The bill , known as the NAT GAS Act , extends for 10 years the alternative fuel credits for natural gas used as a vehicle fuel , the purchase of natural gas - fueled vehicle , and the installation of natural gas vehicle refueling property credit .
" Each day , our nation consumes about 21 million barrels of oil - more than 25 percent of the world ’s oil supply , " said Senator Reid .
" Nearly 70 percent is imported from outside our borders .
With only three percent of the world ’s oil reserves , we cannot produce our way to a safe and secure energy future .
I ’m proud to join with Senators Menendez and Hatch in introducing legislation that will help encourage the development of natural gas vehicles to help save consumers and operators thousands of dollars per year , protect our environment , and decrease our dependence on foreign energy . "
Burning natural gas produces far less air pollution than burning gasoline .
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , cars running on natural gas cut overall toxic emissions by at least 93 percent compared to gasoline .
" We must get serious about using cleaner burning natural gas and renewable energy , and this legislation is a strong step in the right direction , " said Reid .
T. Boone Pickens listens as Senator Orrin Hatch tells reporters why he supports tax credits to spur the use of natural gas .
( Photo courtesy Office of the Senator )
Natural gas is an abundant resource , with 98 percent of natural gas used in the United States originating in North America , a key reason for his support of this bill , said Senator Hatch .
" Natural gas is an important alternative fuel to help pave the way to energy independence , which will not only help keep us safer , but will also help reduce the high cost of fuel and , thus , high utility bills across the board , " Hatch said .
" In our current economic downturn , it ’s crucial to provide appropriate incentives that lead to lower prices for all Americans , " he said .
This piece of legislation does just that while also helping clean up our environment ; I am a proud cosponsor . "
Billionaire T. Boone Pickens , who drove his CNG - fueled Honda GX Civic to the news conference introducing the bill on Wednesday , said , " This bipartisan legislation does more to reduce our foreign oil dependency crisis than any other piece of legislation in the past 40 years .
As I have said many times before and will continue to say , natural gas is cleaner , cheaper , it ’s abundant and it ’s American . "
" This bill will accelerate the use of natural gas in vehicles and is the only way I know to quickly and effectively reduce our dependence on foreign oil , " Pickens said .
" For too long , our dependence on foreign oil has been one of the factors influencing our foreign policy and if we can eliminate that issue by using our own domestic natural gas resources I am confident that it will benefit our national security , our economy and the environment . "
Pickens stands to benefit from passage of the legislation .
The company he founded , Clean Energy Fuels Corp. , owns and operates natural gas fueling stations from British Columbia to the Mexican border .
The largest provider of natural gas for transportation in North America , on June 30 , Clean Energy opened the world ’s largest natural gas truck fueling station on a site adjacent to the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles .
Natural gas has the ability to displace 100 percent of the petroleum currently used in heavy - duty vehicles , according to the EPA .
If the bill becomes law , it would increase the refueling property tax credit from $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 per station , a provision from which Pickens ' company would benefit .
The state of Utah also stands to benefit from this legislation .
Americans use more than 22 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per year .
There are an estimated 350 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in Utah and surrounding states .
Currently , natural gas for vehicles sells for 88 cents per gallon in Utah , and at least 5,000 Utah drivers fuel their cars and trucks with natural gas .
In February , Utah Governor Jon Huntsman announced plans to increase the state ’s natural gas vehicle fueling infrastructure and in his State of the State address designated Interstate 15 ( I - 15 ) from Idaho to Arizona as a natural gas vehicle corridor .
Demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel has quadrupled during 2008 , Huntsman 's office says .
Today , the state of Utah and the utility Questar Gas own and operate 25 natural gas fueling stations that are open to the public .
The legislation S. 1408 :
Allows the natural gas vehicle and natural gas fueling infrastructure credits to be transferred by the taxpayer back to the seller or to the lessor
Allows state and local governmental entities to issue tax exempt bonds to finance natural gas vehicle projects .
Allows 100 percent of the cost of a natural gas vehicle manufacturing facility that is placed in service before January 1 , 2015 to be expensed and to be treated as a deduction in the taxable year in which the facility was placed in service .
This decreases to 50 percent after December 31 , 2014 and is phased out by January 1 , 2020 .
Requires that when complying with mandatory federal fleet alternative fuel vehicle purchase requirements , federal agencies shall purchase dedicated alternative fuel vehicles unless the agency can show that alternative fuel is unavailable or that purchasing such vehicles would be impractical .
Provides for grants for light - duty and heavy - duty natural gas engine development .

GENETIC ENGINEERING
THE CURRENT CATALOG OF LIFE
By Ed Regis
In their futuristic workshops , the masters of the Synthetic Genomics , Craig Venter and George Church , play out their visions of bacteria reprogrammed to turn coal into methane gas and other microbes programmed to create jet fuel 14 .
August 2009 — John Brockman is a New York City literary agent with a twist : not only does he represent many of the world 's top scientists and science writers , he 's also founder and head of the Edge Foundation ( www.edge.org), devoted to disseminating news of the latest advances in cutting - edge science and technology .
Over the weekend of 24 - 26 July , in Los Angeles , Brockman 's foundation sponsored a " master class " in which two of these same scientists — George Church , a molecular geneticist at Harvard Medical School , and Craig Venter , who helped sequence the human genome — gave a set of lectures on the subject of synthetic genomics .
The event , which was by invitation only , was attended by about twenty members of America 's technological elite , including Larry Page , co-founder of Google ; Nathan Myhrvold , formerly chief technology officer at Microsoft ; and Elon Musk , founder of PayPal and head of SpaceX , a private rocket manufacturing and space exploration firm which is housed in a massive hangar - like structure near Los Angeles International Airport .
The first day 's session , in fact , was held on the premises of SpaceX , where the Tesla electric car is also built .
Synthetic genomics , the subject of the conference , is the process of replacing all or part of an organism 's natural DNA with synthetic DNA designed by humans .
It is essentially genetic engineering on a mass scale .
As the participants were to learn over the next two days , synthetic genomics will make possible a variety of miracles , such as bacteria reprogrammed to turn coal into methane gas and other microbes programmed to churn out jet fuel .
Still other genomic engineering techniques will allow scientists to resurrect a range of extinct creatures including the woolly mammoth and , just maybe , even Neanderthal man .
The specter of " biohackers " creating new infectious agents made its obligatory appearance , but synthetic genomic researchers are , almost of necessity , optimists .
George Church , one of whose special topics was " Engineering Humans 2.0 , " told the group that " DNA is excellent programmable matter . "
Just as automated sequencing machines can read the natural order of a DNA molecule , automated DNA synthesizing machines can create stretches of deliberately engineered DNA that can then be placed inside a cell so as to modify its normal behavior .
Many bacterial cells , for example , are naturally attracted to cancerous tumors .
And so by means of correctly altering their genomes it is possible to make a species of cancer - killing bacteria , organisms that attack the tumor by invading its cancerous cells , and then , while still inside them , synthesizing and then releasing cancer - killing toxins .
Church and his Harvard lab team have already programmed bacteria to perform each of these functions separately , but they have not yet connected them all together into a complete and organized system .
Still , " we 're getting to the point where we can program these cells almost as if they were computers , " he said .
But tumor - killing microbes were only a small portion of the myriad wonders described by Church .
Another was the prospect of " humanized " or — even " personalized " — mice .
These are mammals whose genomes are injected with bits of human DNA for the purpose of getting the animals to produce disease - fighting antibodies that would not be rejected by humans .
A personalized mouse , whose genome was modified with some of your very own genetic material , would produce antibodies that would not be rejected by your own body .
Beyond that is the possibility of creating synthetic organisms that would be resistant to a whole class of natural viruses .
There are two ways of doing this , one of which involves creating DNA that is a mirror - image of natural DNA .
Like many biological and chemical substances , DNA has a chirality or handedness , the property of existing in either left - handed or right - handed structural forms .
In their natural state , most biological molecules including DNA and viruses are left - handed .
But by artificially constructing right - handed DNA , it would be possible to make synthetic living organisms whose DNA is a mirror - image of the original .
They would be resistant to conventional enzymes , parasites , and predators because their DNA would not be recognized by the mirror - image version .
Such synthetic organisms would constitute a whole new " mirror - world " of living things .
Church is also founder and head of the Personal Genome Project , or PGP .
The project 's purpose , he said , is to sequence the genomes of 100,000 volunteers with the goal of opening up a new era of personalized medicine .
Instead of today 's standardized , one - size - fits - all collection of pills and therapies , the medicine of the future will be genomically tailored to each individual patient , and its treatments will fit him or her as well as a made - to - order suit of clothes .
Church also speculated that knowledge of the idiosyncratic features that lurk deep within each of our genomes — genetic differences that give rise to every person 's respective set of individuating traits — will bring us an unprecedented level of self - understanding , and , therefore , will allow us to chart a more intelligent and informed course through life .
Toward the end of the first day Elon Musk , for whom the word charismatic could have well been coined , described a genomic transformation of another type .
While a video of his Falcon 1 rocket being launched from the Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific played in the background , Musk spoke about sending the human species to the planets .
That might have seemed an unrealistic goal were it not for the fact that on 13 July , just twelve days prior to the Edge event , SpaceX had successfully launched another Falcon 1 rocket that had placed Malaysia 's RazakSAT into Earth orbit .
Earlier , competing against both Boeing and Lockheed , SpaceX had won NASA 's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition to resupply cargo to the International Space Station .
Then , like an emperor leading his subjects , Musk gave the conference attendees a tour of his spacecraft manufacturing facility .
We saw the rocket engine assembly area , several launch vehicle components under construction , the mission operations area , and an example of the company 's Dragon spacecraft , a pressurized capsule for the transport of cargo or passengers to the ISS .
" This is all geared to extending life beyond earth to a multiplanet civilization , " Musk said of the spacecraft .
Suddenly , his particular version of the future was no longer so unbelievable .
The leadoff speaker on the second and last day of the conference was J. Craig Venter , the human genome pioneer who more recently cofounded Synthetic Genomics Inc. , an organization devoted to commercializing genomic engineering technologies .
One of the challenges of synthetic genomics was to pare down organisms to the minimal set of genes needed to support life .
Venter called this " reductionist biology , " and said that a fundamental question was whether it would be possible to reconstruct life by putting together a collection of its smallest components .
Brewer 's yeast , Venter discovered , could assemble fragments of DNA into functional chromosomes .
He described a set of experiments in which he and colleagues created 25 small synthetic pieces of DNA , injected them into a yeast cell , which then proceeded to assemble the pieces into a chromosome .
The trick was to design the DNA segments in such a way that the organism puts them together in the correct order .
It was easy to manipulate genes in yeast , Venter found .
He could insert genes , remove genes , and create a new species with new characteristics .
In August 2007 , he actually changed one species into another .
He took a chromosome from one cell and put it into different one .
" Changing the software [ the DNA ] completely eliminated the old organism and created a new one , " Venter said .
Separately , Venter and his group had also created a synthetic DNA copy of the phiX virus , a small microbe that was not infectious to humans .
When they put the synthetic DNA into an E. coli bacterium , the cell made the necessary proteins and assembled them into the actual virus , which in turn killed the cell that made it .
All of this happened automatically in the cell , Venter said : " The software builds its own hardware . "
These and other genomic creations , transformations , and destructions gave rise to questions about safety , the canonical nightmare being genomically engineered bacteria escaping from the lab and wreaking havoc upon human , animal , and plant .
But a possible defense against this , Venter said , was to provide the organism with " suicide genes , " meaning that you create within them a chemical dependency so that they cannot survive outside the lab .
Equipped with such a dependency , synthetic organisms would pose no threat to natural organisms or to the biosphere .
Outside the lab they would simply die .
That would be good news if it were true , because with funding provided by ExxonMobil , Venter and his team are now building a three to five square - mile algae farm in which reprogrammed algae will produce biofuels .
" Making algae make oil is not hard , " Venter said .
" It 's the scalability that 's the problem . "
Algae farms of the size required for organisms to become efficient and realistic sources of energy are expensive .
Still , algae has the advantage that it uses CO2 as a carbon source — it actually consumes and metabolizes a greenhouse gas — and uses sunlight as an energy source .
So what we have here , potentially , are living solar cells that eat carbon dioxide as they produce new hydrocarbons for fuel .
George Church had the final say in a lecture entitled " Engineering Humans 2.0 . "
Human beings , he noted , are limited by a variety of things : by their ability to concentrate and remember , by the shortness of their lifespans , and so on .
Genomic engineering could be used to correct all these deficiencies and more .
The common laboratory mouse , he noted , had an average lifespan of 2.5 years .
The naked mole rate , by contrast , lives ten times longer , to the ripe old age of 25 .
It would be possible to find the genes that contributed to the longevity of the naked mole rat , and by importing those genes into the lab mouse , you could slowly increase its longevity .
An analogous process could also be tried on human beings , increasing their lifespans and adding to their memory capacity , but the question was whether it was wise to do this .
There were always trade - offs , Church said .
You may engineer humans to have bigger and stronger bones , but only at the price if making them heavier and more ungainly .
Malaria resistance is coupled with increased susceptibility to sickle cell anemia .
And so on down the list .
In a conference characterized by an excess of excess , Church provided a welcome cautionary note .
But then he proceeded to pull out all the stops an argued that by targeted genetic manipulation of the elephant genome it might be possible to resurrect the woolly mammoth .
And by doing the same to the chimpanzee genome , scientists could possibly resurrect Neanderthal man .
" Why would anyone want to resurrect Neanderthal man ? " a conference participant asked .
" To create a sibling species that would give us a fresh outlook on ourselves , " Church answered .
Humans were a monoculture , he said , and monocultures were biologically at risk .
His answer did not satisfy all of those present .
" We already have enough Neanderthals in Washington , " Craig Venter quipped , thereby effectively bringing the Edge Master Class 2009 to a close .

Elisabeth Bumiller , the reporter , said she was just trying to convey what the study said , not swallowing a Pentagon line , and that she had plenty of problems with the study that she tried to make clear to readers .
Dean Baquet , the Washington bureau chief , said Bumiller questioned whether the study was newsworthy , but he overrode her doubts .

Douglas Jehl , who directs national security coverage and edited the story , said he became aware that there was a distinction between suspected cases and confirmed cases only after the article was published .
“ Had I known , I would have treated the story differently , ” he said .
The report , since released , said someone could be listed as being suspected of militant activity based on “ unverified or single - source , but plausible , reporting , ” a standard The Times would not accept for its own reporting .
Jehl said he would have used only confirmed cases in the lead paragraph .
Although he and Baquet defended the article as still worth the front page , I think the difference between one in 20 and one in seven made it a much less compelling story that should have run inside , with stronger warnings that The Times had its doubts .
( On Friday , the paper published an editor ’s note saying the article should not have accepted the premise that all the prisoners were engaged in terrorism before their capture , and should have used the one - in - 20 figure . )
Jill Abramson , the managing editor for news , told me that , in retrospect , “ I would n’t lead the paper with it exactly in the form it appeared , and I definitely would give it a different headline . ”
Abramson , Baquet , Jehl and Bumiller said the Pentagon report was being suppressed , and that made The Times hungry to find out why .
Bumiller , expressing frustration that people think the report was just handed to her by someone with political motives , said she worked for weeks to obtain a copy .
She said she found an official who believed the report should be released , and “ I pestered this official for it for a long time . ”
The official finally agreed to let her make notes from a copy but would not give it to her .
With limited time , Bumiller said she focused on the hardest evidence , the 29 former prisoners named as having suspected or confirmed involvement in terrorism or militant activity .
She was looking for verifiable facts .
Confirmed versus suspected was not a big issue to her , Bumiller said , and “ it was a mistake not to focus on that . ”
She thought the bigger problem was that 45 more people were accused of terrorism but not identified .
Abramson said , “ The whole game of leaks can be problematical if you are n’t given a document or the time to look at it in a full way . ”

So is gum on the bottom of chairs .
Let me share a recent event with you all .
I opened my mailbox to receive a surprise issue of Maxim , featuring such lovely articles as “ Balls of Fury ” , which is understandably about tennis , and a whole hell of a lot of scantily clad women .
And some women without tops , covering their nipples with their hands or their hair .
And let me tell you , that ’s exactly what a gamer like me wants to see !
Wait , no .
No , it is n’t .
If they asked me if I would like to receive Maxim when EGM stopped publication , I really do n’t remember saying yes .
They could ’ve sent me a subscription to a related gaming magazine , or just put it on hold until it reopens in the fall , like they said they were going to do .
Hell , they could ’ve done a lot of things .
Instead , I got a short note saying that the remaining balance of my paid subscription would be fulfilled with Maxim .
Wow .
Imagine if I was a straight female .
Actually , that ’s pretty kinky … ahem !
Sorry about that .
Got sidetracked .
Anyway , it seems that I ’ll be getting an issue or three of Maxim .
Go me .
So , if you ’re a former EGM subscriber and you suddenly start getting copies of a magazine you never subscribed to ( or * gasp * want ) , do n’t fret and enjoy the gratuitous half - nudity and lame guy jokes .
And look for EGM to hopefully resume in the fall .

It may not be as exciting as the Apollo 11 , but I do find exciting that SpaceX has put a commercial satellite in orbit for the first time , launching a Falcon I rocket from the Marshall Islands .
SpaceX launched a Malaysian satellite into orbit using the two - stage Falcon , a rocket developed and built from scratch by the company .
The satellite , called RazakSAT , is designed to take high resolution pictures of Malaysia .

If all goes as planned , SpaceX will soon deliver material to the International Space Station in the future .

Non-government school registration systems
Effective from 1 January 2017
The NSW Education Standards Authority ( ‘ the Authority ’ ) is strengthening its risk - based approach to regulation by expanding its program for the inspection of schools selected randomly .
The expanded program will include government schools for the first time and continue to select individual and systemic non-government schools .
The expanded ‘ random inspection ’ program is consistent with the recommendations of the recent BOSTES Review and legislative changes providing for the Authority to monitor the compliance of government schools in addition to advising the Minister on the compliance of government schools with similar requirements to those that apply to non-government schools .
The inspection of schools selected randomly will :
consider school compliance with a subset of the registration requirements rather than the full set of requirements ; and
occur with limited notice having regard to the assessment of risk associated with the registration requirement ( s ) being monitored ; and
check whether the school continues to comply with the registration requirements .
For the inspections , schools will be asked to provide a sample of the materials identified in the Evidence of Compliance sections from the relevant registration manual :
government schools – Registration Process for the NSW Government Schooling System Manual
For government schools and systemic non-government schools the ‘ random inspection ’ program has regard to the context in which these schools operate as members of a system and the associated responsibilities of the system in managing the compliance of their schools .
An overview of the ‘ random inspection ’ process follows .
Further details will be published in early 2017 .
Selection
Schools will be selected randomly to form a sample that is proportionate to the number of schools in each schooling sector .
In 2017 , it is planned to select 18 government schools , four individual non-government schools and four systemic non-government schools .
Schools that are already part of the Authority ’s inspection program , for example , schools seeking renewal of registration in 2017 , will be excluded from the selection process in 2017 .
Notice
The selected schools will be contacted by a Board Inspector no less than four days in advance of the inspection .
An inspection with less notice may take place should the Authority have concerns in regard to the compliance of a school with registration requirements , having regard to the assessment of risk associated with those requirements .
The contact will be by phone call to the school ’s Principal ( or equivalent ) followed by written notice identifying the inspection date and confirming the subset of requirements to be assessed .
For government schools and systemic non-government schools , the nominated system representative will be notified prior to phone contact with the school ’s Principal ( or equivalent ) .
In 2017 , the implementation of the ‘ random inspection ’ program will commence in Term 2 and be conducted throughout the year .
Requirements
The inspection will focus on the school ’s compliance with a subset of the requirements as described in the relevant registration manual .
The subset of requirements will relate to either Strand A or Strand B :
Strand A – Annual priorities in 2017
In 2017 , the annual priorities for the inspection of schools selected randomly are the requirements for :
safe and supportive environment – child protection ; and / or
safe and supportive environment – student welfare , with particular regard to anti-bullying and / or managing complaints and grievances .
Strand A inspections will consider school compliance in relation to aspects of these requirements to be specified in the written notice to the school .
Strand B – Quality of teaching and student learning
From 2017 , the Authority will have regard to the quality of teaching and student learning in deciding whether the requirements for registration are being met .
Evidence to demonstrate the quality of teaching and student learning is described in the amended registration manuals to take effect from 1 January 2017 .
Strand B inspections will consider school compliance in relation to :
records to demonstrate the standard of teaching , monitoring the standard of teaching and implementing strategies to improve the standard of teaching ; and / or
records of assessing student learning and implementing strategies to improve student learning ; and / or
curriculum documentation and samples of student work in one or two key learning areas in one or two stages of schooling .
The particular set of requirements to be monitored will be specified in the written notice to the school .
Focus
While the focus of the ‘ random inspection ’ process is a subset of the requirements , a Board Inspector may request additional evidence in relation to a broader range of registration requirements should compliance concerns be identified .
Where a ‘ random inspection ’ identifies compliance concerns , the school and / or system , if relevant , will be required to provide the Authority with evidence of addressing the concerns and the school may be subject to further inspection .
Report
A Board Inspector will prepare a report identifying the findings of the ‘ random inspection ’ in relation to the school ’s compliance .
The school and system , if relevant , will be provided with a copy of the report prior to it being considered by the Authority ’s School Registration Committee .

Short , snappy writing works best online .
First , people are less ready to read long pieces online than short articles .
Second , people read online material about 25 percent slower than print .
Jakob Nielsen explains why in In defence of print .
Nielsen wrote his article in 1996 , but things have n’t changed .
Third , people get distracted easily online .
There are advertisements and links to other websites as well as bleeping notification of incoming emails , tweets and instant messages .
If you write a brief article , there is more chance a reader will get to the end before skipping off elsewhere .
Fourth , skilled writers aim for brevity because good , vigorous English is concise .
A writer ’s goal is to get messages to readers as swiftly and as accurately as possible .

If I wish I had learned one lesson earlier in life , it ’s this : it ’s okay to be angry , it ’s okay to make other people angry , and anger can work for you .
( Well , that might be three lessons , but I find it hard to disentangle them , so bear with me . )
It ’s okay to be angry .
Girls are subjected to an impressive load of anti-anger propaganda .
Snow White and Cinderella , at least in the mid-century modern Disneyfield versions we ’re stuck with today in U.S. popular culture , are both specifically praised for remaining sweet and good - natured in spite of the fact that they ’re turned into indentured servants by their stepmothers .
( There ’s also a not - so - subtle implication that it ’s their sweet natures that preserve their beauty –because anger is so aging , my dears ! )
What kind of a lesson is that for girls ?
If a child of mine were enslaved by an evil stepmother , I ’d sure as hell want her to get pi$$ed off and fight back .
But , anger is punished in girls from the beginning .
An undergraduate student of mine recently complained that she ’s not permitted to express anger .
When she does , first she ’s patronized and told that she really does n’t mean what she ’s saying , and when she insists that no , she really is angry , the reaction she gets from other people is n’t apology or rational discussion , it ’s anger at her anger .
( For more on this see below , “ It ’s okay to make other people angry . ” )
I ’ve got another version of Snow White ’s story I like to tell : Instead of a smiling , simpering dip$hit who simply loves scrubbing the stairs , Snow White sneaks away one day to raise an army .
( She makes sure break that tattletale Magic Mirror first , so that he ca n’t rat her out . )
Snow
White delivers a stirring speech in a clandestine meeting at the local cathedral , where the women and men of the kingdom agree to enlist in her cause against the usurper queen .
She returns to the castle in gleaming armour , and while her army overwhelms the queen ’s guards , she chops off the queen ’s head with her broadsword , and displays it on a pike from the castle ’s highest tower .
And of course , the kingdom becomes a republic with a constitution and an elaborate system of shared governance ; Snow White stays on as a cabinet secretary .
Without anger , that course of action is simply impossible .
Without anger , you ’re at the mercy of forest animals , dwarves , and handsome princes , all of whom have their own agendas should they choose to help you out .
It ’s okay to make other people angry .
It happens to us all–if you are a sentient being with needs and opinions , you will pi$$ someone off .
Most of the time it wo n’t have been your intention at all , but you will make others angry .
Sometimes you ’ll be in a position to make a decision that will make people angry .
Suck it up –it ’s a privilege of rank to make decisions , and those people are entitled to their anger , too .
Sometimes , you ’ll pi$ $ off others because they treated you badly and you protested their treatment because you are , after all , a sentient being who refuses to be treated badly .
But , be warned : people who treat you badly get really , really angry when you refuse to accept bad treatment .
Do n’t get upset because people who treated you badly are angry .
Always remember : no matter what they say , they do n’t have your best interests at heart , because they treated you badly !
Sometimes people will get angry and treat you badly because you ’ve expressed an opinion they do n’t like .
Whatever the reason , please get over any compulsion you may have to apologize to them or to anyone else for their anger or for their inappropriate displays of their anger .
This will be very hard if they insult your intelligence or misprepresent your point of view .
It will be even harder if they scream at you in public and make wild accusations about your motives for expressing your opinions .
Understand that these people are behaving childishly , and the way to deal with angry children is to send them to their rooms and ignore the tantrum .
Their anger is their responsibility .
Anger can work for you .
There are people who will disagree with me on this , but I have found anger to be a remarkably clarifying and cleansing emotion .
Men ’s liberationist movements are all about anger :
Anger was at the heart of what made the American and French Revolutions happen , and anger motivated generations of black and white abolitionists to fight against slavery .
Anger is the only rational and healthy reaction to exploitation and injustice .
In my own life , anger has worked :
Once upon a time , anger motivated me to get out of an exploitative romantic relationship .
Early in the present decade , anger motivated me to get another , better job when I was being bullied at work .
I agree that anger that does n’t lead to productive change is a problem that probably requires therapy .
( And you have to use anger judiciously – do n’t get angry at traffic , and do n’t get angry about petty everyday frustrations .
That ’s anger that does n’t go anywhere but straight to your cardiovascular system . )
Too many girls and women are told that it ’s bad simply to feel anger–let alone to express it or act on it , and I think that ’s because denying anger is enfeebling .
( Denying anger takes its toll on your cardiovascular system , too–beware , my pretties . )
Not being angry is a large part of what makes us girls and women–we agree to be the not - angries who are somehow nevertheless responsible for placating everyone else ’s anger : our employers ’ and co-workers ’ anger , our parents ’ anger , our partners ’/ abusers ’ anger , and even our children ’s anger ( when applicable ) .
That ’s a division of emotional labor and emotional privilege that has awesome ( and awesomely unequal ) economic , political , and social consequences for everyone .
What lesson do you wish you had learned earlier in life ?
Do any fembloggers out there want to take a swing at more Lessons for Girls ?
Let me know in the comments below , and I ’ll post links here to your contributions to our little feminist vade mecum .
( If you do n’t have a blog , I ’m willing to consider guest posts–so e-mail me and let me know . )
This post is dedicated to Clio Bluestocking , who was recently lectured about her inappropriate “ tone ” when her opinions were solicited by a fellowship program she ’s participating in and she actually shared them with the other fellows .
She was informed that no one else in the program liked or respected her , so she should try to moderate her language and “ tone ” because it would be so good for her personal growth .
Clio ’s description of her experiences made me very angry on her behalf , but they helped me clarify some thoughts that have been knocking around for a while about women and anger .
The latest data on insider selling shows little relief in the relentless unloading of company stock by corporate insiders .
In the last two weeks insiders sold over $ 335 MM in stock vs listed insider purchases of just over $ 12 MM .
As has been the trend over the course of the last few weeks the list of insider selling has been long and the amounts have been staggering .
The buy side , on the other hand , is represented by low rated , low priced stocks whose insiders rarely purchase over $ 500K .
One might think that with all of these “ green shoots ” the insiders at major U.S. corporations would begin buying up their own shares voraciously .
Especially after a nice little run like we ’ve seen lately .
After all , with stocks still 35 % off their highs and a full blown economic recovery ( supposedly ) on the horizon it would make nothing but sense than to buy your own shares , right ?
Although there were signs of life in early May the overall trend in buying remains very low .
As we ’ve noted before it ’s not the mountain of selling that most concerns us , but the total lack of buying .
Insiders sell for many reasons , but they only buy their own stock when they are confident that the price will rise .
As of now , insider buying remains incredibly weak which is more than likely a vote of ( no ) confidence in future business operations .

Disruptive technology ; it 's a term thrown around these days by industry marketing types and quite frankly it 's just plain getting worn out as of late .
In the mid 90s , a Harvard Business School Professor coined this phrase to describe a product innovation that breaks current convention and exceeds market expectations so vastly that market leaders might not see it coming and perhaps even the market itself does n't know how to react .
Since the term was brought forth , there were many innovations over the years that overzealous marketing types have hailed as " disruptive technologies , " though obviously , in reality , this level of innovation is on a different scale all together .
However , a truly disruptive technology is unequivocally and unmistakably a game - changer .
Let 's take NAND Flash memory for example .
A few years ago , the camera market was turned on its ear by the new storage technology and it has changed the landscape forever with digital cameras displacing film cameras almost completely now .
Then USB
Flash sticks came along and of course the floppy drive then became extinct .
Disruptive enough for you ?
In addition , it has become clear that there is yet another market the NAND Flash chip has set its disruptive sights on -- secondary computer storage .
There is little question at this point , that SSD ( Solid State Drive ) technology will eventually supplant traditional rotational media , with perhaps the exception of large bulk storage arrays , at least for the time being .
Though it is debatable when the transition will reach critical mass beyond a few drives shipped in notebooks , some higher - end desktop configurations and the DIY niche ' .
However , is even the SATA SSD as we know it today , eventually going to end up on a proverbial endangered species list ?
We 'll leave you pondering that question as we take a competitive look at two SSD solutions that peg the performance scales with very different approaches to the technology .
" In a move set to infuriate and send many Zero Hedge readers over the top , the NYSE has taken action to make sure that nobody will henceforth be able to keep track of the complete dominance that Goldman Sachs exerts over the New York Stock Exchange .
This basically ends our weekly Program Trading updates disclosed every Thursday indicating that Goldman has singlehandedly captured all of NYSE 's program trading . "
-- Zero Hedge
I 'm sorry I did n't post this earlier , but I urge readers to go over to Zero Hedge and check out this post about the NYSE 's recent decision to change its procedures ... to protect Goldman Sachs from bloggers like Zero Hedge !
This is complicated stuff ( for people with no financial background , like me , it 's nightmarish ) and I have a longer thing about this coming out later .
But the essence of this story is that Tyler Durden over at Zero Hedge has , for months , been complaining that Goldman has been manipulating the NYSE , in particular manipulating program trading in somewhat the same way ( although perhaps not to the same extent ) that they manipulated the commodities markets .
In order to make his case -- and his theory has gained a lot of acceptance , to the point where Goldman had to respond to the allegations publicly -- he has been analyzing data the NYSE releases on program trading every week .
So what happened this week ?
The NYSE announced that it will no longer be releasing its weekly program trading data .
This is quiet obviously a move designed to make it even more impossible to track what 's going on in the NYSE and shield , in particular , Goldman Sachs .
Let 's hope there 's a public uproar about this ; Zero Hedge posted contact info for NYSE officials , and has urged readers to petition the exchange to restore the old rules in the name of transparency .
More on this later .

eBay has since been licensing the technology from the founders ’ new company , Joltid , but the pair recently decided to revoke the licensing agreement .
The matter is now the subject of a legal battle in the English High Court of Justice , with eBay trying to force Joltid to let it continue using the technology .
In a quarterly report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission , eBay said in no uncertain terms that if it lost the right to use the software it would most likely have to shut Skype down .
e Bay said it was working on developing ‘‘ alternative software ’’ to that licensed through Joltid , but this ‘‘ may not be successful , may result in loss of functionality or customers even if successful , and will in any event be expensive ’’ .
‘‘ If Skype was to lose the right to use the Joltid software as the result of the litigation , and if alternative software was not available , Skype would be severely and adversely affected and the continued operation of Skype ’s business as currently conducted would likely not be possible , ’’ eBay wrote .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A new study challenges the traditional view that patents foster innovation , suggesting instead that they may hinder technological progress , economic activity and societal wealth .
These results could have important policy implications , because many countries count on patent systems to spur new technology and promote economic growth .
To examine the effect of patents on technological innovation , Bill Tomlinson of UC Irvine ’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and Andrew Torrance of the University of Kansas School of Law developed an online game simulating the U.S. patent system .
PatentSim features an abstract model of the innovation process , a database of potential innovations and a network through which users can interact with one another to license , assign , buy , infringe and enforce patents .
The software allows players to simulate the innovation process under a traditional patent system ; a “ commons ” system , in which no patent protection is available ; or a system with both patents and open - source protection .
“ In PatentSim , we found that the patent system did not work to spur innovation , ” said Tomlinson , associate professor of informatics .
“ In fact , participants were more likely to innovate when there was no intellectual property protection at all , or when they could open - source their innovations and share them with other people . ”
The researchers measured the efficacy of the three systems based on innovation , the number of inventions ; productivity , a measure of economic activity ; and societal wealth , the ability to generate money .
Players were first - year law students who had never had intellectual property coursework .
Tomlinson and Torrance plan further studies with subjects of different backgrounds , including M.B.A. students at Harvard University .
“ Current patent laws are based on century - old assumptions that patents spur technological progress , and few have questioned this , ” said Torrance , associate professor of law .
“ If it turns out that our laws are based upon misinformation and bad assumptions , society may be failing to promote beneficial new technologies that could improve quality of life . ”
The study was published recently in The Columbia Science and Technology Law Review .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea on Monday raised the stakes in its confrontation with Washington by sentencing two American journalists to 12 years hard labor for “ grave crimes ” while U.S. President Barack Obama ’s spokesman said the two were innocent and should be freed .
Obama is due to meet with South Korean President Lee Myung - bak at the White House on June 16 to discuss a number of issues , expected to include including growing threats by North Korea which tested a nuclear bomb in May .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Sunday Washington was considering putting the reclusive North back on its list of states that sponsor terrorism , further isolating a country already facing additional United Nations sanctions .
The journalists , Euna Lee and Laura Ling , of U.S. media outlet Current TV , were arrested in March working on a story near the border between North Korea and China .
The trial for the two , working for the company co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore , had opened on Thursday .
“ The trial confirmed the grave crime they committed against the Korean nation and their illegal border crossing as they had already been indicted and sentenced each of them to 12 years of reform through labor , ” the official KCNA news agency said in a brief dispatch .
In Washington , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the journalists ’ fate should not be linked to the dispute over Pyongyang ’s nuclear program .
The White House said in a statement Obama was “ deeply concerned ” and added : “ We are engaged through all possible channels to secure their release . ”
The journalists ’ sentence seemed certain to deepen the chill in relations with the United States which has been trying for years to convince Stalinist North Korea to give up its ambition of becoming a nuclear weapons power .
“ ( North Korea ) is using the sentence as bait to squeeze concessions out of the U.S. amid heightened tension , ” said Lee Dong - bok , a senior associate with the CSIS think tank in Seoul and an expert on the North ’s negotiating tactics .
South Korea ’s main stock index dipped as the news of the sentencing weighed on sentiment .
“ Although this ( fall ) will probably be short - lived , there still are concerns the United States may take stringent measures in response , ” said Lee Yun , a market analyst at Woori Investment & Securities .
Analysts say it would take a military clash at sea or on the border to have a major impact on global markets .
MILITARY GRANDSTANDING
Obama at the weekend called the North ’s nuclear test , which was followed by a series of missile tests , “ extraordinarily provocative ” and said that this time there would be no appeasement by Washington .

Communist North Korea kept up its rhetoric which is increasingly unnerving a region that accounts for a sixth of the world ’s economy .
It threatened to retaliate with “ extreme ” measures if the United Nations punished it for the nuclear test .
“ Our response would be to consider sanctions against us as a declaration of war and answer it with extreme hardline measures , ” the North Korea ’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary .

It also issued a no -sail warning off its east coast , up to 260 km ( 160 miles ) off the Wonsan area from where it launched a short - range missile in May and a barrage of short - range missiles in 2006 .
North Korea has said it would fire an intercontinental ballistic missile if the U.N. Security Council did not apologize for punishing it for its April rocket launch , widely seen as a disguised missile test that violated U.N. resolutions .
The North appears to be preparing a long - range missile for a test that could be conducted as early as this month .
It also appears to be readying for tests of mid-range missiles that could strike anywhere in South Korea or most of Japan .
The Security Council may adopt a new resolution as early as this week , but members are divided on how to respond .
Japan wants a strong resolution to make it clear that such tests would not be forgiven and Clinton said last week Washington wanted the strongest possible resolution .
China has said a “ balanced ” resolution was needed .
TERRORISM BLACKLIST
The United States removed North Korea from its terrorism blacklist in October in a bid to revive faltering six - party nuclear disarmament talks , prompting the North to take some measures to disable its nuclear facilities .
Pyongyang has since reversed those steps and said it had restarted the nuclear complex -- including reprocessing nuclear fuel to obtain weapons - grade plutonium .
China is seen as nervous of measures that might push its fragile neighbor into collapse , especially at a time when there is uncertainty of the health of leader Kim Jong - il , who is widely believed to have suffered a stroke last year .
Many analysts say the North ’s belligerence may be aimed largely at a domestic audience , with Kim , 67 , using it to bolster his position at home with the military and to better secure the succession for his youngest son Kim Jong -un .
I keep coming across musicians who have appeared on Sesame Street ( usually singing the Alphabet Song ) , and the performances are uniformly awesome .
( One of the best videos from my Late Movies segment last week was Stevie Wonder live on Sesame Street , and in a previous week , Paul Simon was on Sesame Street . )
I 've collected some favorites here for your viewing enjoyment .
Feist , " 1 2 3 4 "
Feist performs her hit " 1 2 3 4 " with a twist -- it 's now more specifically about counting than about growing up .
Totally adorable .
Queen Latifah , " The Letter O "
Safari Sisters in the house !
" Now , one day I was chillin ' on Sesame Street , hanging wit ' my homegirls , rockin ' to the beat , when Telly came along and he was feelin ' kinda blue , he said , ' I lost my Letter O , what should I do ? ' "
Latifah 's advice : learn some words that include the letter O !
R.E.M. , " Furry Happy Monsters "
They pulled some monster Muppets out of storage ( including a B - 52's Kate Pierson monster ) for this Sesame Street - ified rendition of their hit " Shiny Happy People . "
Norah Jones , " Do n't Know Y "
This is pretty cute -- " Do n't Know Why " becomes a song about missing the letter Y , spelling words like Yarn and Yet .
Ray Charles and Friends , " The Alphabet Song "
Only Ray Charles can make the Alphabet Song soulful and sort of wistful .
Includes guest appearances by Patrick Stewart , Ellen Degeneres , Tony Bennett , and more .
" Wo n't you sing along with me ? "
Patti LaBelle , " The Alphabet Song " ( Gospel Version )
Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Kermit the Frog , " African Alphabet Song "
Paul Simon and Ladysmith Black Mambazo , " The Alphabet Song "
Slightly similar to the above , but with no Kermit and no fancy visuals .
Spin Doctors , " Two Princes "
Um. I guess the Spin Doctors ' singer got a haircut and kinda needs work .
Tilly and the Wall , " The Alphabet Song "
Indie rock band Tilly and the Wall , most notable for its lack of a drummer ( they use tap - dancers instead to keep the beat ) , perform a modified Alphabet Song .

Out of all the returning shows this week , I think Better Off Ted did the best .
This episode had a better plot that Bioshuffle ( ep. 9 ) and was funnier .
One of Veridian Dynamic 's perfumes causes hornets to attack some women , so the company is being sued .
Ted 's team and Veronica have to give depositions .
This leads to a hilarious exchange between a lawyer and Veronica who of course tries to say nothing .
Lawyer - " Can you describe your job ? " Veronica - " Yes . "
Lawyer - " How would you describe your job ? " Veronica - " Cleverly . "
Once they get around to asking whether anyone had knowledge the hornets could attack , everyone denies it except Linda .
Apparently she knew and even sent an email to the CEO and Ted .
Ouch !
( it 's funny if you watched Veronica 's deposition )
Phil also reveals that he never attended MIT and actually went to the University of Aruba which causes lots of tension between him and Lem , but is later resolved rather easily .
Ted swears that he never got an email , but Linda also insists she sent him one .
They both claim to remember it clearly as it was Linda 's first project and it was the day Ted had sex with Veronica .
Veronica offers to make Linda a scapegoat for a large sum of money and she accepts .
Someone slides a CD under Ted 's door and it is actually a video of Ted and Veronica having sex showing that Veronica had in fact deleted the email with her shoe .
Dr. Bomba takes the fall as a druggie and everyone is happy .

Desde hace poco , las áreas de opacidad en la administración pública se han incrementado , denunció la Auditoría Superior de la Federación
[ email protected ]
En los últimos años las áreas de opacidad en la administración pública — en todos sus niveles — se han incrementado , pese a los esfuerzos por avanzar en la rendición de cuentas , denunció la Auditoría Superior de la Federación .
El auditor Arturo González de Aragón informó que a diferencia de enero de 2008 , las áreas de opacidad crecieron de 13 a 17 , siendo los más importantes fideicomisos , subejercicios y la ausencia de supervisión y evaluación del Estado a contratos y convenios entre gobierno y particulares .
Actualmente las áreas de opacidad detectadas y denunciadas por la ASF son la eficiencia recaudatoria , educación pública , pensiones y jubilaciones , transferencias a estados y municipios , Pidiregas , recursos electorales , sistema contable gubernamental , sistema de evaluación de desempeño , donativos , mejora regulatoria , remuneraciones y preservación del medio ambiente .
González de Aragón recibió ayer de los diputados federales las conclusiones de la revisión a la Cuenta Pública 2007 , y dijo en entrevista que hoy por hoy los subejercicios son una fuente millonaria de opacidad , pues se justifican como ya gastados , pero en realidad se guardan hasta finales de cada año para transferirlos a fondos o fideicomisos que están inmersos en la opacidad .
En 2007 , se reportó 120 mil millones de pesos de subejercicios con los que se hicieron 28 transferencias a fondos y fideicomisos .

Some birds have a remarkable talent for dancing , two studies published in Current Biology suggest .
Previously , it was thought that only humans had the ability to dance , but footage has revealed that some parrots have a near - perfect sense of rhythm .
This film of Snowball , a sulphur - crested cockatoo , shows him dancing to his favourite song - the Backstreet Boys ' Everybody - played at three different tempos .
Frame - by - frame analysis revealed that he was able to keep time as the beat changed .
The findings could help to shed light on how our relationship with music and the capacity to dance came about .
I 've long been of the opinion that creating banner ads should be punishable by stoning .
But this Pringles ad from Bridge Worldwide in Cincinnati does n't suck .
If nothing else , I appreciate that it is n't flashing horrible circus colors and promising me a free Xbox or a spyware - laden " virus scan . "
It 's also kind of neat that clicking on it repeatedly reveals a little story within the ad , an innovation that earned it a gold Cyber Lion at Cannes last week .
According to its Cannes entry materials , the ad " shows a young , online audience how fun , eccentric — and even downright weird — life with Pringles can be . "
The best part ?
It does n't even take you to the Pringles Web site .
That 's a quality I can appreciate in a banner ad .
It does expose , however , that Pringles needs to make a wider can already .
The agency says 20 people who clicked on the ad clicked through all 97 creative frames of it .
Check out the full case study below .
Deutsche Bank put up a billboard in Madison Square Garden that allegedly displays almost real - time data on the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
And I , for one , can't read that number .
Kevin Parker , global head of Deutsche Bank 's Asset Management division , said of the counter at its unveiling : " It will be a huge task to bring global emissions under control and my hope is that putting this data in public view will spur both governments and markets to move us more quickly to a low - carbon economy . "
The counter increases at around 800 tons a second , which , if you are good at the maths , you know translates into , um , a lot per day .
At least half of which is my roommate .
Seriously , dude 's so gassy the walls in his bedroom are turning brown .

Several major US studios have filed a lawsuit against The Pirate Bay , seeking a judicial injunction that would shut down the notorious torrent tracker .
The move is the latest in the continuing legal saga that surrounds The Pirate Bay .
The site 's operators were found guilty in Swedish court earlier this year of assisting copyright infringement , and were sentenced to a year in jail and fined 30 million kronor .
The sentence failed to include an injunction forcing the operators to shut the site down .
Instead , TPB admins have audaciously stated they will not pay the fines , convinced that " what we do is right . "
The group first moved for a retrial , suggesting the judge was biased against copyright holders .
Though the retrial was denied , the group still plans to appeal the guilty verdict against them .
Meanwhile , the site continues to be a thorn in Big Content 's side , with the appeals process expected to last at least a couple years .
Big Content is n't , er , content to sit idly by , though , while the legal wheels slowly turn .
The studios filing for the injunction — which include Columbia Pictures , Disney , and Warner Bros , among others — want a court order compelling The Pirate Bay to stop facilitating sharing of the respective companies ' films and TV shows .
" We 've been forced to seek a court order demanding that they stop the spreading of these roughly 100 films and television programmes , " Monique Wadsted , the studios ' legal counsel in Sweden , told The Local .
" They 've been sentenced to prison for criminal activities but have n’t stopped carrying out those activities . "
The suit does n't seek any damages for copyright infringement , though Wadsted did n't discount that as a future possibility .
" What matters [ most ] is that the spreading of these works is stopped , " she told The Local .
While Global Gaming Factory has announced plans to buy The Pirate Bay and turn it into a legal downloading service , Wadsted said that the studios she represents can't " wait and see " if that will ever happen or not .
This latest lawsuit is far from the only legal worry for The Pirate Bay .
The rights holders behind the original lawsuit have filed their own appeal to both the verdict and the sentencing , insisting that the charge of " infringing copyright " be restored against the defendants and that the fine of 30 million kronor be increased to 100 million .
The international music trade group IFPI has also said it plans to seek an injunction against the site .
And a Dutch antipiracy group has also sued the site and its operators to block access by Dutch users .
But the most difficult challenge  both to grasp and to solve  of the cloud is its effect on our freedom to innovate .
The crucial legacy of the personal computer is that anyone can write code for it and give or sell that code to you  and the vendors of the PC and its operating system have no more to say about it than your phone company does about which answering machine you decide to buy .
Microsoft might want you to run Word and Internet Explorer , but those had better be good products or you ’ll switch with a few mouse clicks to OpenOffice or Firefox .
Promoting competition is only the tip of the iceberg  there are also the thousands of applications so novel that they do n’t yet compete with anything .
These tend to be produced by tinkerers and hackers .
Instant messaging , peer - to - peer file sharing and the Web itself all exist thanks to people out in left field , often writing for fun rather than money , who are able to tempt the rest of us to try out what they ’ve done .
This freedom is at risk in the cloud , where the vendor of a platform has much more control over whether and how to let others write new software .
Facebook allows outsiders to add functionality to the site but reserves the right to change that policy at any time , to charge a fee for applications , or to de-emphasize or eliminate apps that court controversy or that they simply do n’t like .
The iPhone ’s outside apps act much more as if they ’re in the cloud than on your phone :
Apple can decide who gets to write code for your phone and which of those offerings will be allowed to run .
The company has used this power in ways that Bill Gates never dreamed of when he was the king of Windows : Apple is reported to have censored e-book apps that contain controversial content , eliminated games with political overtones , and blocked uses for the phone that compete with the company ’s products .
The market is churning through these issues .
Amazon is offering a generic cloud - computing infrastructure so anyone can set up new software on a new Web site without gatekeeping by the likes of Facebook .
Google ’s Android platform is being used in a new generation of mobile phones with fewer restrictions on outside code .
But the dynamics here are complicated .
When we vest our activities and identities in one place in the cloud , it takes a lot of dissatisfaction for us to move .
And many software developers who once would have been writing whatever they wanted for PCs are simply developing less adventurous , less subversive , less game - changing code under the watchful eyes of Facebook and Apple .
If the market settles into a handful of gated cloud communities whose proprietors control the availability of new code , the time may come to ensure that their platforms do not discriminate .
Such a demand could take many forms , from an outright regulatory requirement to a more subtle set of incentives  tax breaks or liability relief  that nudge companies to maintain the kind of openness that earlier allowed them a level playing field on which they could lure users from competing , mighty incumbents .
We ’ve only just begun to measure this problem , even as we fly directly into the cloud .
That ’s not a reason to turn around .
But we must make sure the cloud does not hinder the creation of revolutionary software that , like the Web itself , can seem esoteric at first but utterly necessary later .
Supporters of the seals say they are a popular draw for tourists .
The Californian city of San Diego has been given 72 hours to remove harbour seals from a small beach area originally designated for children .
They were ordered by a judge to comply with an earlier order to clean up the Children 's Pool at La Jolla beach .
But lawyers for seal activists are planning to file a motion to block the move in what has been a decades - long battle over the issue .
The city plans to use the sound of barking dogs to scare off the seals .
They can not use force because the seals are a federally - protected marine species .
" We can't harm the seals in any way .
Any method we use basically has to be benign , " said Andrew Jones , assistant attorney for civil litigation .
He said the city planned to pay someone to walk along the beach with a public address system broadcasting the sounds of dogs - backed up by two police officers in case of trouble .
" There 's certainly a lot of emotions revolving around this issue , " he was quoted by Associated Press as saying .
" We expect that this person could be harassed , even physically attacked " .
City warning San Diego County Superior Court Judge Yuri Hoffman ruled on Monday that state law requires the beach be kept clean for children under a 1931 deed to the property .
If [ the seals ] do n't get their rest , their health will be jeopardised and the local community will also suffer a huge economic cost
Dorota Valli
Seal Watch
He ordered the city to comply with a 2005 order by another judge to restore the beach to its original condition .
However , supporters of the seals would like the area to be preserved as a sanctuary .
" The seals need rest each day , " Dorota Valli , Seal Watch campaign coordinator , told AP .
" If they do n't get their rest , their health will be jeopardised and the local community will also suffer a huge economic cost .
It 's an enormous tourist draw " .
The Children 's Pool - created by a sea wall built in 1931 through a gift by a La Jolla philanthropist - was donated to the city on condition it became a public area .
The seals began patronising the area in increasing numbers during the 1990s , AP reports .
Despite a city warning in 1997 not to use the pool because of high levels of bacteria from seal waste , people still continue to swim there .

The Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river around 11 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago .
These are the most significant results of a study on two boreholes drilled in proximity of the mouth of the Amazon River by Petrobras , the national oil company of Brazil .
A team formed by the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics ( IBED ) of the University of Amsterdam , the University of Liverpool and Petrobras used this new oceanic record to reconstruct the history of the Amazon River .
Until recently the Amazon Fan , a sediment column of around 10 kilometres in thickness , proved a hard nut to crack , and scientific drilling expeditions such as Ocean Drilling Program could only reach a fraction of it .
Recent exploration efforts by Petrobras lifted the veil , and sedimentological and paleontological analysis on samples from two boreholes , one of which 4.5 kilometres below sea floor , now permit an insight into the history of both Amazon River and Fan .
Prior to this publication the exact age of the Amazon River was unknown .
This research has large implications for our understanding of South American paleogeography and the evolution of aquatic organisms in Amazonia and the Atlantic coast .
It is a defining moment as a new ecosystem originates which at the same time forms a geographic divisor .
The importance of river sediment
Sediment aprons in the proximity of major rivers often hold continuous records of terrestrial material accumulated by the river over time .
These records provide a unique insight into the historic climate and geography of the land .
The information released from this 4.5 kilometre borehole is a scientific breakthrough and stresses the value of cooperation between academia and industry .
The study was published in the scientific journal Geology in July 2009 .
Inevitably I must go back to the topic of Honduras .
In spite of trying to dispel much of the disinformation floating about , people are still making the same incorrect claims .
Obama is now being accused of being a commie !
If we should be so lucky ! 😉
Here is an excellent article ( in Spanish ) on the coup that does a very good job of explaining the situation , but perhaps what ’s needed is more of an FAQ , though I ’m not calling it an FAQ because the questions that need asking are n’t actually being frequently asked .
So here ’s a little FUQ on the situation in Honduras ( you work out if the pun was intended ) .
Did n’t Zelaya break the law when calling the referendum to extend term limits ?
Zelaya did n’t call a referendum .
Zelaya did n’t call a consultation to extend term limits .
Zelaya called a non-binding popular consultation , essentially a poll , to find out what people thought of the idea of calling for a constituent assembly on the upcoming elections in November .
Right , but was n’t Zelaya ’s term over when the army acted because he wanted to keep in power ?
No , Zelaya ’s term ends at the end of this year .
In November there will be elections in Honduras , which will elect a new president .
The candidate list is already final .
Zelaya is not on it .
I must make this point again , because people seem to have some problems digesting it : the candidate list for the upcoming November elections in Honduras is already final , Zelaya is not on it .
OK , but the Constitution forbids an attempt to increase term limits : is n’t this what Zelaya was implicitly doing ?
No .
Let me go over this once more , slowly :
Zelaya did not call for a referendum .
The non-binding consultation did not refer to term limits .
Whatever would have been the result , Zelaya would stop being president at the end of his term .
OK , but a new constitution could have increased term limits , could n’t it ?
Yes–and then again , it could not .
The whole point is that a new constitution would be a new constitution .
By definition , it would be outside the constitutional purview of the currently existing instrument .
If it would have increased term limits , this would be a result of the constituting power of the sovereign people of Honduras democratically expressed in a constituent assembly .
Whatever the case would be , though , Zelaya would not directly benefit from it , certainly not these upcoming elections : the constituent assembly would have taken place after the elections , when Zelaya would have stopped being president of Honduras .
Right , but does n’t article 239 forbid the breach or modification , or direct or indirect support thereof , of the provision that sets presidential term limits ?
Yes , it does .
It is extremely far - fetched though , to believe that this provision is breached or modified by the non-binding consultation on whether to call a constituent assembly .
The following could have happened :
The people could have said no .
The people could have said yes , but the assembly not be convened ( Remember ?
Non-binding )
The assembly could have been convened and no agreement could have been reached on a new Constitution .
An agreement on a new Constitution could have been reached , and the people not have approved it .
The people could have approved the new Constitution , which could contain the same term limits .
Holding that all these contingencies can be ignored and that the popular consultation itself breaches article 239 is utterly laughable , and , not to put too fine a point on it , completely lacking in any basis in law .
If we ’re going to do a reductio ad absurdum , why not say running for elections breaches this disposition ?
After all the president of the republic is the one with the power to propose the popular consultation , placing themselves in the position to breach term limits !
Yeah , right .
The verbs on the article are clear : to breach ( not done ) and to propose its reform ( not done ) .
End of story .
A weak argument could be made that if the constituent assembly had been convened , people proposing the removal of term limits may be breaching this article .
It ’s a weak argument for several reasons , chief of it being that no constituting power can bind the future with its will .
If a constituent assembly were chosen by the people of Honduras and then through referendum the people would have chosen to rule itself under a new Constitution , the constituting power from 1982 has nothing to say about that .
No person can , even willfully , enter slavery , nor nation can be hostage of a Constitution : the people of Honduras is the full sovereign subject who can , if it so wishes , abolish this arrangement and institute a new one .
OK , but did n’t Zelaya breach the law , at least , when going against the Supreme Court ’s writ ?
Maybe .
This is a difficult question I do n’t pretend to have a definite answer for .
I do have a definite answer for some other issues that should be considered in reference to this question .
The popular consultation law had never been decreed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court .
Disobedience by the military to the president of the republic–whose chain of command terminates–is certainly contrary to law .
The president can dismiss military leaders who disobey orders , contrary to the Supreme Court ’s claim .
There is no provision in the Constitution or the laws for the president to be kidnapped and exiled by the military , completely without due process .
OK , so you say what the military did was not legal , how should they have gotten rid of a president who broke the laws ?
Zelaya probably did n’t break the laws , but let ’s assume for a second that he did .
The proper procedure in this case would be impeachment by the National Congress .
Let ’s recapitulate what actually happened : the president was kidnapped through force of arms , put into a plane , and flown abroad by the military ; a resignation letter was forged , and the president of Congress assumed the presidence of the republic .
Perhaps the president ’s exile was illegal , but did n’t the president of Congress have the right to assume power now ?
No .
Congress should have impeached , for which there are also some laws to follow , and which conditions are in all likelihood not satisfied .
Instead , Congress contradicts itself , claiming on the one hand the separation of the president from his powers due to breach of article 239 , and on the other hand the substitution by the president of Congress on the basis of that ludicrous ploy , the resignation letter .
Be honest here : does it look to you like Zelaya really did resign ?
OK , but now that Zelaya is abroad , is n’t the right thing to let the people of Honduras sort their own future out ?
Sure , and they are trying to do that , through protests , civil disobedience against the illegal de facto regime , and so on .
The people of Honduras want their constitution restored and their legitimate president reinstalled .
At least this is the feeling I get from most sources .
Incidentally , they ’re acting legally on the basis of article 3 of their Constitution , a rather elegant expression of the people ’s legitimate right of resistance against naked force and lawlessness .
But if Zelaya is reinstalled , communism will spread over the world , Chávez / the terrorists will win and America fwill lose a vital partner and a friend who protects its interests in Central America , wo n’t it ?
That ’s bad , is n’t it ?
To the first , all I can say is the same I ’ve said about Obama : if we should be so lucky !
To the second , bad for who : the US ?
Perhaps , in which case maybe it should consider stop giving implicit ( or even explicit ) backing to military coups in Latin America .
For the people of Honduras ?
It does n’t look that way to me , but , more to the point , it does n’t look that way to them : it ’s their country , it ’s their call .
In any event , in November they will be able to make these choices through democratic elections .
So let the sovereign people decide !

Political reporter , BBC News , Tory Spring Forum
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Conservative leader David Cameron has said he plans to " replace Labour 's spendaholic government with a new government of thrift " .
Mr Cameron told his party 's spring forum he wanted a " complete change of direction " on public spending .
And he vowed an end to Labour waste and " incompetence " .
Labour accused him of plotting tax cuts for the wealthy few at the expense of ordinary voters .
The Lib Dems said he had " bottled " tough decisions .
Mr Cameron received a standing ovation from delegates at Cheltenham racecourse for his speech , in which he set out his priorities for a general election campaign , which could be less than a year away .
He announced plans to name and shame overpaid civil servants , with a " people 's right to know " scheme .
A Tory government would publish all items of public spending over £ 25,000 on a website and all public sector salaries over £ 150,000 , he said .
He attacked Chancellor Alistair Darling 's new 50 % top tax rate as a " pathetic piece of class war posturing " aimed at distracting attention away from the " vast hole in the public finances " .
" When I see Brown and Darling , I 'm reminded of those people who come to your door ; one pretends to read your gas meter , while the other robs your house .
" 50 p income tax when you have a budget deficit of £ 175 bn ?
That 's not responsibility - it 's distraction burglary . "
Mr Cameron has so far resisted calls to make axing the new top rate a priority for an incoming Conservative government .
' Change of direction '
Responding to the dire state of the public finances revealed in Wednesday 's Budget , he said Britain was entering a " new age of austerity " and there needed to be a " complete change of direction " at the top .
He said any government would have to make cuts in the years ahead and he said he was not " frightened about their ( Labour 's ) idiotic ritual chants about Tory cuts " .
And he pledged to come up with more detailed proposals when the party had completed a study of the public finances .
He argued for a " whole new , never - been - done - before approach to the way the country is run " .
He told delegates : " Cutting out spending we can do without is not going to deliver the scale of change we need .
With a Conservative government , if ministers want to impress the boss , they 'll have to make their budgets smaller , not bigger
David Cameron
Conservative leader
Send us your reaction " Delivering more for less , on a sustained and long - term basis , cannot just be about top - down cuts imposed by ministers .
We need a massive culture change at every level of government , so the state is no longer casual , but careful , with public money . "
He listed examples of public sector waste and attacked what he said was the culture in government that " prizes profligacy over prudence " .
" With a Conservative government , if ministers want to impress the boss , they 'll have to make their budgets smaller , not bigger .
" On my watch it will be simple : if you do more for less you get promoted ; if you do less for more , you get sacked .
Today David Cameron once again showed that natural
Tory instinct to make the many suffer to pay for tax cuts for the very wealthiest
Alan Johnson , Health Secretary " If we'd had this approach over the last 12 years , I do n't suppose there 'd be a single minister left . "
He said the " culture of thrift " must also apply to the civil service , promising " a new fiduciary responsibility on senior civil servants - a contractual obligation to save the taxpayer money " and a " proper finance director " for every government department .
' Bottling out '
Mr Cameron earlier hit back at criticism from the right of his party that he should axe the 50 % top rate of tax
He also suggested in an interview with BBC One 's Politics
Show that his party 's inheritance tax plans might still be " operable " .
This prompted Labour to claim he was planning tax cuts for the few " at the expense of the many " .
Labour also seized on Mr Cameron 's call for the government to ditch its " irresponsible " plan to increase public spending by £ 20bn in 2010 .
Health Secretary Alan Johnson said : " Today David Cameron once again showed that natural Tory instinct to make the many suffer to pay for tax cuts for the very wealthiest .
" Behind all the marketing speak designed to disguise their true plans , David Cameron let slip today that he is considering cuts of £ 20 bn to public services and help for families .
" He also revealed today that he is so determined to cut taxes for the 3,000 wealthiest estates in the country that if he had to then he would ' put some taxes up ' to pay for it . "
Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable accused the Tories of " bottling out " of the debate on the " hard decisions " that had to be made by all parties on public spending .
" They can not wait until after the election before confronting all of this stuff , " he told the BBC News channel .

Over the course of the last few months we ’ve been talking quite a bit about incentives that the government is giving first time homebuyers in order to prod them into buying a home .
First there was a $ 7500 loan that homebuyers could pay back over time .
That was n’t an amazing deal , since you had to pay it back , but many took advantage .
Then earlier this year a new incentive was passed that gave first time homebuyers an $ 8000 refundable tax credit that they could claim on their 2008 or 2009 taxes .
When the FHA announced that you could use that $ 8000 credit towards a down payment , the deal became even sweeter .
Within the past week or so legislators began debating whether they should pass an additional $ 15,000 refundable tax credit for all homebuyers .
Besides all the tax credits that are being handed out right now , interest rates on home loans are still relatively low in comparison to where they were even a couple of years ago .
In 2006 - 2007 rates were upwards of 7 % for many homebuyers .
Now you can still find a rate below 5 % .
It ’s a buyers market , with home prices in many areas dropping upwards of 10 - 20 % in the past year .
If I were looking for a house right now , it would seem like an extremely good time to buy !
Just Because It ’s A Good Time To Buy A House , Does n’t Mean It ’s A Good Time For YOU
It ca n’t be denied , the market for first time homebuyers is pretty good right now .
But the question is this .
If the market is this good , should you be trying to buy a house – even if you ’re not really ready ?
I ’ve talked with friends who are considering buying a house right now .
They ’ve rented for years , and have recently become debt free .
They even had the foresight to start saving up for a down payment of 20 % .
For them , I think right now is the probably the perfect time to buy .
They can probably get more for their money , and save thousands in interest because of the lower interest rate they ’re getting .
I know another couple that is in a different situation .
They ’re in the middle of paying off a substantial amount of debt , and it ’s to the point where there debt payments are a big chunk of their income every month .
They also would like to buy a home instead of “ throwing away ” rent money every month , and they could probably find a house for about the same monthly payment as their rent payment .
If I were in their shoes I ’m not sure i would be looking to buy a house right now , even though they could do it for the same cost as the rent .
The problem is , there are a lot of costs associated with home ownership that people do n’t think about .
First , when closing on a home you ’re probably going to have closing costs , escrowed taxes and insurance , along with a ton of other small fees .
Add to that the ongoing maintenance and utility costs that go along with owning a home , and it quickly becomes an extremely expensive proposition .
So when you take the costs of home ownership ( which WILL be more expensive than renting in most cases ) and throw in a bunch of consumer debt , I think the risks of buying a home , even in a buyer ’s market can really outweigh the benefits .
The blessing of home ownership can quickly turn into a curse if even one or two small unforeseen events happen .
Lose a job or have a medical emergency , and you can end up barely making ends meet , or getting behind on your mortgage payments .
You ’ll end up becoming a slave to your nice new home .
Buy A Home When The Time Is Right For You
My advice when considering home ownership ?
Buy a house when the time is right for you , not when the market says the time is right .
If you ’re struggling to get out of debt and are on a strict budget , the time probably is n’t right .
Get your financial house in order , pay off your debts , and start saving for a 20 % down payment .
Buy when you know the home will be a blessing and not a curse .
If you ’re doing well financially , you ’ve paid off all debts and you ’ve got a nice down payment saved , the time might be right .
Talk it over with your spouse , find a house that will fit well into your budget , and take a look into all the programs available now for first time homebuyers .
You may find yourself an extremely good deal .
Have you been considered buying a new home right now , even though you ’re not completely ready ?
Have the good rates and low prices made your decision a tough one ?
Have you given in to buying a house even if you were n’t ready ?
Tell us about your experience in the comments .
From the ' did the web really win ? ' files :
I 've been blogging a lot lately about HTML 5 and its video component .
It 's a game changing element that is also competitive against the current pervasive web video technology -- Adobe Flash .
But what does Adobe think about HTML 5 ?
During Adobe 's second quarter fiscal 2009 investor call , Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen responded to a question from an analyst about what HTML 5 means to Adobe .
Narayen is both supportive of HTML 5 as a standard that Adobe tools will support , while also being dismissive of the competitive threat that HTML 5 video might represent to Flash .
Narayen sees a real challenge for HTML 5 will be getting a consistent HTML 5 display across browsers , which is going to take a long time to do .
" It might be a decade before HTML 5 sees standardization across the number of browsers that are going to be out there , " Narayen said on the call .
" So clearly supportive in terms of making sure as HTML 5 is evolving that we will support it in our web authoring tools but from the perspective of continuing to drive Flash and innovation around Flash and rich Internet applications , we still think that actually the fragmentation of browsers makes Flash even more important rather than less important .

Converted missile orbits six small satellites
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : July 29 , 2009
Six small satellites were launched Wednesday aboard a Dnepr rocket , delivering spacecraft into orbit for organizations in four countries .
Credit : TsENKI
The 111 - foot - tall booster , a converted ballistic missile now used for satellite launches , shot out of the underground silo in Kazakhstan at 1846 GMT ( 2:46 p.m. EDT ) .
After reaching the surface , the Dnepr fired its first stage engines to propel the rocket toward space .
The three - stage launcher was aiming for a sun-synchronous orbit with an altitude of about 420 miles and an inclination of 98 degrees .
The Dnepr 's third stage deployed the six satellites a few minutes later , completing the vehicle 's 13th flight .
A spokesperson for Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. , builder of two of the payloads , confirmed the Dnepr successfully released the satellites as planned .
Ground stations were expected to contact the spacecraft later Wednesday night .
Both SSTL - built satellites will join the international Disaster Monitoring Constellation , a fleet of small Earth - watching satellites designed to provide quick - response imagery to emergency managers worldwide .
The UK - DMC 2 and Deimos 1 satellites will gather wide - angle , medium - resolution images with optical payloads able to see objects about 72 feet across .
The spacecraft join four existing disaster monitoring satellites with less - capable imaging equipment .
Those payloads are owned by agencies in the U.K. , Nigeria , Algeria and China .
" The DMC has pioneered a new international partnership approach to Earth observation , providing unique data with high temporal resolution .
The success of the first DMC is now leading to the next generation of more advanced satellites in the constellation , " said Martin Sweeting , SSTL executive chairman .
UK - DMC 2 and Deimos 1 increase the fleet 's total imaging capacity twenty - fold , according to DMC International Imaging Ltd. , the firm that markets the constellation 's products .
Officials use the constellation 's images for mapping , urban planning , resource management , security and disaster relief purposes .
UK - DMC 2 weighs about 212 pounds and is a follow - on to a 6 - year - old first - generation disaster monitoring satellite .
The 200 - pound Deimos 1 spacecraft will be handed over to Deimos Space , a Spanish company that will operate the satellite during its mission .
Two Nigerian satellites , also built by SSTL , will join the DMC next year .
The Dnepr rocket also delivered DubaiSat 1 into orbit .
The six - sided satellite , weighing about 420 pounds , will be operated by the Dubai - based Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology for up to five years .
About the size of a washing machine , the small craft is the United Arab Emirates ' first satellite .
" DubaiSat 1 comes in line with the directions of our visionary leadership in enhancing knowledge and technological development , and embracing the latest achievements to position the UAE as the regional hub of the knowledge economy , " said Mohamed Nasser Al Ghanim , EIAST board chairman .
" The launch of DubaiSat 1 will pave the way for the further space projects that highlight the UAE 's thought - leadership role in space technology research . "
DubaiSat 1 was built by Satrec Initiative , a Korean company specializing in Earth observation satellites .
The spacecraft carries an optical imaging camera with a black - and - white resolution of about 8.2 feet and a color sharpness of 16.4 feet , according to EIAST .
DubaiSat 1 imagery will be used for urban development , scientific research , telecommunications , transportation , construction and mapping applications , according to EIAST .
Scientists will use the data for fog forecasts , predicting sand storms , water quality research and engineering tests , officials said .
Two 26 - pound American communications satellites orbited by the Dnepr will provide tracking and data monitoring services for companies with remote or mobile assets .
The spacecraft are owned by Aprize Satellite Inc. , a Virginia - based firm that hopes to lower the cost of satellite communications services .
A small testbed for the Spanish space agency was also launched Wednesday .
Nanosat 1B , stretching about 20 inches in diameter , will demonstrate basic space technologies .
Base Ten
You are undoubtedly already familiar with counting on your fingers in base ten , which is also called decimal .
In this manner of counting , each finger simply represents a quantity of one .
Every raised finger contributes to the total sum , which is at most ten .
Base Six Counting in base six is a little different .
Only six numerals ( 0 through 5 ) are needed to represent a number in base six .
Thus , we let each hand represent one digit of a base - six number .
The right hand can be the unit 's place ( 60 ) , and the left hand can be the six 's place ( 61 ) .
In this manner of counting , it is possible to count up to 55 6 , which is 35 in base ten .
Binary Counting in binary ( or base two ) is truly a skill to master .
Representing a number in binary only requires two numerals ( 0 and 1 ) .
Therefore , we can let each finger represent one digit of a binary number .
A raised finger represents a one ( 1 ) , and a lowered finger represents a zero ( 0 ) .
In this fashion , it is possible to count on your fingers up to 1,023 ( 29 + 28 + 27 + 26 + 25 + 24 + 23 + 22 + 21 + 20 ) .
However , caution is advised as the number four is prone to offend onlookers .
Binary Coded Decimal Binary Coded Decimal ( BCD ) is a type of numerical representation wherein each digit of a decimal number is represented by a four - digit binary number .
Four binary digits are more than sufficient for representing quantities of zero ( 0000 2 ) through nine ( 1001 2 ) .
So by letting four fingers on each hand represent a binary encoding of a decimal digit , it is possible to count up to 99 .
Hexadecimal Counting in base sixteen or hexadecimal is similar to counting in binary coded decimal .
The only difference is that hex requires sixteen numerals .
Since 24 equals 16 , four binary digits are sufficient to represent quantities from zero ( 0000 2 ) through fifteen ( 1111 2 ) .
Therefore , we let four fingers on each hand represent a binary encoding of a hexadecimal digit .
In this manner , it is possible to count up to FF 16 , which is 255 in base ten .
Turning Point ?
Noam Chomsky
chomsky.info , June 7 , 2009
The Obama - Netanyahu - Abbas meetings in May , followed by Obama ’s speech in Cairo , have been widely interpreted as a turning point in US Middle East policy , leading to consternation in some quarters , exuberance in others .
Fairly typical is Middle East analyst Dan Fromkin of the Washington Post , who sees “ signs Obama will promote a new regional peace initiative for the Middle East , much like the one championed by Jordan ’s King Abdullah … [ and also ] the first distinct signs that Obama is willing to play hardball with Israel . ” ( WP , May 29 ) .
A closer look , however , suggests considerable caution .
King Abdullah insists that “ There is no change to the Arab Peace Initiative , and there is no need to amend it .
Any talk about amending it , is baseless ” ( AFP , May 16 ) .
Abbas , regularly described as the president of the Palestinian Authority ( his term expired in January ) , firmly agrees .
The Arab Peace Initiative reiterates the long - standing international consensus that Israel must withdraw to the international border , perhaps with “ minor and mutual adjustments , ” to adopt official US terminology before it departed sharply from world opinion in 1971 , endorsing Israel ’s rejection of peace with Egypt in favor of settlement expansion ( in the northeast Sinai ) .
Furthermore , the consensus calls for a Palestinian state to be established in Gaza and the West Bank after Israel ’s withdrawal .
The Arab Initiative adds that the Arab states should then normalize relations with Israel .
The Initiative was later adopted by the Organization of Islamic States , including Iran ( Akiva Eldar , Ha’aretz , June 1 ) .
Obama has praised the Initiative and called on the Arab states to proceed to normalize relations with Israel .
But he has so far scrupulously evaded the core of the proposal , thus implicitly maintaining the US rejectionist stand that has blocked a diplomatic settlement since the 1970s along with its Israeli client , in virtual isolation .
There are no signs that Obama is willing even to consider the Arab Initiative , let alone “ promote ” it .
That was underscored in Obama ’s much heralded address to the Muslim world in Cairo on June 4 , to which I will return .
The US - Israel confrontation — with Abbas on the sidelines — turns on two phrases : “ Palestinian state ” and “ natural growth of settlements . ”
Let ’s consider these in turn .
Obama has indeed pronounced the words “ Palestinian state , ” echoing Bush .
In contrast , the ( unrevised ) 1999 platform of Israel ’s governing party , Netanyahu ’s Likud , “ flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan river . ”
Nevertheless , it was Netanyahu ’s 1996 government that was the first to use the phrase .
It agreed that Palestinians can call whatever fragments of Palestine are left to them “ a state ” if they like — or they can call them “ fried chicken ” ( David Bar - Illan , director of Communications and Policy Planning in the office of the Prime Minister ; Interview , Palestine - Israel Journal , Summer / Autumn 1996 ) .
The 1996 Netanyahu government ’s contemptuous reference to Palestinian aspirations was a shift towards accommodation in US - Israeli policy .
As he left office shortly before , Shimon Peres forcefully declared that there will never be a Palestinian state ( Amnon Barzilai , Ha’aretz , Oct 24 , 1995 ) .
Peres was reaffirming the official 1989 position of the US ( Bush - Baker ) and the Israeli coalition government ( Shamir - Peres ) that there can be no “ additional Palestinian state ” between Israel and Jordan — the latter declared to be a Palestinian state by US - Israeli fiat .
In the Peres - Shamir - Baker plan , barely reported ( if at all ) in the US , the fate of the occupied territories was to be settled in terms of the guidelines established by the government of Israel , and Palestinians were permitted to take part in negotiations only if they accepted these guidelines , which rule out Palestinian national rights .
Contrary to much misunderstanding , the Oslo agreements of September 1993 — the “ Day of Awe , ” as the press described it — changed little in this regard .
The Declaration of Principles accepted by all participants established that the end point of the process would be realization of the goals of UN 242 , which accords no rights to Palestinians .
And by then , the US had withdrawn its earlier interpretation of 242 as requiring Israeli withdrawal from the territories conquered in 1967 , leaving the matter open .
The Peres - Shamir - Baker declarations of 1989 were in response to the official Palestinian acceptance of the international consensus on a two - state solution in 1988 .
That proposal was first formally enunciated in 1976 in a Security Council resolution introduced by the major Arab states with the tacit support of the PLO , vetoed by the US ( again in 1980 ) .
Since then US - Israeli rejectionism has persisted unchanged , with one brief but significant exception , in President Clinton ’s final month in office .
Clinton recognized that the terms he had offered at the failed 2000 Camp David meetings were not acceptable to any Palestinians , and in December , proposed his “ parameters , ” inexplicit but more forthcoming .
He then announced that both sides had accepted the parameters , though both had reservations .
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met in Taba Egypt to iron out the differences , and made considerable progress .
A full resolution could have been reached in a few more days , they announced in their final joint press conference .
But Israel called off the negotiations prematurely , and they have not been formally resumed .
The single exception suggests that if an American president were willing to tolerate a meaningful diplomatic settlement , it might very well be reached .
The facts are well documented in Hebrew and English sources ( for review , see Chomsky , Failed States ) .
But like much of the relevant history , they are regularly reshaped to suit doctrinal needs ; for example by Jeffrey Goldberg , who writes that “ By December of 2000 , Israel had accepted President Bill Clinton ’s `parameters , ’ offering the Palestinians all of the Gaza Strip , 94 percent to 96 percent of the West Bank and sovereignty over Arab areas of East Jerusalem .
Arafat again rejected the deal ” ( NYT , May 24 ) .
That is a convenient tale , false or seriously misleading in all particulars , and another useful contribution to US - Israeli rejectionism .
Returning to the phrase “ Palestinian state , ” the crucial question on the US side is whether Obama means the international consensus or “ fried chicken . ”
So far that remains unanswered , except by studious omission , and — crucially — by Washington ’s steady funding of Israel ’s programs of settlement and development in the West Bank .
All of these programs violate international law , as Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan conceded in 1967 and as has been reaffirmed by the Security Council and the World Court .
Probably Netanyahu would still accept his 1996 position .
The contours of “ fried chicken ” are being carved into the landscape daily by US - backed Israeli programs .
The general goals were outlined by Prime Minister Olmert in May 2006 in his “ Convergence program , ” later expanded to “ Convergence plus . ”
Under “ Convergence , ” Israel was to take over the territory within the illegal “ separation wall ” along with the Jordan Valley , thus imprisoning what is left , which is broken into cantons by several salients extending to the East .
Israel also takes over Greater Jerusalem , the site of most of its current construction projects , driving out many Arabs .
These Jerusalem projects not only violate international law , as do all the others , but also Security Council resolutions ( at the time , still backed by the US ) .
The plans being executed right now are designed to leave Israel in control of the most valuable land in the West Bank , with Palestinians confined to unviable fragments , all separated from Jerusalem , the traditional center of Palestinian life .
The “ separation wall ” also establishes Israeli control of the West Bank aquifer .
Hence Israel will be able to continue to ensure that Palestinians receive one - fourth as much water as Israelis , as the World Bank reported in April , in some cases below minimum recommended levels .
In the other part of Palestine , Gaza , regular Israeli bombardment and the cruel siege reduce consumption far below .
Obama continues to support all of these programs , and has even called for substantially increasing military aid to Israel for an unprecedented ten years ( Stephen Zunes , Foreign Policy in Focus , March 4 ) .
It appears , then , that Palestinians may be offered fried chicken , but nothing more .
Israel ’s forced separation of Gaza from the West Bank since 1991 , intensified with US support after a free election in January 2006 came out “ the wrong way , ” has also been studiously ignored in Obama ’s “ new initiative , ” thus further undermining prospects for any viable Palestinian state .
Gaza ’s forced separation from Palestine , and its miserable condition , have been almost entirely consigned to oblivion , an atrocity to which we should not contribute by tacit consent .
Israeli journalist Amira Hass , one of the leading specialists on Gaza writes that “ The restrictions on Palestinian movement that Israel introduced in January 1991 reversed a process that had been initiated in June 1967 .
Back then , and for the first time since 1948 , a large portion of the Palestinian people again lived in the open territory of a single country –to be sure , one that was occupied , but was nevertheless whole …
The total separation of the Gaza Strip from the West Bank is one of the greatest achievements of Israeli politics , whose overarching objective is to prevent a solution based on international decisions and understandings and instead dictate an arrangement based on Israel ’s military superiority …
Since January 1991 , Israel has bureaucratically and logistically merely perfected the split and the separation : not only between Palestinians in the occupied territories and their brothers in Israel , but also between the Palestinian residents of Jerusalem and those in the rest of the territories and between Gazans and West Bankers / Jerusalemites .
Jews live in this same piece of land within a superior and separate system of privileges , laws , services , physical infrastructure and freedom of movement ” ( April 24 , BitterLemons.org ) .
The leading academic specialist on Gaza , Sara Roy , adds that “ Gaza is an example of a society that has been deliberately reduced to a state of abject destitution , its once productive population transformed into one of aid - dependent paupers …
Gaza ’s subjection began long before Israel ’s recent war against it .
The Israeli occupation–now largely forgotten or denied by the international community –has devastated Gaza ’s economy and people , especially since 2006 … After Israel ’s December [ 2008 ] assault , Gaza ’s already compromised conditions have become virtually unlivable .
Livelihoods , homes , and public infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed on a scale that even the Israel Defense Forces admitted was indefensible .
In Gaza today , there is no private sector to speak of and no industry .
80 percent of Gaza ’s agricultural crops were destroyed and Israel continues to snipe at farmers attempting to plant and tend fields near the well - fenced and patrolled border .
Most productive activity has been extinguished …
Today , 96 percent of Gaza ’s population of 1.4 million is dependent on humanitarian aid for basic needs .
According to the World Food Programme , the Gaza Strip requires a minimum of 400 trucks of food every day just to meet the basic nutritional needs of the population .
Yet , despite a 22 March decision by the Israeli cabinet to lift all restrictions on foodstuffs entering Gaza , only 653 trucks of food and other supplies were allowed entry during the week of May 10 , at best meeting 23 percent of required need ..
Israel now allows only 30 to 40 commercial items to enter Gaza compared to 4,000 approved products prior to June 2006 . ” ( Harvard Crimson , June 2 , 2009 ) .
It can not be too often stressed that Israel had no credible pretext for its December attack on Gaza , with full US support and illegally using US weapons .
Near - universal opinion asserts the contrary , claiming that that Israel was acting in self - defense .
That is utterly unsustainable , in light of Israel ’s flat rejection of peaceful means that were readily available ( see Chomsky , “ Exterminate all the Brutes , ” updated footnoted version at www.chomsky.info).
That aside , Israel ’s siege of Gaza is itself an act of war , as Israel of all countries certainly recognizes , having repeatedly justified launching major wars on grounds of partial restrictions on its access to the outside world .
One crucial element of Israel ’s siege , little reported , is the naval blockade .
Peter Beaumont reports from Gaza that “ On its coastal littoral , Gaza ’s limitations are marked by a different fence where the bars are Israeli gunboats with their huge wakes , scurrying beyond the Palestinian fishing boats and preventing them from going outside a zone imposed by the warships . ” ( Guardian , 27 May ) .
According to reports from the scene , the naval siege has been tightened steadily since 2000 .
Fishing boats have been driven steadily out of Gaza ’s territorial waters and towards the shore by Israeli gunboats , often violently without warning and with many casualties .
As a result of these naval actions , Gaza ’s fishing industry has virtually collapsed ; fishing is impossible near shore because of the contamination caused by Israel ’s regular attacks , including the destruction of power plants and sewage facilities .
These Israeli naval attacks began shortly after the discovery by the British Gas group of what appear to be quite sizeable natural gas fields in Gaza ’s territorial waters .
Industry journals report that Israel is already appropriating these Gazan resources for its own use , part of its commitment to shift its economy to natural gas .
The standard source , Platt ’s Commodity News , reports ( Feb. 3 , 16 ) that “ Israel ’s finance ministry has given the Israel Electric Corp. approval to purchase larger quantities of natural gas from BG than originally agreed upon , according to Israeli government sources [ which ] said the state - owned utility would be able to negotiate for as much as 1.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from the Marine field located off the Mediterranean coast of the Palestinian controlled Gaza Strip .
Last year the Israeli government approved the purchase of 800 million cubic meters of gas from the field by the IEC … .
Recently the Israeli government changed its policy and decided the state - owned utility could buy the entire quantity of gas from the Gaza Marine field .
Previously the government had said the IEC could buy half the total amount and the remainder would be bought by private power producers . ”
The pillage of what could become a major source of income for Palestine is surely known to US authorities .
It is only reasonable to suppose that the intention to steal Palestine ’s limited resources is the motive for preventing Gaza fishing boats to enter Gaza ’s territorial waters .
It would also not be a great surprise if we were to discover some day that the same intention was in the background of the criminal US - Israeli attack on Gaza in December 2008 .
The restrictions on movement used to destroy Gaza have long been in force in the West Bank as well , with grim effects on life and the economy .
The World Bank has just reported that Israel has established “ a complex closure regime that restricts Palestinian access to large areas of the West Bank …
The Palestinian economy has remained stagnant , largely because of the sharp downturn in Gaza and Israel ’s continued restrictions on Palestinian trade and movement in the West Bank . ”
The Bank “ cited Israeli roadblocks and checkpoints hindering trade and travel , as well as restrictions on Palestinian building in the West Bank , where the Western - backed government of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas holds sway ” ( AP ; Avi Issacharoff , Ha’aretz ; May 6 ) .
All of this constitutes what Israeli activist Jeff Halper calls a “ matrix of control ” to subdue the colonized population , in pursuit of Defense Minister Moshe Dayan ’s recommendation to his colleagues shortly after the 1967 conquests that we must tell the Palestinians in the territories that “ we have no solution , you shall continue to live like dogs , and whoever wishes may leave , and we will see where this process leads ” ( Yossi Beilin , Mehiro shel Ihud , 42 ) .
Turning to the second bone of contention , settlements , there is indeed a confrontation , but it may again be less dramatic than portrayed .
Washington ’s position was presented most strongly in Hilary Clinton ’s much - quoted statement rejecting “ natural growth exceptions ” to the policy opposing new settlements .
Netanyahu , along with President Peres and in fact virtually the whole Israeli political spectrum , insists on permitting “ natural growth ” within the areas that Israel intends to annex , complaining that the US is backing down on Bush ’s authorization of such expansion within his “ vision ” of a Palestinian state .
Senior Netanyahu cabinet members have gone further .
Minister Yisrael Katz announced that “ the current Israeli government will not accept in any way the freezing of legal settlement activity in Judea and Samaria . ” ( Ha’aretz , May 31 ) .
The term “ legal ” in US - Israeli parlance means “ illegal , but authorized by the government of Israel . ”
In this usage , unauthorized outposts are termed “ illegal , ” though apart from the dictates of the powerful , they are no more illegal than the settlements granted to Israel under Bush ’s “ vision . ”
The harsh Obama - Clinton formulation is not new .
It repeats the wording of the 2003 Road Map , which stipulates that in Phase I , “ Israel freezes all settlement activity ( including natural growth of settlements ) . ”
All sides formally accept the Road Map — consistently overlooking the fact that Israel , with US support , at once added 14 “ reservations ” that render it inoperable .
If Obama were serious about opposing settlement expansion , he could easily proceed with concrete measures , for example , by reducing US aid by the amount devoted to this purpose .
That would hardly be a radical or courageous move .
The Bush I administration did so ( reducing loan guarantees ) , but after the Oslo accord in 1993 , President Clinton left calculations to the government of Israel .
Unsurprisingly , , there was “ no change in the expenditures flowing to the settlements , ” the Israeli press reported : “ [ Prime Minister ] Rabin will continue not to dry out the settlements , ” the report concludes .
“ And the Americans ?
They will understand ” ( Hadashot , Oct. 8 ; Yair Fidel , Hadashot Supplement , Oct. 29 , 1993 ) .
Obama administration officials informed the press that the Bush I measures are “ not under discussion , ” and that pressures will be “ largely symbolic ” ( Helene Cooper , NYT , June 1 ) .
In short , Obama “ understands . ”
The US press reports that “ A partial freeze has been in place for several years , but settlers have found ways around the strictures … construction in the settlements has slowed but never stopped , continuing at an annual rate of about 1,500 to 2,000 units over the past three years .
If building continues at the 2008 rate , the 46,500 units already approved will be completed in about 20 years …
If Israel built all the housing units already approved in the nation ’s overall master plan for settlements , it would almost double the number of settler homes in the West Bank ” ( Isabel Kirshner , NYT , June 2 ) .
The probable source , Peace Now , which monitors settlement activities , estimates further that the two largest settlements would double in size : Ariel and Ma’aleh Adumim , built mainly during the Oslo years in the salients that subdivide the West Bank into cantons .
“ Natural population growth ” is largely a myth , Israel ’s leading diplomatic correspondent , Akiva Eldar , points out , citing demographic studies by Col ( res. )
Shaul Arieli , deputy military secretary to former prime minister and incumbent defense minister Ehud Barak .
Settlement growth consists largely of Israeli immigrants in violation of the Geneva Conventions , assisted with generous subsidies .
Much of it is in direct violation of formal Government decisions , but carried out with the authorization of the Government , specifically Barak , considered a dove in the Israeli spectrum ( Eldar , Ha’aretz , June 2 ) .
Some deride the “ long - dormant Palestinian fantasy , ” revived by Abbas , “ that the United States will simply force Israel to make critical concessions , whether or not its democratic government agrees ” ( Jackson Diehl , WP , May 29 ) .
He does not explain whether refusal to participate in Israel ’s illegal expansion — which , if serious , would “ force Israel to make critical concessions ” — would be improper interference in Israel ’s democracy .
Diehl also refers to a recent Olmert peace plan of unprecedented generosity offered to Abbas , which he turned down , though it yielded just about everything to which Palestinians might reasonably aspire .
Others have also confidently referred to this mysterious plan and its rejection by Abbas .
Efforts to unearth the plan have so far been unavailing .
The only sources detected in an assiduous search by David Peterson are comments by Palestinians in the Arab media that appear to be part of internal conflict about power sharing , not the usual source for Western commentators .
Eliot Abrams dates the plan to January 2009 ( WP , April 8 , citing unspecified press reports , while also falsifying earlier plans for which records exist ; June 3 response to query about his sources ) .
If there were any truth to this tale , one can be confident that it would be trumpeted by Israeli propaganda and its enthusiasts here , as a welcome demonstration that Palestinians simply will not accept peace , even the most moderate of them .
It is highly dubious on other grounds .
For one thing , Olmert was in no position to offer any credible proposal , having announced his resignation as he was facing indictment for serious corruption charges .
The alleged plan is also hard to reconcile with the steady ongoing expansion of settlement under Olmert , vitiating even far less forthcoming offers .
Returning to reality , all of these discussions about settlement expansion evade the most crucial issue about settlements : what Israel has already established in the West Bank .
The evasion tacitly concedes that the illegal settlement programs already in place are somehow acceptable ( putting aside the Golan heights , annexed in violation of Security Council orders ) — though the Bush “ vision , ” apparently accepted by Obama , moves from tacit to explicit .
What is in place already suffices to ensure that there can be no viable Palestinian self - determination .
Hence there is every indication that even on the unlikely assumption that “ natural growth ” will be ended , US - Israeli rejectionism will persist , blocking the international consensus as before .
It might be different if a legitimate “ land swap ” were under consideration , a solution approached at Taba and spelled out more fully in the Geneva Accord reached in informal high - level Israel - Palestine negotiations .
The Accord was presented in Geneva in October 2003 , welcomed by much of the world , rejected by Israel , and ignored by the US .
There is a “ land swap ” under consideration , but a radically different one .
The ultra -right Israeli leader Avigdor Lieberman , now Foreign Minister , proposed to reduce the non-Jewish population of Israel by transferring concentrations of Israeli Arabs ( specifically , Wadi Ara in the Galilee ) to a derisory “ Palestinian state ” — over the overwhelming opposition of the victims , to be sure .
When first advanced , these ideas were denounced as virtually neo - Nazi — which is a little odd ; they were first proposed by Democratic Socialist political philosopher Michael Walzer , who wrote 30 years before Lieberman that those who are “ marginal to the nation ” ( Palestinians ) should be “ helped to leave ” in the interests of peace and justice .
These ideas have now shifted to the political center in Israel , and are praised by New York Times Israel correspondent Ethan Bronner , who writes that the left likes Lieberman ’s “ willingness to create two states , one Jewish , one Palestinian , which would involve yielding areas that are now part of Israel ” in a land swap ( NYT , Feb. 12 ) — a polite way of saying that Israeli citizens of the wrong ethnicity will be transferred by force from a rich first world country to “ fried chicken . ”
Obama ’s June 4 Cairo address to the Muslim world kept pretty much to his well - honed “ blank slate ” style — saying very little of substance , but in a personable manner that allows listeners to write on the slate what they want to hear .
CNN captured its spirit in headlining a report “ Obama looks to reach the soul of the Muslim world . ”
Obama had announced the goals of his address in an interview with NYT columnistThomas Friedman ( June 3 ) : “ `We have a joke around the White House , ’ the president said .
ÔWe ’re just going to keep on telling the truth until it stops working — and nowhere is truth - telling more important than the Middle East ’ . ”
The White House commitment is most welcome , but it is useful to see how it translates into practice .
Obama admonished his audience that it is easy to “ point fingers …
But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other , then we will be blind to the truth : the only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states , where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security . ”
Turning to truth , there is a third side , with a decisive role throughout : the US .
But that participant in the conflict is unmentioned .
The omission is understood to be normal and appropriate , hence unmentioned : Friedman ’s column is headlined “ Obama speech aimed at both Arabs and Israelis ” ; the front - page Wall St. Journal report on Obama ’s speech appears under the heading “ Obama Chides Israel , Arabs In His Overture to Muslims . ”
Other reports are the same .
The convention is understandable on the doctrinal principle that though the US government sometimes makes “ mistakes , ” its intentions are by definition benign .
Washington has always sought desperately to be an honest broker , only yearning to advance peace and justice .
The doctrine trumps truth , of which there is no hint in the speech or the mainstream coverage .
Obama once again echoed Bush ’s advocacy of two states , without saying what he means by the phrase “ Palestinian state . ”
His intentions are clarified not only by crucial omission , but also by his one explicit criticism of Israel : “ The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements .
This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace .
It is time for these settlements to stop ” ( my emphasis ) .
That is , Israel should live up to Phase I of the 2003 Road Map , though the truth is that Obama has ruled out even steps of the Bush I variety to withdraw from participation in these crimes .
The operative words are “ legitimacy ” and “ continued . ”
By omission , Obama indicates that he accepts Bush ’s “ vision ” : the vast existing settlement project and infrastructure is “ legitimate , ” thus ensuring that the phrase “ Palestinian state ” means “ fried chicken . ”
Even -handed , Obama also had an admonition for the Arab States : they “ must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning , but not the end of their responsibilities . ”
Plainly , it cannot be a meaningful “ beginning ” if Obama continues to reject its core principles : implementation of the international consensus .
But to do so is evidently not Washington ’s “ responsibility ” in Obama ’s vision , presumably because the US has no responsibilities other than to persist in its traditional vocation of doing good .
On democracy , Obama said that “ we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election ” — as in January 2006 , when Washington turned at once to severe punishment of the Palestinians because it did not like the outcome of the peaceful election .
Obama politely refrained from comment about his host , President Mubarak , one of the most brutal dictators in the region , though elsewhere he has had some illuminating words about him .
As he was about to board the plane to Saudi Arabia and Egypt , the two “ moderate ” Arab states , “ Mr. Obama signaled that while he would mention American concerns about human rights in Egypt , he would not challenge Mr. Mubarak too sharply , calling him a `force for stability and good ’ in the Middle East … Mr. Obama said he did not regard Mr. Mubarak as an authoritarian leader .
` No , I tend not to use labels for folks , ’ Mr. Obama said .
The president noted that there had been criticism `of the manner in which politics operates in Egypt , ’ but he also said that Mr. Mubarak had been `a stalwart ally , in many respects , to the United States ' ” ( Jeff Zeleyna and Michael Slackman , NYT , June 4 ) .
Obama also had observations on nuclear weapons , a matter of no slight significance in the light of his focus on Iran .
Obama repeated his hope for their general abolition and called on all signers of the Non-Proliferation Treaty to abide by the responsibilities it imposes .
His comments pointedly excluded Israel , which is not a signer of the NPT , along with India and Pakistan , all of them supported by the US in their development of nuclear weapons — Pakistan particularly under Reagan , India under Bush II .
India and Pakistan are now escalating their nuclear weapons programs to a level that is highly threatening ( see , e.g. , Jeffrey Smith and Joby Warrick , “ Nuclear Aims By Pakistan , India Prompt U.S. Concern , ” WP , May 28 , 2009 ) .
But our significant role in this confrontation confers no “ responsibility . ”
Some who are placing their hopes in Obama have cited remarks of Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller : “ Universal adherence to the NPT itself – including by India , Israel , Pakistan and North Korea – also remains a fundamental objective of the United States . ”
But the threat that her comment might mean something was quickly allayed by the report of a senior Israeli diplomat that Israel had received assurances that Obama “ will not force Israel to state publicly whether it has nuclear weapons , … [ but will ] stick to a decades - old U.S. policy of `do n’t ask , do n’t tell ’ . ”
And as the Institute for Public Accuracy was quick to remind us , the Bush administration had also adopted Gottemoeller ’s stand , calling for “ universal adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
( Julian Borger , Guardian , May 6 .
Reuters , May 21 , http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLL942309.
http://www.accuracy.org/newsrelease.php?articleId=222.).
It appears , then , that “ universality ” applies to Iran ’s alleged programs , but not to the actual ones of US allies and clients — not to speak of Washington ’s own obligations under the NPT .
With regard to Iran ’s nuclear programs , Obama chose his words carefully .
He said that “ any nation — including Iran — should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . ”
His words again reiterate the Bush administration ’s position : it too held that Iran could “ access peaceful nuclear power . ”
But the contentious issue has been whether Iran has the rights guaranteed to signers of the NPT under Article IV : “ Nothing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I and II of this Treaty , ” which refer to nuclear weapons .
There is a considerable difference between research and production , as Article IV permits , and “ access , ” which Bush and Obama are willing to permit , meaning access from the outside .
That has been the heart of the dispute , and remains so .
The Non-aligned Movement , most of the world ’s states , has forcefully affirmed Iran ’s position ( which is also supported by the majority of Americans ) .
The “ international community ” — a technical term referring to Washington and whoever happens to agree with it — opposes allowing Iran the rights guaranteed to NPT signers , and Obama , by careful choice of misleading words , indicates his continued adherence to this stand .
There is a sensible approach to the threat of nuclear weapons in the region : to join in the overwhelming international support ( including a large majority of Americans ) for a nuclear - weapons - free zone including Iran , Israel , and US forces deployed there .
Adequate verification is by no means impossible .
That should mitigate , if not terminate , the regional nuclear weapons threat .
But it is not on the agenda .
It is too easily forgotten that the US is officially committed to establishing a NWFZ in the region , in accord with Security Council Resolution 687 in 1991 .
This Resolution assumes special significance for the US and UK , because they appealed to it in their half - hearted attempt to provide at least some thin legal basis for their invasion of Iraq .
The resolution calls for elimination of Iraqi WMD and delivery systems , as a step towards “ the goal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery and the objective of a global ban on chemical weapons ” ( Article 14 ) .
Since that includes Israel , it was never intended seriously by the US and UK , and it was quickly dispatched to the memory hole along with other inconvenient truths that escape the commitment to “ keep on telling the truth until it stops working . ”
It should perhaps be added that despite much fevered rhetoric , rational souls understand that the Iranian threat is not the threat of attack — which would be suicidal .
Wayne White , former deputy director of the Near East and South Asia office of State Department intelligence ( INR ) , quite plausibly estimates the likelihood that the Iranian leaders would carry out “ some quixotic attack against Israel with a nuclear weapon , ” thus instantly destroying Iran and themselves , as “ down there with that 1 percent possibility . ”
Also timely is his confirmation , from direct knowledge as the INR Iraq intelligence analyst at the time , that Israel ’s 1981 attack on Iraq ’s nuclear reactor did not end Saddam ’s nuclear weapons program , but initiated it .
No one wants Iran — or anyone — to develop nuclear weapons , but it should be recognized that the perceived threat is not that they will be used in a suicide mission , but rather the threat of deterrence of US - Israeli actions to extend their domination of the region .
And to repeat , if the concern were Iranian nuclear weapons , there would be sensible ways to proceed — to which , furthermore , the US is officially committed .
Obama ’s “ new initiative ” is spelled out more fully by John Kerry , the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate , now chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , in an important speech at the Brookings Institute on March 9 . ( http://kerry.senate.gov/cfm/record.cfm?id=309250).
In interpreting Kerry ’s words , we have to suspend normal rationality , and agree that the actual facts of history are completely irrelevant .
What is important is not the contrived picture of past and present , but the plans outlined .
Kerry urges that we acknowledge that our honorable efforts to bring about a political settlement have failed , primarily because of the unwillingness of the Arab states to make peace .
Furthermore , all of our efforts to “ to give the Israelis a legitimate partner for peace ” have foundered on Palestinian intransigence .
Now , however , there is a welcome change .
With the Arab Initiative of 2006 , the Arab states have finally signaled their willingness to accept Israel ’s presence in the region .
Even more promising is the “ unprecedented willingness among moderate Arab nations to work with Israel ” against our common enemy Iran .
“ Moderate ” here is used in its technical meaning : “ willing to conform to US demands , ” irrespective of the nature of the regime .
“ This re-alignment can help to lay the groundwork for progress towards peace , ” Kerry said , as we “ re-conceptualize ” the problem , focusing on the Iranian threat .
Kerry goes on to explain that there is also at last some hope that a “ legitimate partner ” can be found for our peace - loving Israeli ally : Abbas and the Palestinian Authority .
How then do we proceed to support Israel ’s new legitimate Palestinian partner ?
“ Most importantly , this means strengthening General [ Keith ] Dayton ’s efforts to train Palestinian security forces that can keep order and fight terror …
Recent developments have been extremely encouraging : During the invasion of Gaza , Palestinian Security Forces largely succeeded in maintaining calm in the West Bank amidst widespread expectations of civil unrest .
Obviously , more remains to be done , but we can help do it . ”
Routinely , Kerry describes the attack on Gaza as entirely right and just : by definition , since the US crucially participated in it .
It does n’t matter , then , that the pretext lacks any credibility , under principles that we all accept — with regard to others .
General Dayton ’s forces , armed and trained in Jordan with Israeli participation and supervision , are the soft side of population control .
The tougher and more brutal forces are those trained by the CIA : General Intelligence and Preventive Security .
Kerry is right that we can do more to ensure that West Bank Palestinians are so effectively controlled that they cannot even protest the slaughter in Gaza — let alone move towards meaningful self - determination .
For this task , the US can draw on a long history of colonial practice , developed in exquisite detail during the US occupation of the Philippines after the murderous conquest a century ago , then widely applied elsewhere .
This sophisticated refinement of traditional imperial practice has been highly successful in US dependencies , while also providing means of population control at home .
These matters are spelled out in groundbreaking work by historian Alfred McCoy ( Policing America ’s Empire , forthcoming ) .
Kerry should be familiar with these techniques from his service in South Vietnam .
Applying these measures to Palestine , collaborationist paramilitary forces can be employed to subdue the domestic population with the cooperation of privileged elites , granting the US and Israel free rein to carry forward Bush ’s “ vision ” and Olmert ’s Convergence - plus .
Gaza can meanwhile be kept under a strangling siege as a prison and occasional shooting gallery .
Washington ’s new initiative for Middle East peace , so it is hoped , will integrate Israel among the “ moderate ” Arab states as a bulwark for US domination of the vital energy - producing regions .
It fits well into Obama ’s broader programs for Afghanistan and Pakistan , where military operations are escalating and huge “ embassies ” are being constructed on the model of the city - within - a- city in Baghdad , clearly signaling Obama ’s intentions ( Saeed Shah and Warren Strobel , McClatchy Newspapers , May 27 ) .
The “ re-conceptualization ” is evidently satisfactory to US high tech industry , which continues to enhance its intimate relations with Israel .
One striking illustration as a gigantic installation that Intel is constructing in Israel to implement a revolutionary reduction in size of chips , expecting to set a new industry standard and to supply much of the world with parts from its Kiryat Gat facility .
Relations between US and Israeli military industry remain particularly close .
Israel continues to provide the US with a strategically located overseas military base for prepositioning weapons and other functions .
Intelligence cooperation goes back half a century .
These are among the unparalleled services that Israel provides for US militarism and global dominance .
They afford Israel a certain leeway to defy Washington ’s orders — though it is skating on thin ice if it tries to push its luck too far , as history has repeatedly shown .
So far the jingoist extremism of the current government has been constrained by more sober elements : for example , the shelving of the proposals to require a loyalty oath and to prevent citizens from commemorating the Nakba — the disaster for Palestinians in 1948 .
But if Israel goes too far , there might indeed erupt a confrontation of the kind that many commentators perceive today , so far , with little basis .

Bloomberg picked up on something that everyone who trades for a living already knows … correlation of asset classes has almost never been greater .
From Bloomberg via FT
Alphaville :
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index , whose increase in the past three months was the steepest in seven decades , is rallying in tandem with benchmark measures for raw materials , developing - country equities and hedge funds .
The so - called correlation coefficient that measures how closely markets rise and fall together has reached the highest levels ever , according to data compiled by Bloomberg . . .
Listening to brokers and traders banter about their individual fave stocks on line at Chirpin ’
Chicken at lunchtime , you get the sense that some market participants have n’t yet caught on to this , but most have .
I want to grab these guys and tell them how wide the rising tide is , and how futile it is to worry about the individual names right now … but then my chicken is ready , so I pay and I ’m out like a scout .
Not all stocks are correlated , but many of the major sectors are moving along with the overseas trade , enough so that the indices themselves are dragged along for the ride in each direction .
Also worth noting is that all of the hot themes have melded into one , from emerging markets to commodities to precious metals .
These groups are all moving in lockstep with each other as hedgies and growth mutual funds position themselves for an overseas recovery ( they got bored waiting for the US consumer to fire up the credit card and head to the mall … ai n’t happenin’ ) .
If you run a long portfolio for a fund family , you gotta go somewhere and many managers seem to be in agreement that these are the sectors to own .
Just how high is the current correlation between stocks , emerging markets and raw materials ?
Check it :
The correlation coefficient for the S&P 500 and the Reuters / Jeffries CRB index of commodities has been at 0.74 for the last 60 days .
A value of 1 means perfectly correlated , but to give you the historical significance of a reading of 0.74 — it ’s the highest correlation in at least five decades , according to Bloomberg .
And what of the fact that oil is moving so severely in tandem with the S&P 500 ?
And why are treasuries now moving with US stocks ?
This is dogs sleeping with cats stuff , guys .
I have a guess or two on why this may be transpiring ( centered around money flows rather than fundamentals ) but The Why is n’t what matters .
The real question is The How Long .

Advertisement More than 100 Romanian people who fled their homes in south Belfast have been moved to a leisure centre .
The group of about 20 families spent Tuesday night in a church hall after a spate of racist attacks on their homes .
Police have said they do not believe paramilitaries were involved in orchestrating the attacks .
The attacks were condemned by Prime Minister Gordon Brown who said he hoped the authorities would take all action necessary to protect the families .
Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness , who has met with the families , said the attacks were a " totally shameful episode " .
A Romanian woman covers her head as she arrives at a Belfast leisure centre " We need a collective effort to face down these criminals in society who are quite clearly intent on preying on vulnerable women and children , " he said .
The police have met Belfast City Council and social services to discuss how best to care for those affected by the attacks .
Most of the Romanian families , including one with a five - day - old girl , have been taken to the Ozone Leisure Centre in south Belfast , where they will spend the rest of the day .
They said they did not want to return to their Belfast homes .
Mr McGuinness and Junior Minister Jeffrey Donaldson visited the centre earlier on Wednesday .
Mr Donaldson said it was important people in Northern Ireland stood together .
He said : " I think it is important that the whole community shows a united front against this kind of racism . "
AT THE SCENE Mark Simpson , BBC News Looking at 115 Romanians huddled together on the floor of a Belfast church hall , it was possible to see the worst side of Northern Ireland - and the best - all at once .
The speed with which Pastor Malcolm Morgan and his team created a temporary home for 20 families was remarkable .
At the same time , the sight of men , women and children looking so helpless and scared was a stain on Northern Ireland 's international reputation .
Many of the families came to Belfast believing that the years of prejudice and narrow - mindedness were over .
However , it seems that in some parts of the city , racism is the new sectarianism .
Lord Mayor Naomi Long said she did not want to see families " driven from Belfast " .
" They have a right to be in Belfast .
They are part of the fabric of this city .
I want to see them treated with the respect and dignity that I would demand for any other citizen , " she said .
" This is a small number of people who are engaged in this violence .
I understand this is cold comfort to the people affected by it . "
Bernie Kelly , from Belfast Health and Social Care Trust , said it had been a very traumatic experience for the Romanians .
" The whole thing has escalated very quickly , " she said .
" Working with the police and all the agencies together we are going to have to find a resolution . "
There have been suspicions that a loyalist paramilitary group is involved in the violence , but this has been denied , our correspondent added .
One of the women who took shelter in the church , who did not want to be named , said she was very upset and scared .
She said she had feared the attackers had come to kill her and her family , and she now wanted to go back to Romania .
But the help of the church had shown a positive side to the people of Belfast as well , she added .

" They are really very frightened , " she said .
" The women , when they were talking to me yesterday , they were really upset , tears in their eyes and said , ' You know we love it here , we 'd like to live here , but we 're too scared . '
" A woman showed me her shoulder which was quite bruised and cut across , she was hit across the shoulder . "
Jolena Flett , Racial Harassment Adviser for the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities , said they had been threatened verbally and then three properties were attacked on the same day .
" There has been an issue about the families feeling unsafe in the properties they were attacked in .
What we are trying to do is provide them with alternative accommodation , " she said .

World Can't Wait has hit three stops of the Warped Tour ; Ventura , Pomona and San Francisco in California .
This year , the Warped Tour has a variety of bands .... from older political punks who are in their 30's and 40s ' to some Christian punk bands .
This drew a variety of age groups , including families who brought their kids out , to youth that came on their own .
The demographic was mainly white .
Many people were either in the military , came from a military family or had recently joined .
These were the materials we had at the " We Are Not Your Soldiers " tables : Orange bandannas that say “ We are not your soldiers ! " , stickers that read “ Army Wrong , " the What Are They Recruiting For ? pamphlet , the Anti-torture leaflet , a leaflet on abortion rights , the fact sheet from IVAW on military recruiting , and orange ribbons and flagging tape .
We went around to some of the other non-profit booths before the crowds came and got bandannas out to the volunteers .
Two bands also wore the orange bandannas and hung them from their booths .
There were a lot of strong visuals we had , including pictures of people being tortured , dead Iraqis and an enlargement of the poster of the movie " Sir , No Sir ! " .
In some areas , IVAW had a booth next to us which was a great dynamic .
The response to the " We Are Not Your Soldiers " message was positive and we drew the most controversy of any booth at Warped Tour .
People who came from outlying areas and small towns had different consciousness than the “ urban dwellers ” .
Some military families were opposed to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but said that they could n't take up the We Are Not You Soldiers message because it would be disrespectful to the troops .
We would get into sharp struggle over how yes , good people join the military , but there is nothing “ honorable ” about being a troop .
This is war for empire , and we made the point there were plans to go into Iraq before 9/11 even happened and people who are in the military are a part of a machine that is committing war crimes and crimes against humanity .
The troops are thinking human beings that can change , but we have to challenge them with the truth .
Other people were saying that they were over there fighting for our freedom and asked us if we support Al Qaida and the oppression of women ?
We boldly challenged people around this saying , no , the U.S is not fighting for freedom .
Al Qaida was n't even in Iraq until the U.S. invasion and Islamic fundamentalism has increased as a result of the U.S. occupation .
We talked about how neither U.S. Imperialism nor Islamic fundamentalism is in the interests of people around the world , and if you uphold one or the other in opposition to each other , you end up strengthening both .
We need to bring forward another way .
This really got people thinking , including reactionary people .
One woman was arguing very vehemently that the wars in Iraq were just and by the end of the conversation gave us a hug , thanked us for talking to her and ended up taking up the orange .
In some cases you had to remind people of basic history , that Bush lied about weapons of mass destruction and that Iraq had no connection with 9/11 .
A lot of youth were emboldened by us , walking by the table and saying “ There is no way , I would never join that military ” .
Some had even been trying to talk their siblings / friends out of joining .
A lot of the spontaneous hatred youth have for the military was mainly based upon viewing recruiters as predators or having a distaste for the whole “ military lifestyle . ”
One young woman said that she was in a civil lawsuit with the military after being recruited because they told her that she could join even though she had a certain health condition .
Her health worsened significantly as a result of joining and she really sees recruiters as scum .
There were high schoolers who came with us and they were talking to other high schoolers about what they were doing at their school to kick recruiters off , which was a a really important contribution to the whole mix .
Even though there is hatred for the military life and mentality there is not a lot of consciousness about the war itself .
There were some youth that were conscious and understood that the wars were n't about bringing “ democracy ' and understood it as imperialist aggression .
Overall progressive people did n't argue with us about Obama much , or insist that he was going to stop the war .
People said that they were disappointed in him .
In fact the people who talked about Obama the most were reactionaries who said that since we voted for Obama and he was continuing the war , that shows that this war is legitimate and necessary .
We told them that we did n't vote for Obama and that seemed to surprise them .
There were troops that said we did n't know what we were talking about because “ we were n't there . ”
Some of the guys from IVAW would step in and so they could n't really run that shit about “ not being there . ”
One debate with an anti-war vet and pro-war vet got really heated because you had people who had gone through the same experience but had come to understand the nature of the war very differently .
Surprisingly , a significant amount of military people acknowledge that rape , torture and civilian casualties happen all the time and they were for all of these things , because this is the way war is and we have to accept that .
We would counter that , pointing out that you get raised to believe that every war is an honorable war , but is this that kind of war , look at these pictures , these are children .
Is this the kind of war that you want to support ?
Many folks were shocked to find out that those who are being detained and tortured have been rounded up at random .
When reactionaries would come up and we would start debating , a small crowd would gather and people would really listen to what we had to say .
The most reactionary of the military were the ones that were Christian fundamentalist .
One guy truly believed this was a holy war between Christianity and Islam ..
We met vets and students who were interested in participating in the tour .
We would recruit youth on the spot to flier the crowds and there was a lot of interest in Oct 6 , the national day of resistance against military recruiting .
The polarization that was happening in the crowds was also happening between bands when one band bought atheist t- shirts from the Revolution table and this created some controversy among the Christian bands .
Warped tour is definitely the place to be this summer and there is a lot of potential in bringing forward a national day of mass resistance against recruiters .
We learned that it is essential to have minimum four person crew to work the table and the crowd ... but that we should strive to find more people to volunteer and participate so we can get out into the crowds and spread our message wide and create a vibe
We also learned that the more people you have wearing orange in the very beginning , at the different booths , it creates a scene of resistance .
We also learned that while it is important to have visuals that show the reality of torture and war , it is also important to have visuals of people resisting these crimes .
Weezer Rocks a MGMT - Lady Gaga Medley [ Video ]
Weezer basically dominates the two songs they are covering ( “ Kids ” by MGMT and “ Pokerface ” by Lady Gaga ) in this live performance video cut together from footage pulled from 5/09 live shows .
What ’s a little bit amazing , is that as of this writing ( tipd to it via Stereogum ) , the video has only has less than 10,000 views .
Guarantee that will change by the end of the week .
I ’m predicting upwards of two million .

Musical Savants
Meet an autistic piano player who can play back any piece he 's heard for the first time note for note .
A young man who finds drumming eases his Tourette 's syndrome .
An orthopedic surgeon who became obsessed with classical music after being struck by lightning .
And , finally , the man who studies their remarkable abilities , the neurologist Oliver Sacks , author of the book Musicophilia .
running time 9:47 Extraordinary Minds
After listening to the musical wizardry of the blind and autistic Derek Paravicini , Sacks and the BBC's Alan Yentob discuss what might be happening inside his brain .
Then we learn about Sacks 's own fascinating background , including his famous use of the drug L - dopa to help catatonic patients wake up temporarily .
running time 8:17 Drumming Up Relief Matt Giordano , a gifted drummer , talks with Sacks about how his pastime helps relieve the tics and other symptoms of his Tourette 's syndrome .
With this in mind , Sacks then muses on the various parts of the brain that are involved in music appreciation .
running time 9:56 Different Strokes Columbia University scientists watch functional MRI images of Sacks 's brain as he listens to a piece of music , then while he only imagines he 's listening to that same piece .
A single curious difference appears in the images .
Also , meet Anne Barker , a woman for whom music is just irritating noise .
running time 9:00 Of Bach and a Bolt Does Oliver Sacks 's brain love Bach as much as he says he does ?
The Columbia researchers are at it again , and their images provide intriguing answers to that and related questions .
We then meet Tony Cicoria , a previously non-musical person who began composing classical music after being hit by lightning .
running time 5:46 A Kind of Harmony Tony Cicoria gives the premiere performance of his " Lightning Sonata , " while Matt Giordano talks about how his drumming workshop is helping other Tourette 's sufferers .
And what of Derek Paravicini ?
He continues to play in a band , showing off his astonishing musical gifts .

Consumers are easily manipulated because :
they are bad at math ;
they shop with their heart rather than their head .
This means you might be wasting your money ( that is not so easy to earn ) because you are being manipulated .
Do you think this is fair ?
Would you like to be sure you are spending your money because you want , not because someone wants you to ?
Do you want to save ?
Then let ’s learn which tricks sellers may be using to manipulate your shopping behavior .
Shopping momentum
Shopping momentum occurs when a buyer literally “ ca n’t stop ” ‘ : the first purchase produces a psychological impulse that makes him / her buy more .
How this works : Shopping has two phases : deliberation and implementation .
The actual buying moves us from deliberation to implementation phase : we continue buying without returning to the deliberation stage .
How not to be tricked : break the shopping momentum .
A good way to do that is to pay by cash and use several envelopes / pockets where you take the money from :
counting cash makes you think : you thus return to the deliberation stage ;
paying from different envelopes forces you to return to the deliberation stage to think if the purchase was a good idea .
Confused consumers
A sales technique called “ disrupt - then - reframe ” can trick consumers into buying .
How this works : the seller first presents a confusing sales pitch to a customer and then restates the pitch in a more familiar way .
Meaning , they first utilize technical jargon , complex terminology or large product assortments and thus “ attract the consumer ’s attention ” who becomes eager to ‘ understand ’ the pitch .
How not to be tricked : in this case , knowledge is your best weapons .
Just remain cool - headed and realize you are being cheated .
Double discounts
Ironically , shoppers are more attracted to the double discount , even though it involves less savings .
An average American is not very good at maths , which is why a sale offering “ 20 % off the original price plus an additional 25 % off the already - reduced sale price ” is effective .
How this works : the maths behind this is both complex to explain and spot .
Say , one store offers 45 % discount , while another one offers 25 % + 25 % discount for the same product .
Which one do you feel is better ?
The second one ?
Wrong !
In reality , the second offer is about a ~ 43 percent discount , because the second discount is taken on the reduced amount after the first discount .
How not to be tricked : well , use a calculator !
Counting your money is the best way to save it .
So counting ho much you are actually saving will help you understand who is honest and who tries to trick you .

In a last - minute climbdown , the Chinese government announced today that it will delay the launch of censorship software that was supposed to have been sold in every computer from tomorrow .
The postponement comes after an unprecedented wave of online opposition , protests by foreign governments and calls by prominent bloggers for Chinese netizens to climb , attack and demonstrate against the " great firewall " .
Xinhua , the state news agency , reported the change of plan four hours before the software launch was due .
" China will delay the mandatory installation of the ' Green Dam - Youth Escort ' filtering software on new computers , " it said in a terse statement attributed to the ministry of industry and information technology .
The authorities looked likely to miss their deadline for the rollout of the software that blocks pornographic , violent and politically sensitive content .
The Guardian struggled to find a single retailer who had Green Dam either installed or bundled with computers .
Adding to the mystery , Lenovo , Sony , Dell and Hewlett Packard refused to comment on whether their PCs are now being shipped with the software , as the government ordered them to do last month .
The government says the software is necessary to clear the Chinese web of " harmful content " .
But critics say it is a misguided attempt to put the internet genie back in the bottle by a Communist party that now has to answer to about 300 million web users .
" Green Dam is a mini - great firewall placed inside every personal computer , " said Michael Anti , an influential blogger .
" The real logic behind it is that China is a big kindergarten in which even adults are treated as children that need to be ' protected ' . "
Isaac Mao , a prominent internet commentator , believes the government has made a big mistake : " I think this is the tipping point between the people rising up and those in power trying to suppress them .
The great firewall is overloaded and that is why the authorities are trying to move the focus of control to the desktop .
But it has annoyed a lot of people .
Not just liberals who want free speech but the young who see it as an intrusion into their personal lives . "
Although the plan has at least temporarily failed , it succeeded in mobilising people against the censors .
Wen Yuchao , a journalist and blogger who goes by the online name North Wind , said more than 1,000 netizens have signed up to his campaign to " climb " the firewall by signing up to proxy servers that bypass the government 's controls .
He said 15,000 people are joining TOR ‑ one of the most popular proxies ‑ every day , about double the normal rate .
Freegate , a proxy that was developed by Falun Gong , has also reported a sharp rise in demand .
Ai Weiwei , a prominent artist and freedom of expression champion , called for an internet boycott tomorrow .
" Thousands of netizens have said they will join the boycott .
People are starting to realise how important it is to tell the government what they want , " said Ai .
" There is nothing the authorities can do [ to stop us ] .
That is what is great about this .
It is personal but widespread . "
A group of bandit hackers , known as Anonymous , declared " war " on Green Dam and threatened to attack it tomorrow .
According to a source close to the group , they plan to create a remote computer ' bot ' that pummels Baidu , Kaixin and other mainland websites with data requests containing forbidden or sensitive terms , such as expletives , Falun Gong , Dalai Lama and " Fifty - cent party member " ( the derogatory name given to people paid to post pro-government comments online ) .
They hope the volume of dirty traffic will clog up the keyword filters .
It remains to be seen whether the government will go ahead with Green Dam or a watered - down version of it .
But bloggers and free speech advocates say the long - term trend is positive .
" More and more people have accepted ' internet - era values ' such as freedom of speech , access to information and participatory democracy , " said Michael Anti .
" These liberalised people or ' netizens ' are changing the social institutions , step by step .
In 10 years , more people will be [ on the net ] which will increase the chance of China having genuine democracy . "
A Greek man was stuck in a German airport for a week after getting lost .
Christianos Kaklamanis was reported missing in his home country after getting stranded at Hanover airport for seven days .
Travel agent Sabine Berger spotted the 38 - year - old looking confused and alerted police .
" I saw him a few times and at first just thought he was flying in and out of the airport a lot , " she said .
" But I soon realised that something was wrong and thought I better alert the authorities in case .
" I could n't believe it when I found out what had happened to him .
I 'm just glad he finally got home . "
Police sent Kaklamanis back to Athens and have since launched an investigation into how he became lost for a week .

This month I 've attempted to describe deep cultural and economic causal trends which are unaffected by stimulus packages and policy tweaks .
Here are several recent entries on this broad theme :
What Wo n't Change
( February 2 , 2009 )
The Middle Class Is Crumbling
( February 3 , 2009 )
Complacency and The Will To Radical Reform
( February 12 , 2009 )
Complacency and Scalability Traps
( February 14 , 2009 )
Structural causes identified in the above entries include :
1. demographics ( retirement benefits unaffordable )
2. financial deleveraging
3. top-heavy , high - cost U.S. economy
4. rising interest rates
5. de-scaling of large enterprises / structural job losses
6. scalability trap / structural job losses
7. crippling regulation and overhead burdens on small business
8. cultural complacency
9. " head - fake " drop in energy removes incentives for alternative energy
Let 's add a few more today .
In The Fall of the Roman Empire , author Michael Grant identified political disunity as one the one key causes of the fall of the Western Roman Empire ( Rome ) .
One engine of such disunity and squabbling , of course , is a deep - denial complacency : if a large percentage of the ruling class / citizenry sees nothing wrong , or counts on feeble " reforms " to resolve mounting global challenges , then they will hobble those seeking systemic , sweeping changes required to survive the challenges .
Another key reason for this crippling disunity is the resistance of the plutocracy / welfare recipients to any change in the status quo .
It may strike some as ironic that the two ends of the political spectrum are united in one goal : fiercely resisting any shifting of largesse / benefits .
At the top , the " fortunate 400 " in Roman society paid less and less tax as the crises mounted , while 300,000 fortunates at the bottom rung continued to draw free bread and 170 days of free public entertainment in Rome as the Empire collapsed inward on Rome .
We see plentiful evidence of both trends around us .
The number of political appointees who felt paying taxes was for plebians is not just embarrassing , it 's indicative of a broad cultural trend ; and it seems many of the riots we read about in western Europe stem from proposed cuts in what are essentially " bread and circuses " welfare benefits which the Empire can no longer afford to shower on its residents .
As the plutocracy contributes less and less to the finances of a heavily burdened central government , wealth disparity rises .
This trend has been firmly in place for years .
Friday Quiz : The Fortunate 400 ( January 30 , 2009 )
For ' Fortunate 400 , ' a Tumbling Tax Rate ( Wall Street Journal )
As in fast - declining Rome , the plutocracy is pleased to wield its wealth and influence to insure it pays 17 % tax rate ( much , much less when tax - free muni bonds are counted as income ) while the productive elements of the economy are saddled with 40 % - 50 % tax burdens .
Also as in headed - to - oblivion Rome , the plutocracy no longer contributes its sons and daughters to military service ; that is left to the poor .
Lastly , rigid ideological camps are creating disunity as the middle ( and the middle class ) are eroded .
Thus we have a Congress which united under pressure to give $ 700 billion in borrowed money to the banks under a Republican administration , and now under a Democratic administration the Republicans in Congress have belatedly discovered a deep desire for fiscal prudence -- a desire which they mysteriously lacked for the 8 years of the borrow - and - spend Bush administration .
Though it is impossible to summarize the wealth of information in Jared Diamond 's monumental Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed , it seems to me that the inability to see the underlying fragility of the environmental base of the economy was a key factor in the collapse of the cultures Diamond examines .
In an eerily similar way , the Powers That Be in the U.S. are essentially blind to the extreme fragility of the global energy complex , global fresh water supply , global soil reserves and the global public health system .
As many authors have detailed , a global economy without abundant cheap fossil fuels will be unable to feed and maintain 6.5 billion humans .
Though neither Grant nor Diamond mention this specifically , I note that the Roman plutocracy / central leadership obviously hoped that additional regulations and edicts would somehow turn the tide .
I see the same over - reliance on legal mechanisms and edicts and policy tweaks in the U.S. today .
A Congress of attorneys rather unsurprisingly is enamored of legalisms and laws and policy tweaks , and a plutocracy and welfare class wary of any reduction in benefits and tax breaks is pleased to hope tweaks and tucks will somehow maintain a crumbling status quo .
But as Donella Meadows outlined in her seminal paper , Leverage Points : Places to Intervene in a System ( Sustainability Institute ) , adjusting the perameters of a system has limited effects .
What this means is that fiddling around with " reforms " like increasing the fee paid by Medicare recipients by $ 10 will never make Medicare financially sustainable .
Ditto tweaking the gas mileage of the U.S. fleet by a mile or two , and 99.9 % of all the other " reforms " proposed and fought over .
What we have in essence is an over - regulated , overly complex , cost - heavy structure which we attempt to " fix " by adding further layers of complexity and overhead costs .
The idea that these incremental approaches can change the fundamental structural flaws is simply false ; their net effect will be to hasten the collapse of the systems they seek to repair .
This is what I call The Seductive Illusion of Incremental Change ( May 13 , 2008 ) .
As noted yesterday , Trainter 's The Collapse of Complex Societies suggests that at some point the citizenry of failing societies more or less choose to let their unsustainable systems topple over rather than continue the draining attempt to support the burden .
Disunity , complacency , growing wealth disparity , rising military and taxation burdens , fragile environmental foundations -- all these need only a sustained drought or energy shortage to tumble like dominoes .
While we 're on the subject of " collapse , " here are a few other relevant titles :

Several inexpensive USB audio interfaces have hit the market in the past year .
They cost between $ 50 and $ 150 , and offer a single channel mic preamp for use in small - scale portable recording and podcasting .
They provide a low - cost , easy way to begin home recording — a single mic and cable together with one of these USB preamps can be purchased for well under $ 300 and can provide a new recordist with sufficient tools to track guitar , bass , and vocals at home .
None of these will replace a multi-channel DAW — but they ’re not intended to .
These are great for web audio ( e.g. via Skype or iChat ) , for mobile or field use ( e.g. where AC power for your high - end rackmount preamps is unavailable ) , and for low - budget , one - or two - track home recording .
I sense the curling upper lip of your inner DAW snob .
How can these little all - on - one , bus - powered mic pre/ADC devices possibly sound good ?
I decided to find out .
The Contenders
My research led me to four USB mic pre’s that share a basic form factor : cylindrical , about 5 '' long and 3/4 '' in diameter .
Certainly there are other USB interfaces to try , like the ART USB tube pre , but I liked the idea of limiting the test to devices that shared whatever functional limitations might result from this small size .
From left to right in the picture , I tested the MXL Mic Mate , the Blue Icicle , the Shure X2U , and the CEntrance MicPort Pro .
Initial Impressions
It ’s clear even from the packaging that the Shure and CEntrance devices are intended for a higher - end market .
Simply put , both ship in boxes .
The Blue and MXL devices ship in plastic blister packs , the sort that inevitably cut you back when you cut them open .
I hate those things .
In the hand , as in the box , the Shure and CEntrance units are the most impressive of the lot .
It ’s all about the mass .
Woz and Jobs understood this when they loaded one of the early Apple computer models with weights so the computer would feel more substantial .
All the weight may well be in the casing , but the X2U definitely feels solid .
It ’s heavy , in fact .
The case is metal , with two slots for a carry strap .
Three thumbwheels on the face of the device control mic gain , headphone volume , and mix ratio .
A microswitch enables phantom power , which can be left on between sessions by leaving the switch engaged .
Three LEDs indicate USB connectivity , phantom power , and audio signal strength .
The controls on the X2U are smooth and certain .
The build quality is second to none .
The X2U looks and feels like a professional audio device that will last a long time .
It would not be out of place in a professional broadcast rig or recording studio .
In terms of initial impressions , the MicPort Pro runs a close second place to the Shure .
It ’s a lighter - weight device , but still feels solid .
Two rotary knobs on the side control preamp gain and headphone volume .
A button on the bottom of the unit toggles phantom power , which is indicated by a small LED .
I found the placement of the headphone jack and P48 button ( and LED ) on the MicPort Pro awkward .
They ’re on the bottom end of the cylinder ; their placement invariably required me to pick up the interface up to access them .
I wish these had been put on the shaft , where the other controls are .
The MXL Mic Mate is a simpler device .
It is a plain cast - aluminum cylinder with a USB jack at one end and an XLR jack at the other .
Midway along the barrel is a 3 - position switch marked “ HI MED LO , ” for mic gain .
Next to the switch is a red LED to indicate USB connectivity .
It all feels solid enough but somehow reminds me of inexpensive imported microphones .
Of course , many inexpensive imported microphones do a great job for the money .
We ’ll see if the same thing is true of the Mic Mate .
Based on this initial inspection , I was least impressed with the Blue Icicle .
It is both the longest and fattest of the four interfaces in this test , but the lightest weight .
At 45g , it feels insubstantial .
More critically , the casing feels very thin , and it sounds hollow when I tap it .
I think I could crush it or bend it in two without too much effort .
Put another way , you would n’t want to inadvertently step on this thing .
Do n’t let this end up on the studio floor with the cables .
The Icicle has a single control — a rotary gain knob located on the shaft of the device .
The embossed “ Icicle ” logo , and a ring around the gain knob light up to indicate USB power .
I ’m aware of Blue ’s predilection for whimsical design , but my impression of the Icicle is that it ’s a toy .
Needless to say , the sound is n’t in the design or the housing .
It was time to fire them up .
Test Setup
I tested all four interfaces in three basic applications : IP telephony ( Skype ) , voice recording and instrument recording .
For the recording tests , I used a freeware audio application called Audacity .
Apple ’s GarageBand would also work .
For voice tests , I first used a Karma K35 — a large - diaphragm FET condenser , set to Cardioid .
This is a basic imported condenser mic with a K67 - style capsule and a street price of about $ 170 .
I put the mic in a makeshift 2 'x2 ' x2 ' isolation chamber to reduce some of the ambient noise , and maintained a uniform distance of about 20 '' when recording the samples .
Then I repeated the VO test with a Shure SM57 , using a smaller “ booth ” ( about 10 ' ' wide by 15 '' tall ) and a closer working distance , about 8 ' ' .
The SM58 is a more - traditional choice for vocal applications , because the built - in foam windscreen reduces popping , but otherwise the two mics are the same — and the 57 sounded pretty good here .
For the instrument tests , I used an Avenson STO - 2 omnidirectional condenser , set up about six inches from the body of a hammer dulcimer .
I played several takes of the same chord progression with each USB interface , matching gain levels as closely as I could .
I repeated the test with a 3 Zigma CHI condenser , although with the small - diaphragm capsule rather than the lollipop head pictured here .
The CHI is the quietest mic I have ; its self - noise rating is just 7dBA .
( See our 3 - Zigma CHI microphone review . )
For the STO - 2 dulcimer test , I recorded the same passage into my DAW , a Black Lion modded Digi 002R .
All the above samples were recorded at 16 bits , 44.1 kHz , even though the MicPort Pro can run at 24/96 .
Gain
Proper gain staging is critical for any sort of recording .
Too little signal is far preferable to a signal that clips , but clearly the results are improved if the levels are sane .
The MXL Mic Mate proved frustrating because its output level is so low for quiet sources .
Even with the gain switched to the “ HI ” position , this device ’s output level was consistently and significantly lower than all of the other interfaces during my VO tests .
I tried it with multiple microphones , both condensers and dynamics , to see if there might be some sort of issue with phantom power or impedance .
But in every voice test , the Mic Mate produced the lowest - level signal .
The other three interfaces in this test include published gain specifications .
All three show a max level of +40dB .
I expected their output levels to therefore be equal ( at max gain ) , but this was not the case .
To get a handle on the issue , I plugged a pink noise generator into my stereo at a fixed volume , placed a mic in front of the speaker cone at a fixed distance , and recorded a sample of the noise with each of the USB audio interfaces .
In each case I set the USB interface to its max gain setting .
I then measured the audio level of each sample .

Icicle CEntrance

Mic Mate Shure
X2U Sample Gain - 2dB - 3.5 dB - 24.2dB - 10.7dB
The levels are arbitrary , as was the volume of the noise generator .
But we can compare the levels — and the disparity is enormous .
A change of 10 dB is generally perceived to be twice as loud .
Therefore the Icicle , at - 2dB , produces a signal more than four times louder than the Mic Mate ( - 24dB ) .
The Icicle is unique among these devices for offering a digital gain control within its driver software .
Under OS X , in the Sound preference pane , the input level of the device can be adjusted .
This feature can be used in conjunction with the analog gain knob on the Icicle to produce an appropriate signal level without overdriving any of the components in the signal path .
Curiously , the Mic Mate later gave me a different sort of gain problem .
Plugged into an omni condenser set up as a mono overhead above my drum kit , the Mic Mate ’s signal was too hot .
Even on the “ LO ” setting , the preamp electronics clipped .
In contrast , all of the other three USB interfaces , dialed down to a relatively low gain setting , produced a perfectly usable track .
I think the problem is that the 3 - way gain control on the Mic Mate is just too coarse ; it does n’t offer a sufficient range of settings to accommodate either quiet or loud sources .
So , if you intend to use the Mic Mate for loud sources , you may well need an inline pad to bring the mic ’s output level down so as to avoid clipping the Mic Mate ’s amplifier circuit or ADC .
Telephony Test
I used the “ Skype Test Call ” service to record short samples of my voice with each of the four USB interfaces .
They all sounded fine .
Needless to say , this is a low - fi application , and all four interfaces passed the test easily .
The signal - level LED on the X2U came in handy in this application .
Actually it came in handy in all applications .
Voice Tests
Karma K35
Following are four VO samples recorded with the Karma K35 .
If you listen to just the first half of each sample , you can test these “ blind . ”
( I name each interface in the second half of the clip . )
Audio Sample

Audio Sample
The Mic Mate signal was about 20 dB lower than the rest .
After I ’d normalized them all to equivalent levels ( - 8dB ) , the noise level in the Mic Mate sample was audibly higher than in the other three files .
I think the other three samples sound great .
The MicPort Pro has the least noise , but the difference is subtle .
In fact , I ’d be hard pressed to pick a winner from these three .
Shure SM57
SM57 through Blue Icicle
SM57 through Shure X2U
SM57 through Micport Pro
SM57 through MXL Mic Mate
My results using an SM57 were very similar to the above — the signal of the Mic Mate was lower , and after normalization the noise level in that clip was audibly higher , to the point where the audio would not be usable for any sort of recording .
Also , unless I ’m being misled by the noise level , the vocal sound has less meat than it does with the other interfaces .
The sound of this interface seems thin .
The other three are similar , but after repeated listens I developed a slight preference for the Shure X2U .
The noise level is a bit higher than on the MicPort Pro , but the vocal sound is richer .
The MicPort Pro sounds great , though .
It has the lowest noise of the lot , and the audio quality is excellent .
The Icicle takes 3rd place in this test .
Its noise level works against it , but more than that it seems to break up a bit on the ‘ S ’ sounds .
The esses sound a little bit like eshes to me .
Instrument Tests
I first recorded the hammer dulcimer with an Avenson STO - 2 .
But I matched all the gain levels to the Mic Mate , ending up with levels that were far too low for a 16 - bit recording .
Compounding the low signal level problem was the self - noise of the STO - 2 , which is relatively high at 28 dBA .
These are beautiful microphones , and in fact are my favorites for recording the hammer dulcimer .
But the resulting tracks all sounded pretty poor .
So , I recorded all the tracks again , swapping in a mic with much less self - noise , the 3 Zigma CHI ( 7dBA ) .
And I used better gain staging ( except on the Mic Mate , which does n’t have sufficient control . )
Note : if you want to listen to these blind , close your eyes before the player widget fully expands , as the interface in each clip is named in the title .
Digidesign 002 Rack
Blue Icicle
MXL Mic Mate
Micport Pro
Shure X2U
The Mic Mate stands out as the noisiest again — listen to the last few notes fade away , and the hash is apparent .
Also , I hear less of the impact of the hammers on the strings , as if the transient response is somehow a little bit off .
In a blind test I could also identify the Icicle , due to its noise level .
The X2U , MicPort Pro , and 002R tracks all sound really good .
I think the X2U track might have a tiny bit more noise , but in the context of a mix it would be negligible .
In fact , within a mix I doubt anyone could distinguish among these three tracks .
( If you want to hear the original 16 - bit WAVs , download them here : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . )
In Use
The Shure X2U wins the prize for best interface design .
They thought through the details : the controls are all front and center while the interface is laying on a table .
The +48 button is an actual switch , not just an electronic toggle button .
There ’s a 3 - color LED to indicate signal / peak / clip , and the manual documents the sound pressure levels that correspond to each color .
Good interfaces give feedback .
It ’s as simple as that .
Kudos to Shure for implementing this feedback mechanism into the X2U .
None of the other interfaces had any sort of level or clip indicator .
It ’s possible to open the Sound preference pane ( for OS X users ) to see input levels there , but in practice this is awkward because the screen is likely to be filled with whatever audio software is in use .
Moreover , it ’s not usually desirable to have the laptop close enough to the instrument that the player can see it , because the microphone would pick up the sound of the computer fan .
The X2U and MicPort Pro are designed to lay on a table without rolling around .
For my purposes , this seems like a good thing .
The X2U gets the nod here again because it ’s both squatter and heavier , making it more stable .
That said , if you ’re plugging the interface directly into the mic , with no XLR cable , then you might well prefer the lightweight Icicle , which would put much less strain on your mic ’s XLR jack as it hangs in space behind the microphone .

Notes :
CEntrance has a nifty driver that aggregates multiple MicPort Pro devices into a single stereo input .
This is a clever solution .
OS X can do the same thing natively , and in my tests happily created a single stereo “ aggregate ” input comprised of a MicPort Pro and X2U , or an Icicle and Mic Mate .
Not all applications support aggregate inputs , though ; Audacity could n’t record my hybrid input .
But GarageBand worked fine .
Here ’s a video tutorial and demo of recording in stereo via USB .
I measured phantom power in DC volts between pins 1 and 2 of the XLR jack .
In the case of the Icicle , I could n’t trigger its automatic phantom power switch , although it was generating 44V anyway .
Presumably it generates a full 48 V when the switch is triggered .
Presumably .

The Verdict
Update , December 2012
The world of 24 - bit USB audio has finally expanded to include numerous low - cost , high - quality portable preamp / interface devices .
Read below for the original , state - of - the - art 2009 conclusions , or click through to our updated USB audio interface shootout , in which the Micport Pro makes a second appearance .
If you are shopping for the most compact interface available , stay on this page .
If you ’re shopping for a home studio solution , check out the newer review , which includes primarily two - channel desktop devices .
They ’re small , but not this small .
Let ’s get the obvious part out of the way first :
The MicPort Pro is the only 24 - bit ADC in this test .
The other devices will only produce , at best , 16 - bit audio at 48 kHz .
Therefore , if you need 24 - bit audio , or 96 k Hz audio , the CEntrance MicPort Pro is the only solution .
At least until the next generation of competitive USB interfaces hits the market ( prediction : 3 months … Update 2011-03 - 13 : I wildly overestimated the manufacturers ’ willingness or ability to create 24 - bit USB audio devices .
There are a few 24 - bit USB microphones but the format is not ubiquitous as I expected . ) .
The MicPort Pro is the most expensive USB interface in this test , but compared to high - end mic pre’s , it ’s a bargain at $ 150 / channel .
It ’s small , portable , reasonably well laid - out , and it sounds as good as my Pro Tools rig .
You wo n’t go wrong with the MicPort Pro .
The Shure X2U is my personal favorite USB interface .
It wins the usability analysis by a large margin .
It has a mix - ratio control , useful for blending prerecorded with live tracks while recording .
It costs less than the MicPort Pro .
And it creates pristine tracks .
For 16 - bit audio , the X2U is a winner .
Blue ’s Icicle is worth considering too .
It is inexpensive , at $ 50 - $ 60 street .
It ’s a little noisier than the higher - priced interfaces , but packs a metric ton of gain into its amplifier .
For ambient or distant miking , the Icicle would n’t be my first choice due to its noise level , but for close - miked instruments I think its sound quality is hard to distinguish from the others .
And its lightweight build could be an advantage in some situations .
The MXL Mic Mate came up short in this test .
I ca n’t recommend it ; for a couple dollars more , the Icicle has more gain , better gain control , switched phantom power , and it comes with a USB cable .
( See also MXL ’s Mic Mate Pro , which has a headphone jack and a rotary gain control . )
In my experience , hearing differences in preamps and converters is a lot harder than hearing differences in microphones .
So it ’s not a surprise to me that the major distinguishing factor among these four devices is the noise level .
That said , having the X2U and MicPort Pro capture a mono track of the hammer dulcimer that is virtually indistinguishable from my upgraded 002R is pretty amazing .
This test took over my living room — mics , stands , and cables everywhere .
Check out the wreckage .
Yes , it ’s a good thing the family is out of town .

I present to you : that eleventh hour , absolutely perfect finishing touch to your Halloween spread .
Once you ’ve gone through caramel apples & popcorn balls , pumpkin bread / cookies / cupcakes / whoopie pies and cider donuts , it ’s hard to be all that original without making something that looks like something else .
Alas , the very concept of making a dessert that is appealing only insofar as its resemblance to a mummy ’s finger or a cat ’s litterbox is kind of like saying you would feed those things to your guests if only they were edible just because it ’s Halloween .
On the other hand is the risk of creating something that just does n’t quite hit the mark .
It ’s bad enough that I have to explain my costume ( look , I did n’t think Anne Boleyn was all that arcane a reference ) , to have to explain “ See ?
They ’re little ghosts ” adds some serious insult to injury .
And from a culinary perspective , it ’s a little gimmicky and a little lazy and definitely trashy .
Despite the general tackiness of food - that - looks - like - something - else , when done well I can admire such a masterpiece for its cleverness .
A couple years ago I came upon this idea somewhere ( and if it was yours , please do tell ) .
Recognizable , right ?
It ’s like a trick AND a treat all wrapped up in one adorable little package .
The last time I made these little guys I was sorely disappointed by a mushy final consistency to the dipping chocolate , so I took the time this year to learn how to properly temper chocolate at Cooking for Engineers ( dot com ) .
Theirs is a great article to consult for a broad discussion of methods and the science involved , and entire books are no doubt available on the subject .
I will be detailing only as much as applies to this effort .
But first !
Preparations are at hand .
Ever shucked corn ?
Oh good , today you ’ll be shucking Hershey Kisses .
You DO want to do this in advance of getting going with the chocolate , because it is way more of a pain in the ass to unwrap these as you go .
You also want to sift through your giant pile of almond slices to pull out the pieces that are complete and have a nice look / size / shape to them .
It seems obvious in retrospect , but at the time it did n’t seem as though so many of these slices would be so . . . unsuitable .
Also , once the chocolate is on , it ’s go time , and it ’s not going to stop until you ’re done .
Now drain the cherries ,
then pat them dry in a towel .
I made a little hobo bindle with my kitchen towel and rolled them around in there to dab ’em dry .
Previously I was under the impression that tempering one ’s chocolate was too difficult to attempt unless you were a chocolatier , figuring that even a chocolate that has seized still tastes pretty good , and as such never bothered .
Turns out it ’s not actually all that hard , though maybe I just had good luck today .
You will need a thermometer , but no super high heat candy thermometer necessary–a meat thermometer will do nicely .
The easiest way to mess up your chocolate is to get water in it , which is why I ’d avoid a rainy or otherwise humid day to take this on .
So if you ’re good on timing and equipment , let ’s goOOOo !
Step 1 : Make a double boiler .
Take a metal bowl with a lip and place it on top of a pot with 1 ″ water , like so .
Step 2 : Chop your chocolate .
I did not do this , but it would have helped melt everything more easily .
One third is going in the pot and the rest is staying behind for later .
Step 3 : Melt .
Put chocolate in bowl , set burner to medium high .
Once the chocolate begins to melt , reduce heat to medium .
Stir the whole time with a rubber spatula until the chocolate ’s temperature is near 115 oF ( 46 oC ) ( for semisweet chocolate chips , if using milk chocolate or white chocolate 110 oF ( 43 oC ) )
Step 4 : Remove from heat
But leave the bowl in the pot for the next part .
Step 5 : Seed .
Take the remaining ounce of chocolate and stir into the molten stuff .
Stir continuously until temperature is between 88 oF and 90 oF ( for semisweet chocolate chips , if using milk chocolate or white chocolate 86 oF and 88 oF ) .
And that ’s tempering chocolate , ta da !
Here ’s how beautifully smooooove it looks .
Keeping the bowl at an angle helps with the dipping process ( i.e. there ’s more to dip into and it holds its heat better ) .
Lay out on parchment paper or wax paper .
Dab on a Kiss .
And ears .
See how well - tempered my mice are ?
My , Aleta , you are positively . . . punning tonight , bahuffhuffhuff .
These little guys do n’t look like much all stacked together on a plate , but I felt pretty clever sticking them on a cheese plate .
Get it ?
Cuz they ’re mice ?
Oh Martha Stewart , you have some counterculture competition coming your way .
Cute enough to make up for illustrating what in true practice would actually be quite disgusting .
I ’m calling it a win .
When made lovingly , personalities will emerge .
There ’s the ambitious one .
The so - frugal - it ’s - downright - stingy one .
And the one with a really undeniably cute butt .
Chocolate Cherry Mice
Small batch ( makes 25 )
1 small jar Stem - On Maraschino Cherries ( 10 oz ; ~ 25 count )
1/3 bag Hershey Kisses ( 4oz ; 25 total )
4oz chocolate ( avoid chips if possible ; semisweet , dark , or milk as desired )
50 almond slivers ( you ’ll need to pick through a lot to get this many , so I recommend starting with a large bag , at least a cup )
Large batch ( makes 75 , safer in terms of chocolate temper )
1 LARGE ( 10 oz , ~ 50 count ) jar Stem - On Maraschino Cherries
1 small ( 16 oz , ~ 25 count ) jar Stem - On Maraschino Cherries
1 bag Hershey Kisses ( 4oz ; 75 total )
12 oz chocolate ( avoid chips if possible ; semisweet , dark , or milk as desired )
150 almond slivers ( start with at least 3 cups )
Equipment :
Metal or heatproof bowl with lip
Meat thermometer
Rubber spatula .
Word on the internet is no metal , no wood .
A sunny , low - humidity day best tempers chocolate , but rainy day mice will be just as yummy if not as shiny .
Drain cherries , do not rinse .
Place a handful at a time in a kitchen towel , craft into a bindle and shake around to absorb as much moisture as possible .
Leave in towel for now .
Unwrap all Hershey kisses and set on a platter for easy access .
Sort through almond slices until you have two nicely shaped slices for each mouse ’s pair of ears .
Line 1 – 3 cookie sheets or cutting boards with parchment paper or wax paper .
They need to be able to fit in your fridge !
Chop chocolate , reserving about a third chopped pieces ( 1.25 oz for batch of 25 ; 4 oz for batch of 75 ) .
If using chocolate chips , no need to chop .
Make a double boiler by placing a bowl with a lip over a medium pot / saucepan with about a half inch of water .
Set burner to medium high , and once the chocolate begins to melt , reduce to medium .
Stir continuously with rubber spatula .
As soon as you can see no more individual pieces , check the temperature , and continue to cook until it just enters the appropriate target .
Err on the side of removing too soon if the temperature is still rising rapidly as it nears your target .
Dark / Semisweet : 115 oF ( 46 oC )
Milk Chocolate : 110 oF ( 43 oC )
White Chocolate : 110 oF ( 43 oC )
Turn off stove , remove bowl from pot and place on a towel to absorb extra moisture .
Add in remaining chocolate and stir constantly until temperature is at tempering range :
Dark / Semisweet : 88 oF – 90 oF ( 31 oC – 32 oC )
Milk Chocolate : 86 oF – 88 oF ( 30 oC – 31 oC )
White Chocolate : 80 oF – 82 oF ( 27 oC – 28 oC )
Holding stem , dip each cherry in the liquid chocolate , then set on parchment / wax paper .
Set your mice about two inches apart to allow space for the Hershey Kiss and a little fiddling , and so no tails are caught in his neighbor ’s warm chocolate .
Once all cherries are dipped , and starting at the beginning again , set a Hershey Kiss in front of each cherry to make a head .
It helps to rest it on the cherry at an angle , as though the mouse is looking up .
Aesthetically , an upturned nose is cuter .
Once all cherries are headed , and starting at the beginning again , stick one almond slice on either side of the head to make ears .
Try not to touch the wet chocolate , but you can use the Hershey Kiss and the tail to help position these just so .
If the chocolate is not tacky enough , wait a couple minutes and try again , but be careful not let it get too cool .
And finally , once your mice can hear you , set platters in fridge for 1 - 4 hours to firm up .
To remove , seize the mouse by its tail .
Squeak !
Serve on a cheese platter for maximum effect .
Really , it ’s so adorably cute .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama said on Monday accelerated stimulus spending would create or save 600,000 jobs over the next 100 days , pledging action to slow the growth of unemployment that has reached a 25 - year high .
“ We ’ve got a long way to go , but I feel like we ’ve made great progress , ” Obama said at a White House meeting with Vice President Joe Biden and cabinet officials aimed at highlighting gains made since Congress passed the massive stimulus package in February .
“ The biggest concern that I have moving forward is that the toll that job losses take on individual families and communities can be self - reinforcing , ” Obama said .
“ People lose jobs , they pull back on spending , that means businesses do n’t have customers , and suddenly you start seeing more job lay - offs . ”
The White House event took place three days after the Labor Department reported that U.S. unemployment rose to 9.4 percent in May , even though job losses last month slowed to 345,000 .
Obama said the lower rate of job losses was encouraging .
He promised stimulus spending would be carried out “ in a transparent fashion so that taxpayers know that money is not being wasted on a bunch of boondoggles . ”
The White House estimates the $ 787 billion Recovery and Reinvestment Act that Democrats pushed through Congress with little Republican support will create or save 3 million to 4 million jobs by early 2011 .
They said on Monday it created or saved 150,000 in the first 100 days .
Republicans questioned the figure and noted that Biden said on May 13 over 150,000 jobs had been saved or created in the act ’s first 77 days .
The U.S. economy has lost 6.0 million jobs , including 2.9 million this year , since the recession began in December 2007 .
REPUBLICAN HOPES
Republicans , who hope to loosen the Democrats ’ grip on power in 2010 congressional election , have attacked the recovery legislation as a bloated spending bill that will drive the country deeper into debt .
“ I ’m very skeptical that the spending binge that we ’re on is going to produce much good and , even if it does , any time soon , ” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Friday .
“ I think the economy is just as likely to begin to recover on its own , wholly aside from this , before much of this has an impact . ”
The accelerated stimulus spending announced on Monday included 200 new waste and water systems in rural areas and the creation of 125,000 summer youth jobs .
Work will also begin on maintenance and construction at 98 airports and over 1,500 highway locations and in the 107 U.S. national parks .
The White House has already committed over $ 135 billion to stimulus projects but only about $ 44 billion has been paid out .
“ We ’re going to get more dollars out the door , more shovels into the ground and more money into the pockets of workers and families who need it most , ” Biden said in a statement .
A little more than one - third of the $ 787 billion Recovery
Act was tax relief , with the next biggest chunk dedicated to relief for state and local governments to keep health and education programs in place without raising taxes .
The accelerated projects announced on Monday include :

Semen Therapy
Swallowing the semen of a healthy man more than twice a week .
Because of the courage of qualified medical research teams , Semen Therapy promises to ease the suffering of millions .
MENU
Welcome .
SemenTherapy.com has been the portal to scientific research into the health benefits of swallowing semen for more than ten years .
The purpose is to collect references to scientific studies of the health benefits to women of swallowing loads of semen from healthy men every week .
There is no doubt of benefits such as ; increased longevity , reduction of risk of cancer ( by 50 % for breast cancer ) , reduction of cases of miscarriage ( and even death of the mother ) due to pre-eclampsia , anti-aging properties , acne control , easing of depression , mood enhancement , reducing effects of PMS , mitigating morning sickness , suppressing appetite and increasing bonding in relationships .
Also research into large frequency swallowing loads of semen ( with every meal ) as a trigger of cachexia causing mass weight loss in obese woman and it's possible use as a treatment ( cure ? ) for diabetes .
For women who swallow the semen of a healthy man more than twice a week the benefits are :
Live Longer and Stronger
Women who swallow semen from a healthy man more than twice a week enjoy great health benefits .
Scientists all agree women benefit from semen , some studies are about how bad condoms are because of keeping healthy semen away from woman .
" Fellatio ( sucking his penis ) may be just as effective as vaginal insemination . "

Semen is consumed when swallowed compared to vaginally ejaculated semen which leaks out and is wiped away .
Swallowing can't make you pregnant but it can make you healthy enough for pregnancy .

Possible Beneficial Effects of Consumption of Semen
... Semen also consists of a variety of proteins that have antimicrobial activity against bacteria , viruses and fungi .
Also present in the semen are mood - enhancing compounds such as cortisol , estrone , oxytocin , thyrotropin - releasing hormone , prolactin , melatonin and serotonin .
For this reason , scientists have begun studying the health benefits of semen intake , both orally and vaginally .
Some of the studies into the effects of swallowing semen are described here .
Pregnancy
In a Dutch study of women who engaged in oral sex and swallowed the semen , the researchers found that swallowing semen was associated with a lower risk of preeclampsia .
One hypothesis for this is that substances in the semen adapt the mother ’s immune system so that it accepts foreign proteins present in sperm , as well as in the placenta and fetus .
This maintains the blood pressure at a low level and thereby reduces the preeclampsia risk .
Research has also shown that some women are infertile or miscarry due to the presence of antibodies that destroy the proteins or antigens present in their partner ’s semen .
Having oral sex and swallowing the semen of the partner may help make the pregnancy safer and more successful as the woman is swallowing her partner 's antigens .
Morning Sickness
Work carried out by reproductive expert and psychologist Gordon Gallup from SUNY - Albany suggests that swallowing semen could provide a cure for morning sickness .

Ovulation
In a study conducted by researchers from the University of Saskatchewan , a protein in semen was found to act on the female brain to induce ovulation and that protein is the same molecule that controls the growth , maintenance and survival of neurons .
The findings suggest that semen may work as a signalling hormone that acts via the hypothalamus and pituitary gland of the female brain , which triggers the release of other hormones involved in prompting ovulation .
Hair health

Also present in the semen are mood - enhancing compounds such as cortisol , estrone , oxytocin , thyrotropin - releasing hormone , prolactin , melatonin and serotonin .
For this reason , scientists have begun studying the health benefits of semen intake , both orally and vaginally .
Some of the studies into the effects of swallowing semen are described here .
In a Dutch study of women who engaged in oral sex and swallowed the semen , the researchers found that .
One hypothesis for this is that substances in the semen adapt the mother ’s immune system so that it accepts foreign proteins present in sperm , as well as in the placenta and fetus .
This maintains the blood pressure at a low level and thereby reduces the preeclampsia risk .
Research has also shown that some women are infertile or miscarry due to the presence of antibodies that destroy the proteins or antigens present in their partner ’s semen .
Having oral sex and swallowing the semen of the partner may help make the pregnancy safer and more successful as the woman is swallowing her partner 's antigens .
Work carried out by reproductive expert and psychologist Gordon Gallup from SUNY - Albany suggests that .

Semen Health Benefits : It Really Does Have All The Nutrients Of A Protein Shake
How 's this for your protein shake : fructose sugar , water , ascorbic acid , citric acid , enzymes , protein , zinc and more .
Those are nutrients found in human male ejaculate .
New research found that numerous species consume semen for its health benefits , and human seed might as well be viable as a superfood , Discovery News reports .
Female squid , for example , consume excess sperm as if it were food .
So do carrion flies , certain types of leeches , picture wing flies and other creatures .
For the first time , scientists have started tracking how these species utilize the nutrients in sperm .
The study was published in the journal Biology Letters by lead author Benjamin Wegener , a researcher at Monash University in Australia .
That does n't necessarily mean humans should start feasting during foreplay , but if we did , there are plenty of resources out there to make the experience more enjoyable .
There 's " Semenology , " a book dedicated for the bartender in your life who also happens to enjoy concocting semen cocktails .
" Natural Harvest , " on the other hand , is a collection of semen - based recipes ( and is actually getting good reviews ) .

Study in Austria : Compound in sperm may increase life span
London , UK --
The secret to a long life may lie in the human sperm now .
In a new study conducted by Graz University scientists in Austria , it has been found that a compound called spermidine , which is found is human sperms , could be the next step in the fight against aging .
This compound helps fight aging by slowing the process itself , and thus increases longevity in flies , mice , yeast , worms , and most importantly human blood cells , by protecting them from getting damaged .
Reversing the damage
Researchers have said that aging takes place when autophagy , that is the process of repairing or recycling the damaged cells of parts of cells , no longer happens properly .
This process maintains a balance in the growth and regeneration of cells .
Their claim is strengthened by the fact that with age , the concentration of spermidine reduces in the human body .
The scientists found that adding spermidine led to suppression of various aging processes in the cells .
It reduces free radicals and increases the life span of the cells .
The study and its findings
They conducted the study by applying spermidine to aging yeast cells , adding it to the diet of fruit fly and nematode worm , giving mice drinking water with spermidine in it for 200 days , and lastly comparing human blood cells treated with the compound to those which were not treated .
Research on fruit flies indicated an additional life span of 30 percent in the spermidine treated specimen than the untreated specimen .
Worms also showed a similar pattern , with an increase in life span by 15 percent .
Researcher Tony Eisenberg has called the study the " holy grail of age research " .
Anti-aging pill still far - fetched
The importance of the research is unquestionable , but the claims by a British newspaper that an anti-aging pill is going to hit the markets is far from true .
Even human trials cannot be seen in conceivable future .
It will take many more years of testing , short - term and long - term clinical trials , and animal studies to confirm the safety , the cost , and the side - effects of such a treatment .

Semen reduces the risk of breast cancer " not less than 50 % " in married women
Study published by the U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health shows that " semen exposure " reduces the risk of breast cancer " not less than 50 % "
Abstract
A case - control study was conducted in order to test the hypothesis that a reduced exposure to human seminal factors in the early reproductive life of women is a risk factor in breast cancer .
The relative risk of exposure to the hypothetical semen - factor deficiency is 4.7 times greater for breast - cancer patients than for the controls .
The risk of developing breast cancer within the same population in the U.S.A. is estimated as
5 times greater for women who use barrier methods ( condom and other ) than for women who use non-barrier contraceptive methods ( diaphragm and other ) .
The reduction of the incidence of breast cancer by eliminating the barrier contraceptive techniques would be
not less than 50 % in married women in the population .

A case - control study was conducted in order to test the hypothesis that a reduced exposure to human seminal factors in the early reproductive life of women is a risk factor in breast cancer .
The relative risk of exposure to the hypothetical semen - factor deficiency is 4.7 times greater for breast - cancer patients than for the controls .
When the contraceptive methods alone are taken into account , the relative risk increases up to 5.3 .
About 16 percent of the women using barrier methods ( condom , and other )
and 3.4 percent of women using non-barrier contraceptive methods ( diaphragm , pill , IUDs , rhythm , tubal ligation , and other ) would develop breast cancer .
The risk of developing breast cancer within the same population in the U.S. is 5 times greater in women who use barrier methods than in women who use non-barrier contraceptive methods .
The reduction in the incidence of breast cancer by eliminating the barrier contraceptive techniques would be not less than 50 percent in married women in the entire population .
The possibility of preventive measures within an adequate family planning program is emphasized .

Therapy keeps men from getting prostate cancer
A Melbourne research team led by Graham Giles , from the Cancer Council Victoria .
Giles 's team has found men can reduce their risk of prostate cancer through regular ejaculation .
Comparing the sexual habits of a group of 1000 men who had developed prostate cancer with 1250 who had not , they found men who ejaculated more than five times a week were a third less likely to develop prostate cancer later in life .
Regular ejaculation may prevent carcinogens accumulating in the prostate gland , suggest the researchers .

Female college students having unprotected sex ( exposure to semen ) were significantly less depressed than were those whose partners used condoms ( Arch. Sex . Behav . 2002;31:289-93 ) .
Their better moods were not just a feature of promiscuity , because women using condoms were just as depressed as those practicing total abstinence ( no semen ) .
The benefits of semen contact also were seen in fewer suicide attempts and better performance on cognition tests ( IQ tests ) .

Controversial Ideas : Does Semen Act As an Antidepressant to the Recipient ?
By Jennifer Abbasi Popular Science

Psychology Today : Attention , Ladies : Semen Is An Antidepressant
seminal fluid : mostly water , plus about 50 compounds : sugar ( to nourish sperm ) , immunosuppressants ( to keep women 's immune systems from destroying sperm ) , and oddly , two female sex hormones , and many mood - elevating compounds : endorphins , estrone , prolactin , oxytocin , thyrotrpin - releasing hormone , and serotonin .
So it appears quite possible that the antidepressants in semen might have a real mood - elevating effect .
... this effect might come in handy for women over age 50 , who are experiencing menopausal blues .
Psychology Today
Improve sense of smell , reduce risk of heart disease , aid in weight loss , pain relief and soothing PMS symptoms and even help people live longer .
Then there 's a study showing women are less depressed if they have sex without condoms and another showing regular sex helps to avoid colds .
While the research method used for the depression study is rather shaky , both studies , Robertson says , are based on legitimate scientific reasoning .
There 's also research suggesting regular sex can improve sense of smell , reduce risk of heart disease , aid in weight loss , pain relief and soothing PMS symptoms and even help people live longer .

Team unlocks link between sex , female brain .
It 's semen .
" An international team of scientists led by Gregg Adams at the University of Saskatchewan has discovered that a protein in semen acts on the female brain to prompt ovulation , and is the same molecule that regulates the growth , maintenance , and survival of nerve cells .
Male mammals have accessory sex glands that contribute seminal fluid to semen , but the role of this fluid and the glands that produce it are not well understood .
“ From the results of our research , we now know that these glands produce large amounts of a protein that has a direct effect on the female , ” says Adams , a professor of veterinary biomedical sciences at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine at the U of S .
The work , which appears in the August 20 , 2012 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , raises intriguing questions about fertility in mammals , including humans .
The team characterized the protein , dubbed ovulation - inducing factor ( OIF ) , that they have found in the semen of all species of mammal they have looked at so far .
In the process of discovering its identity , the team compared OIF to thousands of other proteins , including nerve growth factor ( NGF ) which is found primarily in nerve cells throughout the body .
“ To our surprise , it turns out they are the same molecule , ” Adams says .
“ Even more surprising is that the effects of NGF in the female were not recognized earlier , since it ’s so abundant in seminal plasma . ” a protein in semen was found to act on the female brain to induce ovulation and that protein is the same molecule that controls the growth , maintenance and survival of neurons .
The findings suggest that semen may work as a signalling hormone that acts via the hypothalamus and pituitary gland of the female brain , which triggers the release of other hormones involved in prompting ovulation .

Pregnancy Preparation
" Oral sex ( with semen swallowing ) makes pregnancies safer . "
It 's true , research by Professor Gus Dekker , a maternal - fetal medicine specialist at the University of Adelaide , shows .
Dekker compared 41 pregnant women with pre-eclampsia - a condition where the mother 's blood pressure soars during pregnancy - to 44 without .
He found 82 per cent of those without the condition practiced fellatio compared with 44 per cent of those with it .
The explanation ?
Semen contains a growth factor which helps persuade a mother 's immune system to accept sperm .
Regular exposure before pregnancy helps her immune system get used to her partner 's sperm .

Wikipedia : Pre-eclampsia , Treatment and prevention , Fellatio ( with semen swallowing )
have reported that pre-eclampsia , a life threatening complication that sometimes arises in pregnancy , is much less frequent in couples who have practiced oral sex , and even more rare in couples where fellatio regularly ended with a woman 's swallowing of her partner 's semen .
The results were statistically significant and are consistent with the fact that semen contains several agents that have important roles in the prevention of pre-eclampsia , which may arise out of an immunological condition .
According to that view , pre-eclampsia is caused by a failure of the mother to accept the fetus and placenta , which both contain " foreign " proteins from the father 's genes .
Regular exposure to the father 's semen helps cause immunological tolerance to their proteins .
Other studies also found that , while any exposure to the partner 's sperm during sex appears to decrease the chances of various disorders , women in couples who have practiced " sex acts other than intercourse " are less than half as likely to suffer pre-eclampsia .
It has been suggested that fellatio may , through " immune modulation " , BBC News [ 35 ] have a beneficial role in preventing dangerous complications during pregnancy , reducing specifically the risk of miscarriage and pre-eclampsia .

Pregnant women who continue getting semen from the baby 's father have less morning sickness
To understand where he ’s coming from , we need to think back to the maternal immune system ’s response to the fetus .
Because half of the DNA the fetus is carrying comes from the father , the mother ’s body may initially treat the organism as foreign tissue or an infection .
This response , Gallup says , triggers an immune reaction that is commonly experienced as nausea , vomiting , and malaise ( aka morning sickness ) .
The best cure for this type of sickness , says Gallup , is , strangely enough , the same thing as its cause .
The more exposure a woman has to her partner ’s semen -- that is to say , the more often she ’s inseminated prior to conception and during the early stages of the pregnancy -- the more tolerance her body develops to his genetic material .
This tolerance generalizes to a tolerance for the fetus and leads to successful maternal immunosuppression -- and subsequently allows her to feel less like an infected zombie with serious stomach troubles .
Here is where Gallup ’s reputation as an innovative -- if often highly speculative -- evolutionary theorist comes into the picture .
Gallup surmises that pregnancy sickness is not itself an adaptation , but instead a side effect of a broader maternal adaptation for favoring the best possible mates .
He suggests that this broader adaptation serves primarily to facilitate reproduction with males that are likely to support mother and child ( in evolutionary terms , to invest in the offspring ) , while weeding out the players .
In previous work , Gallup has shown that women are more likely to develop preeclampsia -- and thus have a higher infant mortality risk -- in pregnancies resulting from unfamiliar semen .
Historically , these would have included rape and “ dishonest mating strategies ” ( tactics in which the man lies to the woman about his long - term intentions just to get into her pants ) as well as unplanned conception occurring in a new , still - fragile relationship .
From the point of view of Mother Nature ’s cold , cold heart , spontaneous abortions due to a reaction against unfamiliar semen might have been biologically adaptive .
This is because conception and childbirth historically meant that a woman foreclosed on any other reproductive opportunities for 2 to 4 years , so pregnancies in which paternal investment was improbable would have meant an enormous gamble .
Today , however , technological innovations such as barrier contraceptives ( condoms reduce a woman ’s exposure to semen that would otherwise become familiar ) and artificial insemination mimic some ancestral conditions .
The maternal immune system has no way to distinguish between , say , conception by in vitro fertilization and rape .
Still , while it may very well work wonders in curtailing nausea and vomiting in your next pregnancy , it ’s probably too early to suggest imbibing copious amounts of your partner ’s semen , either vaginally or orally ( there is some evidence , believe it or not , that fellatio may be just as effective as vaginal insemination for priming the woman ’s body with the man ’s protein , activating maternal immunosuppression in preparation for a child . )
Your partner might think it ’s worth a shot , though .
Huffingtonpost.com source
... fellatio may be just as effective as vaginal insemination for priming the woman ’s body with the man ’s protein , activating maternal immunosuppression in preparation for a child .
NIH.gov source
Data from heterosexual couples , at least , indicate that women who have a history of regularly performing fellatio on males with whom they later conceive are less likely to experience histocompatibility problems during pregnancy .
They ’re developing an early tolerance for a conceptus that will possess , of course , half that man ’s foreign genome .
...evolutionary psychologist Gordon Gallup has recently speculated that this “ seminal priming ” also reduces the chances of morning sickness .
For those mothers - to - be , such as lesbians , who ’d prefer not to imbibe semen straight from the tap for priming purposes , sublingual sprays that are concatenations of various immune factors mixed with the donor male ’s protein have been in development for years .

Morning Sickness
Gallup , who presented his findings at the 2012 Northeastern Evolutionary Psychology Society , proposed the woman ’s body initially rejects the father ’s semen as an infection and reacts to it by vomiting , the NY Daily News reported .
However , the woman will become immune to the semen by swallowing it and could ebb morning sickness in subsequent pregnancies if the second child has the same father as the first .
This remedy proposes oral sex may treat one of the most troubling symptoms of pregnancy .

Sex is what gave you morning sickness , and it can also be what alleviates it .
Gordon Gallup , a SUNY - Albany psychologist , believes in the “ hair of the dog ” concept when it comes to curing morning sickness — ingesting semen , specifically the impregnator ’s semen , so the woman ’s body can build up a tolerance to what ’s already in her body .

Therapy to a woman to swallow four ( 4 ) hours before intercourse increases the quality of sperm .
The couple should have intercourse again four ( 4 ) hours later , if the man can be enticed to perform it .
In general , total motile spermatozoa as well as actively motile spermatozoa progressively increased from first to last ejaculate at the cost of sluggish spermatozoa .
A significant increase in seminal plasma calcium and magnesium was seen as well as a significant increase in magnesium inside the cell from the first to the fourth ejaculate .

It is already known that acne sufferers are a bit deficient in this specific enzyme , which is the cause of there being an excess of dead skin cells for those with acne .
The dead skin cells then build up , get all glued together with oil , and block your pores .

Sure , other vitamins and minerals help .
But zinc does the heavy lifting .
It 's linked to your fertility , potency , sex drive and long - term sexual health .
The mineral is critical to sperm production , and low zinc stores have been blamed for decreases in semen volume and testosterone levels , explains Sara Brewer , M.D. , author of Better Sex .
" Each ejaculation can expend up to 5 milligrams of zinc , or one - third of your daily allowance , " Dr. Brewer says .
Luckily , zinc is easy to come by .
Four ounces of lean beef provide half the daily requirement , and a single oyster gives you the whole shebang .
Turkey , cereals and beans are other good sources .

Abstract : Long term objectives .
To discover the endogenous antimicrobial effector molecules of humans , and to define their structures and mechanisms of action .
This proposal deals with antimicrobial peptides of the male genital tract , an area where remarkably little information currently exists .
Hypotheses .
Normal human semen contains proteins with latent antimicrobial domains that are activated by serine and aspartyl proteases found in normal semen .
The resulting peptides ( " altruins " ) can protect the female from infection by bacteria introduced into the vagina during intercourse .

Obesity ; Semen contains alpha 2 glycoprotein ( ZAG )
Could this be the cure to obesity ?
UK Dailymail : British researchers are trying to develop a pill which could be used to treat obesity without the slimmer having to cut down on what they eat , it was announced .
The team at Aston University in Birmingham are looking at the role of a protein , called zinc alpha 2 glycoprotein ( ZAG ) , which appears to promote weight loss without an obese person having to reduce their food intake .
This happens because the protein targets fat breakdown while not affecting muscle mass .
Professor Mike Tisdale said their long - term plan was to try to turn ZAG into a treatment , such as a tablet , to treat obesity .
ZAG , a soluble protein , is present in most body fluids and in most normal tissues of the body .
But the protein is also involved in a process called cachexia - the weight loss that happens in some cancer patients .
During cachexia , ZAG production is increased 10 - fold , causing the movement of fat from adipose tissue which is used to produce heat rather than energy .
This can lead to cancer patients losing 85 per cent of their body fat .
This fat mobilisation is normally linked to energy demand , so anything which disrupts this process will lead to progressive fat loss .
The process has been extensively examined by Prof Tisdale , leading him to use the protein to target obesity .
ZAG also has potential to be used to treat diabetes because it also lowers blood sugar levels .

Semen Curbs Appetite
I do believe that it curbs your hunger as I found it out quite by accident .
My boyfriend of 6 years and I were making love one morning and he wanted to finish in my mouth so I said sure and I swallowed it .
Once we were done I got up took shower and got ready for work , I had to be there for 8a .
I was running late and had n't had time for breakfast I did n't realize I was n't hungry until around 10a and then I sat there completely puzzled because I could n't understand why as I had n't had my Red Bull or Monster or Starbucks which normally curbs my appetite in the morning , I had n't even drank any water until I remembered he only thing I had swallowed that morning was his cum .
I was hungry till almost noon when I normally had lunch .
I thought it was a fluke so I tried 2 more times just to be sure ( you can imagine my boyfriend was only too happy to help me conduct my experiment ) so it actually does work , but I do n't recommend swallowing cum on a consistent basis or running around giving every guy you meet a blow job as part of your weight loss program either .
But it does work

The PEGI system is now used in more than 30 nations .
The videogame trade association , Tiga , say the Pan European Game Information ( PEGI ) rating systems has " room for improvement " .
Tiga 's chief , Dr Richard Wilson , said changes were needed to make the logos " instinctively recognisable " .
" There needs to be an advertising campaign and publicity as to what these pictograms actually mean , " he said .
The government backed the PEGI system as part of the Digital Britain report , removing responsibility from the BBFC .
Speaking to the BBC , Dr Wilson broadly welcomed the system but said more could be done .
" Game developers will welcome the new PEGI system , as it makes classification easier , especially those who export to the European market .
" While the age ratings are fairly clear , there needs to be improvement to the system - especially the pictograms - because they are not instinctively recognisable , " he said .
Laurie Hall - the director general of the Video Standards Council , which administers the PEGI system in the UK - agreed with Dr Wilson and told the BBC that more work needed to be done .
" I think people need to be made more aware , " he said .
" Take the spider logo : that means ' fear ' .
In other words , people might find the game scary , but you might not immediately jump to that conclusion looking at the box .
" Our plan is to have a big awareness campaign and also put consumer information about the game on the packaging , in English , which will help . "
The decision to go with PEGI , rather than the BBFC , goes against the recommendations of Dr Tanya Byron 's review into protecting children from harmful content in the digital age , where she advocated the BBFC system .
Bill Olner at the launch of the video games all party parliamentary group Games focus
The announcement was one of a number of measures brought in as part of the Digital Britain report .
The government also said it would consider tax relief on video game production .
That news came in the same week that an all party Parliamentary group for the video games industry was set up , chaired by Bill Olner MP with Lord Puttnam filling in as vice chair .
At the event , Dr Wilson said that without tax breaks the games industry stood to lose more than 1600 jobs over the next five years .
John Whittingdale , the Conservative MP who chairs the all party committee on culture , media and sport , said the UK games industry was " under assault " from other countries .
" We were third largest game developer , behind the United States and Japan .
" Now we are the fourth , overtaken by Canada because they have offered substantive tax breaks . "
Experts at the launch of the all party group stressed that there was a skills shortage in the UK which , coupled with high recruitment costs and a lack of relevant university courses , meant that games firms had to invest considerable money and effort into getting graduate recruits up to speed .
" Tax relief would level the playing field somewhat , " said Dr Wilson .
It is thought video games development contributed more than £ 1bn to the UK's GDP in 2008 .

Only the Libertarian Fringe Offers Real Health Care Reform By Arnold Kling
Ronald Bailey writes ,
The health care “ reform ” currently being hammered out by the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives already clocks in at $ 1 trillion and 1,000 pages–and it ’s nowhere near done .
But one thing is clear : the legislation attempts to substitute top - down mandates from a centralized bureaucracy for the distributed decisions made by millions of consumers , physicians , and insurers acting in a marketplace .
This will fail .
The basic problem that the Democrats have with health care reform is that when it comes to taking our system away from free markets , there is just not that much farther we can go .
We already regulate the practice of medicine and allied health services with licensing cartels .
We already regulate individual health insurance practically out of existence , particularly in states that require “ community rating ” and “ must - carry , ” which force insurance companies to charge the same price to all comers , which means that the only price they can safely charge is the price that assumes you are only asking for insurance because you just came down with a really expensive illness .
We already have government insuring the poor and the elderly .
In contrast , there is a lot of room to move health care in the other direction –toward free markets .
The only real health care reformers are those of us on the libertarian fringe .
The two major parties are just posturing .
That ’s why I have n’t written much about the day - to - day debate on “ reform . ”
It is not clear to me that defeating the Democrats ’ legislation is something I should root for .
We ’re still nowhere near considering real reform .
I do n’t know what it is , but people are crazy about slashing prices on the weekend of our Independence Day .
Is it just a swell of patriotism that drives retailers and merchants alike into the insanity of reducing the prices of their own precious goods ?
Perhaps it ’s the heat of summer reaching its boiling point , or maybe even some sort of exotic ( and possibly erotic ) fever .
Whatever the infliction is , digital games distributor / hub Impulse has it ; and they caught it early .
Now through the glorious fireworks , hot dogs and ‘ way too many fat guys with their shirts off ’ laden weekend , PC gamers can pick up several solid titles and bundles including Call of Duty 4 , Flock ! , Sins of a Solar Empire and more for varying discounts .
Additionally , all Epic games ( a handful of Unreal titles ) listed on the client have been given a 25 % markdown , and even the Street Fighter IV pre-purchase gets in on the action with a slight discount .
Impulse knows better than anybody that when that pesky sun starts piercing through your pasty ‘ indoors only ’ skin this weekend , they ’ll be no better place for you to run than back into your bunker to spend some quality time with the mouse and keyboard .
SOUTH CAROLINA - A stunning new poll by William K. Wolfrum & Associates shows that nearly 80 percent of all Americans would stop breathing right now if a major corporation gave that order .
The poll - which was based on looking into how Americans will gladly vote against their own self interests - made several other discoveries , including :
78 percent of Americans would rather die a terrible death that leaves their families bankrupt than have the elite pay higher taxes for government health care .
67 percent of Americans would saw off their left foot to have a Wal - Mart built next door to them ; 62 percent of Americans would shoot themselves in the head if it meant the richest Americans would receive a tax break , and ; 59 percent of Americans would rather see tax money given to banks , or used to kill Middle Easterners than have the same money used on health care in the U.S .
Noted sociologist Tim Johnson of Tupelo , Miss. , said that the poll is in line with how many Americans feel .
" In the U.S. , it 's all about striving to be rich , " said Johnson .
" And if you fail , you 're out .
So better let the successful amongst us thrive than worry about the vast majority of Americans , who are abject failures at getting rich . "
Republicans were quick to jump on the poll numbers .
" Americans are selfless people .
So selfless , they 'll always vote against their own interests , " said Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal .
" At the GOP , we 're aware of that and confident it will again lead us to power .
The people have spoken , and they 've told us they do n't want to be heard anymore .
We can do that . "
More than 1,000 people took the poll , though many refused to accept the free pencils given out to fill out the poll , claiming it was a " socialist act " and that they should be " punished for not having their own pencils . "

Palmer ’s wife slams door on idea of Ochocinco moving in
Earlier this week , Bengals receiver Chad Ochocinco said he was going to be staying with quarterback Carson Palmer in July in order to make up for lost time after the wideout skipped most of the team ’s OTA sessions .
But apparently Mrs. Palmer has nixed that idea :
Carson said Shaelyn got either a text message or e-mail from a friend , saying Ochocinco planned to stay with the Palmers in the days leading up to training camp .
Shaelyn gave birth to twins — a boy and a girl — on Jan. 20 .
“ As soon as I walked in the door from work the other day , she just gave me that look , ” Palmer said .
“ I ’m like , ‘ Whoa , calm down .
It ’s media stuff .
It ’s Chad being Chad . ’
“ I told her , ‘ Do n’t worry .
I have n’t made any commitments to having to clear out the boxes in the ( spare ) room to make a bed for him .
Do n’t worry about that .
It ’s not going to happen . ’ ”
Undeterred , Ochocinco keeps insisting he ’s staying with the Palmers .
“ No , ” Carson said .
“ I just told him that unless he ’s picking up my mortgage for the month of July and August , he ca n’t stay .
He ’s not living for free .
I do n’t need another kid around the house . ”
I ’ve been critical of Ochocinco this past offseason , stating that he ’s been more of a distraction than a funnyman like most perceive him to be .
And his face tattoo joke was flat out stupid .
But I ’ve got to admit , him telling the media that he ’s staying over at the Palmer house is pretty damn funny .
I ca n’t get the image of Chad showing up at Carson ’s front door with an overnight bag and a big ass smile on his face out of my head .
Or him knocking on the door of the master bedroom and asking to borrow a toothbrush because he forgot his .
Hilarious .
One of the things I found annoying with Gnome is that any time I access one of my Fat32 / NTFS partitions it ends up placing an icon on the desktop until I reboot .
Since I do most of my programming in a transparent shell I like to keep my desktop clean .
After doing a bit of research I found a solution :
Hit Alt +F2 and run gconf - editor
Go to Apps -> Nautilus -> Desktop
Remove the check mark from volumes_visible
You ’ll notice that the Configuration Editor ( gconf- editor ) is similar to Window ’s Registry Editor .
With that being said , use the same amount of caution you ’d use when editing your Window ’s Registry .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a resolution apologizing to African - Americans for the wrongs of slavery .
The nonbinding resolution sponsored by Sen . Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , is similar to a House resolution adopted last year that acknowledged the wrongs of slavery but offered no reparations .
The House will have to vote on the issue again because the composition of that chamber changed after last November 's elections .
The resolution was approved on a voice vote .
Because it is nonbinding , it does not have to be forwarded to the president for his signature .
Several states have passed similar resolutions , but the House resolution was the first time a branch of the federal government did so .
Harkin's resolution " acknowledges the fundamental injustice , cruelty , brutality and inhumanity of slavery , and Jim Crow laws , " and " apologizes to African - Americans on behalf of the people of the United States for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow laws . "
Jim Crow laws were state and local laws enacted mostly in U.S. Southern and border states between the 1870s and 1965 that denied African - Americans the right to vote and other civil liberties , as well as legally segregated them from whites .
Some members of the African - American community have called on lawmakers to give cash payments or other financial benefits to descendants of slaves as compensation for the suffering caused by slavery .

The common man ’s guide to the Mandelbrot Set .
Z → Z2 + C
I think I first saw the Mandelbrot set in 2nd grade , in the Guinness book of world records .
It was listed as “ Most complicated mathematical object ? “ .
While reasonably interesting , at 2nd grade I was more intrigued by the obese motorcycling twins , and that picture of the giant spider .
A number of years later , I picked up “ Chaos ” by James Gleick which explained things more thoroughly .
At that point in high school I was already handy in programming simple games and graphics in BASIC .
Plotting the Mandelbrot set intrigued me , but I was discouraged as it had those troubling imaginary numbers .
My graphing calculator did n’t natively support such things , and my knowledge of BASIC was n’t that extensive .
So , the dream sat deferred .
This last year , spurred on partly by trying to get Euler ’s e^i Pi x through my head , i revisited the land of imaginary numbers .
Taking things nice and slowly , it was n’t so bad .
Adding ( a + bi ) and ( c + di ) was just ( ( a+c ) + ( b+d ) i ) .
And multiplication of those same two terms was ac + ( ad ) i + ( bc ) i + ( bd ) i2 .
Mandelbrot came to mind , and I decided to look up the equation .
The core equation is expressed as Z → Z2 + C .
The arrow part indicates this equation is iterative .
One starts with 0 as the initial value for Z , and any complex number for C .
For example , say we choose to run this equation with ( 1 + 1i ) as our first C value :
1st iteration : 02 + ( 1 + 1i ) = ( 1 + 1i )
2nd : ( 1 + 1i)2 + ( 1 + 1i ) = ( 2i ) + ( 1 + 1i ) = ( 1 + 3i )
3rd : ( 1 + 3i) 2 + ( 1 + 1i ) = ( - 8 + 6i ) + ( 1 + 1i ) = ( - 7 + 7i )
4th : ( - 7+7i ) 2 + ( 1 + 1i ) = … and so on
So , ok .
I ’m doing stuff with imaginary numbers , and I ’m using the word “ iterate ” which is kind of neat .
But how does this result in my cool picture of the Mandelbrot set ?
The set is painted on the “ imaginary plane ” .
The imaginary plane is a 2d space , with an X axis and a Y axis .
Any point on this plane represents a distinct imaginary number , ( a + bi ) .
The X coordinate represents the real part , and the Y coordinate represents the imaginary part .
So , to find the point that represents ( 3 + 2i ) , go over 3 on the X axis , and up 2 .
That ’s the point .
Any point on this plane is either “ in ” or “ not in ” the Mandelbrot set .
If the point is “ in ” it shows up on the graph and gets colored in .
To find out , pick a point on the plane , and use it as your initial C value in the main equation ( Use zero for the initial Z value ) .
Then run through your iterations and monitor the “ size ” of the result each time .
Here “ size ” is defined as the complex number ’s distance from the origin , via Pythagoras , the “ size ” of ( a+bi ) is √( a2 + b2 ) .
One of three things will happen .
1 ) the value will get larger and larger , shooting off toward infinity .
2 ) The value will get smaller and smaller until it bounces around , always less than about 1 . Or 3 ) The value will work it ’s way back to a previous Z value , and be in an infinite loop .
For cases 2 ) and 3 ) , the initial C value is said to be in the set .
Go ahead and color it in .
You ’re now plotting the Mandelbrot set .
I ’ll give away the surprise , and reveal that the famous shape lies within about ( - 2 < x < 1 ) and ( - 1.2 < y < 1.2 ) .
Colorful renderings come from plotting points that are technically “ out ” of the set , and rising towards infinity .
As it turns out , once the equation returns a value with a size greater than 2 , it can be regarded as lost .
Keep track of how many iterations before it gets to 2 , and color accordingly .
One color for 5 iterations , another color for 10 iterations , and so on .
I whipped up a program to handle this for me .
Here are two renderings of my results :
At about five minutes of computation per shot , not the fastest , but pretty decent I think .
( A big improvement over essentially the same code running on a ti-82 graphing calculator which took about 6 hours to render . )
Slow rendering aside , I got a cool feeling watching the set slowly revealed , and understanding how it worked .

Over the past few days I 've been working on haskell bindings to Tokyo Cabinet .
Tokyo Cabinet is a high performance ( non-relational ) database that is a simply composed of records ; just keys and values .
There are several ways of organizing the records in this file , including using a hash table , a fixed - length array and a B +
Tree .
It 's a pretty cool project , I think .
Part of the reason I 'm writing this binding is to get more familiar with the Haskell FFI , the other reason is so I can play with tokyo cabinet while using Haskell . :)
As of current , I do n't have a lot of the API covered ; there is the tokyo cabinet utilities API , and each internal representation used for a database ( B+ Tree / Hash / Array ) have their own different APIs ( although they are designed to be extremely similar in functionality , naming convention , etc . . )
As well there is the abstract API ( an interface that allows you to interact with all the various types of databases using a uniform API ) and two various extensions , tokyo tyrant and tokyo dystopia ( more on that in a bit . )
Excluding Tyrant and Dystopia , that is - the utility API + the core database APIs , I would say I might have somewhere around 15 % of it done .
The utility API is by far the biggest and will take the longest , the hash API is the only thing that even has functions in it right now if you want to manipulate a database .
We can have super - fun contrived examples though !
Here 's the C code :
#include < tcutil.h > # include < tchdb.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < stdbool.h > # include < stdint.h> int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { TCHDB * hdb ; int ecode ; char * key , * value ; /* create the object */ hdb = tchdbnew ( ) ; /* open the database */ if(!tchdbopen(hdb , " casket.hdb " , HDBOWRITER | HDBOCREAT ) ) { ecode = tchdbecode ( hdb ) ; fprintf ( stderr , " open error : %s
" , tchdberrmsg ( ecode ) ) ; } /* store records */ if (! tchdbput2 ( hdb , " foo " , " hop " ) || ! tchdbput2 ( hdb , " bar " , " step " ) || ! tchdbput2 ( hdb , " baz " , " jump " ) ) { ecode = tchdbecode ( hdb ) ; fprintf ( stderr , " put error : %s
" , tchdberrmsg ( ecode ) ) ; } /* retrieve records */ value = tchdbget2 ( hdb , " foo " ) ; if ( value ) { printf ( " %s
" , value ) ; free ( value ) ; } else { ecode = tchdbecode ( hdb ) ; fprintf ( stderr , " get error : %s
" , tchdberrmsg ( ecode ) ) ; } /* traverse records */ tchdbiterinit ( hdb ) ; while ( ( key = tchdbiternext 2 ( hdb ) ) != NULL ) { value = tchdbget2 ( hdb , key ) ; if ( value ) { printf ( " %s:%s
" , key , value ) ; free ( value ) ; } free ( key ) ; } /* close the database */ if(!tchdbclose ( hdb ) ) { ecode = tchdbecode ( hdb ) ; fprintf ( stderr , " close error : %s
" , tchdberrmsg ( ecode ) ) ; } /* delete the object */ tchdbdel ( hdb ) ; return 0 ; }
And the Haskell code :
module Main where import Database .
TokyoCabinet .
Hash import Database .TokyoCabinet .
Util import Control .
Monad import System .
Exit import Data .
Bits import Foreign main = do -- open hdb <- tcHdbNew b <- tcHdbOpen hdb " casket.hdb " ( tcHDBOWRITER .|. tcHDBOCREAT ) when ( not b ) $ panic $ do e <- tcHdbEcode hdb putStrLn $ " open err : " ++ show e -- store records b1 <- tcHdbPut2 hdb " foo " " hop " b2 <- tcHdbPut2 hdb " bar " " step " b3 <- tcHdbPut2 hdb " baz " " jump " when ( not b1 || not b2 || not b3 ) $ panic $ do e <- tcHdbEcode hdb putStrLn $ " put2 err : " ++ show e v <- tcHdbGet2 hdb " foo " b4 <- tcHdbEcode hdb if ( b4 == 0 ) then print v else panic ( putStrLn $ " get2 err : " ++ show b4 ) tcHdbClose hdb tcHdbDel hdb return ( ) panic f = f >> ( exitWith $ ExitFailure ( - 1 ) )
Running it :
$ ghc -- make -L$HOME / lib tchdb1.hs [ 1 of 1 ]
Compiling Main ( tchdb1.hs , tchdb1.o )
Linking tchdb1 ... $ ./tchdb1 " hop " $
This is taken from the Tokyo Cabinet API specification as an example ( fwiw we are using the Hash API here . )
A few things to note :
We do n't traverse records ( yet . )
This is in part because I have not filled out the API ; the other part has to due with the fact I am experimenting with perhaps using Oleg - style enumerators as a potential interface for those interested and am hacking some things up .
Oleg 's enumerator stuff is some of the more down - to - earth things he 's come up with , and if nothing else I can rip it out later .
I think it would be an interesting experiment though .
Currently we have to check err codes if we want to know whether or not operations such as tcHdbGet2 succeeded or failed .
It is probably in the best interests of many haskellers to abstract this out likely with an Either or somesuch .
We have to delete the database manually after we close it ; that is because right now I am using Ptr's to represent these databases .
Very shortly I am probably going to move the hash API over to using Foreign Ptr's so we can have finalizers for freeing the DB in memory ( via tcHdbDel , ) although you will always be responsible for closing it before that happens ( the utility API deals with allocated memory all over the place with the various things it provides , such as extensible strings / array lists , so the util module already heavily uses Foreign Ptr's . )
It is not done , not by a longshot .
Other things to take into consideration :
Performance .
As of right now there is a lot of conversions between CStrings and regular String 's which , everybody should know by now , are quite slow .
This is one of the bigger things that have hit my mind , and perhaps going instead from CString 's to ByteStrings would be a better choice ?
How could we accomplish this if so ?
Data .
ByteString .
Internal hackery ?
Benchmarks and stress testing will be necessary before any major conclusions ; the FFI could end up being the major bottleneck for all I am aware .
The Abstract API ; should it be included ?
Should it be the only API available at all , or would it be more appropriate to only fill out bindings to the various databases and abstract things with a type class ?
This is a design issue more than anything , and I 'd like to hear the opinion of other Haskeller 's out there .
Tokyo Tyrant ; this will probably have to come at a later release , but essentially tokyo tyrant is an interface to tokyo cabinet databases over the network .
Currently it only runs on Linux though , so if someone wanted this , they would have to add and test it themselves .
Tokyo Dystopia , again this might come at a later release , but Dystopia is a full - text search system built on top of Tokyo Cabinet .
utf8 .
I am very very very stupid when it comes to just how character encodings work and comments here would be greatly appreciated so I can learn more about character encodes and the whole 9 yards ( the way I see it , most people are of the opinion that something either accepts unicode or it is bullshit ) ; from the looks of the tokyo cabinet site it looks largely as if utf8 comes into play when dealing with Dystopia .
ut f8 - string should hopefully make this easy .
If you would like to examine the code in its current , very primitive form you can do so by doing :
$ git clone git://github.com/thoughtpolice/haskell-tokyocabinet.git
Or you can check it out online :
http://github.com/thoughtpolice/haskell-tokyocabinet/tree/master
I 'll post more on this in the next coming week or so if I can make headway on the oleg - ian stuff or something else significant .
Comments on the spots I 'm wary of are super duper ultra great and welcome .
The U.S. House of Representatives will vote on this very question tomorrow .
Contact your elected officials to tell them what you think should be done :
#1 : The US should n’t interfere .
#2 : U.S. involvement would be counterproductive , but human rights violations must be condemned .
# 3 : The US should voice its support for the demonstrators .

10:55 pm : Breaking : House to vote on Iran resolution tomorrow
According to CQ , the House will vote tomorrow on a bipartisan resolution expressing support for Iranian dissidents who have been demonstrating since the presidential election last week .
House Foreign Affairs Chairman Howard Berman ( D - Calif. ) joined with Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind. ) on a resolution condemning the violence against the protesters , the suppression of communication technologies , and affirming “ the universality of individual rights . ”
This measure is almost guaranteed to pass–probably with an overwhelming number of votes–which will unfortunately put the Congress directly at odds with the White House in responding to the crisis in Iran .
Up to now , the President has been very cautious not to be seen as choosing one side over the other in the election dispute , saying he does n’t want the US to become the story inside Iran .
But the Congress seems poised to speak out more vocally on the subject , choosing to come down squarely on the side of the dissidents .
Les Gelb , earlier in the day , had this to say :
Republican leadership calls for Obama to condemn Iran ’s election results and speak out for the demonstrators shows no knowledge of Iran whatsoever .
If he did so , America would become the issue in Iran , not Ahmadinejad , and we would become the excuse and justification for spilling Iranian blood .
These sniping remarks by Republican leaders also shows they put pandering to their right wing above American national security .
Why ca n’t they listen to their own real foreign policy expert — Senator Richard Lugar — and see and say that the U.S. must exercise restraint in our public statements for Iran ’s sake and our own .
As we ’ve been saying for some time now , the President has it right here .
Though of course everyone supports free and fair democracies , Iran is a country in flux at the moment .
If US political figures come out in strong support for Mousavi , then what ?
Wo n’t Ahmadinejad just use that to declare Mousavi is a puppet of the West ?
That certainly wo n’t do much to help the cause for reform in Iran .
9:00 pm : A powerful and frightening account of a Canadian journalist mistakenly detained by the Ministry of the Interior in Iran :
Before I knew what was happening , I was whisked away on a motorcycle to the Interior Ministry headquarters , and taken to a large basement room .
Inside a concrete room to my left , I could see more than 50 others being made to stand in uncomfortable positions – on their toes with their hands pressed behind their heads .
Some were covered in blood , and police with batons patrolled the rows , tapping some detainees on the shoulders with their sticks .
There was no screaming , just the sound of boots pacing on the concrete floor .
For a few terrifying hours yesterday , I was mistaken for an anti-government protester , giving me a glimpse into how the hundreds arrested over the weekend are being treated by authorities in a system where dissidents are known to “ disappear ” and not be seen again for months .
What was dubbed a “ terrible misunderstanding ” by the officers in charge has given this Canadian journalist a glimpse into the nightmare that countless Iranians are experiencing right now .
When President Obama condemns the violence and human rights abuses going on in Iran , this is what he ’s talking about .
8:51 pm : A loyal niacINsight reader used the website we mentioned earlier to subtitle one of Mousavi ’s campaign videos :
Vodpod videos no longer available .
7:21 pm : Basij Killed
According to Iranian state media , ( words in quotes are the language they used ) 1 Basij has been “ martyred . ”
He was killed by “ thugs ” ( referring to the protesters who ran him over in Sa’adat Abad a northern well - off part of Tehran ) .
According to state media , they have reported 8 deaths , one of them being a Basij and the others , according to them “ thugs . ”
6:32 pm : What ’s going on here ?
Earlier in the day , we saw a message posted on Mousavi ’s facebook page saying “ Mousavi & Karoubi ask supporters NOT to attend Friday prayers ( which is being delivered by supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei ) . ”
We thought this was strange , since they were saying exactly the opposite just a little while ago .
Now , Nico and the NYT both have commented about the same message going up on Twitter .
Just as we were trying to figure out what was going on on Mousavi ’s facebook page , the message was removed .
This appears to be an organized attack on Mousavi and Karroubi ’s facebook and twitter accounts to send misleading messages to supporters .
We got the impression that they were trying to take these messages down as fast as possible , so we are pretty convinced they ’re not legitimate .
5:22 pm : Before and After the elections ( thanks to NIAC intern Ali for the translation ) :
5:14 pm : Shirin Ebadi , Nobel Peace Prize Laureate , wrote over at HuffPo :
Iranian Authorities Must Void Elections to Restore Peace on Streets On Monday , June 15 , more than 1 million people marched in the streets of Tehran to support Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi — two defeated presidential candidates — and to object to the results of last week ’s election .
Their destination was Azadi Square ( Freedom Square ) which , at the time of the Islamic Revolution 30 years ago , had been the gathering spot for revolutionaries .
Mir Hossein Moussavi climbed on top of a minibus and spoke to the people through a loudspeaker .
He told them to continue their objections but refrain from aggressive behavior , in order not to give security forces an excuse to resort to violence .
5:10 : More on the victims ’ families in Qom from http://twitter.com/iranbaan:
“ According to Fars News Agency , the martyr Rajae ’s wife has been arrested in Qom .
It is said that the family and wives of some of famous martyrs such as Hemmat and Bakeri were also with Rajae ’s wife .
Fars wrote that these women along with Jamileh Kadivar and Ms. Mohtashami
Pour were planning a sit-in in Qom when they were arrested by the armed forces . ”
4:44 pm : Greatest headline ever , courtesy state - run Fars news — “ Government : Iranians ’ Unity Thwarts Enemies ’ Plot ”
4:18 pm : According to a reader comment , at least a few of the government phone numbers we posted below check out :
Those numbers you posted at 1:34 pm – they work !
I tried a few .
A couple were engaged and on a couple more I got through !
A great way to maybe make a real difference – call up our government and tell them what you think .
Btw , I am not in Iran – just from there .
3:54 pm : Translated from twitter .
“ In Tabriz today , riot control police and police in civilian clothes severely beat people with batons and they arrested a LOT of people . ”
Though I have read reports in recent days that the protests have been spreading to cities such as Ahvaz and Esfahan , this may represent a substantial escalation of state violence .
We ’ll keep you posted on whether the reports confirm this .
3:51 pm : Fars News is reporting two children of Rafsanjani ( Faezeh and Mehdi ) have been forbidden from leaving the country .
They also claim that students gathered at the prosecutor ’s office to demand that legal action be taken against them .
I ’m not going to speculate , but you can read the story below and draw your own conclusions .
3:37 pm : Translated from twitter .
“ State TV is trying to portray Hashemi Rafsanjani as the main reason of turmoil . ”
I ’ve been watching intently for any signs that Rafsanjani will tip his hand .
As of this point , he ’s been working largely behind the scenes .
He reportedly called an emergency meeting of the Assembly of Experts yesterday , which ( we can only speculate ) might have been intended to raise questions about Khamenei ’s fitness to remain as Supreme Leader .
( The Assembly of Experts is in charge of naming Khamenei ’s successor , and has some oversight responsibility for the Supreme Leader ) .
Though we ’ve heard conflicting reports about him resigning from his very powerful government posts , he has yet to reveal his positions publicly .
In my opinion , if Rafsanjani comes out of the woodwork and joins the demonstrations , the entire situation will be changed drastically .
If this news is correct , the hardliners understand the threat , and are trying to neutralize it .
3:35 pm : US rallies continue
As all of you know , rallies have been taking place all over the country .
The past week ’s demonstrations have been seen in Iowa , North Carolina , New York , DC , California , Pennsylvania , Massachusetts , Washington , and more .
These rallies have been widely successful as hundreds of Iranian Americans across the country have spoken out against the human rights abuses and election fraud of the Iranian elections .
From Orange County to Raleigh to the nation ’s capitol , young and old alike have come together to support their fellow Iranians .
Via facebook ’s
Where is my vote ?
group , upcoming Iran election demonstrations will be held in the following days in Colorado , San Jose , New York , and Sacramento , as well as another tonight at 6 in DC outside the Iranian interests section , with a processions to the Russian and Chinese Embassies .
3:00 pm : The Twitter Revolution
For the first time in history , ordinary citizens have taken it upon themselves to report news instantaneously , spreading information to all the corners of the world online via Twitter .
Though internet connectivity in Iran has been somewhat spotty , Iranians have been able to chat with the outside world to give an accurate account of the events on the ground .
This firsthand perspective is even more important given the crackdown on foreign journalists , many of whom have had their equipment confiscated and even a few of whom have been detained by the authorities .
So I am struck by the tragic irony , then , of a story we reported on recently here at niacINsight , about how Microsoft has blocked its instant messaging service in Iran , citing its interpretation of US sanctions laws .
The US Treasury has made it clear that transfers of informational materials are allowed :
The receipt or transmission of postal , telegraphic , telephonic or other personal communications , which does not involve the transfer of anything of value , between the United States and Iran is authorized
We ’ve spoken to OFAC , who said that Microsoft did this without any prompting from them , and that they are discussing the matter with Microsoft officials .
( We ’re also reaching out to them as well ) .
At a time like this , it sure would be nice to be able to have as much access as possible to the Iranians on the ground , letting them tell the world what is actually going on .
It ’s a shame that they have to fight against their own government ’s repression and censorship and at the same time struggle with America ’s attempt to isolate the Iranian regime at the expense of its people .
2:27 pm : Today ’s rally was called “ green wave in black silence ” as Iranians paid respect to those who have lost their lives in the demonstrations .
“ I fear the day that the youth will demonstrate for their rights against you as result of your incompetence . ” – Ayatollah Khomeini .
( This photo was posted on Mousavi ’s website today . )
2:14 pm:Victims ’ families visit Qom ’s religious authorities
According to Mowj [ Farsi ] , a group of families affected by the recent violence and several widows of Iran - Iraq war joined together to gp Qom today to plead for justice and express their opposition to the use of violence against the Iranian people .
They also issued a statement asking the Ulema ( religious authorities ) to come to their help , saying :
Where should we , women of this land , take our complaints ?
Today , our daughters and sons in universities , dorms , and streets are getting slapped in the face , their blood is being shed , [ they ] are being hit by sticks , batons and bullets , and [ they ] are losing their lives while they are defending their rights and their nation ’s rights .
The families asked the Ulema to help them and to speak up against the atrocities being committed against their children and the Islamic Revolution .
As representatives of “ concerned and suffering mothers , ” the families said they expect the Ulema to defend the ” oppressed , patient , and resistant people ” because “ if you do n’t think about saving Islam from the claws of petrifaction , fraud and lies today , it will be too late tomorrow . ”
1:58 pm : Nico points out that there is a website that allows users to insert their own subtitles to videos .
Check it out and send your translations to yourletters /@/ niacouncil.org .
1:54 pm : By now , most people have heard about the six Iranian soccer players who wore green arm bands in yesterday ’s game with S. Korea .
But what you may not know is that the team is always accompanied by an “ ethics official ” who did not approve the green arm bands , and the players were forced to remove the armbands at half time .
Multiple twitter reports say the official has already sent a report to officials in Iran about the players ’ conduct .
The players showed remarkable bravery to make such a display during the game , which was broadcast live by the Iranian state media .
1:32 pm : From a reader comment in a thread below , a website encouraging people from anywhere BUT in Iran to call and speak out about the election violence .
( Usual caveats apply , since we have n’t tested any of these numbers and have no knowledge of their validity ) .
Call these numbers to discuss the Iranian elections !
Do NOT do from within Iran .

12:43 pm : Thanks to Jill at PSR , a tweeted translation of Mousavi ’s statement to supporters early afternoon today :
I have come due to concerns of current political and social conditions – to defend the rights of the nation .
I have come to improve Iran ’s international relations .
I have come to tell the world and get back Iran ’s pride , our dignity and our future .
I have come to bring to Iran a future of freedom , of hope and of fulfillment .
I have come to represent the poor , the helpless , and the hungry .
I have come to be accountable to you , my people , and to this world .
Iran must participate in fair elections .
It is a matter of national importance .
I have come to you because of the corruption in Iran. 25 % inflation means ignorance , thieving and corruption .
Where is the wealth of my nation ?
What have you done with the $ 300 billion in the last four years ?
The next Government of Iran will be chosen by the people .
Why do all our young want to leave this country ?
I know of nobody else who places himself ahead of 20 million other of a nation .
12:12 pm : Basij scared and cover their faces
The Basij have now begun to cover their faces , whereas previously they had n’t .
This indicates they are becoming more scared of retaliation from the general public .
Also , we have heard that cell phone service is cut off at night .
There have been efforts to identify members of the Basij who have used violence against demonstrators , through facebook and other social networking websites .
11:48 am : Friday prayers
Through contacts in Iran we have heard people are being bused and brought into Tehran for Friday prayers .
They have closed down some streets and have made others one way to help with the constant flow of traffic coming into Tehran .
There is much confusion whether or not to protest tomorrow is an especially sacred day as prayers are led by Supreme Leader Khamenei .
Apparently , Moussavi , Rezai and Karrubi will show up as well .
11:26 am : Rallies Spread to San Francisco
Iranian Americans have showed their continued support for the demonstrators in Iran , by rallying day in and day out all over the country .
In fact , the demonstrations have spread worldwide , as many have made a stand against the disputed presidential election .
On Tuesday , hundreds came out in San Francisco ’s Union Square in their bright green colors demanding human rights and democracy in Iran , and urging the UN to be involved .
Demonstrators planned on sleeping in Union Square until another rally started Wednesday at 6:00 pm .
These demonstrators are not giving up , as the rallies are planned to continue for a fourth straight day on Thursday .
The demonstrators in San Francisco are inspired by the young people in Iran , as are many of us all over the world .
According to one demonstrator , Sahar Maali , “ We see them fighting on everyday and it ’s a matter of showing them that we ’re back here supporting them as well , so they keep on pursuing their fight for basic freedoms that everyone deserves . ”
The rallies in San Francisco and throughout the country show the anger and frustration that this election has caused for many Iranian Americans .
And no one can deny that the demonstrators in Iran indeed have a tremendous amount of solidarity outside of their country .
11:00 am : Ahmadinejad heckled by Mousavi crowd ( before election : “ Just do n’t cheat this time . ” )
This video shows Ahmadinejad getting heckled by a throng of Mousavi supporters during the campaign .
This actually happened before the vote , which I think makes it even more significant .
Mousavi supporters pointed to the “ Green Wave ” that was then sweeping across the country with a wave of optimism for reform ( highlighted by a prescient bit of caution : “ Just do n’t cheat this time . ” )
For my money , chants do n’t get much better than “ Ahmadi Bye Bye ! ”
Someone I assume to be a government official walking up to a car with hand raised , in gray suit , condescendingly saying “ Droplets of water , return to the ocean . ” ( it ’s a reference to a poem ) The cameraman asking him : “ Have you not been looking to the streets ?
Just look at the streets ! ”
Second cameraman : “ Mr. Mirzavi , we liked you . ” [ too many people talking at the same time – inaudible ]
Cameraman again : “ Just do n’t cheat this time . ”
Then they start screaming “ MOUSAVI ! ” when Ahmadinejad shows up and “ LIAR ! ” when he is pulling away , and then my favorite : “ Ahmadi Bye bye . ”

Now we have a big problem .
Andrew Sullivan discovered that one of the three Obama Justice Department attorneys who wrote and filed the anti-gay DOMA brief last night is W. Scott Simpson , a Mormon Bush holdover who was awarded by Alberto Gonzales for his defense of the Partial Birth Abortion act .
Funny , on first reading the brief this morning , I wrote the following :
It ’s pretty despicable , and gratuitously homophobic .
It reads as if it were written by one of George Bush ’s top political appointees .
And it was !
At least a Bush employee .
And a Mormon to boot .
No wonder the brief was so filled with hate and bigoted religious right talking points , such as comparing gay marriage to incest and pederasty .
Obama let a Mormon Bush Justice Dept. employee create his public position on DOMA with the courts .
This is really beyond the pale .
I ca n’t wait until Obama let ’s W. Scott Simpson write the brief in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade .
First - Time Manager Stories of Failure and Success
I ’ve promoted scores of people into first - time manager positions .
Some did well and some did n’t .
Here are a few of their stories , with names changed and a few relevant facts altered to protect the individuals involved .
Fred
This was early in my career , and I did n’t have any experience in promoting people into management .
But I was working for a rapidly growing company , and my organization had gotten too big for me to manage all by myself .
I needed to add a manager below me to supervise some of the programmers .
Fred had already demonstrated project leadership skills , and he seemed to relate to people pretty well .
I did n’t have a lot of other candidates in my organization , and I wanted to promote from within , so I decided to give Fred a shot as a new manager .
Two things sabotaged Fred ’s chances from the start .
First , he seemed to think that making him a manager made him always right .
Where previously he would have open and honest discussions with project team members about technical details , now he did n’t want to get their feedback .
The way he saw it , he was manager so he told his people what to do .
If he did n’t know what to do , he just made something up .
Big mistake !
Second , he could n’t handle the pressure .
This was probably related to the first reason , but it made matters worse .
He would freeze up and become almost unresponsive in certain confrontational situations .
It ’s as if he was trying to hold himself back from exploding .
Or maybe he just froze out of fear .
I tried to help Fred in his new role , providing advice and coaching .
But it was clear that things were n’t going to change very quickly , and so I took Fred out of the manager role and looked elsewhere for a solution .
Fred calmed down once he was off the hot - seat , and he went back to being a good project leader .
I lost track of him over the next few years , so I do n’t know whether he ever got over his initial problem and went into management again .
His first attempt certainly did n’t work out well , so I could understand him being reluctant after that .
Lessons Learned ( by me , by Fred )
You ca n’t always tell in advance who will make a good manager and who wo n’t .
Obviously I was wrong about Fred .
Some guidance from my own manager about how to pick a new manager would have been useful , but I was pretty much left to fend for myself .
Being in management does n’t give you any special knowledge or insight that you did n’t have before .
And it ’s important that you do n’t act like it does .
Being a manager gives you some authority and the opportunity for some different behavior .
It ’s up to you how you use it .
It helps if there ’s a way to reverse a bad promotion .
In some companies you could n’t move Fred back to an individual contributor role — you ’d have to fire him .
And in other companies Fred ’s pay grade would have changed with the promotion , and it would be an administrative nightmare trying to change him back to his old position and salary .
Few companies allow you to “ try out ” a manager .
Pam
Years later , with a lot more management experience under my belt , I got a promotion but kept responsibility for my old department too .
I needed to “ replace myself ” in my old role .
Again I wanted to promote from within if at all possible ( it ’s always my first choice unless I want to take the organization in a radical new direction ) .
My existing employees all had relationships with our customer organization , and industry experience was important .
I made it known to the employees that I was asking for internal candidates , and I talked to three or four employees who wanted to apply .
I decided on Pam , who had years of experience with the customers , and who had an in - depth understanding of the industry .
She was n’t as technically knowledgeable as some of the other candidates , but she had good people skills and she was respected by all of the employees .
In preparation for the management turnover , I spent a lot of time with Pam talking about each of the employees in the department , pointing out strengths and weaknesses , and giving advice on how to best motivate each employee .
Pam absorbed the information eagerly , and she was very prepared for the turnover when it happened .
Once Pam had officially taken over the department , I got together with Pam every day to see how things were going and to offer coaching advice where needed .
After a week or so I stopped the daily meetings , but I still kept in touch and I made myself available whenever needed for advice and coaching .
A few times Pam got herself in over her head on particular issues , but I worked with her to help her get herself out of trouble — I tried very hard not to “ take the wheel ” and make her look incapable .
It was important that her employees viewed her as the manager in her own right — not as a figurehead representing me .
Lessons Learned ( by me , by Pam )
The support I gave Pam really helped .
I used it as a model for future management turnovers .
Good management skills can be taught as long as the new manager wants to learn .
I had to clearly communicate to employees that Pam was the new manager and that they had to work through Pam to solve any problems .
Otherwise the employees would have done an end - run and come to me .
This would have put me in the middle between Pam and the employees — not a desirable place to be .
More Stories to Come
I ’ll put more stories in a future post , but for now I invite you to add your own stories in the comments .
Do n’t forget to talk about any lessons learned by you or by the new manager .

The ASP.NET team just released the first public preview of ASP .
NET MVC Version 2 .
You can download it here .
Today ’s preview works with .
NET 3.5 SP1 and VS 2008 , and can be installed side - by - side on the same machine as ASP .
NET MVC 1.0 ( meaning they do n’t conflict and your existing ASP.
NET MVC 1.0 projects will not be impacted if you install it ) .
If you have both ASP .
NET MVC 1.0 and ASP .
NET MVC 2.0 installed you ’ll see two ASP .
NET MVC project templates within Visual Studio 2008 ’s “ New Project ” dialog :
The release notes that come with the ASP .
NET MVC 2 Preview release detail how to upgrade existing ASP .
NET MVC 1.0 projects to use V2 if you ’d like to migrate them forward to take advantage of the new features .
New Features
ASP .NET MVC V2 will include a bunch of new capabilities and features ( some of these have already been called out on the ASP.
NET MVC roadmap page ) .
Today ’s “ Preview 1 ” release contains a first look at some of the new features .
Many more features will show up in future preview builds .
The Preview 1 bits are still relatively early - the team is releasing today ’s build to start receiving and incorporating feedback .
Below are some quick details about some of the new Preview 1 capabilities :
Areas Support
ASP .NET MVC 2 includes support for a new feature called “ areas ” that allow you to more easily partition and group functionality across an MVC application .
Areas provide a means of grouping controllers and views to allow building subsections of a large application in relative isolation to other sections .
Each area can be implemented as a separate ASP .
NET MVC project which can then be referenced by the main application .
This helps manage the complexity when building a large application and facilitates multiple teams working together on a single application together .
Below is a screen - shot that shows a single solution that has three projects .
One of the projects is named “ CompanySite ” and includes the core site content , layout and controllers and views .
There are then two separate “ Area ” projects - “ Blogs ” and “ Forums ” .
These projects implement the functionality that exists under the / Blogs and / Forums URL sections of the site – and encapsulate all of the routing rules , controllers and views implementing these sections :
The Preview 1 release includes the first part of the areas feature implementation .
It does n’t include any tool support yet ( right now you need to manually add a build task to create an area project and set it up ) .
Future preview releases will include tooling support , and expand and refine the feature - set further .
DataAnnotation Validation Support
ASP .NET MVC 2 now includes built - in support for the DataAnnotation validation support that first shipped with .
NET 3.5 SP1 – and which is used with ASP .
NET Dynamic Data and .NET RIA Services .
DataAnnotations provides an easy way to declaratively add validation rules to Model and ViewModel classes within an application , and have automatic binding and UI helper validation support within ASP .
NET MVC .
To see this feature in action , we can create a new “ Customer ” ViewModel class like below that has five properties on it ( implemented using the C# automatic property feature ) .
We can then decorate the properties with appropriate validation rules using the DataAnnotation attributes implemented within the System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations namespace .
The code below uses 4 different built - in validation rules – [ Required ] , [ StringLength ] , [ Range ] , and [ RegularExpression ] .
The namespace also includes a base class ( ValidationAttribute ) that you can subclass to create your own custom validation attributes .
We can then create a CustomersController class that has two Create action methods on it .
The first Create action method handles HTTP GET requests to the “ / Customers / Create ” URL , and renders a view template based on an empty Customer object .
The second Create action method handles HTTP POST requests to the same URL ( and takes a Customer object as a method parameter ) .
It checks if there are any model binding errors to the input submitted , and if there are errors it redisplays the view template using the already entered data .
If there are no errors it displays a success view to the user :
Finally , we can right - click within either of the Create action methods above , choose the “ Add View ” context menu command , and automatically “ scaffold ” a “ create ” view template that is based on the Customer object .
When we do this the generated scaffolded view template will contain the below HTML < form > for our Customer :
And now when we request the “ / Customers / Create ” URL in our browser we ’ll get an initial empty form like below :
If we enter invalid input and perform a post to the server , the ASP .
NET MVC 2 model binder will detect that there are DataAnnotations attributes on our Customer class , and automatically validate the posted form input using them .
If there are errors our controller action method redisplays the form – which will cause the appropriate validation error messages to be rendered to the user like below .
Note how the validation property error message strings we specified using the DataAnnotation attributes are displayed to the user by the Html .
Validation helper methods .
No extra code is required to enable this .
The above form will redisplay with error messages each time the user enters invalid input and attempts to perform a form post .
In a future ASP .
NET MVC 2 preview we are planning to ship the jQuery Validation plugin as part of the default project template , and add support for the automatic client - side JavaScript enforcement of DataAnnotation validation rules as well .
This will enable developers to easily add validation rules in one place on either a Model or ViewModel object , and have them be enforced both client and server - side everywhere it is used within the application .
If you do not wish to annotate your model or viewmodel classes directly , you can alternatively create a “ buddy class ” that accompanies your model class and encapsulates the DataAnnotaton rules separately .
This capability is also useful for scenarios where VS is code - generating / updating the properties on a class directly and you cannot easily add attributes to the generated code ( for example : classes generated by the LINQ to SQL or LINQ to Entities designers ) .
In addition to providing built - in support for DataAnnotations , the DefaultModelBinder class in ASP.
NET MVC V2 now has new virtual methods that can be overridden to easily integrate other validation frameworks as well ( for example : Castle Validator , EntLib Validation , etc ) .
The validation UI helper methods in ASP .
NET MVC are designed to support any type of validation framework ( they have no direct knowledge of DataAnnotations ) .
Strongly Typed UI Helpers
ASP .NET MVC V2 includes new HTML UI helpers that enable you to use strong - typed lambda expressions when referencing the view template ’s model object .
This enables better compile - time checking of views ( so that bugs can be found at build - time as opposed to runtime ) , and also enables better code intellisense support within view templates .
You can see an example of the better intellisense in action below – notice how I am getting a full listing of the customer model object ’s properties when using the new Html. EditorFor ( ) helper method :
Preview 1 has built - in support for new Html. EditorFor ( ) , Html.LabelFor( ) , and Html.DisplayFor ( ) helpers .
An updated MVC futures assembly that we are shipping this week adds additional Html. TextBoxFor ( ) , Html.TextAreaFor ( ) , Html.DropDownListFor( ) , Html.HiddenFor( ) , and Html.ValidationMessageFor ( ) helper methods as well ( overtime these will move into the core ASP.
NET MVC 2 assembly too ) .
Below you can see an updated version of the “ create ” view template for our customer creation scenario .
Notice how instead of using string expressions to reference the customer object we are instead using strongly - typed lambda expressions with the UI helpers .
We can get full intellisense and compile - time checking with all of them :
The Html.LabelFor ( ) helper method above generates < label for = " Name " >
Name :</ label > HTML markup .
The Html.EditorFor ( ) helper method can be used for any datatype value .
By default it is smart and will output an appropriate HTML < input /> element based on the type to be edited .
For example , it will generate < input type= ” text ” /> elements for the first four properties above ( which are strings and integers ) .
It will generate a < input type=” checkbox ” /> element for the final “ IsActive ” property – which is of type boolean .
In addition to supporting simple data - types , the Html. EditorFor ( ) helper method also allows you to pass more complex objects with multiple properties to it .
By default it will loop over the public properties of the object and generate a < label > , < input / > element , and any appropriate validation message for each property it finds .
For example , we could re-write the above view to have just a single Html. EditorFor ( ) call for the Customer object to conceptually output the same markup as above :
The strongly typed helpers allow you to optionally decorate the properties of the Customer ViewModel class with [ DisplayName ] attributes to control the label string that is output for each property used ( for example : instead of having a label text of “ IsActive ” we could apply a [ DisplayName ( “ Is Active Customer : ” ) ] attribute ) .
You can also add [ ScaffoldColumn ( false ) ] attributes to indicate that a particular property should n’t be rendered at all in scenarios like above where complex objects are passed to Html. EditorFor ( ) .
UI Helper Templating Support
The Html.EditorFor ( ) and Html.DisplayFor ( ) helper methods have built - in support for rendering both standard data - types as well as complex objects with multiple properties .
As noted above , they also support basic customization of rendering by applying attributes like [ DisplayName ] and [ ScaffoldColumn ] to the ViewModel .
Often developers want to be able to customize the output from UI helpers even further , though , and have total control over what is generated .
The Html. EditorFor ( ) and Html.DisplayFor ( ) helper methods support this via a templating mechanism that allows you to define external templates that can override and completely control the output rendered .
Better yet , you can customize the content rendered on a per-datatype / class basis .
With Preview 1 you can now optionally add an “ EditorTemplates ” and / or “ DisplayTemplates ” folder underneath either a \ Views \ [ controllername ] directory ( if you want to customize the rendering for views used by a specific controller ) or underneath the \ Views \ Shared folder ( if you want to customize the rendering for all views and controllers in an application ) .
You can then add partial template files to these folders to customize the output rendering performed on an individual datatype and / or class basis .
For example , below I have added an EditorTemplates folder underneath the \ Views \ Shared folder – and added three custom template files to it :
The “ Customer.ascx ” template above indicates that I want to customize the output anytime Html. EditorFor ( ) is passed a Customer object ( for example : I could customize the exact ordering / layout of the Customer properties ) .
The “ DateTime.ascx ” template above indicates that I want to customize the output anytime Html. EditorFor ( ) is passed a DateTime property ( for example : I might want to use a JavaScript datepicker instead of a plain textbox ) .
I could optionally add an “ Object.ascx ” template to the folder if I wanted to override the default rendering of all objects .
In addition to customizing rendering on a per - type basis , you can also add “ named templates ” to the folder .
A common scenario might be a “ CountryDropDown ” template that handles a string datatype – but instead of providing a standard textbox instead renders a < select > dropdownlist of country values that a user can pick from .
Below is what this editor template might look like :
We can explicitly indicate that we want to use the above template by passing its name as an argument when we invoke the Html. EditorFor ( ) helper method .
For example , below in addition to specifying a lambda expression for our Country property , we are also specifying the name of the editor template to use when rendering it :
Alternatively , you can specify “ UIHint ” attributes on your ViewModel properties and types .
This allows you to indicate the default editor or display template to use in a single place , and have it be used in all views across your application ( without having to explicitly pass it as an argument to Html. EditorFor ) .
Below is an example of how to indicate using a UIHint attribute that the Customer .
Country property ( which is of type string ) should by default use the CountryDropDown template when being rendered :
Once we set the above attribute on our ViewModel we no longer need to specify a template name explicitly when we use that property with Html. EditorFor ( ) .
And now when we hit refresh on our / Customers / Create URL our Country property will be rendered as a dropdown instead of a standard textbox :
Other Cool Features
ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 1 includes a number of other small , but really nice , feature additions .
A few of my favorites include :
New [ HttpPost ] Attribute
It is pretty common with ASP .
NET MVC to split up the handling of a URL across two action methods – one that handles GET requests and one that handles POST requests .
With ASP.NET MVC 1 you used an [ AcceptVerbs ( HttpVerbs .
Post ) ] attribute to indicate the “ Post ” version of an action method :
This still works with ASP .
NET MVC 2 .
Alternatively , though , you can also now take advantage of a terser [ HttpPost ] attribute that does the same thing :
Default Parameter Values
Handling optional parameters is a pretty common web scenario .
With ASP.NET MVC 1 you could handle optional parameters either by registering a custom routing rule and specifying a default value with it , or by marking an action method parameter as nullable and then adding code within your action method to handle whether it was null ( and if so provide a default value ) .
ASP .NET MVC 2 Preview 1 now supports decorating action method parameters with the DefaultValueAttribute from the System .
ComponentModel namespace .
This allows you to specify a parameter value that ASP .
NET MVC should pass in if it is not present as part of the request .
For example , below is an example of how we could handle both the / Products / Browse / Beverages and / Products / Browse / Beverages ?
page=2 URLs – and have the “ page ” parameter value be “ 1 ” if it is n’t provided as part of the querystring :
VB today allows you to specify default parameter values directly within the VB language ( avoiding the need to explicitly specify the DefaultValue attribute like above ) .
C# in VS2010 will also support default values with optional parameters – which will enable you to rewrite the above code simply as :
This should make handling default / optional scenarios really easy and clean .
Binding Binary Data
ASP .NET MVC Preview 1 adds support for binding base64 - encoded string values to properties of type byte [ ] and System .
Data .Linq .
Binary .
There are now two overloaded versions of Html .
Hidden ( ) that can take these data - types .
These can be useful for scenarios where you want to enable concurrency control within your application and want to roundtrip timestamp values of database rows within your forms .

NET MVC 2 project that implements the sample code I demonstrated in the above walkthrough .
Today ’s build of ASP .
NET MVC 2 is just a first preview .
More features will be coming in future previews , and the team expects to get a lot of feedback on ways to improve and enhance the release .
The goal with doing these regular previews is to help make sure that this feedback process is open and that anyone who wants to participate can easily get involved .
Please post any feedback , suggestions or problems you have to the ASP .
NET MVC Forum on www.asp.net.

Four - year old Daniel Santos da Silva and his older brother Diego Mota dos Santos , 10 , heard their first gunshots in April .
Their father was shot in a dispute over land on a cattle ranch near the Brazilian town of El Dorado , in the Amazonian state of Para .
The boys heard he was taken to hospital , but they have not seen him since .
The ranch is called Espirito Santo , holy spirit , though goodwill to all men is hard to find there .
Heavily armed guards protect the thousands of cattle that roam its lush pastures and the hacienda - style complex built on a hill at the farm 's centre , complete with swimming pool .
Daniel and Diego live on the muddy fringe of the farm in a hastily erected collection of palm frond - roofed huts to shield them and a hundred - odd other families from regular tropical downpours .
They are squatters , but squatters rights are rarely observed in Para .
Espirito Santo and thousands of farms like it raise cattle on Amazonian pasture that was once rainforest .
The farms are huge , and so is their impact .
The cattle business is expanding rapidly in the Amazon , and now poses the biggest threat to the 80 % of the original forest that still stands .
Where loggers have made inroads to the edge of the forest in the states of Para and Mato Grosso , farmers have followed .
A report today from Greenpeace details a three - year investigation into these cattle farms and the global trade in their products , many of which end up on sale in Britain and Europe .
Meat from the cattle is canned , packaged and processed into convenience foods .
Hides become leather for shoes and trainers .
Fat stripped from the carcasses is rendered and used to make toothpaste , face creams and soap .
Gelatin squeezed from bones , intestines and ligaments thickens yoghurt and makes chewy sweets .
Greenpeace says it has lifted the lid on this trade to expose the " laundering " of cattle raised on illegally deforested land .
The environment campaign group wants Brazilian companies that buy cattle to boycott farms that have chopped down forest after an agreed date .
To get the industry onside , it is seeking pressure from multinational brands that source their products in Brazil , and , ultimately , from their customers .
Three years ago , a similar exposure of the trade in illegally grown Brazilian soya brought a rapid response from the industry , and a moratorium on soya from newly ­deforested farms that still holds .
Last month , the Guardian joined Greenpeace on an undercover visit to the cattle farming heartland around the town of Maraba , deep inside the Amazon region .
While saving the rainforest is a fashionable cause in faraway developed countries such as Britain , in Maraba it is a provocative and even ­dangerous ideal .
Many people in Maraba work at the slaughterhouse perched on a hill that overlooks the town .
The facility is owned by the Brazilian firm Bertin , one of the companies targeted by Greenpeace for buying cattle from farms linked to illegal deforestation .
After slaughter , Greenpeace says Bertin ships the meat , hides and other products to an export facility in Lins , near Sao Paolo .
From there , they are shipped all over the world .
The firm is Brazil 's second largest beef exporter and the largest leather exporter .
It is also the country 's largest supplier of rawhide dog chews .
Bertin denies taking cattle from Amazon farms associated with deforestation .
The company says it " makes permanent investments in initiatives that minimise impacts resulting from its activities " and that it seeks " to be a reference in the sector " .
It says it has already blacklisted 138 suppliers for " irregularities " .
Brazilian government records obtained by Greenpeace show that 76 cattle were shipped to the Bertin slaughterhouse in Maraba from Espirito Santo farm in May 2008 .
Another 380 were received in January this year .
Standing on Espirito Santo's shady veranda , Oscar Bollir , the farm manager , insists they do nothing wrong .
Under Brazilian law , such farms inside the Amazon region must retain 80 % of the original forest within their legal boundary .
So why is there pasture for as far as the eye can see ?
The farm is very big , Bollir says , and most of the required forest is on the other side of some low - slung hills in the distance .
The squatters on the farm , part of a political movement to settle landless people on illegally snatched farmland , are troublemakers , he says .
" They do n't want land they just want trouble .
They want to take all the farms . "
Earlier that day , he says , he and his men had been forced to visit a neighbouring farm where squatters had killed cattle .
Unlike the previous incident on Espirito Santo , when Daniel and Diego 's father was shot alongside several others , Bollir says , this time there had been no trouble .
He adds that he is aware of environmental concerns , but that his priority is to produce food and jobs .
" Why are these other countries looking at Brazil and telling us what to do ? "
The next day , Greenpeace investigators flew over Espirito Santo – the group has a single - engined plane donated by an anonymous British benefactor .
Bollir 's promised bonanza of forest was not there .
GPS data combined with satellite images show that just 20 % to 30 % of the farm is forested .
A local lawyer also reported that during the nearby dispute over the killed cattle , three squatters had been shot and injured .
The Greenpeace report identifies dozens of farms like Espirito Santo that it says break the rules across Para and Mato Grosso to supply Bertin and other slaughter companies .
Campaigners say there are probably hundreds or even thousands more .
Cheap pasture from clearing and seeding rainforest is very attractive to farmers without easy access to the expensive agrichemicals and intensive land management techniques used in more developed countries .
Within a few years , the planted pasture becomes overrun with native grass , unsuitable for cattle .
Many farmers then take the cheap option and knock down adjoining forest to start again , leaving swaths of unproductive deforested land in their wake .
Andre Muggiati , a campaigner with Greenpeace Brazil based in the Amazon town of Manaus , says efforts to protect the forest in frontier regions such as Para are crippled by a lack of effective governance .
Government inspections are inadequate and many farms are not even registered so checks cannot be carried out .
Casual violence and intimidation are common .
" It 's totally unregulated and many people behave as if the law does not apply to them .
It 's like the old US wild west , " he says .
Illegal deforestation is not the only problem : farms are regularly exposed as using slave labour , and , like many tropical forest regions , there are regular and violent clashes over land ownership .
The problem is clear a three - hour flight across the patchy forest from Maraba , where a clearing on the side of the river is home to a few hundred Parakana people , a tribe with no contact with the outside world until 1985 .
Greenpeace can only reach the village because its plane is equipped to land on the sluggish water , but cattle farmers are steadily intruding .
Hundreds of farms have been set up in the surrounding reserve , and they are not welcome .
" Since the invaders arrived there have been many problems , " says Itanya , the village chief .
Food is harder to find , he says , and discontent is growing .
" If the government do n't find a solution we will solve it ourselves .
We know how to make poison arrows and we are ready to kill people . "
It is not an idle threat : in 2003 the bodies of three farmers were discovered in the jungle not far from the village .
Itanya says it was the work of a neighbouring group .
" We asked them many times to stay away , " Kokoa , the chief of the neighbouring group , told the Guardian through an interpreter .
" They would n't , so one time we said to them that you will never go back and you will stay here forever .
We killed them .
We are proud that we defended our land . "
Food for thought
How much of the Amazon rainforest has been lost and how quickly ?
Since the 1970s , when satellite mapping of the region became available , around a fifth of the rainforest has been destroyed , an area the size of California .
Greenpeace US estimates that , between 2007 and 2008 , another 3 m acres ( 1.2 m hectares ) of the Brazilian Amazon have been destroyed .
What is driving the destruction ?
Logging , cattle farming and soy plantations are key , plus the increased construction of dams and road , and shifting patterns of farming for local people and mining ( for diamonds , bauxite , manganese , iron , tin , copper , lead and gold ) .
These factors are often interlinked – trees are cut down for timber and the cleared land can be used for grazing cattle .
Soybeans are then cultivated on the same land .
Land is also cleared for biofuel crops .
According to Greenpeace , around 80 % of the area deforested in Brazil is now cattle pasture .
Brazil 's biggest export markets for beef are Europe , the Middle East and Russia .
Friends of the Earth Brazil estimate that cattle farming in Brazil has been responsible for 9 bn - 12bn tonnes of CO² emissions in the past decade , almost equivalent to two years worth from the US .
Infrastructure projects such as hydroelectric dams also threaten the forests because they cause large areas to be flooded .
Currently , the biggest planned project is the Tocantins River basin hydroelectric dam , the effects of which stretch over a distance of 1,200 miles .
Why are cattle a particular problem ?
In 2006 , the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation found that the livestock industry , from farm to fork , was responsible for 18 % of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions .
In addition , livestock - rearing can use up to 200 times more water a kilogram of meat compared to a kilo of grain .
Furthermore , global meat consumption is on the rise , having increased by more than two and half times since 1970 .
Who is trying to stop the destruction ?
At this year 's climate change negotiations in Copenhagen , governments will consider the " Redd " mechanism .
This is the idea that richer countries could offset their carbon emissions by paying to maintain forests in tropical regions .
The idea has roots in the 2006 review of the economics of climate change by Nicholas Stern , who said £ 2.5 bn a year could be enough to prevent deforestation in the eight most important countries .
But Friends of the Earth says the proposals seem to be aimed at setting up a way to profit from forests , rather than stop climate change , and fail to protect the rights of those living in the forests .
In 2007 , Greenpeace also came up with a plan to stop deforestation in the Amazon by 2015 .
It included creating financial incentives to promote forest protection ; and increased support for agencies to monitor , control , and inspect commercial activities .
So far , only some of these proposals have been taken up by the Brazilian government .

• This article was amended on Tuesday 23 June 2009 .
We said that according to Greenpeace US , between 2007 and 2008 an estimated 3 m acres of the Amazon rainforest have been destroyed .
That figure was for the Brazilian part of the rainforest only .
This has been corrected .

Budget Nightmare : 10 Most Broke States
From road paving to services for the poor , states cut back to balance budgets .
July 7 , 2009  --
The economic problems of American families are now pounding many state governments which are in turn slashing services to balance their budgets in one of the most difficult years in decades .
High on the chopping block are benefits to the poor , money for education , highway repairs , hours that state offices are open and even closures of state parks and recreation areas .
Things are so bad that 48 states addressed or are facing shortfalls in the fiscal year that just started .
The total deficit : $ 166 billion , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities .
Many states are also already predicting shortfalls next year .
Only Montana and North Dakota have so far been unscathed in their state budgets .
The problem : as workers get laid off or see their pay cut , they end up owing the state less in income tax .
Further compounding the issue is a shortfall in sales tax caused by consumers cutting back in the recession .
Finally , companies are making less money and also paying less in taxes .
" It 's a revenue problem , not a spending problem , " said Elizabeth McNichol , a senior fellow at the center .
Unlike the federal government , nearly every state is legally required to balance its budget .
For many , the spending cuts would have been worse without the $ 787 billion federal economic stimulus package .
No one is immune from the wide - ranging cuts .
" States are really looking at everything , " said Todd Haggerty , a research analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures .
" Anything and everything is on the table . "
To come up with a list of the worst state budget situations , ABC News asked the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities to look at the budget gaps that states closed -- or still need to close -- as a percentage of their overall budgets .
Coming in at the top of the busted list is California , which is going through a miserable budget crisis .
But there are also some surprises on the list , including Alaska and Vermont .
California : $ 53.7 billion shortfall or 58 percent of its budget
Perhaps no state has a more daunting problem to overcome than California .
Its massive deficit is larger than the entire budgets of several states .
The state has almost a $ 27 billion gap to close before balancing its budget .
The $ 53.7 billion figure adds in the massive gap that the state has already closed .
There 's very little fat to trim without residents feeling even more pain .
Adding to the attention today will be Michael Jackson 's memorial service , reportedly estimated to cost up to $ 4 million for police overtime .
While the city of Los Angeles will be footing that bill -- for now -- the cost draws even more attention to the state 's troubles .
The Golden State 's problems are emblematic of the nation's .
But whatever happens in California could actually have implications for all of us : the state accounts for 12 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product and the largest share of retail sales of any state .
The cash flow shortage is so bad that last week the state , which if counted as a country would have the eighth largest economy in the world , had to start issuing IOUs to make its bills .
The IOUs , issued for the first time since 1992 , are being given to vendors and residents who were owned tax refunds .
( The IOUs pay an interest rate of 3.75 percent , better than most people are seeing in their savings accounts these days . )
The state hopes to redeem the script in October .
Residents seeking to get a new driver 's license or even call with questions about their IOUs might find their pleas falling on deaf ears .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is shutting down most of state government for three " Furlough Fridays . "
Voters in May rejected five ballot measures that would have helped stop the budget crisis .
Now , to raise cash , Schwarzenegger has called for selling off certain state properties .
He also proposed eliminating $ 70 million of funding for state parks , which would likely result in the closure of 220 parks .
The legislature is trying to avoid those closures through a $ 15 increase in annual motor vehicle registration fees .
California drivers would then get free admission to the parks .
To help close the gap , the state has also increased co-payments and reduced dental benefits in its children 's health program .
Other big cuts include state aid to local school districts , a 10,000 - student enrollment cut at the California State University system and the elimination of dental and vision services for many Medicaid recipients .
Other Troubled States
Arizona : $ 4 billion shortfall or 41 percent of its budget
Arizona was ground zero for the collapse of the housing market .
Cities like Phoenix have seen home prices plunge while jobs have dried up .
Income tax collections are down 34.4 percent and the sales tax is down as sakes of building supplies and other consumer goods plunge .
The governor and legislature have been battling over way to close the budget gap .
At issue : more than $ 630 million in spending cuts , including the elimination of a welfare program for disabled people waiting for Social Security benefits .
Gov. Jan Brewer wants to temporary hike the state 's sales tax from 5.6 percent to 6.6 percent .
For each of the three years she expects it will take to turn around the state 's economy , the hike would bring in an extra $ 1 billion .
But lawmakers have balked .
Instead they have reduced school spending , cut $ 40 million from the state universities , $ 49 million from the Health Services Department and taken $ 43 million in slot - machine revenues that were supposed to go to highways and used it for other spending .
The governor vetoed most of the $ 8.4 billion budget Wednesday , saying it " incorporates devastating cuts to education , public safety and our state 's most vital services for the frail . "
She called lawmakers into a special session Monday to pass a budget that avoids deep cuts in part by increasing the sales tax .
The government is unable to make cuts to roughly one third of the budget because voter mandates stipulate exactly how that money should be spent .
Nevada : $ 1.2 billion or 38 percent of its budget
Like Arizona , Nevada was hit hard by the housing market .
But the state also got whacked by a drop off in tourism and gambling revenue .
First , high gas prices kept tourists away .
The only way to get to Las Vegas is to drive a far distance or fly .
Then the recession made people less willing to gamble with their paychecks .
That has put a massive strain on the state 's budget .
To help close the budget gap , the state is looking at decreasing teacher pay by 4 percent and giving state employees 12 unpaid furlough days , the equivalent of a 4.6 percent pay cut .
Lawmakers are considering raising some taxes -- for instance the tax on cigarettes could go from 80 cents a pack to $ 1.80 -- but Gov. Jim Gibbons has threatened to veto any new taxes proposed by the legislature .
That includes cigarette , liquor and mining taxes .
To help close the gap , the governor has ordered cuts to education , including delaying an all - day kindergarten expansion and eliminating funds for gifted and talented programs and a magnet program for students who are deaf or hard of hearing .
Illinois : $ 9.2 billion or 33 percent of its budget
Last week , Gov. Pat Quinn vetoed a budget proposal that would taken away $ 5 billion in federal funds from social services for the poor and homeless .
However , the state still does not have a budget in place even though the new fiscal year began on July 1 .
Quinn , who replaced ousted governor Rod Blagojevich only six months ago , has stated he will veto any other budget proposal that does not call for a tax increase .
Even with the 50 percent income tax hike that Quinn has proposed , the governor 's administration will carry out $ 1 billion worth of budget cuts that amount .
These include a $ 185 million cut in state operations , a $ 140 million cut in health insurance , $ 175 million cut in education and $ 283 million cut in the Department of Human Services .
More than 2,500 state workers may lose their jobs and those who stay may be required to work 12 unpaid furlough days .
Wall Street's Woes
Home to Wall Street , New York state has seen its personal income tax collections fall a whopping 48.9 percent in the last year , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
When Wall Street started laying off workers and slashing multi-million dollar bonuses , the state 's coffers felt the impact .
Although a divided state Senate in Albany enters its fifth week of a budget stalemate , New York 's struggle to close the budget gap has dragged on for several months .
The state legislature passed a $ 131 billion spending plan at the start of its fiscal year , which began on April 1 .
The gap there was cut , in large part , due to income tax hikes on the state 's richest citizens .
For households with taxable income above $ 500,000 , the tax rate went from 6.85 percent to 8.97 percent .
For those earning above $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 – depending on filing status – but less than $ 500,000 , the rate jumped from 6.85 percent to 7.85 percent .
In addition , New York placed limits on itemized state income tax deductions for taxpayers making over $ 1 million and reduced a state - funded credit on New York City 's personal income tax .
The changes are projected to raise more than $ 5 billion a year .
But that wo n't be enough .
Gov. David Paterson has proposed a $ 698 million reduction in school funding , $ 3.5 billion cuts in healthcare services and layoffs for more than 500 state government workers .
To further help balance budgets , tuition at public universities also increased .
Alaska : $ 1.35 billion shortfall or 30 percent of its budget
The county 's most - remote state had a shockingly large shortfall this year for one simple reason : oil prices plunged .
Alaskans pay no state sales tax or state income tax .
In fact , the state pays every man , woman and child who has lived there at least a year money to , well , live there .
The so - called Permanent Fund paid $ 3,269 from oil taxes and royalties to the 610,768 residents who qualified last year .
But signs are showing that the fund is n't so permanent .
Oil production in Alaska has declined by 64 percent since 1988 but had very little impact on the state 's budget because at the same time the price of each barrel of oil has shot up significantly .
Then came the global recession .
Oil prices fell from more than $ 140 a barrel last summer to about $ 30 this winter before climbing back up to $ 64 a barrel today .
That drop caused the state 's corporate taxes -- essentially all oil money -- to fall 32 percent compared to last year , creating a rare budget problem for Alaska .
The state easily solved it this year by taking money out of flush reserve funds , built up during oil boom years .
But many state watchers questioned the future of Alaska 's ability to fund its services and continue its annual Permanent Fund payments to residents .
That 's one problem Gov. Sarah Palin wo n't have to deal with .
She 's announced her resignation from the job .
New Jersey : $ 8.8 billion or 30 percent of its budget
The Garden State has seen a double - whammy of problems from a drop in Wall Street salaries and also a fall in gambling revenues in Atlantic City .
To close the gap , the state eliminated 2,000 jobs by encouraging early retirement , leaving vacancies unfilled and laying off staff .
About $ 325 million will be saved through wage freezes and furloughs , although unions have yet to formally sign on to the plan .
The state is also skipping making a $ 940 million payment to its pension fund .
The money will have to be made up at some point and the longer the state waits , the larger the repayment will have to be .
New Jersey also raised about $ 1.2 billion in new taxes , mostly from tax filers earning $ 400,000 or more .
It also scaled back and eliminated property tax rebates for people earning $ 150,000 or more .
The state also increased so - called sin taxes on cigarettes , lottery winnings larger than $ 10,000 and alcohol , except beer .
Big Layoffs
With nearly $ 800 million in tax increases , Oregon is among a handful of states to recently approve big tax hikes .
Budget cuts announced in May anticipated the layoffs of 1,700 state employees and a 14 percent budget cut in higher education , for $ 2 billion in cuts .
Oregon 's lawmakers traditionally meet just every other year , but state legislators met last month to pass a $ 6 billion budget for the state 's K - 12 schools , despite concerns from Gov. Ted Kulongski .
However , schools still have to cut back , as evidenced by bigger classes , fewer music and athletic programs and a freeze in employee pay at many districts .
While public school students were spared from deep cuts , the same cannot be said for the state 's working poor , seniors and disabled .
The Department of Human Services will receive $ 387 million less than what officials say is needed to sustain their programs .
Among the largest cuts is a $ 41 million reduction in a daycare program for low - income families .
The state legislature will reconvene in February .
Vermont : $ 278 million or 25 percent of its budget
Compared to the other states , Vermont 's $ 278 million shortfall might not seem like much .
But then again , this tiny New England state does n't really spend much , so the shortfall actually takes up a large portion of the budget .
After a special legislative session last month , Vermont lawmakers approved a state budget .
But the state 's financial woes have translated into cuts across many sectors .
Lawmakers tapped money from the state 's education fund to pay overall expenses , resulting in a loss in state aid of about $ 18.4 million to the Education Fund for fiscal year 2010 .
Lawmakers also enacted a provider rate cut from 4 percent to 2 percent for contracted healthcare services , impacting mental health providers , sign language interpreters and rehabilitation programs for children .
The state is also taking cuts that could impact its environment , a major selling point in its important tourism industry .
Vermont eliminated approximately 10 percent of the jobs in its Agency of Natural Resources , a state department dedicated to protecting the environment .
Most of the job cuts were made among the agency 's solid waste management staff .
Vermont now charges a sales tax for digital music downloads and liquor , has raised tobacco taxes and will shut down several highway rest areas .
Washington : $ 3.6 billion or 23 percent of its budget
Washington state 's deficit has taken its toll on social services for residents .
Lawmakers predicted budget cuts would result in the loss of 8,000 state jobs and 40,000 fewer people receiving state - subsidized health insurance .
There are already 14,000 people on the waiting list for that program .
In April , state legislators approved plans to cut the state 's public education system by nearly $ 800 million , though some school districts will receive money from the federal stimulus package .
Measures passed this year will also allow the state to raise the current 7 percent cap on undergraduate tuition increases to up to 14 percent at public universities .
Approximately 9,000 fewer students are estimated to be able to enroll in a state university as a result .
A 70 percent cut in Medicaid for low - income seniors took effect on July 1 , forcing elderly care providers to lay off staff .
Connecticut : $ 4.1 billion or 23 percent of its budget
Rounding out the worst 10 is Connecticut , where there is currently no budget in place after Governor M. Jodi Rell vetoed Democratic legislators ' budget proposal earlier this month .
Rell issued a 34 - page executive order to provide $ 1.4 billion for state operations for the month of July .
Last September , the state 's Department of Children and Families budget took a heavy hit , including a more than $ 9.8 million cut in residential services and shelters for children in state custody .
The Department of Developmental Services and the Department of Social Services lost more than $ 8 million and $ 5 million respectively .
Rell 's latest proposal calls for $ 5.4 million cuts in the state 's library services .
We 've had a wonderful response rate , much better than we anticipated .

The House Energy and Commerce Committee has begun marking up the bill , and it is headed to the full House of Representative some time this month .
H.R. 2454 is expected to be weakened significantly through the process .
One would expect Republicans and lobbyists to water down the bill , but farm state Democrats are also vying for home state protection for ethanol .
Ethanol is big political business in farm country .
Ethanol is an alternative biofuel that can be made from corn , sugar cane , or switchgrass .
In fact , Henry Ford ’s first mass - produced automobile was designed to run off of 100 % ethanol , so the fuel has a long history in the car industry .
When added to gasoline , ethanol reduces ozone formation by lowering volatile organic compounds and hydrocarbon emissions .
This all sounds good , but there is controversy surrounding corn - based ethanol .
Michael Grunwald of Time reports that one person could be fed for a year “ on the corn needed to fill an ethanol - fueled SUV ” .
Some research demonstrates that the production of corn ethanol consumes more energy than it yields , and there is concern that corn - based ethanol is raising the price of food , although the USDA denies the increase is significant .
Other concerns surrounding ethanol include antibiotic overusage in its production and its heavy water footprint .
As expected , most debate over the American Clean Energy And Security
Act of 2009 falls across party lines , except when it comes to ethanol .
Farm state Democrats are demanding the legislation include ethanol safeguards .
According to Reuters :
Democrats from farm states are threatening to withhold support unless they win safeguards for ethanol and other biofuels from proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations .
The climate bill could give them leverage : assuming most House Republicans oppose the bill , many in this group of moderate Democrats must be on board in order to pass the measure .
Large farm groups are opposing Waxman - Markey , not just because of the impact on ethanol .
Representative Lucas ( R - OK ) explains :
From higher energy costs to lost jobs to higher food prices , cap - and - trade promises to cap our incomes , our livelihoods , and our standard of living , while it trades away American jobs and opportunities .
For this reason , as this bill stands now , I can not embrace it .
I am not alone .
So far , 34 agriculture groups including the American Farm Bureau Federation , American Farmers and Ranchers , National Corn Growers Association , National Chicken Council , and National Turkey Federation have sent letters to members of Congress encouraging them to oppose the Waxman - Markey bill .
Meanwhile , no large farm groups have endorsed it .
Many farm state Democrats agree , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) recently traveled to the midwest to gain support for the climate bill .
Why should ethanol be exempt from EPA regulations under Waxman - Markey ?
Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture contribute greatly to the effects of climate change .
From farting cows to growing crops that emit nitrous oxide , agriculture is globally a major source of greenhouse gases .
Feeding the world is just as important as providing biofuels .
It seems unfair to exempt ethanol while expecting food producing farmers to abide by the American Clean Energy And Security Act of 2009 .

Video key evidence at inquiry into death of Iraqi soldier in British custody – a death which could have ' rallied extremists ' , says QC
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
A video of a British soldier screaming obscenities and abuse at hooded Iraqi detainees was shown today at the opening session of a public inquiry into how the hotel receptionist , Baha Mousa , was killed while in British custody .
The film shows Corporal Donald Payne , formerly of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , shouting and swearing at the Iraqis as they are forced to maintain painful " stress positions " .
The video is a key piece of evidence in a wide - ranging inquiry into the death of Mousa , which got under way today .
Mousa died after sustaining 93 injuries while being detained by soldiers from the former Queen 's Lancashire Regiment in Basra , southern Iraq , in September 2003 .
A central issue of the inquiry is why five " conditioning techniques " – hooding prisoners , putting them in stress positions , depriving them of sleep , depriving them of food and water , and playing white noise – were used on Iraqi detainees .
The techniques , inflicted on IRA suspects , were banned in 1972 by the then prime minister , Edward Heath .
In an opening statement , Gerard Elias QC , counsel to the inquiry , said of the film : " Even if one considers only the video that we have just looked at , it may be thought to be entirely apparent that these detainees were being subjected to stress positions and prolonged hooding .
Detailing the abuses against six other Iraqis arrested with Mousa , Elias said : " One man says he was made to dance in the style of Michael Jackson . "
Other detainees claimed they were urinated on and forced to lie face down over a hole in the ground filled with excrement .
The inquiry heard " scandalous " allegations that the soldiers tried to manipulate the detainees ' moans into an " orchestrated choir " .
Elias said : " There was shouting , moaning – even screaming – coming from the TDF [ temporary detention facility ] from time to time during the detention , according to some witnesses . "
The inquiry was also told that Mousa 's injuries may have been more intentionally inflicted than was previously thought .
Elias said : " Statements to this inquiry now suggest perhaps a greater degree of deliberation than has hitherto been described . "

The hearing was told that Mousa died at about 10 pm on 15 September 2003 after a " struggle " with Cpl Payne and another soldier , Private Aaron Cooper .
Elias said witnesses suggested that Payne was trying to restrain Mousa by putting his knee on the detainee 's back and pulling his arm back to put plastic handcuffs on him .
He went on : " It has been suggested that Baha Mousa 's head was banged on the floor or wall as this was happening . "
Different pathologists gave the cause of Mousa 's death as either asphyxia and multiple injuries or asphyxia alone , the inquiry heard .
The manner of his death risked undermining the sacrifices made by UK troops serving abroad , the inquiry in central London heard .
Elias QC said the manner of Mousa death could " act as a rallying cry for extremists . "
Outlining what the inquiry would examine , Elias said it would look at the training and guidance given in relation to the use of hooding and handcuffing and other tactics , he said .
It would also explore whether the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office had known of such tactics .
Seven soldiers faced a court martial at Bulford camp , in Wiltshire , on war crimes charges relating to the receptionist 's death .
All but Cpl Payne were cleared on all counts in March 2007 .
The court martial highlighted confusion among high - ranking military officers about whether the techniques were lawful .
The MoD has said it will not take disciplinary action against military personnel if their testimony to the inquiry suggests they earlier lied or withheld information .
The public inquiry hearings are expected to take about a year , including several breaks , with the chairman publishing his report and recommendations in autumn next year .
The major music labels are committed to the idea of graduated response , but they are n't wedded to any particular method of implementation .
In France , disconnecting repeated online copyright infringers has been pushed by legislation .
In the US , the RIAA wants ISPs to sign up to a voluntary scheme .
But in Ireland , the " sue - them - into - doing - what - we - want " school of thought has triumphed .
The Irish Recorded Music Association ( IRMA ) has filed lawsuits against two of the country 's largest ISPs , seeking to force compliance with an Internet disconnection scheme .
It worked well enough earlier this year , when Ireland 's largest ISP Eircom settled a similar case with the industry and agreed to implement a graduated response program .
After a third accusation of online copyright infringement , Eircom will disconnect a user 's Internet connection .
But neither BT Ireland nor UPC Ireland sound inclined to settle .
A UPC spokesperson told the Irish Times that " there is no basis under Irish law requiring ISPs to control , access or block the internet content its users download " and that the ISP would fight the case in court .
The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland ( ISPAI ) agrees .
In a March statement , the group said , " Irish copyright law provides an avenue for the pursuit of people breaching copyright through the courts ...
Privacy of user communications is protected in European and Irish legislation .
ISPs can not be expected to ignore these merely because it does not suit another private party . "
If other ISPs refuse to adopt the graduated response plan , Eircom will be at a competitive disadvantage , so it has been pushing the recording industry to go after the other ISPs .
Eircom has not begun disconnecting users , saying that the details are still being worked out , but we suspect that the company would prefer to delay disconnections until a few of the country 's other major ISPs are ready to do the same thing .
But with the European Parliament already on record opposing Internet disconnections and France 's Constitutional Council taking a dim view of disconnections that happen without judicial oversight , Irish ISPs will be wary .
Sure , signing on to the record industry 's plan might make one lawsuit disappear , but it invites a host of other legal challenges from subscribers and consumer groups .
Scientists agree , by an overwhelming majority , that the death penalty has no deterrent effect .
They felt the same way over ten years ago , and nothing has changed since then .
States without the death penalty continue to have significantly lower murder rates than those that retain capital punishment .
And the few recent studies purporting to prove a deterrent effect , though getting heavy play in the media , have failed to impress the larger scientific community , which has exposed them as flawed and inconsistent .
The latest issue of the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology contains a study by a Sociology professor and a graduate student at the University of Colorado - Boulder ( Michael Radelet and Traci Lacock ) , examining the opinions of leading criminology experts on the deterrence effects of the death penalty .
The results reveal that most experts do not believe that the death penalty or the carrying out of executions serve as deterrents to murder , nor do they believe that existing empirical research supports the deterrence theory .
In fact , the authors report that 88.2 % of respondents do not think that the death penalty deters murder — a level of consensus comparable to the agreement among scientists regarding global climate change .
At the same time , only 9.2 % of surveyed experts indicated that they believed the death penalty results in a significant drop in murder cases ( 56.6 % completely disagreed with that statement , while 32.9 % thought the correlation between capital punishment and lower homicide numbers to be “ largely inaccurate ” ; 1.3 % were uncertain ) .
The study builds upon previous research , published in 1996 , in which the opinions of 67 leading experts in the field of criminology were surveyed .
The most recent study sent the same questions to a new group of experts ( a total of 73 ) , among whom were fellows from the American Society of Criminology , as well as award - winning criminology scholars .
A majority of respondents also expressed the opinion that death penalty states do n’t have lower homicide rates than states where capital punishment has been abolished .
The authors point to empirical evidence that backs this up — in 2007 murder rates in states that still had the death penalty exceeded those in states that have abolished it by no less than 42 % .
More than eighteen percent of surveyed experts went even further and actually expressed the belief that the death penalty leads to a higher rate of murders , something the authors call the ‘ brutalization hypothesis . ’
In addition , a majority of respondents involved in both the 2008 and the 1996 studies believe that “ ( d ) ebates about the death penalty distract Congress and state legislatures from focusing on real solutions to crime problems . ”
Overall , the authors conclude that there is no significant difference between the opinions of experts from the 1996 and the 2008 time periods and that “ a vast majority of the world ’s top criminologists believe that the empirical research has revealed the deterrence hypothesis for a myth . ”
Radelet and Lacock also discuss and point to significant inconsistencies in a number of studies conducted by economists , who have found the death penalty to have a deterrent effect .
These inconsistencies lead them to conclude that “ ( r) ecent econometric studies , which posit that the death penalty has a marginal deterrent effect beyond that of long - term imprisonment , are so limited or flawed that they have failed to undermine consensus . ”
We ’re well into the blockbuster film season , and each year , especially recently , it ’s interesting to see which flick will crack the list of the highest grossing films of all time .
For many years , E.T. – The Extra-Terrestrial and Star Wars sat atop the list .
Those made sense considering they are must - see classics , but as time has passed , the list has become saturated with films that most certainly are n’t memorable .
While there are a number of changing factors that contribute to the amount of money that films make over the years ( including inflation , competition from other media , how soon they go to DVD and cable , etc. ) , what was once a list of must - see films is now a list of … how did that get so popular ?
Let ’s look at the top grossing domestic movies of all time , and ponder how they became that way :
1. Titanic ( 1997 ) $ 600,788,188
Being vastly over budget and late on delivery ultimately benefited this film at the box office .
It came out in the winter of 1997 with little competition .
Stunning visual effects , the heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio , and an oh - so - simple - that - it - works love story sent teenagers back to the theaters multiple times .
As a result , it sits atop the list by far .
It even won Best Picture at the Academy Awards , though its script was n’t all that spectacular .
Regardless , this film will remain in the public eye for years to come .
And look what would be number one if the guy had steered clear of that iceberg …
And let ’s not forget , it had this song :
2. The Dark Knight ( 2008 ) $ 533,184,219
This film benefited from the untimely death of Heath Ledger , who played the Joker and won a posthumous Oscar for Best Supporting Actor .
It was , relatively speaking , a fun film , but how it out - grossed films far better ( basically , many of the ones below it ) seems unthinkable .
3. Star Wars : Episode IV – A New Hope ( 1977 ) $ 460,998,007
The original came out in 1977 , and was re-released theatrically in 1978 , 1979 , 1981 , 1982 and with additional scenes and enhanced special effects in 1997 .
The impact Star Wars has has on pop culture is incalculable .
How it ’s not No. 1 by flying colors is likely a result of the changing factors involved in movie - going over the years .
If there were a list of films that changed film - making , this , along with 2001 : A Space Odyssey , would top the list .
4. Shrek 2 ( 2004 ) $ 437,212,000
Ugh .
A sequel is the fourth top - grossing film of all time ?
Okay , I ’ll give it credit because it was n’t bad and it ’s digital animation , which is stunning to watch , and obviously parents bring their kids to see this , which boosts ticket sales ( though the kids generally are charged a smaller fee ) .
But the first Shrek , which was better , made $ 267,665,011 in 2001 and is currently 38 on the list .
So how this is No. 4 ever is strange , to say the least .
5. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ( 1982 ) $ 434,974,579
Stephen Spielberg ’s masterpiece blew audiences away and certainly benefited from repeat viewings ( I saw it twice when I was only 6 years old ) .
The film was re-released in 1985 and then again in 2002 , with minor differences from the original ( look them up – Spielberg caved to political correctness ) .
My favorite fun fact : Harrison
Ford originally shot scenes for this film that were never shown .
6. Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace ( 1999 ) $ 431,088,301
When this film came out , fans called George Lucas a sell - out and blasted him for focusing more on special effects and less on a good script .
Yet , here it is , out - grossing ‘ better ’ films such as The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi .
MY guilty pleasure , however , are Darth Maul action figures .
7. Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man ’s Chest ( 2006 ) $ 423,416,000
Again , a sequel out - grossing the original .
At least this film was n’t bad , but the story got so confusing that at one point , two characters had to explain exactly what was going on ( the scene on the beach , midway through the film ) .
When I saw this on opening day , some viewers were dressed as pirates .
Maybe if they re-release The Shawshank Redemption I ’ll consider dressing as a New England prisoner .
8. Spider -Man ( 2002 ) $ 407,681,000
I ’m not too surprised about this film making this much money considering the special effects and it was a long time in the making .
I ’d been hearing about a Spider - Man movie for decades , and the first one did n’t disappoint .
And this despite sissy - boy Tobey Maguire starring .
9. Star Wars : Episode III – Revenge of the Sith ( 2005 ) $ 380,270,577
The film ( the only one in the series rated PG - 13 ) that led us to the creation of Darth Vader and bridged the way to the original Star Wars .
I believe that this was the best of the three new Star Wars flicks , at least up until Darth Vader screamed “ Nooooooo ! ” ( My brother ’s dog would howl when that part came on ) .
10 . The Lord Of The Rings : The Return of The King ( 2003 ) $ 377,019,252
Part III swept the Oscars and certainly deserves the money it made .
I ’m guessing that the third one made more than the previous two because people who had n’t seen The Fellowship of the Ring and The Tow Towers in theaters saw them on DVD instead .
They were only separated by one year .
Up next is the prequel The Hobbit , and , somehow , a second one .
Expect each of those to wedge their way onto this list .
11 . Spider - Man 2 ( 2004 ) $ 373,377,893
Unlike Lord of the Rings , which kept making more money as each film came out , and unlike the Star Wars saga , which is completely out of order , Spider - Man drew less slightly less interest along the way .
As for the film itself , there was n’t anything particularly great about it , just more of the same .
12 . The Passion of the Christ ( 2004 ) $ 370,773,867
It ’s well - known where these dollars came from – religious Christians flocking to the theaters .
The controversy it drew among Jews alone made headlines , and a deep discussion even at my synagogue .
Also note that this is the only film of its kind on this list , and the only one other than Titanic that is n’t completely imagined .
I have to admit that even though Mel Gibson went nuts over the years , the guy knows film .
13 . Jurassic Park ( 1993 ) $ 357,067,947
Another good film that blew audiences away with groundbreaking special effects .
Spielberg is the man .
Who can forget when they saw the T - Rex fill the big screen ?
Aside from the sequels , other films after this also had dinosaurs running around ( including Peter Jackson ’s King Kong ) .
14 . The Lord of The Rings : The Two Towers ( 2002 ) $ 341,748,130
The only thing that slowed this movie down was Treebeard .
His scenes were drawn out and during repeat viewings , I find myself hitting the fast - forward button ( In case you did n’t know , Treebeard ’s voice is done by the guy who played the dwarf Gimli ) .
The guy who stole the show was Gollum , played by Andy Serkis ( He wrote a book about his experience , available on Amazon and very interesting … I ’ve read it ) .
15 . Finding Nemo ( 2003 ) $ 339,714,978
Pixar ’s highest - grossing film , and rightfully so .
Although , with Pixar ’s track record , do n’t be surprised if something else comes along that makes far more , hopefully knocking off Shrek 2 as the highest - grossing animated film .
16 . Spider - Man 3 ( 2007 ) $ 336,530,303
Not a fan .
They tried to portray that sand guy as a sympathetic criminal because he had to steal to help his sick daughter , and then they spun around what happened in the first film by changing who killed Uncle Ben .
They should absolutely continue making these movies for various reasons , but it ’s pretty sad that this is No. 16 on the list .
17 . Forrest Gump ( 1994 ) $ 329,693,974
This is a film that will last in our memory for years to come .
I even brought my grandparents to see this film , and they rarely went to movies ( maybe once every 5 years ) .
I highly recommend listening to this book on tape or CD .
While there are many parts that are the same as the film , there are far more adventures to follow ( like Forrest going into space and winning at chess after distracting his opponent by passing gas ) .
18 . The Lion King ( 1994 ) $ 328,538,000
A fabulous film with fabulous music .
Imagine how it would ’ve done had it been made by Pixar .
Disney really hit its stride in the 90s with a string of hits , and this one topped them all ( at least at the box office ) .
It also made its mark on the stage .
I ’m looking forward to having kids so I can show them this film .
19 . Shrek the Third ( 2007 ) $ 320,706,665
Oh for the love of God .
Do n’t get me wrong , I like Shrek , but the fact that Shrek 2 is the fourth highest grossing film of all time and Shrek the Third , which is n’t even all that good , still cracks the top 20 , is a true shame .
20 . Transformers ( 2007 ) $ 319,222,000
I was a huge Transformers fan when I was a kid , watched the cartoons and had the toys .
It took them years to make a live action film , presumably as they waited for the special effects technology to work .
It ’s too bad they did n’t spend all that time polishing the script .
21 . Iron Man ( 2008 ) $ 318,298,180
I ’m starting to see a pattern here …
Superhero movies are hot .
Expect Aquaman ( and you know it will get made ) to surpass this one .
22 . Harry Potter and the Sorcerer ’s Stone ( 2001 ) $ 317,575,550
Considering the popularity of the books , I ’m actually surprised that these films did n’t make more dough .
I have n’t seen them or read them yet but I completely respect their popularity in both film and written form .
23 . Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ( 2008 ) $ 317,011,114
To think that the very worst Indiana Jones film made far more than the previous three .
Chalk it up to years of anticipation .
24 . The Lord of the Rings : Fellowship of the Ring ( 2001 ) $ 314,163,000
The first of this trilogy left viewers eagerly awaiting the next film , which came out one year later .
I even know a guy who did n’t realize it was a trilogy , and was confused and disappointed that it ended the way it did .
The Hobbit ca n’t come out soon enough ( slated for 2012 – one reason I want to live till then ) .
25 . Star Wars : Episode II – Attack Of The Clones ( 2002 ) $ 310,676,740
… made more than Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi .
26 . Pirates of the Caribbean : At World ’s End ( 2007 ) $ 309,302,628
I was tempted to walk out of this movie .
Even while wearing my pirate outfit .
Arrrrrrgh .
27 . Star Wars : Episode VI – Return Of The Jedi ( 1983 ) $ 309,206,384
So , George , when do Episodes VII , VIII and IX come out ?
28 . Independence Day ( 1996 ) $ 306,169,268
A man-vs-aliens summer blockbuster with Will Smith .
A sure thing .
Deserves to be on the list .
29 . Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl ( 2003 ) $ 305,411,000
The best of the Pirates franchise made the least at the box office .
30 . The Sixth Sense ( 1999 ) $ 293,506,292
Possibly one of the most profitable films on this list in terms of cost - to - earnings ratio .
No special effects , just a great script .
M. Night was thought to be the next Spielberg after this but has since fell way short .

The state of your relationship with your spouse will be the primary factor in determining which option best suits your needs .
Divorce in New Jersey includes both traditional methods , as well as newer collaborative options .
Traditional methods of divorce are needed when parties disagree on at least one term of the divorce .
This is more often the case , as it can be difficult for separating spouses to agree on every term , especially when it comes to children and finances .
If , however , the divorce is a mutual decision , and both parties are in complete agreement to all terms , a collaborative divorce may save you time , money , and stress .
Options for the collaborative process include :

Coronavirus : 10 Interesting Facts You Might Not Have Known
Under the heading , " My moon - landing jam session " , David Gilmour talks at length in today 's Guardian ( UK ) newspaper of Pink Floyd 's atmospheric tune " Moonhead " , performed live on July 20th 1969 in a BBC TV studio .
In the article ( also online ) , David notes that " there was a panel of scientists on one side of the studio , with us on the other .
The programming was a little looser in those days , and if a producer of a late - night programme felt like it , they would do something a bit off the wall .
Funnily enough I 've never really heard it since , but it is on YouTube [ see below ] .
They were broadcasting the moon landing and they thought that to provide a bit of a break they would show us jamming .
It was only about five minutes long .
The song was called Moonhead - it 's a nice , atmospheric , spacey , 12 - bar blues .
" I also remember at the time being in my flat in London , gazing up at the moon , and thinking , " There are actually people standing up there right now . "
It brought it home to me powerfully , that you could be looking up at the moon and there would be people standing on it " .
In the article , printed in a special issue of the newspaper 's G2 supplement ( ' Mission To The Moon : 40 Years On ' ) , he also noted that " it was fantastic to be thinking that we were in there making up a piece of music , while the astronauts were standing on the moon .
It does n't seem conceivable that that would happen on the BBC nowadays " .
BAGHDAD 
With little notice and almost no public debate , Iraq ’s Kurdish leaders are pushing ahead with a new constitution for their semiautonomous region , a step that has alarmed Iraqi and American officials who fear that the move poses a new threat to the country ’s unity .
The new constitution , approved by Kurdistan ’s parliament two weeks ago and scheduled for a referendum this year , underscores the level of mistrust and bad faith between the region and the central government in Baghdad .
And it raises the question of whether a peaceful resolution of disputes between the two is possible , despite intensive cajoling by the United States .
The proposed constitution enshrines Kurdish claims to territories and the oil and gas beneath them .
But these claims are disputed by both the federal government in Baghdad and ethnic groups on the ground , and were supposed to be resolved in talks begun quietly last month between the Iraqi and Kurdish governments , sponsored by the United Nations and backed by the United States .
Instead , the Kurdish parliament pushed ahead and passed the constitution , partly as a message that it would resist pressure from the American and Iraqi governments to make concessions .
The disputed areas , in northern Iraq , are already volatile :
There have been several tense confrontations between Kurdish and federal security forces , as well as frequent attacks aimed at inflaming sectarian and ethnic passions there .
Mandatory Swine Flu Vaccination Alert - by Stephen Lendman
On July 13 , a World Health Organization ( WHO ) Global Alert headlined , " WHO recommendations on pandemic ( H1N1 ) 2009 vaccinations " suggest that universally mandated ones are coming .
It stated that on July 7 , the pharmaceutical industry - dominated Strategic Advisory Group of Experts ( SAGE ) on Immunization held an " extraordinary meeting in Geneva to discuss issues and make recommendations related to vaccine for the pandemic ( H1N1 ) 2009 . "
There 's no pandemic nor until recently a single death anywhere attributable to Swine Flu .
Yet WHO said the virus " is considered unstoppable , " while admitting little evidence of spread so far , most cases are mild , and many people recover unaided .
Nonetheless , all countries will need vaccines and should follow these priorities as initial supplies will be limited :
-- immunize health care workers " to protect the essential health care infrastructure ; " then
-- pregnant women ; children over six months of age " with one of several chronic medical conditions ; " healthy young adults aged 15 - 49 ; healthy children ; healthy adults aged 50 - 64 ; and finally healthy adults aged 65 or older .
WTO suggested the risks in stating " new technologies are involved in the production of some pandemic vaccines , which have not yet been extensively evaluated for their safety in certain population groups ... "
As a result , " post - marketing surveillance " and " post - marketing safety and effectiveness studies " are essential so that countries can adjust their vaccination policies .
WHO " recommendations " are binding on all 194 member countries in case a pandemic emergency is declared under the 2005 International Health Regulations Act and April 2009 WHO pandemic plan .
It 's crucial to understand that these vaccines are experimental , untested , toxic and extremely dangerous to the human immune system .
They contain squalene - based adjuvants that cause a host of annoying to life - threatening autoimmune diseases .
They must be avoided , even if mandated .
It 's also known that vaccines do n't protect against diseases they 're designed to prevent and often cause them .
They should be banned but proliferate anyway because they 're so profitable , and if globally mandated to the greatest extent ever .
Get ready because that 's precisely what 's coming - universal orders to risk toxic vaccine hazards .
In the coming weeks , the dominant media globally will get into high gear fear - mongering mode to convince people voluntarily to submit to jeopardizing their health and well - being .
It 's essential to refuse and be safe and international law absolutely allows it .

Scholars say that Utah ’s demographic portrait is changing , especially with the fast growth of the Hispanic population , but that only time will tell where those changes go and how prescient Mr. Huntsman proved to be .
His would - be successor , Lt. Gov. Gary R. Herbert , is regarded as a staunch conservative and is already distancing himself from some of Mr. Huntsman ’s positions , including support for same - sex civil unions .
Supporters say Mr. Herbert , who has said he will run in a special election next year to fill out the rest of Mr. Huntsman ’s second term , through 2012 , will lead the party back to conservative orthodoxy .
Other conservatives have said they may challenge him for the nomination if he does not .
Chirac is said to have been stupefied and disturbed by Bush ’s invocation of Biblical prophesy to justify the war in Iraq and “ wondered how someone could be so superficial and fanatical in their beliefs . "
In the same year he spoke to Chirac , Bush had reportedly said to the Palestinian foreign minister that he was on “ a mission from God ” in launching the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and was receiving commands from the Lord .
There can be little doubt now that President Bush ’s reason for launching the war in Iraq was , for him , fundamentally religious .
He was driven by his belief that the attack on Saddam ’s Iraq was the fulfilment of a Biblical prophesy in which he had been chosen to serve as the instrument of the Lord .
Many thousands of Americans and Iraqis have died in the campaign to defeat Gog and Magog .
That the US President saw himself as the vehicle of God whose duty was to prevent the Apocalypse can only inflame suspicions across the Middle East that the United States is on a crusade against Islam .
The A.P. headline played up the Republican bloodletting on TV yesterday : Split Threatens To Rupture Republican Ranks , although I suspect that the main battles have already been fought and that the war is pretty much just a series of cleaning up actions .
Ostensibly the radical right , lead by dark , divisive characters like Cheney , Rove and Limbaugh , has already won , which means the Republican Party has lost -- big time .
Right - wing extremists whose vision of America is so far from the mainstream that there are few states outside of the old Confederacy and the Mormon West where they will be competitive electorally .
And last year they managed to lose 3 ex-slave - holding states ( Florida , North Carolina and Virginia ) as well as two key Mormon states ( Nevada and Colorado ) .
There is probably no state further from the Democratic vision of the country than the heartland of the Mormon theocracy : Utah .
But even in what is arguably the most socially backward place in America , the winds of change are starting to rustle .
Last year even the incredibly inclusive and optimistic Obama wrote off Utah and , basically , the state was n't contested .
It 's still interesting to compare McCain 's victory last November to Bush 's win in 2004.2004Bush - 663,742 ( 72 % ) Kerry - 241,199 ( 26%)2008 McCain - 596,030 ( 63 % ) Obama - 327,670 ( 34 % ) That hardly looks like a promising trend for the Republicans -- and in the reddest and most authoritarian and reactionary state in the country .
It 's especially grim for the GOP because it was younger voters , especially first - time voters , and the state 's rapidly growing Hispanic population that went for Obama .
And in Salt Lake County , Obama actually beat McCain !
There 's been a lot of talk about how the mainstream conservative son of a Mormon billionaire , Jon Huntsman , Jr. , was bringing change to Utah .
Earlier this year , even as his job approval rating ( 84 % ) wound up higher than any other Republican governor in America , right - wing extremists began flagging him as unreliable and untrustworthy for true believers .
He was kicked off a speaking bill at a Michigan Republican Party function , serving notice that the party was not going to get behind anyone with an outspoken mainstream agenda , not even a conservative one .
He 's since taken a job with the Obama Administration as ambassador to China .
But what happens with a post - Huntsman Utah ?
Democrats think Herbert is too far to the right for " the evolving , diverse , urbanized state that Utah is becoming . "
And they think he 's making a big mistake by distancing himself from Huntsman and even taking potshots at him .
If Blue Dog congressman , Jim Matheson , who is very popular among Republicans , runs against Herbert there 's even a chance he could beat him .
And Herbert is facing the same dilemma Republicans are facing nationally .
His first move will be selecting a Lt. Governor .
If he picks a right wing extremist , the party base will be placated .
If he picks a mainstream conservative who could help him beat Matheson , the fanatics could turn on him .
Among the right - wingers he 's thinking about are Rep. Greg Hughes , Josh Romney ( yep , son of Willard ) , Rep. Becky Lockhart , and two powerhouses who already have better jobs than Lt. Governor , Speaker David Clark and state Senate President Michael Waddoups ( a real kook ) .
If Herbert goes for a more mainstream pick who could help him win in 2010 , state Senator Greg Bell will get the nod .
But if Herbert shows any signs of going in a mainstream direction , ala Huntsman , you can be certain that a wingnut , probably the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce president , Lane Beattie , ( a former state Senate president ) will jump right in and challenge him .
To understand Mormon politics , try to grasp the ideas in this short film that has been banned by the cult : [ UPDATE - The Mormons got YouTube to take the video down .

Now , it is n't only the Mormons who are dangerously delusional and whose primitive superstitions are hazardous for normal folks .
Former French President Jacques Chirac has confirmed a story that has been circulating for years that Bush tried persuading him to join in his crusade against Iraq by invoking Old Testament gobbledygook about Gog and Magog and the Apocalypse .
Chirac thought he was deranged and had to get a scholarly translator to explain what the hell Bush was babbling about .

usually mere sugar pills designed to represent " no treatment " in a clinical treatment study .
The effectiveness of the actual medication is compared with the placebo to determine if the medication works .
And yet , for some people , the placebo works nearly as well as the medication .
How well placebos work varies widely among individuals .
Why that is so , and why they work at all , remains a mystery , thought to be based on some combination of biological and psychological factors .
Now , researchers at UCLA have found a new explanation : genetics .
Dr. Andrew Leuchter , a professor of psychiatry at the UCLA Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior , and colleagues report that in people suffering from major depressive disorder , or MDD , genes that influence the brain 's reward pathways may modulate the response to placebos .
The research appears in the August edition of the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology ( currently available online by subscription ) .
Placebos are thought to act by stimulating the brain 's central reward pathways by releasing a class of neurotransmitters called monoamines , specifically dopamine and norepinephrine .
These are the brain chemicals that make us " feel good . "
Because the chemical signaling done by monoamines is under strong genetic control , the scientists reasoned that common genetic variations between individuals — called genetic polymorphisms — could influence the placebo response .
Researchers took blood samples from 84 people diagnosed with MDD ; 32 were given medication and 52 a placebo .
The researchers looked at the polymorphisms in genes that coded for two enzymes that regulate monoamine levels : catechol - O- methyltransferase ( COMT ) and monoamine oxidase A ( MAO - A ) .
Subjects with the highest enzyme activity within the MAO - A polymorphism had a significantly lower placebo response than those with other genotypes .
With respect to COMT , those with lower enzyme activity within this polymorphism had a lower placebo response .
" Our findings suggest that patients with MDD who have specific MAO - A and COMT genotypes may be biologically advantaged or disadvantaged in mounting a placebo response , because of the activity of these two enzymes , " said Leuchter , who directs the Laboratory of Brain , Behavior and Pharmacology at the UCLA Semel Institute .
" To our knowledge , this is the first study to examine the association between MAO - A and COMT polymorphisms and a response to placebo in people who suffer from major depressive disorder , " he said .
Leuchter noted that this is not the sole explanation for a response to a placebo , which is likely to be caused by many factors , both biological and psychosocial .
" But the data suggests that individual differences in response to placebo are significantly influenced by individual genotypes , " he said .
Including the influence of genotype in the design of clinical trials could facilitate more powerful testing of future treatments , Leuchter said .

Maziar Bahari is originally from Tehran , but moved to Canada in 1988 .
He completed a degree at Concordia University in Montreal and keeps a home in Toronto . ( ( CBC ) )
An Iranian - Canadian reporter arrested in Tehran last week admitted his election coverage was biased in favour of the opposition , an Iranian government - linked news agency reported Tuesday .
Fars News Agency , a semi-official government - aligned organization , said Maziar Bahari appeared at a news conference Tuesday to discuss his situation with other reporters .
The 41 - year - old was taken from his mother 's Tehran apartment on Sunday by a group of men believed to be Iranian security officials .
A laptop computer and several videos were also taken .
According to the article , Bahari , who was in Iran to report for Newsweek , admitted his coverage of the June 12 presidential election was biased in favour of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's rival , Mir Hossein Mousavi .
There is no way to independently confirm the report because of tight Iranian government restrictions on foreign media in the country imposed following violent anti-government demonstrations .
The report also says Bahari admits that as a journalist , he is part of capitalist machinery that gets caught up in revolutionary activities aimed at throwing the legitimacy of the election in doubt .
Several other media outlets , including CNN , Newsweek and the New York Times , are feeding information in support of the revolution , he says , according to the article .
The report did not say whether Bahari remains in custody , where the reported news conference took place , or who attended .
The Canadian government has reportedly demanded to have access to Bahari .
Protesters , militia killed
At least 24 journalists and bloggers are also known to have been arrested in Iran since Iranians began protesting the official results of the presidential election more than a week ago .
Iranian authorities say 17 protesters and eight members of the volunteer Basij militia have been killed in two weeks of unrest , and hundreds of people have been arrested .
Iran 's top legislative body on Monday said a partial recount had confirmed Ahmadinejad 's disputed victory .
The 12 - member clerical council has already rejected opposition calls for it to annul the vote over charges of voting irregularities .
The Interior Ministry 's initial tally of the vote handed Ahmadinejad victory by a 2 - 1 margin over Mousavi .
The Grand Theft Auto Bankruptcy of General Motors
Greg Palast writes : Screw the autoworkers .
They may be crying about General Motors ' bankruptcy today .
But dumping 40,000 of the last 60,000 union jobs into a mass grave wo n't spoil Jamie Dimon 's day .
Dimon is the CEO of JP Morgan Chase bank .
While GM workers are losing their retirement health benefits , their jobs , their life savings ; while shareholders are getting zilch and many creditors getting hosed , a few privileged GM lenders - led by Morgan and Citibank - expect to get back 100 % of their loans to GM , a stunning $ 6 billion .
The way these banks are getting their $ 6 billion bonanza is stone cold illegal .
I smell a rat .
Stevie the Rat , to be precise .
Steven Rattner , Barack Obama 's ' Car Czar ' - the man who essentially ordered GM into bankruptcy this morning .
When a company goes bankrupt , everyone takes a hit : fair or not , workers lose some contract wages , stockholders get wiped out and creditors get fragments of what 's left .
That 's the law .
What workers do n't lose are their pensions ( including old - age health funds ) already taken from their wages and held in their name .
But not this time .
Stevie the Rat has a different plan for GM : grab the pension funds to pay off Morgan and Citi .
Here 's the scheme : Rattner is demanding the bankruptcy court simply wipe away the money GM owes workers for their retirement health insurance .
Cash in the insurance fund would be replace by GM stock .
The percentage may be 17 % of GM 's stock - or 25 % .
Whatever , 17 % or 25 % is worth , well ... just try paying for your dialysis with 50 shares of bankrupt auto stock .
Yet Citibank and Morgan , says Rattner , should get their whole enchilada - $ 6 billion right now and in cash - from a company that can't pay for auto parts or worker eye exams .
Preventive Detention for Pensions
So what 's wrong with seizing workers ' pension fund money in a bankruptcy ?
The answer , Mr. Obama , Mr. Law Professor , is that it 's illegal .
In 1974 , after a series of scandalous take - downs of pension and retirement funds during the Nixon era , Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. ERISA says you can't seize workers ' pension funds ( whether monthly payments or health insurance ) any more than you can seize their private bank accounts .
And that 's because they are the same thing : workers give up wages in return for retirement benefits .
The law is darn explicit that grabbing pension money is a no - no .
Company executives must hold these retirement funds as " fiduciaries . "
Here 's the law , Professor Obama , as described on the government 's own web site under the heading , " Health Plans and Benefits . "
" The primary responsibility of fiduciaries is to run the plan solely in the interest of participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits . "
Every business in America that runs short of cash would love to dip into retirement kitties , but it 's not their money any more than a banker can seize your account when the bank 's a little short .
A plan 's assets are for the plan 's members only , not for Mr. Dimon nor Mr. Rubin .
Yet , in effect , the Obama Administration is demanding that money for an elderly auto worker 's spleen should be siphoned off to feed the TARP babies .
Workers go without lung transplants so Dimon and Rubin can pimp out their ride .
This is another " Guantanamo " moment for the Obama Administration - channeling Nixon to endorse the preventive detention of retiree health insurance .
Filching GM 's pension assets does n't become legal because the cash due the fund is replaced with GM stock .
Congress saw through that switch - a - roo by requiring that companies , as fiduciaries , must
" ... act prudently and must diversify the plan 's investments in order to minimize the risk of large losses . "
By " diversify " for safety , the law does not mean put 100 % of worker funds into a single busted company 's stock .
This is dangerous business :
The Rattner plan opens the floodgate to every politically - connected or down - on - their - luck company seeking to drain health care retirement funds .
House of Rubin
Pensions are wiped away and two connected banks do n't even get a haircut ?
How come Citi and Morgan are n't asked , like workers and other creditors , to take stock in GM ?
As Butch said to Sundance , who ARE these guys ?
You remember Morgan and Citi .
These are the corporate Welfare Queens who 've already sucked up over a third of a trillion dollars in aid from the US Treasury and Federal Reserve .
Not coincidentally , Citi , the big winner , has paid over $ 100 million to Robert Rubin , the former US Treasury Secretary .
Rubin was Obama 's point - man in winning banks ' endorsement and campaign donations ( by far , his largest source of his corporate funding ) .
With GM 's last dying dimes about to fall into one pocket , and the Obama Treasury in his other pocket , Morgan 's Jamie Dimon is correct in saying that the last twelve months will prove to be the bank 's " finest year ever . "
Which leaves us to ask the question : is the forced bankruptcy of GM , the elimination of tens of thousands of jobs , just a collection action for favored financiers ?
And it 's been a good year for Señor Rattner .
While the Obama Administration made a big deal out of Rattner 's youth spent working for the Steelworkers Union , they tried to sweep under the chassis that Rattner was one of the privileged , select group of investors in Cerberus Capital , the owners of Chrysler .
" Owning " is a loose term .
Cerberus " owned " Chrysler the way a cannibal " hosts " you for dinner .
Cerberus paid nothing for Chrysler - indeed , they were paid billions by Germany 's Daimler Corporation to haul it away .
Cerberus kept the cash , then dumped Chrysler 's bankrupt corpse on the US taxpayer .
( " Cerberus , " by the way , named itself after the Roman 's mythical three - headed dog guarding the gates Hell .
Subtle these guys are not . )
While Stevie the Rat sold his interest in the Dog from Hell when he became Car Czar , he never relinquished his post at the shop of vultures called Quadrangle Hedge Fund .
Rattner 's personal net worth stands at roughly half a billion dollars .
This is Obama 's working class hero .
If you ran a business and played fast and loose with your workers ' funds , you could land in prison .
Stevie the Rat 's plan is nothing less than Grand Theft Auto Pension .
It does n't make it any less of a crime if the President drives the getaway car .

The State is out with a new e-mail dump , showing Mark Sanford went MIA during his state - funded trip to Argentina in June 2008 .
Politically , however , the most interesting thing about the e-mails may be that they show that within Sanford 's own office , there was considerable debate about how he should handle stimulus funds .
Sanford 's former chief of staff warned him against rejecting the stimulus funds , telling him that even his own supporters were growing impatient with Sanford 's antics .
The e-mails also include strategizing among Sanford , staff members and allies about how to approach the stimulus and budget debates .
" We are getting killed message - wise and even folks who support you are worried you have lost your mind , " wrote former chief of staff Chad Walldorf on April 3 .
" Let ’s discuss ... you are the man on thinking ... " Sanford responded .
At another point , former communications director Chris Drummond advised against vetoing the entire state budget , as Sanford did in 2006 .
" You tried that and it got you nowhere , " Drummond wrote on May 14 after Sanford asked if he should veto all or part of the budget .
" Veto the offensive stuff and those items that are consistent with your executive budget . "
The e-mails also reveal Sanford asked state employees for advice on lowering his taxes .

A man wanted in connection with British Columbia 's worst gang murders in history -- the " Surrey Six " slayings -- has been arrested in the Philippines .
Homicide investigators believe Quang " Michael " Vinh Thang Le , 24 , is one of the leaders and original founders of the Red Scorpions gang in B.C. 's Lower Mainland .
On May 25 , Crown Counsel approved one charge of first - degree murder and one charge of conspiracy to commit murder in the slaying of Corey Lal during October 2007 's execution - style slayings , where six men , including innocent bystanders Ed Schellenberg and Chris Mohan , were gunned down in a high - rise apartment .
Cpl . Dale Carr , spokesperson for the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team , says Le , who was born in Vietnam but became a Canadian citizen , fled to his native country to flee prosecution .
IHIT received word Le was travelling to Manila , the capital city of the Philippines .
Investigators in British Columbia worked with Interpol to secure a " Red Notice " for Le , which gave the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation the power to arrest him once he arrived in the country .
Le was taken into custody Wednesday as he arrived at the Manila airport .
Carr says Canadian authorities are now working to have Le extradited , where he will face his criminal charges .
" This investigation is still very active and other arrests are expected , " Carr said in a statement .
" Just because charges have been laid and people have been arrested we do n't stop .
We will take advantage of all opportunities to bring someone to justice . "
Surrey Six
The 18 - month investigation into the Surrey Six slayings , dubbed " Project E - PESETA , " has involved more than 100 investigators at the municipal , provincial and federal levels .
Dennis Karbovanec pleaded guilty April 3 to three - counts of second - degree murder for the deaths of Chris Mohan , 22 , Ryan Bartholomeo , 19 and 26 - year - old Michael Lal .
A B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled the 27 - year - old must spend at least the next 15 years in prison before he can apply for parole .
A publication ban prevents news outlets from publishing key details in the case .
Karbovanec also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy for the murder of Lal , a charge shared with 23 - year - old James Bacon of Abbotsford .
Bacon was charged for the first - degree murder of Lal on April 4 .
Police have linked the killings to a bloody gang war that has seen more than 100 shootings in recent years and almost four dozen since mid-January , more than 20 of them fatal .
A Quick Note To Every Goddamn Person I Came In Contact With Yesterday
Mike , my husband :
You know , there ’s nothing cute or amusing about a man in his mid-40s standing in the kitchen , bending at the knees and pointing his fingers in the air like a gay retard , while forcing intestinal gas into the room .
Not one thing .
Especially while I ’m trying to eat my Cream of Wheat .
Also , sniffing the air after yet another of your revolting eruptions , and saying , “ Did somebody just open a can of peaches ? ” is starting to get a little old .
Five times a day for seventeen years is excessive , I believe .
And those toenails ?
I ’ve never seen anything more disgusting .
I ’m fairly certain you ’re supposed to trim them before they start growing toward the light .
The woman at Hardee ’s : “ Hep you ? ” is not a proper greeting .
In fact , “ Hep ” is n’t even a word .
And what ’s with all the attitude ?
I ’m just getting a coffee , for godsake .
I ca n’t be held responsible for your poor decision - making skills , or the delay in your “ settlement . ”
Gene , the parking garage attendant at my job :
You seem like a nice man , but I have no idea what you ’re talking about most of the time .
For instance , who the fuck is Bonnie , and why do you think I ’m at all concerned about her hand surgery ?
The security guard in the lobby at my job :
My tits thank you for your daily Good Morning !
greeting .
They appreciate it — especially the left one .
The left one is a little insecure , and really eats - up that kind of stuff .
Jan , the department secretary at my job :
Nobody is buying the “ I ’m so incredibly busy ” act .
We all know your cubicle is a pig sty simply because you ’re a lazy slob .
I mean , look at your car !
There ’s only enough room in that piece of shit for your ass .
Admittedly that ’s a lot of space , but still …
Since we ’re on the subject , I ’ve been meaning to ask : why is there a rotisserie chicken and a can of Right Guard on the dashboard ?
And your voice .
Dear God , your voice !
It carves a hole straight through my central nervous system .
Have you ever considered shutting the hell up for a few minutes , just as an experiment ?
Jerry , with whom I share an office :
Is it really necessary to talk to your wife every thirty minutes throughout the day ?
Have you ever noticed how she never calls you ?
I have .
And that thing you do where you twist your whole torso around , and crack your back ?
I hate that ; it makes me almost physically ill .
One of these days you ’re going to blow something out , and end up in a wheelchair typing emails with your forehead - mounted typing - wand .
Plus , those “ health shakes ” you drink all day smell like unwashed balls .
Brenda , who believes we ’re office buddies : I know this might come as a shock , but the entire universe does n’t revolve around your bony , tan - in - a - can ass .
You think everybody ’s out to get you , but in reality , nobody gives you a second thought .
Because you ’re forgettable .
Also , it ’s “ picture , ” not “ pitcher . ”
Wow !
Phil , my boss :
You ’re a good guy , and very smart , and everything .
I just wish I ’d never seen that “ No Spin Zone ” sticker on your Taurus .
I was this close to respecting you .
It ’s too bad , really .
Because everything you say and do now , regardless of its brilliance , is tinged in douche ; at this point you carry a very distinct douchey patina .
Mike , my husband , again :
If you do n’t like the way I cook the pork chops , here ’s an idea : do it yourself .
Why not get up off your ever - expanding hams every once in a while , and contribute something ?
Besides , of course , your “ comedy . ”
I ’d never kill you in your sleep , understand , but that does n’t mean the thought has n’t crossed my mind .
David Letterman :
What ’s happened to you ?
You used to be the funniest man alive , and now you ’re about as amusing as… oh , I do n’t know … pancreatic cancer ?
A little unsolicited feedback : exaggerated coughing and throat - clearing is not entertainment .
So knock it off , please .
And your political analysis ?
Embarrassing .
You do n’t have any idea what you ’re talking about ; you ’re like some ranting old man at a diner now .
The only thing missing is a slice of blueberry pie , and a Sea World hat .
And I think that brings us up to date .
Thanks for your time , folks !
Your pal , Leslie

Gov. Brad Henry announced Thursday evening that he will sign an executive order on Tuesday naming the Flaming Lips song as the official rock song .
Henry had planned to sign the resolution into law at a Tuesday ceremony that members of the band as well as national music and entertainment writers planned to attend .
Henry said that for more than 20 years the Flaming Lips have produced " creative , fun and provocative rock music . "
" The music of the Flaming Lips has earned Grammys , glowing critical acclaim and fans all over the world , " the governor said .
" A truly iconic rock n' roll band , they are proud ambassadors of their home state .
" They were clearly the people 's choice , and I intend to honor that vote . "
The Oklahoma House rejected a resolution today to name a song by The Flaming Lips as the state 's official rock song because one of the band members wore a T - shirt bearing a symbol associated with the Communist Party while at the state Capitol last month .
A resolution making The Flaming Lips ' " Do You Realize ? ? " the state 's rock song failed to get the necessary votes for passage .
Senate Joint Resolution 24 was the last item brought up today , and because it was the last day for the House to vote on measures coming out of the Senate that particular piece of legislation is dead this year .
Rep. Corey Holland , R - Marlow , debated against the resolution , saying he was bothered one of the band members wore a red T - shirt with a yellow sickle and hammer on it when The Flaming Lips came last month to the Capitol when results of an online voting contest showed their song to be the clear - cut winner .
" I was really offended by that , " Holland said .
Rep . Mike Reynolds , R- Oklahoma
City , also spoke against the measure , saying the band has a reputation for using obscene language , recalling band members used offensive language several years ago when the city of Oklahoma City named an alley after the band .
" Their lips ought to be on fire , " Reynolds said .
Rep. Joe Dorman , D - Rush Springs ,
House sponsor of the resolution , said The Flaming Lips were scheduled to be at the state Capitol next week for a ceremony when the governor was to sign the resolution .
National media members also were invited to attend , Dorman said .
The Flaming Lips also were to appear next week at a music exhibit at the Oklahoma History Center , Dorman said .
The resolution won a majority of votes , 48 - 39 , but it failed to get the minimum 51 .
Many of the 101 members after working late Wednesday night left early this afternoon .
The state Senate last month approved the resolution 46-0 .
The song , a single from the 2002 compact disc " Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots , " beat out nine other finalists chosen by an advisory panel working with the Oklahoma History Center .
More than 21,000 people voted on the Oklahoma State Rock Song .
The Flaming Lips song got more than 10,000 votes , Dorman said .
Wheelchair with real - time control using brain waves
Japan ’s BSI - TOYOTA Collaboration Center has successfully developed a system that controls a wheelchair using brain waves in as little as 125 milliseconds .
BTCC was established in 2007 by RIKEN , an independent Japanese research institution , as a collaborative project with Toyota Motor Corporation , Toyota Central R&D Labs , Inc. , and Genesis Research Institute , Inc .
Also collaborating in the research were Andrzej Cichocki , Unit Leader , and Kyuwan Choi , Research Scientist , of BTCC ’s Noninvasive BMI Unit .
Recently technological developments in the area of brain machine interface ( BMI ) have received much attention .
Such systems allow elderly or handicapped people to interact with the world through signals from their brains , without having to give voice commands .
BTCC ’s new system fuses RIKEN ’s blind signal separation1 and space - time - frequency filtering2 technology to allow brain - wave analysis in as little as 125 ms , as compared to several seconds required by conventional methods .
Brain - wave analysis results are displayed on a panel so quickly that drivers do not sense any delay .
The system has the capacity to adjust itself to the characteristics of each individual driver , and thereby is able to improve the efficiency with which it senses the driver ’s commands .
Thus the driver is able to get the system to learn his / her commands ( forward / right / left ) quickly and efficiently .
The new system has succeeded in having drivers correctly give commands to their wheelchairs .
An accuracy rate of 95 % was achieved , one of the highest in the world .
Plans are underway to utilize this technology in a wide range of applications centered on medicine and nursing care management .
R&D under consideration includes increasing the number of commands given and developing more efficient dry electrodes .
So far the research has centered on brain waves related to imaginary hand and foot control .
However , through further measurement and analysis it is anticipated that this system may be applied to other types of brain waves generated by various mental states and emotions .
Notes :
(1) Blind signal separation ( BSS ) is a technology that separates the noise components and useful signal components from brain signals that can be used to control the wheelchair .
It utilizes only on - line - recorded EEG signals .
(2) Space - time - frequency filtering is a technology which extracts space and time patterns and frequency oscillation data from EEG electrodes to discriminate significant features and components which are able to reliably control the wheelchair .

Updated on July 2 , 2009 , at 9:02 a.m. PT with more from Skype regarding push notification for the iPhone / iPod Touch app .
Skype is certainly on a roll this week .
Just yesterday it converted the latest beta of its Windows Mobile phone software into a full - fledged release .
On Tuesday , the VoIP company did it again for Skype 4.1 for Windows .
In addition , Apple green - lighted Skype 1.1 for the iPhone and iPod Touch , which you can download now .
Skype 4.1 for Windows
Skype 4.1 beta brought back features like accessibility , birthday reminders , and the capability to send a contact record to another contact .
These had been left out when Skype first updated its interface to the 4.0 style , the company citing a wish to get core features out the door before piling on the extras .
It 's these extras that users nevertheless clamored for .
This minor point update also contains a major new feature that was first introduced in Skype 4.1 beta : screen sharing .
( Credit : CNET / Screenshot by Jessica Dolcourt )
Screen sharing initiates a video call , using the technology to broadcast a recording of your screen -- either a portion or the full screen -- to one other viewer .
Screen sharing has some limitations : you can't simultaneously see a video of your buddy and their desktop , and since only one viewer at a time can peep at your screen , you can't use it as a free replacement for collaborative Web conferencing .
It does n't help that the picture quality is still choppy and fuzzy , in both partial - screen and full - screen view modes .
Make no mistake , though : it 's a great feature that we 're happy to see added , but we 'll be even happier to watch it improve .
In addition to screen sharing , Skype 4.1 lets you feed a contact search from outside address books , including those in Gmail , AOL , MSN , Yahoo , Microsoft Outlook , and a host of other players .
If you have it installed , the Web toolbar will highlight phone numbers within contact lists so you can call them through Skype .
Skype for iPhone
Skype 1.1 for iPhone and iPod Touch reintroduces the capability to listen to Skype voice mail and to send and receive SMS messages .
These features had been available on the desktop version , but were not activated when Skype first came out for iPhone .
There are a few visual tweaks , also , which gloss up the look and feel of a few screens , most notably the dial pad .
To top off the changes , this iPhone update pours on multilingual support , making it available in Danish , Dutch , Finnish , French , German , Italian , Japanese , Korean , Norwegian , Polish , Portuguese ( Brazil ) , Portuguese ( Portugal ) , Russian , Simplified Chinese , Spanish , Swedish , and Traditional Chinese .
Skype for iPhone still has far to go if it's to get all of the extra features that round out the Skype experience - - games and conference calling are but two .
Push notification is another that Skype users are now asking for .
Skype told CNET that they wanted to first integrate SMS and voice mail , the two most - requested features .
As for push notification , Skype is n't making any commitments at this point , but a representative from the company vaguely stated , " Where we 're able to use functionality provided by the iPhone OS to support a rich Skype experience on the iPhone platform , we will endeavor to do so . "
Still , it 's a fair guess that a future version could notify you when someone is calling .
In the future , we 're looking forward to what Skype might do with video calls now that the iPhone 3GS has its shiny new video recorder .
To understand why such preventive measures might be useful , it helps to take a step back and notice a general trend toward building ever larger and more complex networks .
In recent years , hundreds of millions of people have rushed to join online social networks , while billions more rely on e-mail and cellphones to stay connected to friends and coworkers all day , every day .
Technologists wax lyrical about " Metcalfe 's Law , " which posits that a network 's " value " increases in proportion to the square of the number of people or devices in it .
And system designers revel in the ability of networks to improve a system 's overall efficiency by dynamically distributing computer - processing load , power generation , or financial risk , as the case may be .
Rather than waiting until the next cascade is imminent , and then following the usual modus operandi of propping up the handful of firms that seem to pose the greatest threat , it may be time for a new approach : preventing the system from becoming overly complex in the first place .
It may be true , in fact , that complex networks such as financial systems face an inescapable trade - off - between size and efficiency on one hand , and global stability on the other .
Once they have been assembled , in other words , globally interconnected and integrated financial networks just may be too complex to prevent crises like the current one from reoccurring .
Answering these questions properly requires us to grapple with what is called " systemic risk . "
Much like the power grid , the financial system is a series of complex , interlocking contingencies .
And in such a system , the biggest risk of all - that the system as a whole might fail - is not related in any simple way to the risk profiles of its individual parts .
Like a downed tree , the failure of one part of the system can trigger an unpredictable cascade that can propagate throughout the entire system .
Although these explanations can help account for how individual banks , insurers , and so on got themselves into trouble , they gloss over a larger question : how these institutions collectively managed to put trillions of dollars at risk without being detected .
Ultimately , therefore , they fail to address the all - important issue of what can be done to avoid a repeat disaster .
Over the past year we have experienced something similar in the financial system : a dramatic and unpredictable cascade of events that has produced the economic equivalent of a global blackout .
As governments struggle to fix the crisis , experts have weighed in on the causes of the meltdown , from excess leverage , to lax oversight , to the way executives are paid .
ON AUG .
10 , 1996 , a single power line in western Oregon brushed a tree and shorted out , triggering a massive cascade of power outages that spread across the western United States .
Frantic engineers watched helplessly as the crisis unfolded , leaving nearly 10 million people without electricity .
Even after power was restored , they were unable to explain adequately why it had happened , or how they could prevent a similar cascade from happening again - which it did , in the Northeast on Aug. 14 , 2003 .
In all the excitement , however , we tend to overlook a fact that should be obvious - that once everything is connected , problems can spread as easily as solutions , sometimes more so .
Thanks to globally connected transportation systems , epidemics of disease like SARS , avian influenza , and swine flu can spread farther and faster than ever before .
Thanks to the Internet , e-mail viruses , nasty rumors , and embarrassing truths can spread to colleagues , loved ones , or even around the world before remedial action can be taken to stop them .
And thanks to globally connected financial markets , a drop in real - estate prices in California can hurt the retirement benefits of civil servants in the UK .
Traditionally , banks and other financial institutions have succeeded by managing risk , not avoiding it .
But as the world has become increasingly connected , their task has become exponentially more difficult .
To see why , it 's helpful to think about power grids again : engineers can reliably assess the risk that any single power line or generator will fail under some given set of conditions ; but once a cascade starts , it 's difficult to know what those conditions will be - because they can change suddenly and dramatically depending on what else happens in the system .
Correspondingly , in financial systems , risk managers are able to assess their own institutions ' exposure , but only on the assumption that the rest of the world obeys certain conditions .
In a crisis it is precisely these conditions that change in unpredictable ways .
No one , for example , anticipated that an investment bank as old and prestigious as Lehman Brothers could collapse as suddenly as it did , so nobody had that contingency built into their risk models .
And once it did fail , then just as the failure of a single power line increases the stress on other parts of the system , leading to further " knock on " failures , so too did Lehman 's unlikely collapse render other previously unlikely failures suddenly much more likely .
Risk managers have started to pay more attention to systemic risk of late , but unfortunately they have n't made nearly enough progress .
A 2006 report co-sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the National Academy of Sciences concluded that even defining systemic risk was beyond the scope of any existing economic theory .
Actually managing such a thing would be harder still , if only because the number of contingencies that a systemic risk model must anticipate grows exponentially with the connectivity of the system .
So if the complexity of our financial systems exceeds that of even the most sophisticated risk models , how can government regulators hope to manage the problem ?
BEIJING -- China 's policies to support its auto market drove sales up 34 % in May , according to data issued Tuesday by a semi-official industry group , as the country remained a bright spot for the struggling global car industry .
Auto sales last month totaled 1.12 million units , the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said .
In contrast , U.S. car sales fell 34 % in May to 925,824 units .

German exports declined at a faster rate than imports
The economies of the 16 countries that make up the eurozone declined by 2.5 % in the first three months of 2009 , the EU 's statistics agency Eurostat said .
Analysts had forecast a drop of only 2 % .
A sharp fall in German exports was a key factor in the decline .
The German economy suffered its largest contraction since reunification , falling 3.8 % in the first quarter .
Eurostat also said that consumer price inflation in the eurozone remained steady at 0.6 % in April .
GDP in the eurozone fell 4.6 % on a year - on - year basis .
GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced in a country .
GDP also fell 2.5 % in the wider EU .
About 60 % of the UK 's exports go to the 27 countries in the EU .
' Uncertainty shock '
The record decline in German GDP was led by falls in exports and investments , the Statistics Office said .
Year - on - year the German economy shrank by 6.7 % .
The German government has predicted the economy will shrink 6 % in 2009 .
That is a more downbeat forecast than the European Commission's .
The Commission expects Germany , Europe 's biggest economy , to contract 5.4 % this year .
It predicts a contraction of 4 % across the eurozone .
The severity of the contraction surprised economists .
" The figures came in a bit worse than even we had expected and are significantly worse than the consensus , " said Joerg Kraemer from Commerzbank .
" In the first quarter , the German economy fell victim to the ' uncertainty shock ' , which has gripped the world economy since the collapse of Lehman Brothers . "
The fourth quarter of 2008 had previously been the worst on record , with GDP falling by a revised 2.2 % .
Record deficit On Thursday , Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck admitted the German government would announce record budget deficits for 2009 and 2010 .
GERMAN ECONOMY
Europe 's largest economy Exports of about 66bn euros ( £ 59 bn ) Unemployment rate of 8.6 % ( March ) Mr Steinbrueck said the deficit - the difference between a government 's spending and tax take - would exceed 50bn euros ( £ 45 bn ) this year and rise to 90bn euros next year .
The current record is 40bn euros set in 1996 .
Germany unveiled a 50bn euro economic stimulus package in January and has spent heavily on bank bail - outs .
Mr Steinbrueck 's forecasts mean that Germany is likely to miss the EU 's target for eurozone countries to restrict their deficits to within 3 % of their GDP .
Shrinking economies Also on Friday , provisional data showed the French economy contracted 1.2 % in the first quarter , in line with forecasts .
EUROZONE v EU
The 16 eurozone countries are : Austria , Belgium , Cyprus , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Malta , the Netherlands , Portugal , Slovakia , Slovenia and Spain The European Union is made up of those countries in the eurozone plus : Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Poland , Romania , Sweden and the UK
European economy ' will shrink 4 % '
The fall in French GDP , reported by the statistics office Insee , was smaller than the 1.5 % drop seen in the previous quarter .
In a statement , the Economy Ministry said it expected the French economy to contract by 3 % in 2009 .
Meanwhile Italy 's GDP declined 2.4 % in the first quarter - the largest fall since records began in 1980 , statistics agency ISTAT said .
On Thursday , the National Statistics Institute in Spain said the Spanish economy suffered its largest contraction in 50 years .
GDP fell 1.8 % in the first quarter .

Richard Madeley : ' I could n't give a stuff that my daughter Chloe was pictured smoking cannabis '
Richard Madeley has defended daughter Chloe 's ' experiments with cannabis '
He has always insisted he is anti-drugs .
But Richard Madeley has now launched a passionate defence of his 21 - year - old daughter Chloe , claiming he ' could n't give a stuff ' after pictures of her smoking cannabis at a party emerged earlier this year .
The 53 - year - old presenter has dismissed the incident , which showed her sitting between a man 's legs and inhaling from a bong , a pipe used to smoke the drug .
At the time , the pictures caused huge embarrassment to Madeley and his wife Judy Finnegan , 60 , after they proudly boasted that Chloe and her 22 - year - old brother Jack were ' incredibly anti-drugs ' .
However , he has now claimed it was a ' non issue ' because cannabis is ' not a heavy drug ' .
In an interview with Star magazine , Madeley said : ' I felt sorry for her because a huge fuss was made of it - it was just a bong for f**k 's sake . '
Asked if he was concerned when the pictures emerged he added : ' It was n't something heavy , it was weed .
If Chloe was a regular user , Judy and I would be concerned about it and rightly so .
' But she 's not in any way a drug user , she does n't come in smelling of weed , she does n't have a problem . '
Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan issued a joint apology after the pictures of Chloe were released
Madeley was then asked if he had warned Chloe not to take drugs again .
He replied : ' I 'm not going to nail her head to the wall and say : " Sign here saying you will never ever in your life , on pain of death , have a toke on something ' , because that 's stupid .
It 's a non-issue .
Honestly ?
I really could n't give a stuff . "
Pictures of Chloe smoking cannabis emerged in February
Madeley 's comments brought an angry reaction from anti-drug group , the National Drugs Prevention Alliance .
Executive councillor David Raynes said : " Richard Madeley is playing down the effects of drugs .
' Minimising the dangers of drugs leads to a change in culture and it's irresponsible .
He should n't shout his mouth off .
The fact is that cannabis does a lot of harm , especially to teenagers . '
Only in October , Madeley and his wife said they were both against drugs , despite having experimented with cannabis in the past .
When the pictures were published in February , Madeley and his wife issued a joint statement apologising over their daughter 's conduct .
They said at the time : ' We 've obviously spoken to Chloe and whilst we - like most parents - are aware that kids her age sometimes experiment , it is always a bad idea .
' However , she is an extremely sensible person , and now she knows that too . '
Madeley also defended his daughter 's decision to strip down for a photoshoot in men's magazine FHM last summer when she posed in stockings with her satin dress provocatively hitched up .
' I thought she looked great in the FHM photos , ' he said .
' She looked smashing , she 's a pretty girl and she 's got a lovely figure , I felt very proud of her .
' It did n't give me a moment 's sleepless night .
All our kids have done well and never given us any cause for concern . '
His comments come just ten days after it was revealed that Richard and Judy 's talk show is being axed by bosses at digital channel Watch .
At its lowest point , just 5,000 viewers tuned in to watch the show and the last episode will now be screened on July 3 .
Madeley added : ' It 's not like a patient 's died in the operating theatre .
I know people expect us to be upset , but we 're not .
No one 's died . '

Profits at Gordon Ramsay 's UK restaurants plunged nearly 90 % in a " turbulent " year in which the celebrity chef was forced to pump his own money into the business .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ramsay 's latest company accounts show that the restaurant empire came close to the brink as revenues collapsed while debt and tax bills mounted up .
The precarious situation caused the TV chef and his father - in - law and business partner Chris Hutcheson to inject the business with £ 5 million .
Ramsay 's business problems were blamed on ambitious expansion as well as the closure of key London restaurants like the Savoy as pre-tax profits tumbled from £ 3.05 million in 2007 to £ 383,325 .
The Savoy Grill was shut because of refurbishment at its host hotel , while the Connaught lease expired .
The two restaurants alone accounted for a £ 9.5 million reduction in revenues .
A statement from the firm today said that , after a restructuring of operations , it was confident the group had " successfully undergone change for the better " and was now " well - placed to grow its operation with a more stable capital base and a more manageable overall structure " .
Ramsay 's restaurant empire expanded " significantly " in 2007 and 2008 , leaving the business vulnerable to the economic headwinds .
In the year to August 2008 , turnover dropped to £ 35 million from £ 41.6 million the previous year .
Meanwhile , net debt soared from £ 4.06 million to £ 9.48 million .
A full review of operations was instigated in December as part of a refinancing deal with the Royal Bank of Scotland and to help the business get through the troubled economic times .
The cash injection from Ramsay and Mr Hutcheson came after the firm accrued a bill from VAT , corporation tax and PAYE of around £ 8 million .
This has now mostly been repaid and will be completely settled by the end of this month .
Ramsay has told how he had to sell his Ferrari to help put the restaurant empire back on track , blaming its problems on his own ambitions .
Mr Hutcheson said : " 2008 brought its own challenges , not just for our group , but for the industry as a whole and the broader economy .
" Whilst the restructuring has benefited the group , the significant contribution and commitment of all 750 staff to the business has been integral to moving us to a position of strength . "
The firm said 25 staff were axed as part of the restructuring efforts .
Of Ramsay 's 11 London restaurants , Boxwood , Royal Hospital Road and Claridges emerged as the star performers .
Connaught was closed after its lease expired , but two further restaurants were opened : Murano in September 2008 and York and Albany in October .
The Narrow has had extra seating installed , Petrus is due to move to Knightsbridge later this year after closing last September , Maze has been fully refurbished and Savoy Grill is set to reopen with the hotel in early 2010 .
But La Noisette ceased trading in January this year and was described as a " consistently underperforming site " .
News of troubles in the Ramsay restaurant empire comes amid a torrid time for the TV chef .
Knives were out for the 42 - year - old Hell 's Kitchen star after he reportedly called Australian television star Tracy Grimshaw a lesbian and compared her to a pig in front of a 3,000 - strong audience at a live cooking show in Melbourne last month .
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton .
The payment of physician income has been the subject of a lively debate for centuries .
In fact , one finds it addressed at length in the famous Code of Hammurabi , chiseled into stone tablets some 4,000 years ago by edict of the Babylonian King Hammurabi along , by the way , with a malpractice system that makes today ’s look like a pussycat .
Adam Smith , who generally is regarded as the father of modern economics , mused at length on the compensation of physicians in his celebrated book “ An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations ” ( 1776 ) .
Chapter 10 of Book 1 , titled “ Wages and Profit in the different Employments of Labour and Stock , ” is a gracefully written treatment of what we now call labor - market theory .
It is well worth a read .
“ Honour makes a great part of the reward of all honourable professions , ” Smith wrote .
“ In point of pecuniary gain , all things considered , they are generally under - recompensed , as I shall endeavour to show by and by .
…
Disgrace has the contrary effect .
The most detestable of all employments , that of public executioner , is , in proportion to the quantity of work done , better paid than any common trade whatever . ”
( Italics added . )
Today we teach students that seemingly mysterious differences in the pecuniary income of different occupations can be explained in part by what we call “ compensating variations in the psychic income ” associated with different occupations .
Remarkably , in his treatise on compensation , Smith then departed sharply from the traditional demand - and - supply framework he popularized and we economists usually employ to explore employment and wages .
Instead , for physicians and lawyers he appeared to lean on the medieval doctrine of “ just price . ”
Thus he wrote :
We trust our health to the physician : our fortune and sometimes our life and reputation to the lawyer and attorney .
Such confidence could not safely be reposed in people of a very mean or low condition .
Their reward must be such , therefore , as may give them that rank in the society which so important a trust requires .
The long time and the great expense which must be laid out in their education , when combined with this circumstance , necessarily enhance still further the price of their labour .
Although I ’m a card - carrying economist who normally is quite comfortable with our supply - demand framework for virtually anything , I do find Adam Smith ’s perspective persuasive .
But what income would give physicians “ that rank in the society which so important a trust requires ” ?
Suppose we say , as I would , that the income physicians earn after practice expenses , working full time caring for patients , should put them somewhere into the top fifth percentile of the nation ’s distribution of income ( meaning 95 percent of families would have a lower annual income ) .
What income level might we then be talking about ?
The chart below presents the distribution of money income of American families in 2007 , as published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census .
The data are for 2007 , the latest year published at this site ; but these distributions do not shift substantially in the span of two years .
Source : U.S. Bureau of the Census , 2009 Annual Social and Economic Supplement , Table FIN-07
It turns out that an annual income of $ 250,000 or so would comfortably meet the fifth percentile threshold .
Many primary - care physicians — especially pediatricians — are considerably below that threshold .
Physicians who derive a substantial part of their incomes from procedures — such as tests or imaging — are situated much above the threshold .
They are comfortably in the top second percentile of the income distribution .
From the perspective of the “ just price doctrine , ” of course , one can easily understand , that against the huge and relatively easily earned incomes of executives in banking and business , physicians feel vastly “ undercompensated ” — just as Adam Smith predicted it .
To illustrate , a recent Princeton graduate ( B.A. ) with a job secured on Wall Street estimated wistfully that , in the midst of the current banking crisis , his first - year pay , including bonus , probably would not be much more than $ 200,000 .
How happy many pediatricians would be with such an income !
On the other hand , one gains perspective on the matter by ruminating a bit on this quotation from Adam Smith , also in the above cited chapter :
“ What a common soldier may lose is obvious enough .
Without regarding the danger , however , young volunteers never enlist so readily as at the beginning of a new war ; and though they have scarce any chance of preferment , they figure to themselves , in their youthful fancies , a thousand occasions of acquiring honour and distinction which never occur .
These romantic hopes make the whole price of their blood .
Their pay is less than that of common labourers , and in actual service their fatigues are much greater . ”
( Italics added . )
As the rest of us whine about our unjust pay , let us think from time to time of our sailors , soldiers and Marines , so willing to work so hard and to pay such a huge price for an imagined “ honour ” that most of the rest of us rarely ever bother to bestow on them .
From Countdown , James Risen on the NSA 's domestic surveillance program which has been found to have accessed the personal emails of former President Bill Clinton , along with millions of other Americans ' mails and phone calls .
Keith asks just what Congressional oversight is in place to prevent this and whether the Obama administration has actually put some oversight in place to end the over - collection of data that occurred under the Bush administration .
Risen notes Eric Holder 's unwillingness to say the program is illegal during Congressional hearings , which means we are n't going to see anyone prosecuted for spying on every American illegally any time soon .
Of course with so much of this being classified we 're going to be lucky to ever find out just what the NSA has been doing .
I 'm inclined to assume the worst since these people have given me no reason not to .
When or how we ever get Big Brother out of our lives is a question yet to be answered .
If spying on a former President and a former member of the House Intelligence Committee is n't enough to raise some concerns from our political elite and put a stop to some of this , I 'm not sure what is .
For more on this you can read Risen 's article at the New York Times : E - Mail Surveillance Renews Concerns in Congress .
From the article :
Sometimes I 'm just rendered speechless , and this is one of those times .
Natasha Chart via Sustainable Food at Change.org :
Obama 's considering appointing a former Monsanto vice president , Mike Taylor , to head the Food Safety Working Group at the FDA .
As Jill Richardson writes at LaVidaLocavore at the link above , Taylor thinks the FDA wastes too much time on food safety inspections at meat packing plants .
Further , he believes that one of their main problems is that they have to slow down their line speed too much .
Everyone who 's read anything about the horrendous working conditions at US meatpacking plants knows that incomplete kills before slaughter and worker injuries increase dramatically when line speeds increase .
As also noted at the Ethicurean , Taylor is the reason milk from rBGH / rBST cows does n't have to be labeled .
Bovine growth hormone is perfectly safe , after all .
Except for cows , or humans who drink its breakdown products in milk .
So yes , Mike Taylor is the person we have to thank for putting pus from mastitis - infected cows into the milk supply , and exposing milk - drinking Americans by the millions to greater cancer risks .
This guy is heading up a food safety working group .
I 'm just swimming in the changeiness .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Billionaire oil man T. Boone Pickens is shelving plans to build the world 's largest wind farm .
T. Boone Pickens says the capital markets will not support his plans to build the world 's largest wind farm .
The chairman of BP Capital Management announced Tuesday that his plans for the Pampa Wind Project , designed to generate 4,000 megawatts of electricity using thousands of wind turbines , is on hold .
" I had hoped that Pampa would be the starting point , but transmission issues and the problem with the capital markets make that unfeasible at this point , " Pickens told CNN 's Ali Velshi .
" I expect to continue development of the Pampa project , but not at the pace that I originally expected . "
The Pickens Plan was an attempt to wean the United States off foreign oil and switch to wind and natural gas .
The project was to be set in four Texas Panhandle counties .
Pickens said he faced hurdles in routing the power from Texas to a distribution system .
His plans were also stymied by a plunge in natural gas prices and a tightening credit market .
" The capital markets have dealt us all a setback , and I 'm less aggressive with the Panhandle project than I have been , " Pickens said .
Watch Pickens respond to criticism that the U.S. can't shake it 's oil addiction »
He said he was still committed to 667 wind turbines that he has already ordered and would find homes for them .
The Texas billionaire pushed The Pickens Plan in television commercials and lobbying efforts that started last summer .
Pickens had hoped to complete his $ 12 billion plan in 2014 and provide enough electricity to power 1.3 million homes .
Renewable energy is the source of only a small portion of electricity used today , but in 2008 , the United States became the world 's leading provider of wind power .
Pickens , 81 , made his fortune in oil production and trading and is listed in Forbes magazine as the 117th richest person in the United States with a net worth of about $ 3 billion in 2007 .

I was most interested to read the anecdote of Sir Charles Napier in William Safire 's column '' Exit Haigspeak ' ' ( On Language , July 11 ) .
However , I think the circumstances surrounding his message to London , '' Peccavi , '' were rather different , making it an even better pun .
The fighting in the 1840's was at a time of British expansion in India .
Nevertheless , there were those in Britain who doubted the wisdom of too rapid an advance , and in particular , the capture of the province of Sind , which was thought likely to lead to an overextension of lines of communication .
Napier was therefore under express orders not to capture the territory .
Once he discovered , however , how little resistance there was , he took the province with ease .
'' Peccavi '' therefore meant both '' I have Sind , '' and ' ' I have sinned ' ' - perhaps a perfect pun .

An estimated 1,200 Irish - born men and women – roughly a third of all Ireland ’s gay couples — are living with a same - sex partner in the United States , according to a new study based on U.S. Census data .
The study found that more than 500 Irish - born same - sex partners here are not U.S. citizens , and would be among those most likely to return to Ireland to take advantage of a forthcoming civil - partnership bill to be introduced by Irish Minister for Justice and Equality Brian Lenihan by March 31 .
Gary Gates , senior research fellow at the Williams Institute , a public policy think tank at the University of California Los Angeles Law School , told The Irish Voice : “ Same - sex partnership legislation could help to entice a very talented group of Irish - born emigrants back to live and work in their homeland .
Our study found that 43 percent of Irish - born same - sex partners living in the U.S. are college - educated . ”
Analyzing data from the U.S. Census Bureau , the study found that two - thirds of Irish - born same - sex partners in the US are women .
The researchers also found that Irish - born same - sex partners are highly educated , with more than four in ten ( 43 percent ) possessing a college degree .
More than one in seven couples that include an Irish - born partner ( 15 percent ) are raising children .
An additional 2,000 same - sex couples are living in Ireland , according to the study .
As the Irish Government considers the details of the civil - partnership law , Gates added , “ Irish policymakers should look beyond their own shores when they consider the possible effects of civil - partnership legislation , some of which might be very good for the Irish economy . ”
In the United States , the Williams Institute has recently conducted a series of studies on the economic consequences of a state implementing marriage or other forms of legal recognition for same - sex couples , providing data to inform those debates .
Says Gates : “ With help from the recent Census data , I discovered that I could determine what portion of same - sex couples were Irish - born .
But since Ireland does not permit foreign - born partners of Irish people to work there , for most same - sex couples it is not an option to move back .
In consequence , Ireland is missing out on highly educated college graduates , the kind of talent that Ireland hopes to attract , due to legislation that wo n’t permit them to move home with their U.S. born partners . ”

Nobody Ever Dies of Overpopulation
By Garrett Hardin
Following the recent loss of life due to a cyclone in Bangladesh Dr. Garrett Hardin's 20 year old column came to mind .
It is here reprinted with permission from Science , 12 February 1971 , Volume 171 , Number 3971 , © 1971 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Professor Hardin has retired from teaching in the biology department of the University of California at Santa Barbara .
Those of us who are deeply concerned about population and the environment  " econuts , " we 're called ,  are accused of seeing herbicides in trees , pollution in running brooks , radiation in rocks , and overpopulation everywhere .
There is merit in the accusation .
I was in Calcutta when the cyclone struck East Bengal in November 1970 .
Early dispatches spoke of 15,000 dead , but the estimates rapidly escalated to 2,000,000 and then dropped back to 500,000 .
A nice round number : it will do as well as any , for we will never know .
The nameless ones who died , " unimportant " people far beyond the fringes of the social power structure , left no trace of their existence .
Pakistani parents repaired the population loss in just 40 days , and the world turned its attention to other matters .
1
What killed those unfortunate people ?
The cyclone , newspapers said .
But one can just as logically say that overpopulation killed them .
The Gangetic Delta is barely above sea level .
Every year several thousand people are killed in quite ordinary storms .
If Pakistan were not overcrowded , no sane man would bring his family to such a place .
Ecologically speaking , a delta belongs to the river and the sea ; man obtrudes there at his peril .
In the web of life every event has many antecedents .
Only by an arbitrary decision can we designate a single antecedent as " cause . "
Our choice is biased  biased to protect our egos against the onslaught of unwelcome truths .
As T.S. Eliot put it in Burnt Norton :
Go , go , go , said the bird : human kind
Cannot bear very much reality .
Were we to identify overpopulation as the cause of a half - million deaths , we would threaten ourselves with a question to which we do not know the answer :
How can we control population without recourse to repugnant measures ?
Fearfully we close our minds to an inventory of possibilities .
Instead , we say that a cyclone caused the deaths , thus relieving ourselves of responsibility for this and future catastrophes .
" Fate " is so comforting .
Every year we list tuberculosis , leprosy , enteric diseases , or animal parasites as the " cause of death " of millions of people .
It is well known that malnutrition is an important antecedent of death in all these categories ; and that malnutrition is connected with overpopulation .
But overpopulation is not called the cause of death .
We can not bear the thought .
People are dying now of respiratory diseases in Tokyo , Birmingham , and Gary , because of the " need " for more industry .
The " need " for more food justifies overfertilization of the land , leading to eutrophication of the waters , and lessened fish production  which leads to more " need " for food .
What will we say when the power shuts down some fine summer on our eastern seaboard and several thousand people die of heat prostration ?
Will we blame the weather ?
Or the power companies for not building enough generators ?
Or the econuts for insisting on pollution controls ?
One thing is certain : we wo n't blame the deaths on overpopulation .
No one ever dies of overpopulation .
It is unthinkable .

At first sight , what is happening in Tehran today looks very like the extraordinary events of the Islamic Revolution 30 years ago .
But how deep do the similarities go ?
On 2 December 1978 , two million Iranians filled the streets of central Tehran to demand an end to the rule of the Shah and the return of Ayatollah Khomeini .
It was the most popular revolution in history .
At night , people gathered on rooftops to chant " Allahu Akbar – God is Great " .
In the daytime , mass rallies commemorated as martyrs the protesters who had been killed by the security forces .
The methods of protest are very similar .
This is hardly surprising because the demonstrators seeking to get rid of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad understandably hope the type of unarmed mass protest that worked against the Shah will succeed again .
Mass rally and public martyrdom are part of the Iranian revolutionary tradition , just as the barricade is part of the tradition in France .
A difference between 1978 - 9 and today is that the Iranian government has no intention of letting history repeat itself .
Nor is it likely to do so .
The Iranian revolution was carried out by a broad coalition from right to left which had religious conservatives at one end and Marxist revolutionaries at the other .
The Shah and his regime had a unique ability to alienate simultaneously different parts of the Iranian population which had nothing in common .
His cruel but poorly informed Savak security men convinced themselves that communists and revolutionary leftists were the danger to the throne and not the Shia clergy .
They were not alone in their delusion .
President Jimmy Carter recalls an August 1978 CIA memo , drafted five months before the Shah took flight , firmly concluding that Iran " is not in a revolutionary or even a pre-revolutionary situation " .

Crucially , the Iranian revolution had a messianic leader in Ayatollah Khomeini who was a visible alternative to the Shah , a leader whose claims to legitimacy were compromised even before he came to the throne : his father Reza Shah , an army general who seized power in the 1920s , was deposed by British and Soviet troops in 1941 .
His son was forced to flee in 1953 when Mohammed Mossadeq was elected prime minister , only to be restored by a CIA - run coup for which President Barack Obama has apologised .
More astute rulers might have tried to burnish their nationalist credentials but instead the Shah indulged in historical fantasies such as abolishing the Islamic calendar and celebrating the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire at Persepolis in 1971 .
Foreign dignitaries and celebrities sipped drinks behind security cordons while Iranians were excluded .
What makes the Iranian revolution different from previous revolutions in the 19th and 20th centuries is that it was a religious revolution in terms of its leadership and inspiration .
Thirty years later , when " Islamic revolution " is seen as such a menace in the West , it is difficult to recall what a surprising development it was in the late 1970s .
Revolutions were supposed to follow roughly in the footsteps of the French , Russian or Chinese revolutions .
Their tone was secular and anti-religious .
Priests were the defenders of the established order .
There had been Islamic anti-colonial movements against the European empires and later against the nationalist regimes which succeeded them .
But the record of these Islamic parties was one of failure .
It was the Iranian revolution that made political Islam such a potent and , to its enemies , such a menacing force .
The revolution was not only Islamic , but was rooted in the theology and beliefs of one particular Islamic sect .
At a moment when intelligence services were looking at Moscow , Peking and Havana as the inspiration for revolution , none of them foresaw the danger to the status quo that was brewing in the clerical seminaries of Najaf in Iraq and Qom in Iran .
The birth of revolutionary Shi'ism surprised the world .
In theory , Shia theology is more likely to spawn revolution than the Sunni because so many of its beliefs and ceremonies revolve around the lost battle of Kerbala in AD680 .
It was here that Imam Hussain , the grandson of the Prophet , and 72 of his companions and relatives , were massacred by the soldiers of the second Umayyad caliph Yazid 1 .
It is a story of refusal to bow to injustice , of resistance to oppression and martyrdom .
But this alone did not make Shi'ism a revolutionary ideology .
Iran became Shia by the fiat of the Safavid dynasty in the 16th century .
It was only in the 1950s and 1960s , in response to triumphant secularism , leftist revolutionary ideology and persecution by the Shah , that the Shia clergy of Iran and Iraq began to develop their own Islamic " liberation theology " which enabled them to take power in 1979 .
The Iranian revolution was more deeply rooted than it appeared to be .
It sprang from a coherent ideology .
It succeeded partly because it caught its enemies , as well as most of its supporters , by surprise .
But it was not a spontaneous event .
Khomeini and the clergy who supported him were committed revolutionaries .
They had thought out how to take power and how to keep it .
They might decry nationalism , but it was their commitment to defending the Iranian nation from foreign encroachments which was so crucial to their success .

In 1964 , Khomeini was expelled from Iran , to take refuge in Najaf , because of his opposition to extra-territorial rights for US government employees .
The present Iranian leadership does not have the great weakness of the Shah , which was to be seen as the puppet of foreign powers .
By the time the Shah left Iran on 16 January 1979 he had almost no support .
This again is very different from the present situation .
President Ahmadinejad was re-elected with 62.6 per cent of the vote last week .
His opponents claim the poll was rigged , although this is almost exactly the same as his vote in 2005 , when he won 61.7 per cent .
The point is that Mr Ahmadinejad is a popular politician and the Shah was not .
He is very unlikely to be forced from power .
Nor is he likely to surrender as the Shah did when he found he was unable to cope with the uprising .
The weakness of the Shah was not evident when the first demonstrations against him began in October 1977 , after the death of Khomeini 's son .
The first demonstrators , religious students , were killed in early 1978 after an article in a government newspaper attacked Khomeini .
Their deaths were commemorated 40 days later , according to Shia religious custom , and protests spread across Iran .
These demonstrations in some ways resembled civil rights marches in the US but they had greater impact because they were wedded to religious ritual and the commemoration of martyrdom .
Politically , this was a potent blend .
It appealed to the most conservative cleric and the most radical student alike .
Even so , the marches and demonstrations might have run out of steam over the summer of 1978 if they had not been sustained by a network of clerical supporters of Khomeini in the mosques .
Iranians from the slums and villages who had not benefited from the oil boom began to join in .
No crime was so bad that Iranians did not think that the Shah and his security men capable of it .
When the Rex Cinema in Abadan caught fire and 400 people burned to death , it was widely believed Savak had started it .
The Shah , who appeared demoralized from an early stage in the crisis , used enough repression to make his regime detested but not enough to create lasting fear .
His concessions conveyed confusion and weakness .
Martial law was declared .
On 8 September , so - called Black Friday , soldiers opened fire on demonstrators and were accused of killing thousands ( though the real figure may have been much lower ) .
These were the days when the Shah lost his last chance of staying in power .
He made one further unforced error which had disastrous consequences for himself .
Khomeini had been in exile in Najaf , from which he could communicate with Iran but with some difficulty .
Cassettes of his sermons had to be smuggled across the border .
There was no international press corps in Iraq .
But with self - destructive zeal , the Shah 's emissaries persuaded the Iraqi government , in which Saddam Hussein was already the strongest figure , to expel Khomeini , who , after being refused entry to Kuwait , took up residence in a suburb of Paris in October .
In Paris , he had better access to the international press than the Shah and was able to communicate easily with Iran .
By the end of 1978 , Iranians , even those opposed to the revolution , could see that the Shah was finished .
His core military support began to waver .
The clergy made every effort to infiltrate and propagandize his armed forces .
In any case , he did not want to fight .
By mid-January , he and his wife had left Iran forever .
On 1 February 1979 , Khomeini returned to Iran to be greeted by several million Iranians and swiftly completed the takeover of power .
He marginalised his secular allies from the year before and began to radicalise the revolution , culminating in November 1979 when clerical students took over the US embassy .
Recalling how the Shah had come back from exile with US support in 1953 , any potential Shah supporters were imprisoned or shot .
The leaders of the new regime were intent on staying in power .
They have not changed much today .
The spectacle , the symbols , and the language in Iran in 2009 are similar to those present in 1978 - 9 , but the political forces at work could not be more different .
The protesters then were much stronger than they looked ; those of today have the odds heavily stacked against them .
The second half recovery argument took a significant blow last week when it was announced that 467,000 Americans were laid off in the month of June .
This number understates the problem because of BLS tinkering with the birth / death model and the headline number does not reflect the over 9 million Americans who are working part - time but want full - time work .
It also was little help that the state with the highest GDP in the nation is unable to manage its own finances and now finds itself in a $ 26.3 billion deficit and issuing IOUs .
This does not look like a green shoot recovery .
The problem of course stems from the initial premise dating back to the early part of this year that somehow , with the economic stimulus and bailouts that the economy would be back on its feet .
What did happen is the crony banking system is still intact but the real economy is deteriorating at the same pace .
In this article , I am going to layout 10 charts as to why there will be no second half recovery in 2009 .
Before getting into the details , it is crucial to note that Americans have never lost so much of their net worth in any recession on record :
In no time in history have Americans faced such a destruction to their bottom line .
Since the recession started , some $ 13.87 trillion in household net worth has evaporated .
Much of this of course comes from the housing bubble imploding but also , the stock market following the same path .
Now given that housing in many areas is still overpriced , we can expect that the bottom line will drop further as housing contracts .
The above chart has data up to Q1 of 2009 and given housing prices fell in Q2 of 2009 we should see another drop in household net worth .
The bottom line is Americans feel poorer because they are and this will have a major psychological impact on how they spend .
The green shoot argument hinges on the stimulus package that was some $ 787 billion .
Given the amount of lost net worth , this stimulus is a drop in the bucket .
Also , $ 287 billion of the plan was based on temporary tax breaks which are now being negated by many states raising taxes .
Part of the tax credit gave new home buyers an $ 8,000 tax break ( this has run out for California ) .
Yet here we are issuing IOUs like some Dumb and Dumber reenactment .
If we break down the stimulus further , it really is n’t a stimulus plan as much as a “ put a band - aid on the broken leg so things do n’t get worse ” stop - gap measure .
Much of the money goes to schools , Medicaid , repairing infrastructure , and helping the growing number of unemployed so to view this as the engine for second half growth is absolutely wrong .
It is a tourniquet to stop the bleeding .
However during this same time we committed some $ 13 trillion to the crony banking bailout and that is why you see some folks like Goldman Sachs trading at $ 143 a share up from their $ 47 low reached in March .
So the banking system and Wall Street were taken care of but Main Street was kicked to the ditch .
Here are the 10 reasons why there will be no second half recovery in 2009 .
Reason # 1 – Collapsed Auto Sales
It should n’t come as a surprise that the auto industry is in shambles here in America .
As you can see from the chart above auto sales are struggling even to get over the 10 million SAAR which does n’t bode well for the future of many car companies .
The problem is n’t so much that cars that are being produced today are of low quality .
In fact , the opposite is true and cars today are being produced more efficiently and with better quality .
But like housing , they are too expensive once you take away the debt elixir .
Even the Governor of car happy California had this to say in a recent radio address :
“ As a matter of fact I was just talking with a friend of mine who told me about an American company that is going to produce a car for $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 .
Think about that .
For $ 10,000 or $ 15,000 compared to the average car sold in America for close to $ 30,000 . ”
Now you should think about that .
How does this bode for companies that make those cars selling for the average $ 30,000 ?
The only reasons Americans were able to buy cars like they did for the past decade was because of easy access to debt .
That is gone .
Even if it came back , who in the world are car companies going to make loans to ?
Someone that is unemployed or seeing their hours cut back is n’t in the mood to buy a $ 30,000 car .
So this big segment of the U.S. will be slow for the rest of the year .
Reason # 2 – Housing Starts
The last time housing starts collapsed this quickly was in the Great Depression .
For a country with an economy built on real estate this chart tells you a lot as to why we are in this mess .
We over built with easy financing both at the commercial and retail level and here we are working through the excess that is left in the system .
The problem is , we have years of excess .
Nationwide foreclosures are at record levels thus ensuring us continued cheap inventory throughout the year .
Why would any builder want to start building right now to compete with that economic forecast ?
Plus , new homes are more expensive than existing home sales and if you have n’t noticed , we ’re in the middle of a deep recession .
The second half recovery crew apparently did n’t get the memo on this one .
Reason # 3 – Single Family Home Sales
This above chart shows this divergence even clearer .
Calculated Risk calls the gap between new home sales and existing home sale the distressing gap .
In more normal times , the pattern for both of these usually trend together .
That trend has been broken .
Existing home sales are outpacing new home sales in large part because of foreclosure re-sales .
How are new homes going to compete with this ?
They ca n’t and that is why they are losing .
Since foreclosures are sky high we can rest assured this pattern will continue for some time , definitely for the rest of 2009 .
Keep in mind that we have n’t even seen the Alt - A and option ARM tsunami which will flood more inventory onto the market later this year and into 2010 .
People ask , “ how are you so sure the Alt - A problems will come to fruition ? ”
It is a simple problem and if you think about it , there is just no way around it .
Let us assume for the sake of the crony banking system , that the government does a massively boneheaded move and buys up all the toxic Alt - A paper in the market ( which would be some $ 2+ trillion but we are being hypothetical here ) .
Okay .
Banks and Wall Street are saved again .
But one small problem .
The borrower still has the crappy loan !
So the default will still happen unless the government writes down the loan ( and I do n’t mean these pathetic loan mods which are basically turning loans into option ARMs ) .
If that happens , our deficit will explode even further which is not a good sign given how enormous it is now .
Deflation seems to be here in many sectors yet the fear of inflation and hyperinflation are ever present .
Bottom line is that there is no way around it and we will see more foreclosures and lower home prices .
Not a recipe for a second half recovery .
Reason # 4 – Personal Savings Rate
You notice how financial networks do n’t spend more than two seconds on this fact ?
Want to know why ?
It is because these financial networks view the average American as their pet consumption hamster .
They speak about unemployment as if it were some science project yet scream in climatic passion to help their banking overlords .
The fact that the savings rate is going up is good .
Yet this brings up the paradox of thrift .
Our society today massively relies on consumption with 70 percent of our GDP coming from this .
So it would logically follow that if Americans are saving more , they are spending less .
And the above chart shows the savings rate literally off the charts .
This is important since Americans have lived beyond their means for the past two decades and now that debt is collapsing , many are realizing that they were only living on borrowed financial time .
You do n’t need to read hundreds of personal finance books to realize that to be financially secure , you need to save .
But how many times have we heard the so - called financial media highlight this ?
Sure , they have their token frugal segments but 90 percent of their time is spent on pumping stocks and skimming on any deeper analysis .
The fact that they missed the deepest recession since the Great Depression puts their credibility ( what is left of it ) on the line .
I heard one of the networks say that we need to have “ faith and hope ” in the recovery .
Come on now !
This was coming from a network that ridiculed many bearish commentators about the housing bubble as “ having the wrong faith . ”
Unfortunately finances are n’t about faith .
We do have animal spirits but no animal spirit is going to save you if you lose your job or have a major mortgage recast in your future .
Americans realize this and are upping their savings rate .
One troubling anecdote which is also contributing to this is many employers have cut back their 401k contributions .
Given the market has gone down by 40 % since its high , many are debating whether they should even contribute to their retirement account .
So instead , many are just putting their money in a cheap saving account .
Well at least we are n’t like Sweden offering a negative 0.25 percent rate .
As much as the government is trying to get people to spend , many are doing the opposite which is the right thing to do .
After all , I doubt the financial networks will be there to make up for your lost hours or employment should those green shoots not show up .
Speaking of lost hours …
Reason # 5 – Hours Worked
What was even more troubling than the 467,000 jobs lost last month was the fact that hours worked keeps declining with no foreseeable stop .
This is probably a better indicator of the overall economy since as we noted , over 9 million people are working part - time so that does n’t show up in the mainstream unemployment number but would show up here .
When the economy does start turning around , there will already be people working that will simply go from part - time to full - time .
This is good for those that jump into the new role but this will keep a lid on any new employment growth for a very long time .
And keep in mind the trend is still heading lower .
As many of you know , unemployment peaks well after the recession is over .
This recession is far from over .
Many were expecting the second half to usher in massive rallies and easy money .
From where ?
What sectors ?
As we noted , the stimulus was more of a tourniquet .
In fact , in Q1 of 2009 the loss in American household wealth almost doubled the amount of the initial stimulus bill .
The hours worked component is important to keep our eye on .
This is a good indicator for early signs of recovery .
So far , there is no green shoot here .
Reason # 6 – Unemployment
The unemployment rate keeps moving up and most early estimates from analyst this year are blown out of the water .
States like California now have unemployment rates of 11.5 percent that have never been seen by a large part of the population .
It is amazing how little focus has been given to job creation .
If we spent half the amount of time as we did in bailing out the crony banks on job growth we ’d be in much better shape .
But as many of you now know the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve when push comes to shove , answer to their banking oligarchs first and then to whatever they have time for .
It is amazing that the Federal Reserve which in its mission talks about maintaining stability has presided over :
The Great Depression
Multiple Recessions
1987 Panic
Technology Stock Crash
Housing Bubble
By this simple definition they have failed miserably .
They operate as a cartel and when things are going well , it goes better for those connected here .
When things hit the fan , they take care of their banking partners and take the average taxpayer out to dry .
That is why the unemployment situation is quickly falling apart .
In fact , that is why we have seen no employment plan come out from either the last or current administration .
No matter what tax break you give for buying a home , without a job it really does n’t matter .
That is something that really amazes me in this current economic crisis .
Where are the jobs going to come from ?
If anything , I can stand behind a job plan more than I can stand behind a crony banking bailout .
Yet all this time is devoted to saving Wall Street and banks .
Now you know who the Fed serves and it is n’t the American citizen .
Reason # 7 – Renting Does n’t Sound so Bad Anymore
I remember these debates I would get into with colleagues during the housing bubble .
They would jokingly say , “ it ’s the first of the month , is n’t the rent due today ? ”
I would get a laugh out of it but in my mind , I knew they had a mammoth mortgage payment due on the same day , which to them was somehow different .
A few had neg - amortization loans like option ARMs which were building up no equity !
It was worse than renting .
Most of these colleagues now either rent or lost their home in the California housing implosion .
Yet the conversation has now shifted to the utility of a home and not so much the equity machine that many thought it was .
The above chart is important .
As you can see , over this decade the debt service for homeowners is still at a high while the debt service for renters has steadily decreased .
Part of this of course is many are now electing to rent instead of buying a home .
The rental market is now facing some challenges because of a flood of inventory .
As many of you know I own rental property and I have seen this first hand .
Yet the rental market is nothing like the housing market .
That is , you can drop your rents and the market will respond at some level .
Right now , you have some areas in Nevada and Arizona where you almost have to give away homes .
And for selling a home , you are restricted to the balance due otherwise you have to give someone money to sell your home or get your lender to agree to a short - sale .
Not many of these get approved .
Hence , many just walk away and that is why we are now seeing more rental inventory hitting the market .
The major shock is that housing prices do fall and can fall hard .
We have never seen a nationwide housing decline since the Great Depression .
What do you think those that lose their home in foreclosure will think later on ?
Many will vow never to buy again once they get the stain of foreclosure off their credit history .
And many watching this will be extremely cautious in over paying .
The housing bubble machine has stopped .
There is no dues ex machina for the second half .
Reason # 8 – S&P 500 Priced too High
Sometimes in life you get what you pay for .
Many people rushed into the stock market after the crash thinking it was the bottom .
Much of the recent buying is program trading resulting in low volume days and also , highlighting what a casino the market really is .
In fact , a former Goldman Sachs employee is now in trouble for trying to take away software from the ever powerful company .
The fact that they are trying to create programs that you can set on autopilot and make billions on tiny trends is absurd and show how nutty the market is ; this is like having a robot sit at a Texas Hold ’em table that will win 90 percent of the time and expecting people to play against it .
Yet when they make a horrible bet with say , AIG then the government ( aka taxpayer ) steps in to bail them out .
This is something that needs to be addressed now by the current administration .
People are starting to lack much confidence in the system and really do n’t enjoy losing money to robots and computers .
If we look at the S&P 500 as we enter earnings season , we need to realize that prices may be cheap because they deserve to be cheap .
As we ’ve noted , Americans are saving more thus cutting into consumption .
Household wealth has taken a major hit which will be reflected in a negative wealth effect .
So to expect that earnings will explode in the second half has no premise in reality .
Until we see stabilization in the employment figures and housing stops dropping like a ton of bricks , jumping into the stock market casino is at your own peril .
Reason # 9 – Deflation
In a recent article I gave 5 clear sectors where deflation is hitting the American family .
Inflation is not the immediate threat .
Wages are falling .
Home prices are crashing .
Auto prices are lower .
Demand destruction is causing price deflation .
That is clear and the CPI reflects this .
The trends that set this in motion are still present .
Wages will be falling further and home prices still have a way to go .
Having deflation in the second half is almost a guarantee and deflation does not bring good things to the stock market .
Have we even talked about commercial real estate ?
There are many reasons why there will be no second half recovery .
There are few arguments to show us why we will see green shoots in the coming six months .
Reason # 10 – Personal Consumption Expenditures
It should come as no surprise then , putting all of the above together that consumers are spending less and less .
As you can see from the chart above personal consumption expenditures have fallen off a cliff .
The trend is still lower .
Until this reverses there is little reason to believe in the second half recovery .
Keep in mind that if we reach this December in recession , it will be 24 months of being in an official recession .
This is the deepest cut to our national economy since the Great Depression .
If you are looking for green shoots we can start having that conversation once we see some semblance of stability in the employment numbers .
Keep in mind that housing is falling in spite of every imaginable bailout possible .
Loan modifications , tax breaks , and other propaganda have done nothing in stopping the inevitable reversion to the mean .
What it has done is wasted trillions in taxpayer money .
The second half recovery will not happen .
These 10 charts above represent an extremely large part of our society and where Americans hold their wealth .
The financial networks may have paid puppets to cheerlead for a second half recovery to keep their Wall Street masters happy but the vast majority of Americans see through their propaganda .
Even if they do n’t see through it , they are feeling it through the horrible employment conditions , declining home values , and shrinking stock portfolios .

A bartender pulls on the beer tap handle , and a rosy liquid streams into a waiting glass .
Take a sniff and it smells like a barnyard .
The bartender assures you that it tastes a lot better than it smells .
So you take a sip .
It ’s tart enough to make your lips pucker , but you ca n’t wait to take another sip .
This is Chez Monmee , a tart cherry ale from Alpine Beer Co. that ’s part of a new wave of refreshing American sour beers .
Ten years ago , domestic sours were nearly nonexistent .
Now a band of American brewers , including several in Southern California , is drawing on Belgian traditions to produce distinctly sour lambics , gueuzes , krieks and Flanders - style red ales .
Though still relatively rare , they ’re showing up at some of L.A. 's better beer bars .
Proprietors such as Verdugo Bar ’s Ryan Sweeney , the Golden State ’s Jason Bernstein and Blue Palms Brewhouse ’s Brian Lenzo are regularly stocking stateside sours .
Restaurant owner Bernstein appreciates how sour beer “ allows new flavors to emerge in food that would n’t normally be enhanced by hops .
The other charming thing is that sours tend to be relatively low in alcohol ” and thus sip smooth for the summer .
Patrick Rue launched the Bruery , his Belgian - style brewery in Placentia , last year , and sours have been a focus from the start .
At its first - anniversary party in May , it had a four - tap sour bar , including Cuvée Jeune , a young lambic aged in Chardonnay barrels for 10 months .
White Zin is a sweeter variation on Cuvée Jeune , blended with a brew made with Zinfandel grapes .
Gypsy Tart was Rue ’s limited - edition Flanders red that was untouched by wood , and plenty sour .
“ The classic beer palate is malty , sweet and bitter , ” says Craftsman Brewing Co. 's Mark Jilg , who began brewing sours six years ago in Pasadena .
He considers sours “ the final frontier of palate experience . ”
Jilg regularly brews a tart cherry beer called Honestly Ale , released a black sour called El Prieto in November and has several more varieties in the works .
Sour beers are only now gaining acceptance stateside , but they ’re hardly new .
“ Sour beers are our connection to the ancient history of beer , ” says Colby Chandler , president of the San Diego Brewers Guild .
“ Someone was drinking a similar beverage dating back to the 6th millennium BC . ”
A certain mystique
Traditional sour styles include unblended lambics that ferment in oak barrels in Belgium ’s Senne Valley .
Brewers add fruit to develop tart framboise ( raspberry ) and krieks ( cherry ) , to name just two tangy options .
Gueuzes blend three consecutive lambic vintages to balance flavors , minimize astringency and create carbonation .
Flanders red ales can be intensely tart .
Alex Macy , who heads the beer program at downtown ’s BottleRock , appreciates “ the acidity , the aftertaste , and the mystique in the way it ’s produced .
It ’s the romanticism of beer being brewed in an open barn with crazy wild yeast . ”
Macy is alluding to traditional Belgian fermentation methods .
Very few American brewers take the time ( and risk ) to let natural bacteria take its course , but that ’s what brew master Ron Jeffries is doing at Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales in Dexter , Mich .
America ’s only 100 % oak - aged sour brewery uses wild yeasts that appeared in the brewery naturally and spread from barrel to barrel during transfers .
Allagash Brewing Co. has raised the stakes by installing America ’s only Belgian - style cool ship in its Portland , Maine , brewery .
“ Granted , it made no financial sense , ” says brew master Jason Perkins , “ but we figured why not ? ”
An unfermented grain - enriched liquid called wort is pumped into a 12 - by - 8 - by - 1 - foot tray ( the cool ship ) .
Open windows cool the brew to 60 degrees and invite naturally occurring bacteria and yeasts , which spontaneously ferment the beer .
The wort then enters French oak barrels , where the beer ferments for more than a year .
Sour beers provide brewers with unique challenges .
“ A common misconception among brewers is that all it takes is an oak barrel and a vial of bugs and you get a sour beer , ” says Perkins .
“ In reality , it takes a lot more than that . ”
Breweries must be willing to commit the space and expense and patiently endure an unpredictable aging process .
Another major challenge is controlling the aggressive microbes .
Brewers must isolate the barrels so that the bacteria do n’t cross -contaminate other batches .
At Alpine Beer Co. , a brewery east of San Diego , brew master Pat McIlhenney uses separate hoses , separate fermenter gaskets and unique bottling machines .
Exposed tanks and barrels are nearly impossible to de-sour .
Microbial unpredictability is another variable .
“ It can be difficult to measure how well they are turning out because there is often excessive sulfur , sometimes they are n’t very sour , or sometimes they become sour very quickly , ” says the Bruery ’s Rue .
“ When we get it right , though , it is all worthwhile , ” adds Russian River brew master Vinnie Cilurzo .
Microbiology
Standard bacteria ( lactobacillus , pediococcus ) and wild yeasts ( brettanomyces ) are widely available from labs and commercial suppliers , and many brewers have developed custom microbe blends .
“ The art for the brewer is picking the right strains , growing them up effectively and choosing the right venue for them to be used , ” says Perkins .
American brewers are mindful of sour Belgian heritage but are straying from traditional oak - barrel fermentation to produce unique flavors .
Cilurzo is currently aging a brown sour cherry ale called Supplication in Pinot Noir barrels and black currant - tinged Consecration in Cabernet Sauvignon barrels .
Alpine ’s Halloween release -- Ichabod -- will be tart and lightly flavored with pumpkin , cinnamon and nutmeg .
Bourbon barrels have become increasingly popular .
To be considered “ straight bourbon , ” Kentucky distilleries can use their barrels only once .
Kentucky ’s loss is Ballast Point ’s gain .
For the sour version of the San Diego brewery ’s Black Marlin Porter , brew master Colby Chandler blends beers fermented in three different bourbon barrels to develop “ layers of flavor ” -- Jim Beam for vanilla , Heaven Hill for cherry and Old Fitzgerald for smokiness .
For Sour Wench , Chandler avoids barrel aging altogether but still sours the mash with a pound of tart Oregon blackberries per gallon .
Southern Californians have two upcoming opportunities to immerse themselves in sour beer culture .
On July 19 , Stone Brewing is hosting its third annual Sour Fest in Escondido .
Newly installed beverage coordinator Bill Sysak has visited Belgium 30 times and promises the selection will be “ decadent , more extreme ” than previous years , with close to 50 kegs , plus plenty of bottled lambics .
Beachwood BBQ proprietor Gabriel Gordon has been hoarding kegs for more than two years for Sour Fest at his restaurant in Seal Beach .
The Aug. 25 - 31 festival will feature 18 sours on tap at any given time , including Russian River Consecration and the Bruery ’s sours , plus nightly brewery events .
“ I ’ve seen the evolution of beer drinkers in general , ” says Alpine ’s McIlhenney , “ how Sierra Nevada pale ale used to be , ‘ Whoa , oh , my God , too strong flavored . ’
Eventually it became a fairly accepted beer .
. . .
Sour beers are the next step . ”

Les allocataires du Revenu de solidarité active ( RSA ) sont invités à intenter des actions en justice à leurs proches ( père , mère , ex- conjoint ) pour obtenir une aide financière s’ils affrontent des difficultés .
C’est ce qu’ont découvert les futurs allocataires en remplissant leurs dossiers de demande de ce minima social entré en vigueur début juin .
Inacceptable .
Le formulaire retiré à la CAF ( Caisse d’allocations familiales ) ou téléchargé sur son site Internet questionne sur cinq pages les postulants au RSA et les encourage à entreprendre des démarches devant les tribunaux .
Comme si l’Etat leur demandait de faire jouer la solidarité familiale avant de solliciter la solidarité nationale .
A la rubrique « Vous êtes célibataire et vous vivez seul » , le document interroge les futurs allocataires : « Percevez - vous une pension alimentaire ? »
Si le demandeur répond « non » , le document lui précise qu’il est « susceptible d’engager une action envers ( ses ) parents [ père , mère , ndlr ] pour obtenir une pension alimentaire » .
Une idée inacceptable pour la plupart de ces grands adultes de 30 , 40 ou 50 ans qui ont touché le fond et pour lesquels le RMI d’hier et le RSA d’aujourd ’hui constituent le dernier filet de sécurité .
Là , ils se voient proposer par l’administration d’emmener leurs parents âgés parfois de 60 , 70 ou 80 ans , devant les tribunaux .
« Si vous souhaitez être dispensé de cette démarche , précisez le motif » , stipule le formulaire .
Même chose pour les personnes séparées de leurs conjoints et ayant des enfants à charge .
Le dossier les invite à « engager une action envers [ l’autre ] parent pour obtenir la fixation ou le versement d’une pension alimentaire pour chaque enfant concerné » .
Là encore , pour « être dispensé de cette démarche » il faut « préciser le motif » .
Pour certains demandeurs , ces questions réveillent des histoires douloureuses .
« Je travaille en emploi précaire depuis plusieurs années .
Je gagne 808 euros par mois .
J’ai entendu parler du RSA .
Je pensais que cela allait m’aider » , raconte une femme venue , formulaire en main , à Libération , pour dire son « indignation » .
La cinquantaine , une fille lycéenne à charge , elle a fait une simulation de sa situation sur le site de la CAF .
Elle a droit à une allocation RSA de 180 euros par mois , qui s’ajoute à son salaire .
Un vrai bonus .
« J ’en ai besoin parce que je n’y arrive pas .
» Mais elle dit s’être « sentie trahie » lorsqu’elle s’est penchée sur le formulaire .
« Le père de ma fille a disparu dans la nature à sa naissance .
Depuis , je me débrouille .
Je trouve ça cruel qu’on me demande d’aller voir les tribunaux au motif que je demande à bénéficier d’un dispositif de solidarité nationale » , souligne cette femme .
Au - delà de sa situation , elle « juge inhumain et indigne d’une société soi-disant civilisée » qu’un Etat incite des enfants à attaquer leurs parents en justice « pour leur prendre de l’argent » .
L’aide parentale pourquoi pas .
Mais pas sous la contrainte judiciaire .
Ces réactions sont nombreuses car , outre les actuels allocataires du RMI ( 1,13 million de personnes qui ont basculé au RSA ) , plus de 2,5 millions de travailleurs pauvres doivent remplir ce dossier pour bénéficier du RSA .
Choc .
La découverte de ces questions constitue un choc .
Contacté par Libération , le cabinet de Martin Hirsch , haut - commissaire aux Solidarités actives entré au gouvernement pour mettre en place le RSA , est très gêné .
Sa réponse se fera attendre trois jours ( lire ici ) .
En guise d’explication , ses services invoquent un problème d’«articulation entre la solidarité familiale telle que l’organise le code civil , et la solidarité nationale telle que l’organise le code de l’action sociale » .
Sous - entendu : le code civil non - toiletté de longue date a un temps de retard sur l’action sociale et notamment les dispositifs de solidarité nationale comme le défunt RMI et le nouveau RSA .
Le communiqué précise que la loi du 1er décembre 2008 relative au RSA reprend « les mêmes dispositions » que le RMI .
Pas tout à fait vrai .
Le Haut - Commissariat reconnaît que l’incitation faite aux enfants de 30 , 40 ou 50 ans d’engager une action contre leurs parents « ne figurait pas dans le formulaire national du RMI » .
Pourquoi l’avoir rajouté alors ?
Parce que cette question « était posée par certains départements au travers de formulaires complémentaires » , argumente le cabinet , qui avance « un souci d’harmonisation » .
Mais au lieu d’harmoniser par le haut , en éliminant dans tout l’Hexagone cette formule contestable , les services de Martin Hirsch ont harmonisé par le bas , en la généralisant partout et auprès des 3,7 millions de personnes éligibles au RSA .
Pour finir , après bien des contorsions , le communiqué du Haut - Commissariat souligne que « le formulaire sera modifié sur ce point pour éviter les troubles inutiles » .
Une façon très indirecte de reconnaître qu’il y a un malaise auquel il convient de répondre .
The PlayStation Portable ( officially abbreviated PSP ) is a handheld game console manufactured and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment .
Development of the console was first announced during E3 2003 , and it was unveiled on May 11 , 2004 at a Sony press conference before E3 2004 .
The system was released in Japan on December 12 , 2004 , in North America on March 24 , 2005 , and in the PAL region on September 1 , 2005 .
The PlayStation Portable is the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format , Universal Media Disc ( UMD ) , as its primary storage media .
Other distinguishing features of the console include its large viewing screen , robust multi-media capabilities , and connectivity with the PlayStation 3 , other PSPs , and the Internet .
Despite the console 's superior computing power and its multimedia capabilities , sales have consistently lagged behind its main competitor , the Nintendo DS .
After the release of a remodeled , slimmer , and lighter version of the PlayStation Portable , appropriately titled Slim and Lite , in early September 2007 , sales quadrupled in the United Kingdom the following week and increased by nearly 200 % in North America for the month of October .
On a Tuesday morning in April , the presidents of three of the largest restaurant chains in the country slip into an unmarked white van in Orlando , Florida , and embark on an unprecedented mission — sharing their latest trade secrets .

You know their brands : $ 3 billion — plus Olive Garden , with its heaping bowls of pasta and all - you - can - eat breadsticks ; $ 2 billion — plus Red Lobster , which introduced middle America to the wonders of fried shrimp ; and nearly $ 1 billion LongHorn Steakhouse , whose variations on a theme include steak stuffed with fontina cheese and wild mushrooms .
You probably do n’t know they ’re part of the same company , Darden Restaurants .
It ’s the country ’s largest full - service restaurant operation , the 29th - largest employer in the United States , and a pioneer of what ’s known as “ casual dining , ” which accounts for 39 % of all sit - down restaurant meals .
Like Procter & Gamble , low - profile Darden runs a portfolio of ubiquitous brands .
The company generated $ 6.7 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year , owns and operates 1,770 restaurants , and serves more than 400 million meals a year — the equivalent of feeding the entire U.S. population , with seconds for residents of California , Florida , New York , and Texas .
At the helm of this quiet giant is the 53 - year - old son of a janitor from Watts , the Los Angeles neighborhood that made headlines for riots in 1965 .
“ You hear people in the restaurant industry say , ‘ I have a feel for the business , ’ ” says CEO Clarence Otis .
He ’s not one of those people .
“ On the continuum of intuitive restaurants versus systematized , analytic restaurants , we ’re very analytic , ” he says .
“ The direction of our business is based on understanding customers . ”
Otis is sitting in his corner office in Orlando , unperturbed by an April storm .
High winds , clouds as dark as a cast - iron skillet , and pounding rain envelop the whitecaps outside his window on Lake Ellenor .
As he describes the economic and demographic forces buffeting the industry , and how Darden has prepared for them , he ’s not easily distracted .
Lean and fit , he has the air of someone with the patience to study a spreadsheet and the self - discipline to resist Olive Garden ’s “ never - ending pasta bowl . ”
He ’ll need both traits to weather the storm facing the restaurant industry .
Darden is in the process of altering the Red Lobster recipe — a big risk — to serve healthier food and improve sluggish sales .
Meanwhile , Olive Garden ’s streak of 57 consecutive quarters of same - restaurant sales growth ended last fall , and the company that grew earnings in 9 of the last 11 years is expected to fall short this year .
True , Darden is faring better than most of its competition :
The company beat analysts ’ earnings forecasts for the last two quarters , and by May , its stock had tripled from its low last November .
Still , the challenges in this climate are huge , especially given Darden ’s plan to add as many as 55 restaurants in the coming year .
Hence the Orlando tour .
The secret to Darden ’s success has been a combination of leading - edge technology that helps make a notoriously unpredictable business more efficient , purchasing practices out of the Wal - Mart playbook , and decentralized brand - management honed during the 15 years the company was owned by consumer - products giant General Mills .
Now Otis is pushing a new tactic : no -holds - barred sharing of information between brands .
“ I want to come stand in the kitchen on Friday night at 8 o’clock and see it when you ’re slammed , ” LongHorn president Dave George tells an Olive Garden executive .
advertisement
“ Anytime , ” is the response .
“ Anytime . ”
As a kid , Otis would escape the racial strife and isolation of 1960s Watts through reading .
Every couple of weeks , he ’d check out a dozen books from the local library .
By ninth grade , he had finished nearly every novel and biography in the collection .
Encouraged by a guidance counselor , he earned a scholar - ship to Williams College , went on to law school at Stanford , and then to Wall Street ( Carl Icahn was a client ) .
At the age of 31 , Otis became a vice president at First Boston and later helped turn around Chemical Securities ’ public - finance department .
( Institutional Investor named one bond he helped create at Chemical the “ deal of the year . ” )
In 1995 , a headhunter recommended him to Darden , which had just been spun off from General Mills .
Otis signed on , drawn to a company poised for growth .
Darden was already an institution .
Its founder , Bill Darden , at just 19 years old , opened his first restaurant in 1938 — a lunch counter in Waycross , Georgia , with 10 stools , two booths , and curb service .
( My dad , who grew up in Waycross , was a fan of the fried shrimp . )
Darden called the place the Green Frog and promised “ service with a hop . ”
It was fast and affordable , and became a must - stop for families on their way to and from Florida .
Over the next 30 years , Darden added nearly two dozen Howard Johnson franchises , but his breakthrough was Red Lobster , which opened in Lakeland , Florida , in 1968 .
He saw that a seafood restaurant that was nicer than still - young fast - food and more affordable than white - tablecloth restaurants would fill a niche .
Otis moved up , from treasurer to chief financial officer of Darden and then president of its Smokey Bones Barbeque & Grill chain .
In 2004 , he was tapped to run Darden , becoming one of the few African - American CEOs in the Fortune 500 .
He plotted a new course for major growth , and began making changes .
He sold Smokey Bones , after deciding the 127 - restaurant chain lacked national appeal , and , in 2007 , engineered Darden ’s first acquisition : a $ 1.4 billion deal for Rare Hospitality , parent of LongHorn Steakhouse and the upscale Capital Grille .
Now ,
Otis says , Darden ’s future growth will come primarily through taking market share .
Even before the financial crisis tightened consumers ’ budgets , he was aware that Americans were dining out less frequently .
Today , the average American has 79 sit - down meals in restaurants per year , 16 % fewer than 15 years ago , according to analyst Harry Balzer of market - research firm NPD Group .
Meanwhile , the number of casual - dining restaurants has grown at roughly twice the rate of population .
Part of Darden ’s strategy is an updated version of the comment cards Bill Darden put on tables at the first Red Lobster .
Over the past year , Darden ’s 22 - member customer - insight team invited 16 million customers across its six chains to answer guest - satisfaction questionnaires .
The company wo n’t disclose results but claims the feedback predicts shifts in traffic at individual locations .
“ In restaurants , consumers are always shopping the competition , which reinforces the need to monitor how you ’re doing , ” says J.J. Buettgen , head of consumer insights .
“ We sample guests every day .
We want to know how their last meal was . ”
advertisement
Given the competitive pressures , says Otis , it ’s more important than ever for the company ’s 180,000 employees to work collaboratively .
Its three major brands should operate as test labs , sharing the best ideas and even personnel , while maintaining their distinctive identities .
Nothing embodies
Otis ’s vision for Darden better than its new headquarters , a $ 100 million state - of - the - art building in Orlando .
More than 1,400 executives and restaurant support staff are scheduled to relocate there in October ; until now , they have worked in 12 buildings spread out over 2 miles .
In the new arrangement , the brands ’ test kitchens will operate side by side , to both practically and symbolically epitomize Otis ’s mandate for sharing .
“ When we talk about working smarter , that means stronger working relationships across different levels of the organization , ” he says .
“ We have a lot of great brand leaders who are n’t taking advantage of each other ’s expertise . ”
In other words , a restaurant tour of brand presidents should be the norm , not an anomaly .
David Pickens , 53 , the president of Olive Garden , knows firsthand how grueling — and how fulfilling — restaurant work can be .
At 17 , he started as a line cook at a Red Lobster in Nashville .
The pace was relentless , the pay was n’t great , and he never saw the people he cooked for .
It was just a job .
Then he became a waiter , interacting with customers , shaping their dining experience , and getting rewarded for it .
He set his sights on becoming a restaurant manager , got the job at 21 , and never looked back , opening and overseeing restaurants for Red Lobster , Olive Garden , and the short - lived China Coast .
“ I went from Nashville to Memphis to St. Louis to Evansville , Indiana , back to Nashville and Memphis and then to Little Rock to Houston to Philadelphia to New York and finally here to Orlando , ” says Pickens .
“ Got all that ? ”
We ’re talking over dinner at an Olive Garden in Orlando .
( “ Chicken marsala ?
Good choice .
That ’s in my top five . ” )
The Olive Garden brand is built around the notion that guests are treated like family , but Pickens knows that is n’t likely to happen unless employees feel like family too .
Employees , he says , need to believe that serving meals and cleaning tables and cooking pasta in a hot kitchen is meaningful .
“ It ’s very difficult for the experience of the guests to exceed the experience of the staff , ” Pickens says .
“ We put the two together . ”

Pickens starts every meeting with Olive Garden senior executives by reading letters from customers and employees — a woman ’s description of her celebration at Olive Garden after having survived cancer ; the reunion of an EMS worker , a 911 operator , and the boy they saved from drowning ; the story of a young woman who dined every Tuesday at the table where her fiancé proposed before he was shipped off to Iraq .
The managers share the letters with their staffs .
Pickens has brought a leather - bound collection of these letters to our dinner .
Between bites of bruschetta , he reads one about Molly , a girl with Down syndrome who enjoyed coming to the restaurant with her family so much that she dreamed of working there .
Pickens ’s voice breaks as he reads the letter .
He shows me a photo of Molly , who got hired as a hostess .
“ A big part of my role is not just to make sure we do well financially but to reinforce what we stand for , ” he says .
“ I want staff to realize we have a brand that people love . ”
Olive Garden promises “ an idealized Italian family meal , whether you ’re Italian or not , ” says Pickens .
When General Mills launched the chain in 1982 , it was an affordable Italian restaurant — a safe choice , nothing surprising .
By the 1990s , it had hundreds of locations , but the menu had grown stale and sales were in decline .
“ It lost its culinary and cultural soul , ” says John Caron , Olive Garden ’s head of marketing .
Darden turned to research .
“ The key consumer insight was that people missed the emotional comfort and connectivity that comes with family , ” says chief operating officer Drew Madsen , then the chain ’s head of marketing .
“ People come to a restaurant for both physical and emotional nourishment .
The physical is the food ; and the emotional is how you feel when you leave . ”
Olive Garden executives began tying everything to this mythical Italian family , adopting the tagline , “ When you ’re here , you ’re family . ”
New locations were designed to suggest Italian farmhouses , with a large family - style table , modeled on one in a Florentine trattoria .
Then executives formed a partnership with actual Italians : Olive Garden ’s Culinary Institute of Tuscany ( CIT ) .
It was a “ stroke of genius , ” says Dennis Lombardi , a veteran food consultant .
Eleven times a year , the company sends 14 top employees , many of whom have never set foot in Italy , to spend a week in an 11th - century village in Tuscany and learn from Sergio and Daniela Zingarelli , a husband and wife who operate a restaurant , winery , and inn .
The couple and other local experts expose the Americans to everything from how olive oil gets pressed to how to layer flavors in a Bolognese sauce .
The Olive Garden employees buy fresh vegetables at a market in Florence and prepare a multicourse Italian meal .
“ It ’s like getting into Harvard , ” says Pickens .
“ It ’s not , of course , but you know what I mean . ”
Since 1999 , some 850 employees have attended CIT ; 80 % of them are still with the company .
There are also what Caron calls “ ideation trips ” to CIT , during which chefs work in local Tuscan restaurants .
They have come back with dozens of ideas that have served to expand and update Olive Garden ’s menu .
Gone are the days of puzzling hybrids like Italian nachos .
Today , many items on the dinner menu carry a CIT logo , designating that they were inspired by a staffer ’s experience in Italy .
advertisement
These experiences — and menu items — provide an authenticity that ’s rare for a chain .
Take risotto , an Italian staple that made its way into Olive Garden only two years ago .
In a pilot program at a small number of restaurants , diners were initially tepid .
As attitudes changed , the test kitchens took on the preparation challenge ; risotto requires 20 minutes to cook , longer than customers are willing to wait .
Chefs eventually found a more expensive variety of rice that could be cooked most of the way through in advance , finished off just before serving , and still retain the desired taste and texture .
Risotto is now part of a CIT - inspired entrée designed to entice more adventurous diners who might not have considered Olive Garden : Chianti - braised short ribs ( minus the bone — a concession to American tastes ) and portobello mushroom risotto .
It ’s Otis ’s favorite .
The restaurant business looks really simple :
Put food on a plate and smile , ” says Christopher Muller , a professor at the Rosen College of Hospitality Management at the University of Central Florida .
“ Yet it ’s an incredibly complex undertaking . ”
Essentially , Darden runs 1,770 just - in - time manufacturing plants that create in minutes a wide range of products selected , consumed , and judged by customers who show up unannounced .
Foodies may scoff , but standardizing the preparation of Chianti - braised short ribs and risotto at hundreds of restaurants by thousands of employees requires innovation and creativity .
And the inventory ca n’t just sit around on the shelf .
Leftover ingredients are refrigerated in day - stamped plastic bags , and anyone using an outdated item is fired on the spot .
Patti Reilly
White , 53 , chief information officer , leads the 170 - person team at Darden that introduces order and predictability to this volatile business .
She ’s another Darden veteran ( 18 years and counting ) , a former government consultant who liked that the company preferred to develop its own software .
In the 1970s , Darden had worked with Burger King to build the first restaurant point - of - sale system ; it tracked sales in real time , eliminating the need for managers to call in the previous day ’s results .
These days , managers rely on Guest Forecasting , another software program developed internally .
“ In every area where technology can be applied , Darden has a considerable lead on other businesses , ” says Muller , who has followed the industry for 20 years .
Darden was computerizing its guest surveys in the 1990s , he says , when other restaurants were relying on comment boxes .
On a Thursday night in April , Erin Harvell , the culinary manager at the Olive Garden in Wayne , New Jersey , reviews the week ’s forecasts in a tiny office off the kitchen .
They ’re within 1 % to 4 % of the actual turnout .
The biggest gap — 630 guests instead of 660 — was on a rainy night .
Guest Forecasting spells out the appropriate staffing and food preparation — how many fettuccine Alfredo orders to expect , how much sauce to make in the morning .
Over the past two years , Darden has reduced unplanned hours by more than 40 % and trimmed excess food costs by 10 % .
“ We do n’t want zero waste , ” says White , “ because we do n’t want to run out of anything on the menu . ”
The goal is no more than 9 % waste , and the system tells each restaurant how it ’s doing .

In the kitchen , cooks are hustling , directed by a program called Meal Pacing that White ’s team introduced across the company two years ago .
Traditionally , an expediter would try to ensure that meals for a given table were ready at the same time so the shrimp entrée did n’t sit at the window getting cold while the 14 - ounce steak was still on the grill .
Meal Pacing displays the optimal work flow for each party on eight screens in the kitchen and monitors each station ’s progress , with color - coded warnings when one falls behind .
The screens also show if the staff is meeting Darden ’s one - minute rule :
Food should arrive at the table within one minute of being ready .
Meal Pacing , says
White , is the ideal restaurant support tool in that it benefits employees as well as guests by taking much of the guesswork out of juggling scores of simultaneous orders .
The restaurants can turn tables faster in peak times , which increases revenue .
And guest - satisfaction scores are up .
Now
White ’s group is addressing wait times .
Other than Capital Grille and Seasons 52 , Darden restaurants do n’t accept reservations , and the crowds can get ridiculously big .
Some guests are willing to wait an hour or more , but Darden knows it ’s losing business when they do .
White is running one pilot program with handheld devices to speed things up ; waiters submit orders and payments at the table , eliminating lag time .
This summer , she ’s launching another project to share wait times across restaurants so that a hostess can steer customers to nearby Darden establishments that are n’t as busy .
The next logical step ,
White says , would be to give customers online access to that information .
After all , as Bill Darden used to say , “ not everybody ’s a gourmet , but everybody can tell time . ”
The next place where Darden ’s drive to collaborate across restaurants could really pay off is LongHorn .
Steak is the second - biggest sector in casual dining , and LongHorn gives Darden a ready - made challenger to No. 1 Outback Steakhouse .
LongHorn generated $ 900 million in revenue over the past 12 months with fewer than 330 restaurants — and only one west of Oklahoma .
The challenge is differentiating the chain in a homogeneous category , which is where president Dave George is hoping Darden ’s brand expertise will help .
George , 53 , is barrel - chested and gregarious , the kind of guy you want manning the backyard grill .
( The appetizer of crispy shrimp with peppers and garlic butter was his idea . )
Before the acquisition , he marveled at Olive Garden ’s 14 - year streak of quarterly same - store sales growth .
“ Every year , even in down times , ” he says .
“ Man , that ’s impressive .
It ’s [ Babe ] Ruthian . ”
Now he ’s privy to its secrets , and he ’s eating them up .
“ I call it the consumer - insight gold mine .
We had insights at Rare , but quite frankly , I think Darden knew more about Rare ’s customers .
Nobody looks at the customer more . ”

LongHorn is still being Dardenized .
After surveying 35,000 consumers about every menu item and every last detail about its restaurants , the chain stripped burgers of unwieldy garnishes and replaced the deer heads on the wall with cowboy sculptures by Frederic Remington .
Guest traffic , which had been trailing the sector , has beaten it in recent quarters .
Otis and George are planning for dozens and then hundreds of new LongHorn restaurants .
Darden , which owns about 60 % of its restaurant sites , is shopping in a buyer ’s market these days .
“ Olive Garden has been reaping the benefits of doing this for years , ” George says .
“ We believe we could be Darden ’s next $ 2 billion brand . ”
And that ’s not based on “ a feel for the business . ”
Otis and his team are crunching the numbers .
“ We ’re not even in half the country , ” he says .
Meanwhile , Darden is pushing ahead with an ambitious plan to revitalize its second - biggest brand .
Red Lobster , which proudly deep - fried for 40 years , is changing the way it cooks .
Not unlike U.S. automakers , the chain failed to adjust to changing market tastes .
In 2004 , quarterly same - store sales dropped for the first time in five years as consumers regarded it as an out - of - date fried - fish shack .
“ You see this all the time in large organizations , ” says industry expert Muller .
“ They tend to suffer from hubris , from past success .
They say , ‘ This is what we ’ve always done . ’ ” Darden has been experimenting with what COO Madsen calls “ stealth health ” since it opened the first Seasons 52 in 2003 .
With 60 wines by the glass , entrées with no more than 475 calories , and desserts so mini they ’re served in shot glasses , the upscale chain is cool enough and healthy enough to attract Tiger Woods , who lives near one of the Orlando locations .
But Otis and Madsen are moving slowly with Seasons , which opened its eighth location only this year .
The risks are much higher with Red Lobster .
“ It is an enormous gamble for a multibillion consumer brand , ” says Muller .
“ They ’re moving away from their core business and chasing new business , and doing it in a down economy . ”
The changes are far deeper than those that worked to revive Olive Garden back in the 1990s .
Last November , chain president Kim Lopdrup and his team launched a menu around wood - fired grilling , which required retraining cooks on how to avoid overcooking seafood at a higher heat while still making the all - important grill stripes .
Red Lobster has spent $ 10 million on the makeover , including new equipment for 690 restaurants .
You ’ll still find fried scallops and popcorn shrimp there , but grilled items make up a third of the menu .
And each location now prints a new fresh - fish menu twice a day .
There ’s no turnaround yet ; sales dipped 4.6 % in the most recent quarter ( less than the industry average ) .
The chain is remodeling restaurants and opening a handful .
And , says David Palmer , an analyst with UBS , it ’s managing costs better .
It ’s also winning new fans .
In March , Men ’s Health dubbed Red Lobster “ the best sit - down chain in America . ”
When a magazine devoted to fitness sings the praises of a restaurant that has been known for all - you - can - eat fried shrimp , things are moving in the right direction .

Continuing that progress presents Darden with its most pressing supply problem .
“ Is there Red Lobster without lobster ? ” is not an existential question for this company .
The North American lobster harvest fluctuates every year , but demand continues to grow .
So two years ago , Darden began sponsoring an experiment to boost the population .
Scientists working with the government of New Brunswick , in Canada , catch pregnant lobsters and care for their offspring until they ’re mature enough to burrow into the ocean ’s sandy bottom , then release the tiny animals into the wild .
Then Darden waits and hopes — for six years or more .
So far , says Bill Herzig , Darden ’s senior vice president of supply - chain innovation , “ it looks like good science . ”
The ability to get high - quality seafood at good prices has given the company a critical edge for years .
Bill Darden himself bypassed wholesalers and created the first national seafood distribution network for a restaurant ; Joe Lee , Otis ’s predecessor , expanded the network to Asia .
These days , Roger Bing , vice president of seafood purchasing , and his team travel the globe buying seafood — again without brokers — in more than 32 countries , often contracting with fish farms for set yield at a set price .
But today , overfishing has made the seafood side of the business increasingly complicated — not just for Red Lobster but for all the Darden brands .
“ It ’s a supply - and - demand issue , ” says Ian Olson , the company ’s director of sustainability , a newly created position .
“ There are 6 billion people on the planet today , and it ’ll be 9 billion by 2050 .
There ’s no better way to say it :
There are only so many fish in the sea . ”
Even before scientists predicted in 2006 that world fish stocks could collapse by 2048 , Darden had begun removing endangered wild fish , such as Chilean sea bass and orange roughy , from its menus and using its clout as one of the world ’s largest buyers to push the industry toward sustainability .
To promote fish farming and to set standards to minimize its environmental impact , Darden cofounded the Global Aquaculture Alliance , a nonprofit trade association that partners with governments and NGOs .
Once GAA agreed on shrimp aquaculture rules , Darden required its suppliers to adopt them , much as Wal - Mart has successfully pushed its vendors to reduce packaging .
“ We recognize our responsibility , ” says Olson .
“ We want to make sure we preserve the ecosystem , but it ’s even better if we enhance it . ”
The demand for other ingredients is bound to rise as well , particularly as China ’s and India ’s growing middle classes consume more .
So the company has begun a plan to transform the supply chain , which it expects will save $ 20 million a year .
It is studying Wal - Mart to “ understand the components of cost ” with its vendors and become a better and more informed negotiator , says senior vice president Barry Moullet , whose group purchases $ 2.4 billion of goods a year from 1,500 suppliers .
It ’s hedging wheat purchases , much the way airlines purchase fuel .
An automated ordering system will eventually replenish a restaurant based on electronic - tagged inventory and guest - traffic forecasts .
“ We ’re developing tools to control risks , ” Moullet says .
“ This should give us an advantage for years to come . ”
At the last stop on the morning tour , the presidents of Olive Garden , Red Lobster , and LongHorn do what you expect restaurant executives to do : chow down .
Over steaks and salads at LongHorn , they talk shop at a back table in the dining room , dissecting things customers do n’t notice .
Red Lobster ’s faux - wood floor tile , which lasts longer than real wood and is less slippery .
Olive Garden ’s stone exterior , which requires less upkeep than painted wood .
LongHorn ’s layout of food - prep and storage spaces , a small improvement that saves valuable time .

“ This was the biggest opportunity yet to see what ’s behind the scenes and how each of us makes it happen , ” LongHorn ’s George tells me after lunch .
When LongHorn joined Darden , he says , “ I thought this bigger company with tens of thousands more employees and more restaurants than Rare would be less connected .
But that ’s untrue . ”
Many major brand leaders would die for the opportunity to consult with people who run businesses of similar scale and wrestle with the same issues on a daily basis .
But the teams at T.G.I. Friday ’s and Applebee ’s ca n’t get together any more than those at Coke and Pepsi can .
That is one of Darden ’s unique strengths , having several brands under the same roof — and in adjacent offices and R&D kitchens at the new Orlando headquarters .
The key is finding the best mix of independence and collaboration .
All of Darden ’s chains may use the same technology to pace their cooking and predict their dinner traffic , and they may serve shrimp from the same
Thai fish farm , but each brand needs to remain distinctive .
“ It ’s all about balance , ” says COO Madsen .
“ There ’s an art and science to this . ”
Efficiency and soul .
Innovation and continuity .
Darden wants it both ways .
Think of it this way : Red Lobster may be serving more grilled salmon and less fried flounder .
But no one is messing with the cheese biscuits .

The year 2014 was an important one for the friends , family and fans of America ’s infamous 37th president , who died 20 years ago this April .
August 8th marked the 40 - year anniversary of Nixon ’s resignation , followed by his dramatic exit from office the following day .
It was the beginning of a long journey back into America ’s good graces , a process that continues to this day .
This country and the entire world have changed a lot since his death , and time has rendered a different judgment of Nixon than the one rendered in his lifetime , as old information combines with new developments to clarify old perceptions .
These anniversaries have triggered a small flood of Nixonalia into the marketplace , and each project wrestles with a central problem : Richard Nixon is not a man who can be spoken of objectively .
The nature of his work forces all those who study it to make their own decision at so many different points .
Let ’s keep it real :
His enemies called him “ Tricky Dick ” , and even his allies would concede how utterly appropriate the nickname was — more so than maybe any president since Andrew Jackson , aka “ Old Hickory ” .
HBO released “ Nixon : In His Own Words ” , an excellent 75 - minute mashup of audio clips and video footage spanning the scope of his career .
It ’s an ideal introduction to one of the great character studies of the entire 20th century .
Richard Milhous
Nixon cut one of the most unique swaths through our nation ’s political history , and that influence persists today , a generation after he took leave of this dimension .
As President Obama lurches toward the anticlimactic end of his administration , recent scandals have proven that , despite whatever early pretensions he may have had to the legacy of JFK , history will regard him as the closest thing we ’ve had to Nixon since Nixon himself — a cold - blooded pragmatist , driven by inner tensions that he can hardly articulate .
Each of the three books tends to center on specific aspects of Nixon ’s story , and will be of varying appeal , depending on the reader ’s views of the subject .
Two of the authors can be considered partisans : Buchanan and Stone were both recruited and trained in part by Nixon himself , and both went on to work for Reagan , as well .
But just as Nixon ’s worst enemies would allow for the man ’s obvious ability , his key supporters will readily own up to his major flaws — and , seen in its totality , the Nixon Legacy seems like something that could have never gone any differently than it did .
Although Nixon himself would later own up to his many mistakes , it is unlikely that , given the opportunity , he would have never corrected them , because Richard Nixon was , by all accounts , pathologically incapable of admitting weakness .
The whole debacle involving the infamous “ Nixon Tapes ” is a case in point .
Even as his presidency was lurching , slowly and painfully toward its inevitable conclusion , he retained the power to save his presidency by simply burning the tapes .
Of course , veteran GOP operative Roger Stone , who started working for Nixon while barely out of his teens , posits that Nixon was set up for scandal by his own underlings , through a combination of incompetence and outright corruption , and that even he may not have known exactly what was up until the end .
By the time his resignation was a fait accompli , the old man ( who aged prematurely , like they all do ) had already pivoted into plotting his post - presidency career .
Stone argues that the affable ax - man Gerald Ford was selected to replace Spiro Agnew with a mind toward the pardon that he would eventually grant the fallen Nixon ; he further argues that Nixon secured that pardon essentially through blackmail — specifically , his knowledge of Ford ’s crucial role in whitewashing what became the Warren Commission Report .
And that is the axis around which his narrative rotates .
Only in recent years has it become common knowledge that many of the people closest to the situation — Bobby Kennedy , Jackie Kennedy , Ted Kennedy , Lyndon Johnson , Richard Nixon , and even Fidel Castro — had all privately admitted extreme skepticism of the commission ’s findings .
Note that the latter three frequently turn up in conspiracy theories related to the real architects of the assassination ; for what it ’s worth , Stone fixes the blame squarely on LBJ , as he wrote in his previous book , and one may assume that his views were influenced heavily by Nixon ’s own .
During his presidency , Nixon was known for making frequent references to “ the Bay of Pigs situation ” , particularly as the Watergate investigation began to pick up steam .
Although he never spoke to the point directly , it was always widely believed that the phrase was a reference to the murder of JFK , but Stone makes this theory explicit :
In his telling , Nixon as Vice - President was deputized by Eisenhower to plot the removal of Fidel Castro , in conjunction with the CIA and members of the mafia who ’d been alienated by the Cuban regime .
This effort , called “ Operation 40 ” , led directly to the ridiculous failed assassination plots run by Bobby Kennedy under his brother , which then led directly to the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion , which many ( including Stone ) led directly to the tragedy in Dallas in November 1963 .
( Add Stone ’s name , also , to the list of writers who have alleged that other assassination plots had been in the works prior to November 1963 . )
What made all this relevant to Nixon ’s interests is that A ) JFK was , at one point , a friend of his , and , having survived attempts on his own life over the years , he was deeply disturbed by the idea of any president being killed ; and B ) Nixon knew that several of the people thought to be involved in the murder plot — including people like Frank Sturgis , Felix Rodriguez , Santo Trafficante , Johnny Roselli and the infamous E. Howard Hunt , who confessed membership in the conspiracy shortly before his own death — were veterans of Nixon ’s Operation 40 , and as such he knew he could ’ve been implicated in the conspiracy himself , even though he presumably was not .
The fact that Hunt and Sturgis both went on to be part of the original Watergate burglary team is a historical anomaly that , in Stone ’s telling , led directly to the Plumbers ’ apparent failure , and the end of their boss ’ tenure .
Stone ’s book “ Nixon ’s Secrets ” is probably the most must - read of the three books .
It ’s loaded with insider dirt , rendered by an author whose dirty - tricks credentials are rock - solid .
Stone ’s book is kind of a throwback to this writer ’s personal favorite Nixon book , Anthony Summers ’ infamous biography The Arrogance of Power : The Secret World of Richard Nixon ( 2000 ) , a tome crafted and marketed as an epic takedown that , as so often with aspects of Nixon ’s blowback , backfired .
In a country that glorifies gangsters and anti-heroes of all stripes , it makes perfect sense that Richard Nixon is arguably more popular now that he was at any point in his life , and his fan - base is built heavily around people who were n’t even alive during his presidency .
Their views of that era are colored by their living memory of all the ( for lack of a better word ) shenanigans that have transpired in the 40 years since Nixon ’s resignation : the Iran hostage crisis , Reagan getting shot , Iran - Contra , Whitewater , Lewinsky , the Drug War , the Patriot Act , two attacks on the World Trade Center , two Iraq wars and countless skirmishes and incidents elsewhere , leading up to things like the NSA and TSA today .
It is frankly hypocritical for Americans to pretend that the 1970s elite consensus regarding Nixon remains valid in today ’s world , given the men we elected to succeed him as president .
At least half of those six may have eclipsed Nixon , in terms of pure ruthlessness , and maybe all of them .
For today ’s GOP to attack President Obama for using Nixonian tactics — which he does , no doubt — creates the kind of bitter , cynical historical irony that only Nixon could appreciate .
And when one considers that the three most successful presidents since Nixon ( Reagan , Clinton , Obama ) , all basically came up from nothing , with fathers who were either absent or insufficient , and all grew up with chips on their shoulders that they carried into the White House with them , along with the attendant defense mechanisms , creating a psychological component that directly influenced their own presidencies ( for better or for worse ) it could well be argued that we are still living in the Age of Nixon , because they all worked variations on a theme that he established in the larger narrative of the presidency as an institution .
The only difference between he and them is that ( as every Nixon scholar seems to agree )
Nixon was never able to check his darker impulses , which eventually consumed him .
But then again , Nixon never had Nixon ’s example to draw upon .
As time has passed , and the principals on all sides have grown older , passed on and left their ( always selective ) memories behind , Nixon ’s controversial run has come to be seen in a broader context .
This process was initiated by Nixon himself during the David Frost interviews in 1977 , his Oxford Union gig in 1978 and the publication of his memoirs that same year .
While Nixon did not invent the concept of “ revisionist history ” , he was without question the all - time master of its use in American politics , and the broader culture .
It ’s hard to think of another public figure in our nation ’s history whose posthumous reputation is more different than their reputation in life , and certainly not in a positive way .
Again , this was probably Nixon ’s plan all along .
Only he could have understood what honest observers would now concede : that the historical value of keeping the White House Tapes would transcend the disastrous short - term effect that it had on his presidency .
Even after he resigned he left behind the framework for what would become a winning coalition for Reagan and Bush that later gave his party 12 more years of power — or 20 , if one counts George W. Bush , a very different type of Republican , no doubt .
Buchanan ’s book goes into great detail on the process of triangulating between two parties that were both in transitional phases ; he shows how , at all points in the 1960s , Nixon was working toward an end - game that most of his peers were unable to figure out until it was basically over .
Nixon was consistently ahead of the curve when it came to almost everything , except his own career ; he consistently sacrificed his short - term interests in favor of long - term legacy concerns , culminating with the fateful and fatal decision not to destroy his tapes , and it ’s only now , long after his death , that we can appreciate that calculation
Time has leveled a sort of equilibrium to Nixon ’s legacy , in that casual observers will remember him mostly for perceived misdeeds that history has given context to , in not exactly validation .
On matters like Alger Hiss , the escalation of war in Indochina , the Pentagon Papers and even the Oval Office tapes themselves , time has led more people to believe Nixon simply made the least - disastrous choice in a number of lose - lose situations that were often not of his doing .
The present era of global chaos makes some nostalgic for the man who engaged Communists in China and Russia , reached out to Arab moderates while strengthening America ’s relationship with Israel and managed to pass a wave of progressive social policies while ratcheting up the war on drugs .
Nixon had a special kind of hustle that we will likely never see again on any level of the business , and that in my opinion is to our permanent disadvantage .
Hillary Clinton ( who might not have met her husband , at least not have met her husband , had the two young rising Democratic stars not shared a common enemy in Nixon , but that ’s another story ) once defined the difference between politicians and statesmen thusly :
A politician thinks of the next election , while a statesman thinks of the next generation .
Nixon was both , in spades , but 40 years after his final disgrace , more and more Americans are coming to recognize that his disgrace was not really not that disgraceful after all .
Swift notes that Pat Nixon always suspected that her husband ’s undoing may have related to willful shenanigans by members of the Watergate burglary team acting at cross-purposes — a hypothesis that Stone makes extensive effort to verify in Nixon ’s Secrets .
He implicates Alexander Butterfield , who installed Nixon ’s taping system and then revealed its existence to Congress — unprovoked , in his telling — while also calling out the incompetence of key functionaries like Bob Haldeman , John Erlichmann and John Mitchell , who were all key to Nixon ’s political rebirth but whose personal flaws contributed to their boss ’ undoing , and their own eventual imprisonment .
Stone reserves special venom for John Dean , whom he places at the center of a conspiracy to undermine the president for self - serving ends , and whose own multiple versions of the story are painstaking elucidated .
Their feud has only burned hotter since the book ’s release ; it would make an interesting debate .
Stone also hits Alexander Haig , while alleging that he was among the sources for former Navy intelligence operative Bob Woodward , whose seminal reporting on the scandal was , in Stone ’s telling , largely specious , if not transparently false .
He flatly rejects the idea of Mark Felt being Deep Throat , suggesting the character was merely a composite of several people .
Stone has obviously given a lot of thought to Watergate and related matters , and his views are useful addendums to the established narrative .
( Stone and Dean had a brief , but vitriolic verbal battle at the Austin Book Festival ; their dispute may ultimately have to be settled in court . )
Stone ’s next book , due later this year , focuses on the Clintons , and promises to be potentially even more explosive than Nixon ’s Secrets .
And with a potential run for US Senate in the works for 2016 , with Hillary Clinton seeking the presidency in the same year , there is no reason for him to hold anything back , and no reason to think he ’d even consider it .
Because , after all , he is a Nixon man .
The United States Senate yesterday demanded that President Bush provide a coherent Iraq strategy and passed an amendment calling for “ changes to the policy of the United States on Iraq and to require reports on certain matters relating to Iraq . "
" It is the sense of the Senate that , in order to succeed in Iraq the Administration needs to explain to Congress and the American people its strategy for the successful completion of the mission in Iraq , " read the text of S. Amdt.
2518 , which passed by a bipartisan vote of 79- 19
“ It 's not often you see in our legislative halls here in Washington votes of no confidence on an administration , " said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid after the vote .
" Today you saw a vote of no confidence in the Bush administration 's policy on Iraq .
Democrats and Republicans acknowledged that staying the course is not the way to go .
And , therefore , this is a vote of no confidence on the Bush administration policy in Iraq . ”
The amendment further says that the president should issue a report on U.S. policy and military operations in Iraq " ... not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act , and every three months thereafter until all United States combat brigades have redeployed from Iraq . "
The GOP - controlled Senate had earlier defeated a more strongly - worded Democratic bill with the same intent – the big difference being that the Democratic amendment would have required Bush to explain his administration 's actions , while the GOP - sponsored measure simply calls for such an explanation .
Even so , the amendment represents a significant rebuke to the Bush administration and a near - unanimous call for less excuses and more real answers .
Republican senators are clearly feeling the pressure of severely waning public support for the war and looming mid-term elections that will have all of the House and a third of the Senate up for re-election .
But the thing that Republicans found most unpalatable in the Democratic bill was the paragraph calling for the president to offer a plan for a phased withdrawal of the 150,000 plus U.S. troops now in Iraq .
That would have taken way too much guts on the part of the average Bush - controlled GOP senator .
But the message to Bush is still clear , according to Harry Reid : " The no-plan , no - end approach is no longer acceptable . "
Senator Chuck Hagel ( R - NE ) called the vote a " significant event " and said that , despite the defeat of the Democratic bill , the Bush administration should begin drawing down troop strength in Iraq next year .
He also took the time to scold Bush for his ongoing contention that anyone who disagrees with the administration 's Iraq approach is hurting troop morale and " comforting the enemy . "
" The Bush administration must understand that each American has a right to question our policies in Iraq and elsewhere , and should not be demonized or condemned for disagreeing with them , " Hagel said in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations .
" Suggesting that to challenge and criticize policy is undermining and hurting our troops is not democratic , nor what this country has stood for over 200 years . "
