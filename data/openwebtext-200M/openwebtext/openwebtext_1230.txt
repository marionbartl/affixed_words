Abstract
Objective :
To assess the effect of chewing a piece of 2 mg nicotine gum on systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) and pulse rate ( PR ) .
Methodology : Blood pressure and pulse rate were measured on 176 abstinent smokers , at two time points ; before ( at 0 min ) and after nicotine gum administration ( at 120 min ) .
Results :
The baseline SBP was 106.3 ± 13.6 mmHg ( range 75.0 – 140.0 ) and baseline DBP was 69.6 ± 9.4 mmHg ( range 50.0 – 100.0 ) .
Three subjects ( two female ex-smokers aged 62 years and one male current smoker aged 28 years ) had high DBP above 90 mmHg .
The baseline PR was 70.0 ± 9.0 beats / min ( range 46.0 –99.0 ) .
At two hours after chewing nicotine gum , there was no change in SBP ( 106.3 ± 13.1 mmHg at 120 min ( t 174 = 0.11 , p=0.9 ) ) but there was a significant increase in DBP ( 71.7 ± 9.9 mmHg at 120 min ( t 174 = - 2.9 , p=0.004 ) ) , and a significant reduction in PR ( 68.4 ± 10.4 beats / min at 120 min ( t 175 = 2.13 , p<0.001 ) ) .
Conclusion :
The variable effect of nicotine gum at different time points have important implications on the usefulness of nicotine gum as nicotine replacement therapy , in particular on individuals with hypertension or cardiac diseases .
Even for experience designers , building email newsletters is n't easy .
You receive a lovely looking design , and you crack on with the development .
Unfortunately , it just does n't work as it should in every email clients .
Styles do n't display , images are n't visible , etc .
This is where these twenty best practices come in handy .
1 : Keep the Design Simple
Emails are not like complex website designs ; they should be nicely designed , but somewhat basic .
Try basing your designs on a main header image followed by the main content .
The cleaner the design , the easier it will be to code , and the less chance of any abnormalities happening between various browsers and email clients .
2 : Use Tables
Email clients live in the past , so all emails must be built using tables for layout .
Some CSS styling can be used , but we will discuss this later .
Not Accepted
Accepted
3 : Have Web Browsers at the Ready
Make sure you have as many web browsers as possible available to you .
Who knows who will view your email , and what he or she will be using to view it !
At the very least , use these :
Internet Explorer 6
Internet Explorer 7
Internet Explorer 8
Mozilla Firefox 3
Apple Safari 3
Google Chrome
4 : Sign Up for all the Major Email Clients
Sign up for as many email accounts as you can think of .
Below is a list of email clients to get you started :
Google Mail ( http://mail.google.com)
Hotmail / Live Mail ( http://www.hotmail.com)
Yahoo Mail ( http://mail.yahoo.com)
AOL Mail ( http://webmail.aol.com)
Please note that they 're are other , more convenient services that can be used instead ; however , many of these charge monthly fees .
For more information , review Litmusapp .
5 : Use Inline Styles
If this were the website world , every developer on the planet would say , " do not use inline styles , create a class for it " .
Unfortunately , in an email , this is not possible , as the email clients will strip them out , and we do n't want that .
So if anything needs to be styled , use inline styles .
Elements like font type and size can be used within the < table > tag , but individual styles should be placed on < td >'s .
6 : Give all Images Alt Tags
This is a very important step to take , but is often forgotten by many .
Styling the < td > for which images are in , with font types , size and color , will allow for your email to degrade gracefully when images are off by default .
No Alt Tags
Alt Tags
7 : Do not Set Widths or Heights to Images
Again , this is a further step to take in order for a lovely gracefully degraded email .
If images are off by default , there dimensions will be present , leaving a lot of unnecessary white space throughout .
8 : Wrap the Email in a 100 % Width Table
Email clients only take the code within the body tags , not the body tags themselves .
In order to use a background color , you must create a 100 % width table to " fake " the background effect .
9 : No Wider than 600px
Many people do n't actually open their email ; they instead view them in the preview panel .
On average the smallest preview panel is around 600 px , so always design your emails accordingly , unless you do n't want your full email viewable in the preview panel , of course .
10 : Link Styling
Do n't forget to style the < a > tag .
This will overwrite the email client 's standard link tags .
11 : Try not to Nest Tables
Apart from the 100 % width wrap table , you should try your best not to nest additional tables .
This is easily avoidable ; use the stacking system instead .
This allows for a much easier , controllable email .
Avoid
Use
12 : Avoid Background Images
Stick to block colors rather than images for the backgrounds for your text ; only use funky gradients , images , etc. when no text is involved .
13 : Borders do n't Work
Within emails , we do n't have much room for browser or email clients specific fixes , so when we have borders that can either sit outside or inside the < td > or be included or excluded from the < td > width , there 's not much we can do .
The fix ?
Drop two extra < td >'s to either side of the main < td > , and set the background color in each one .
This will again " fake " the look of a border and work in all browsers and email clients .
Wo n't Work
Will Work
14 : Hotmail Bug Fixes
Over the past couple of years , Microsoft has vastly improved the Hotmail / Live service .
But ... one huge bug you will come across is the strange padding added to all images .
Why do they do this ?
Who knows ?
All I know is , there is a wonderfully easy fix .
On every image tag , simply add display : block , as shown above .
15 : Encode All Characters
Although we do n't technically have to encode characters , it 's best we do .
When viewing emails in various email clients , we cannot guarantee the charset every website is using , so encoding characters allows us to be certain that all characters are being displayed as they should .
May Work
Will Definitely Work
16 : JavaScript = Junk Email
You cannot , unfortunately , include any type of JavaScript .
So no fancy pop-ups or auto - scrolling emails please !
If you do decide to include it anyway , your email may be sent to the junk folder .
Email clients will see you as a threat .
And this is obviously not good .
So please stick to plain old HTML .
17 : Give the User a Way Out
When sending general newsletters to various clients / customers , although you have a lovely designed and developed email , that user may not want your email ( hard to take , I know ) .
Always allow them a way out , by adding an unsubscribe link to the bottom of the email , like so :
If you would like to unsubscribe from this newsletter , simply click here
18 : Users Want Options
Some users may be utilizing a very basic email client - maybe they 're checking there webmail at work or on their phones .
Images and complex designs may not be best for these types of clients , .
Consider , at the top of the email newsletter , having a link which points to the email on a web server somewhere , so the user can view the email in all its glory .
Cannot view this email ?
View it here
19 : Use a spacer.gif
Some browsers ( Internet Explorer ) , do n't get on with empty < td >'s .
Even if the < td > is set to 10 px in width .
IE will ignore this and set it to 0 .
The fix is to add a transparent GIF , and set this to 10 px wide .
This then provides you with something to put within the < td > , thus fixing IE 's issues with having empty < td >'s .
Wo n't Work
Will Work
20 : Send Tests
This is the most important aspect of email design ; sending test emails allows you to view them in all browsers and email clients , looking for any bugs and odd variations .
I have setup a way to allow me to send test , by all means , use mine !
Username : test
Password : nettuts
For more comprehensive testing , use a service like CampaignMonitor or LitmusApp .

In 1966 , the British Museum acquired a curious object of convoluted provenance and sinister reputation .
It is a black disc of highly polished stone , 1.3 cm thick and 18.9 cm in diameter , with a small handle - like protrusion to one side , pierced with a tiny hole .
The thing is plainly a mirror of sorts , small enough to be held in the hand , and carved – so the museum established , after centuries of confusion – from obsidian : the glassy stone from which the Aztecs fashioned their ritual implements .
It is usually exhibited alongside a desiccated and much - repaired flat leather case to which are attached two labels .
The first , dating from 1842 , when the " wondrous speculum " was sold at auction , simply says " Lot 48 " .
The second inscription is from the late 18th century , and likely quickens the hearts of serious scholars and New Age occultists alike : " The Black Stone into which Dr Dee used to call his spirits . "
The handwriting belongs to its former owner , Horace Walpole .
The politician and collector seems to have chanced upon the enigmatic slab ( which he thought was made of marble ) in the collection of Lord Frederic Campbell , who was at a loss to say just what it was for .
But Walpole was well apprised of the life of John Dee , the Elizabethan astronomer and conjurer who fell in and out of favour with the Queen , and was said to have communed regularly with the angels Gabriel and Raphael .
Indeed , an excitable legend concerning his ink - black mirror or " scrying stone " states that it was given to him by one of these angelic interlocutors .
The more plausible story has it that Dee bought the stone from a member of the Spanish court , and that it is an Aztec artefact of the late middle ages .
Dee 's black mirror does not appear in The Dark Monarch , the current show at Tate St Ives that posits hitherto unheeded links between " magic and modernity " in British art of the past century or so .
It has in fact been restored to its historical and cultural context as part of the British Museum 's Moctezuma exhibition .
But avatars of the mysterious and depthless stone are everywhere in the St Ives show , which seems , like the magician himself , to be in thrall to the spirited seductions of gleaming black objects and darkly reflective planes .
It 's not simply a dusky Gothicism that seizes on artists as diverse as Barbara Hepworth and Derek Jarman , Graham Sutherland and Cerith Wyn Evans .
Nor does the show merely return us to the familiar gloom and swirl of fin - de - siècle mysticism .
Instead , it sets up a relay between modern and contemporary art and much older strains of occult thought .
The black mirror ( which historically fascinated artist and magus in equal measure ) is actually and allegorically a portal between the most arcane practices and the mainstream of British painting and sculpture .
As an occult accoutrement , the black mirror has a venerable history .
The belief that spirits could be summoned in a dark glass or smooth stone goes back at least as far as Euclid , who writes of images appearing in the space between the viewer and the magic surface into which he peers .
By the 14th century , scrying with a black stone or a convex glass mirror was widely held to be a common practice among witches .
( In fact , by an odd semantic sleight , the object itself came to be known as " the witch " . )
So tenacious was the fear of such unholy rituals that in 1318 Pope John XXII published a letter decrying catoptromancy or divination by mirrors , and eight years later issued a bull , Super illius specula , that excommunicated all those engaging in the idolatrous art .
During seances in the 16th century , demons were said to have been summoned from the depths of mirrors , and as late as the 18th century it seems the church was still pursuing adepts of the dark glass : an account from 1712 describes the arrest of a catoptromancer at the School of Theology in Paris .
There is something deeply seductive about the image of a pristine surface that frames unspeakable possibilities , so it is not surprising that a small literary canon has grown around the motif of the black mirror .
In the extremely eccentric 15th - century Italian dream narrative Hypnerotomachia Poliphili , the protagonist finds himself in an avenue whose marble walls have been inlaid with two perfect circles of jet , so that he is mirrored to infinity .
Five centuries later , Truman Capote 's short story " Music for Chameleons " seems to unfold in the depths of a black mirror , the " senseless flickerings " of which recall an untuned television .
And in his fatally recursive tale " The Mirror of Ink " , Jorge Luis Borges makes a black mirror – or rather its common variant , a small pool of ink poured into the hand – the instrument of a terrible revenge .
In such stories , the black surface seems to function as a mise - en - abyme , swallowing among endless reflections those who dare to face it .
It 's perhaps this aspect of self - reference that several of the artists in The Dark Monarch respond to , alongside the more elemental , occult properties of the black mirror .
Jeremy Millar 's Assemblage I is an expanded replica of a Sol LeWitt sculpture from the mid-1970s ( somewhat resembling a modular display unit ) to which have been added certain ritual elements , including an obsidian disc and a hefty clump of fragments of the same material .
The self - involved stones seem to leach energy from the surrounding structure , biding their time before deploying their revelatory power .
Simon Periton 's Mint Snoopier is a convex , oval mirror , elaborately patterned in silver and black and placed ominously above a gallery door .
And Eva Rothshchild 's sculpture Actualisation – which consists of two glass globes : one black , the other transparent – summons the most familiar image of fairground crystallomancy and at the same time essays an elegant reflection on what is seen and unseen , manifest and occulted .
Other works in the show , less obviously rapt before the mythology of the black mirror as such , nonetheless seem to know something about the visual and metaphoric properties of dark reflective surfaces .
Cerith Wyn Evans exhibits a series of inky monochrome photographs , taken by his father , of tree segments that look like the faces of watchful spirits .
Gillian Carnegie 's painting Black Square turns Kasimir Malevich 's modernist icon of the same title into a thickly layered and unsettling treescape .
In the hands of these artists , shiny black surfaces suggest not metaphysical voids but darkening landscapes – a sort of homely , rural occultism surmised in the slick black and twilit colours of Clare Woods 's painting Daddy Witch .
This intimacy of magic and landscape art is not all that surprising ; the black mirror has played a crucial , though now mostly occluded , role in the development of landscape painting in the past two and half centuries , especially in Britain .
Tinted glass mirrors , flat or convex , were part of the paraphernalia of the picturesque : that 18th - century mode of seeing which sought to domesticate the more unruly vistas of the natural sublime .
Following the example of Claude Lorrain , who was said to have employed tinted mirrors when preparing his paintings , tourists and amateur artists were encouraged , for example , to turn their backs on views of the Lake District and gaze into their " Claude glasses " : hand - held black mirrors that now seem like precursors of the digital camera 's ubiquitous screen .
By the end of the 18th century , the Claude glass had become a satirical shorthand for the facile touristic gaze .
" The effect is unspeakably interesting ! " gushes a sightseer in The Lakers , James Plumptre 's comic opera of 1798 – but its dark entrapment of the natural world still resonated for Romantic poets .
Coleridge wrote of a nature " miniatured on the mind of the beholder , as a landscape on a convex mirror " , Wordsworth of the poetic desire to throw over natural objects " a certain colouring of imagination " .
( By contrast , John Ruskin later railed against the employment of the black mirror , calling it " one of the most pestilent inventions for falsifying nature and degrading art which was ever put into an artist 's hand " . )
The optical and imaginative , if not occult , fascinations of the device survived into the 20th century in such works as Matisse 's Anemones with a Black Mirror ( 1919 ) and Gerhard Richter 's many large mirror paintings .
The Dark Monarch seems to attest to another , peculiarly British , afterlife of the images summoned in the black mirror : one that embodies both occult and art - historical tendencies .
The Neo-Romantic painters of the mid-20th century were invested alike in landscape as inspirited territory and object of aesthetic remaking .
Paintings by Bryan Wynter and Karl Weschke show a natural world ominously palled in black .
Graham Sutherland 's Dark Hill and Black Landscape ( both from 1940 ) are at once – as co-curator Michael Bracewell puts it – " pictorial excursions into the consciousness of time and place , tinged by dark prophecy " , and reminders of the technologically enhanced Romantic vision of a century and a half before .
Sutherland was well acquainted with the mechanics of both ways of seeing : a photograph from 1946 shows him examining his Crucifixion ( at St Matthew 's Church , Northampton ) in a hand - held black mirror .
Among the postwar inheritors of the Neo-Romantic vision was Derek Jarman , whose Super - 8 films of the 1970s – notably Journey to Avebury , from 1971 – show him keenly attuned to the spectral remnants of a ritualised English landscape .
The Dark Monarch includes Jarman 's 1975 film Sulphur – from his series The Art of Mirrors – in which elegant and sinister black - clad figures disport themselves in various ritual attitudes , periodically shining a circular mirror straight at the camera so that it casts everything else into shadow .
Jarman was fascinated by Dee ; around the time he made Sulphur , he completed a screenplay based on the magician 's life , and aspects of this unmade film crept into Jubilee , The Tempest and The Angelic Conversations .
Dee 's mysterious rituals with the black mirror – an object , wrote Capote , with a " frivolous power " – were for Jarman an abiding image of the alchemy of film - making .
There is , of course , much else to see in The Dark Monarch – an exhibition of its considerable generic and historical scope is not reducible to the adventures of one motif , no matter how seductive .
It 's an exhibition embedded , for example , in the artistic heritage and milieu of St Ives itself – the title of the show is taken from Sven Berlin 's notorious roman à clef of 1962 .
And it is touched in numerous places by the rough magic of Cornwall .
But among its most powerful aspects is the way it reminds us of the darkling strain in familiar artists and works : Barbara Hepworth 's Group of Three Magic Stones , Paul Nash 's monstrous landscape photographs , a sinister stone mask by Henry Moore .
A black seam runs though the show , made of pure obsidian .
The Dark Monarch : Magic & Modernity in British Art is at Tate St Ives until 10 January 2010 .
Here we are on the verge of a momentous announcement – President Obama ’s unveiling of his " comprehensive plan " for escalating the war in Afghanistan – and where is the so - called antiwar movement ?
Missing in action , as this news report reveals :
“ ‘ There ’s this trust that he ’s going to fix it all , ’ said Shara Esbenshade , 19 , a sophomore at Stanford University and member of Stanford Says No To War .
She says there are no antiwar marches on her campus , only vigils , educational events , and occasional protests against Condoleezza Rice , who has returned to Stanford after serving as George W. Bush ’s secretary of state .
‘ We ’d really like to start doing more about Afghanistan , ’ she added .
‘ But students here rising up ?
I really do n’t see that happening . ’"
No need to ask who " he " is : it ’s the Dear Leader , of course , the Big O : He Who Can Fix Anything .
Well , I ’ve got some really , really bad news for you , Shara , honey : he is getting ready to send somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 more troops to the Afghan front , and not only that , but he ’s come up with a brand - new strategy , one that means they ’ll be sending a lot more troops that way pretty damned soon .
What it boils down to is this : saying no to war entails saying no to Obama – and I have the distinct feeling that , forced to make a choice between their ostensibly antiwar sentiments and their devotion to the Dear Leader , Shara and her privileged , politically correct friends will reflexively choose the latter .
Indeed , they already have , which is why Stanford Says No to War is lazing around , only stirring itself when a Republican rolls into view .
But for how much longer can they rank on Condi Rice , who may indeed be a reprehensible warmonger but has , since the end of her tenure at State , been rendered relatively harmless ?
Oh , but it ’s too easy to go after a clueless 19 - year - old : after all , why should it fall on Shara ’s fragile shoulders to challenge the dominant political orthodoxy ?
Why blame her for the unlikelihood of her fellow students " rising up " anytime soon ?
Maybe I ’m wrong , but it seems Ms. Esbenshade and her confreres are generally on the Left , and what ’s left of the Left has a political conflict of interest when it comes to opposing U.S. military intervention overseas , as the above - cited article makes all too sadly clear :
" Mounting economic and academic pressures on today ’s youth , intimidation by authorities , online distractions , and conflicted views about the ‘ good ’ war in Afghanistan , not to mention other causes such as health care and slashed school budgets clawing for attention , have conspired to snuff out antiwar activism on campus , experts and students say .
" They acknowledge , too , that U.S. President Barack Obama has paradoxically hampered the movement because many of the largely leftist protest groups have n’t wanted to openly oppose him so early in his first term . "
Intimidation by authorities ?
Really ?
Will their professors give them a failing grade if they go out in the streets with signs proclaiming " Stop Obama ’s War " ?
You ’d think we were living in China , where all expressions of dissent are illegal and an unauthorized demonstration can earn you a free trip to the gulag .
Yet even if there were indeed some real intimidation , then would n’t that in itself provoke a wave of defiant protest – as it has , say , in Iran ?
No , this is excuse - making : the piece is closer to the truth with its invocation of " the good war " as a phrase that meaningfully relates to Afghanistan .
As we begin to hear more and more about the potential goodness of this war – e.g. , from feminists , such as Code Pink , who have now decided that withdrawal from Afghanistan would not be good for the cause of equal pay for equal work – we begin to hear more about the war ’s potential usefulness in advancing the Obamaite big - government agenda .
Here ‘s Matt Yglesias , over at the Center for American Progress – the epicenter of Obama worship – musing over the prospect of a " war surtax " :
" I ’d like to see Paul Krugman or other advocates of more stimulus weigh - in on whether debt - financed escalation of military effort would have a beneficial impact on the labor market situation .
I think it ’s deplorable that U.S. political culture tends to regard military - related appropriations as exempt from normal budgetary considerations , but it ’s possible that that ’s a loophole worth taking advantage of in this case .
All those new weapons purchases the Pentagon does n’t want to estimate are manufacturing jobs for someone , right ?
Obviously this should n’t the primary consideration in dictating military strategy , but I do think a comprehensive look at the macroeconomic impact of defense policy choices – both the costs and benefits of hugely expensively military undertakings – is a necessary element of the strategic consideration . "
How to balance the costs of the Afghan war – the thousands of Afghan and American lives lost , the horrific destruction wreaked on Afghan society , the screams of the horribly wounded , and the tears of mourners – against what Yglesias and his fellow Keynesians imagine will be the " benefits " of spending all that government moolah and doling it out to their political allies and corporate patrons ?
These soulless policy wonks may believe this kind of calculus has no moral import , but for the rest of the human race the profoundly immoral and frankly repulsive nature of this arithmetical exercise is readily apparent .
Yglesias himself has criticized our policy in Afghanistan and is skeptical of plans to escalate the conflict , yet he unhesitatingly unpacks the doctrine of military Keynesianism in order to advance his big - government agenda .
He may think this is harmless , but as John T. Flynn presciently pointed out as World War II was ending :
" The great and glamorous industry is here – the industry of militarism .
And when the war is ended the country is going to be asked if it seriously wishes to demobilize an industry that can employ so many men , create so much national income when the nation is faced with the probability of vast unemployment in industry .
All the well - known arguments , used so long and so successfully in Europe … will be dusted off – America with her high purposes of world regeneration must have the power to back up her magnificent ideals ; America cannot afford to grow soft , and the Army and Navy must be continued on a vast scale to toughen the moral and physical sinews of our youth ; America dare not live in a world of gangsters and aggressors without keeping her full power mustered … and above and below and all around these sentiments will be the sinister allurement of the perpetuation of the great industry which can never know a depression because it will have but one customer – the American government to whose pocket there is no bottom . "
The economic benefits Yglesias points to , however , come with some strings attached .
As Flynn accurately predicted :
" Embarked … upon a career of militarism , we shall , like every other country , have to find the means when the war ends of obtaining the consent of the people to the burdens that go along with the blessings it confers upon its favored groups and regions .
Powerful resistance to it will always be active , and the effective means of combating this resistance will have to be found .
Inevitably , having surrendered to militarism as an economic device , we will do what other countries have done : we will keep alive the fears of our people of the aggressive ambitions of other countries and we will ourselves embark upon imperialistic enterprises of our own . "
Keynesian militarism means a foreign policy shaped by a constant propaganda of fear .
In order to justify outsized military spending , it is necessary to conjure threats of comparable stature , but once we take this path , there is no return to normalcy .
For our own economic normalcy will come more and more to depend on generating a constant stream of foreign crises and an ever ready supply of enemies who can not be safely ignored .
There are , in the long run , no net benefits to be had from the policy of military Keynesianism : our debt - driven military buildup can only end in bankruptcy and universal ruin .
Yes , in the short run , certain workers and employers do indeed derive benefits from our foreign policy of unrelenting aggression , but their " jobs " are not in any sense productive : indeed , they are engaged in the " business " of wholesale destruction – of human lives and resources – so while their " work " benefits them , it hurts the rest of us immeasurably .
Of course , the Keynesians will have none of this .
They believe that if the government pays us to build pyramids , blows up the finished product , and pays us to rebuild them , then they ’re " kick - starting " the economy .
So why not start a world war – would n’t that deliver a swift kick to our stubbornly mulish economy and save the Obamaites ’ rapidly sinking political fortunes ?
Well , because that would be morally indefensible , now would n’t it ?
Yet that is precisely what the administration is getting ready to do , as the announcement of Obama ’s Afghan " surge " looms closer .
The president wo n’t argue that the war will be good for the economy ; he ’ll leave that dirty job to his proxies over at the Center for American Progress , who , if they do good work , just might get invited to the latest " must attend " White House event .
All in all , we face a depressing prospect : the Left brain - dead with Obama idolatry , the Right neoconized beyond redemption – and no one left to oppose a futile , draining , and horrifically destructive conflict , a war we cannot afford and which directly contravenes our real interests as a nation .
No one , that is , except a clear majority of the American people , who , according to polls , think the battle for Afghanistan is not worth it .
Here is a clear instance in which ordinary , everyday Americans are radically out of sync with partisan activists of both the Right and the Left – thus creating a huge opening for libertarians , particularly the campus arm of the movement ..
The premier libertarian youth organization , Young Americans for Liberty ( YAL ) , is the fastest - growing political group on campus , these days , and no task would suit them better than assuming the leadership of the moribund , leftist - dominated antiwar movement .
As Obama ’s zombie - like cult follows him down the road to war – a war on a scale the much - reviled Bush administration never dared attempt – YAL can fill the vacuum , swell its own ranks , and , more importantly , dramatize the moral and political bankruptcy of the current administration , while drawing a clear and very dramatic line of demarcation between libertarians and Sean Hannity - type conservatives ..
I have my issues with the organized libertarian movement , such as it is , and I have never endorsed any organization .
YAL , however , is a different story : born out of the surge in libertarian activism generated by the Ron Paul campaign , it exemplifies the same staunch anti-imperialism married to ( and derived from ) a hard - core libertarian economic perspective .
What I love about Rep .
Paul is his obvious delight in mixing in denunciations of Obama ’s domestic boondoggles with his informed and trenchant opposition to our global empire - building project .
If we ’d only give up the empire , Paul averred during his presidential campaign , the savings would give us the resources to repair our decaying infrastructure , fund healthcare , and ameliorate a good many of the ills liberals say need fixing .
Rather than do that , however , liberal Democratic members of Congress want to impose a war surtax and make us pay for the war on top of all the other nonsense .
Liberalism , in its modern incarnation , is intellectually bankrupt , and has been for quite some time , but it took the ascension to power of a decidedly liberal administration to highlight the demise of its moral authority .
Young people looking for a comprehensive view of life , a principled perspective on the events shaping their world , are not going to find it in the cost - benefit analyses of dried - up Washington policy wonks who balance the economic " benefits " of mass murder against the weight of the dead .
Nor will they find it in the cynical pontifications of neoconservative militarists , who think they can pursue a " freedom agenda " while supporting a foreign policy that requires a huge and highly centralized federal Leviathan , one that eats up a good portion of the national income .
Libertarianism alone represents a coherent alternative to the tired , worn - out ideologies of the Right and the Left , and the war issue can underline this uniqueness like no other .
If any organization has the spirit , and the numbers , to attempt this , it is YAL : growing by leaps and bounds , springing up on campuses coast to coast , its principled opposition to overseas intervention is exemplary .
Do n’t wait for the sleepy - eyed Left to wake from its slumber .
That may be a long time coming .
If there are other groups on campus you can work with , fine , but libertarians must take the initiative – not only to make political gains , but because it is a moral imperative that we act .
Do n’t be taken in by the " no one cares " meme , which invariably pops up in journalistic accounts of how the antiwar movement is in the doldrums .
There is a populist anger out there that is easily attached to any issue , whether it be healthcare or the Afghan war .
The " tea parties " showed us that .
Do n’t wait for lightning to strike .
You can start a prairie fire all on your own .
The sagebrush is dry , and the weather is amenable : what ’s needed is a spark .
Has anybody got a match ?
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Once again , we come to the end of a fundraising campaign , and as I write this , we still have a few thousand bucks to go .
Which tells us , yes , the recession is still hitting hard – but no , our readers have n’t abandoned us .
To all who gave , enduring days – nay , weeks – of rude hectoring and endless reminders of our impending doom , I have to say my gratitude is boundless .
Every time I sit down to write another column , as I have been doing for more than a decade now , I remember this extraordinary generosity , which has endured lo these many years , and it gives me the energy to soldier on – and do it with gusto !
Now for those who did n’t give , because they wanted to save for Christmas presents , as well as those who could be talked into giving more , let me remind you that Amazon.com has everything a Christmas shopper could want – and if you click this link , you can shop and benefit Antiwar.com every time you make a purchase .

Gold is the money of kings ; silver is the money of gentlemen ; barter is the money of peasants ; but debt is the money of slaves .
There ’s something frightening and melancholic about knowing that your country , your life even , is run by people who believe in the powers of a godman .
It is confusing to see a healer in a wheelchair , but the miracle man made the irony disappear .
When Sai Baba visited Bombay this week , waiting to fall at his feet were some of the most powerful men in the country .
It was a familiar world at his feet , where usually presidents , ministers , RBI governors , corporate chiefs and Supreme Court judges arrive .
There is something frightening and melancholic about it — to know that your country , your life , in a way , is run by people who believe in the powers of a godman .
The endurance of Sai Baba as some form of a god is astonishing .
He has been publicly accused of sexual abuse and his miracles would increasingly appear naïve today even to his devouts ( PC Sorcar once claimed he was just a bad magician .
Sorcar , famously , converted Sai Baba ’s sandesh - from - thin - air into rasagulla ) .
Rationalists have for long tried to discredit Sai Baba .
Once they even filed a case against him for producing gold chains from thin air .
They said that if they were created through supernatural means , they devalued the precious metal by increasing its supply .
But in the end , Sai Baba has triumphed .
Faith , as always , has beaten reason .
Some people are repulsed by the sight of influential men falling at the feet of godmen .
The sentiments of the believers in the paranormal are protected by law , but those who believe in reason cannot be guarded in this manner .
They go through life , especially in this country , not with the chuckle of superior disdain as people imagine , but on some days with great rage .
Days when they are reminded that men who run the country seek extraterrestrial help , that criminals donate kilograms of gold to temples to absolve themselves of their latest crime .
There is this unsung decency about atheists , as they are loosely called .
They know there is no hot weather hell , there is no punitive rebirth as an earthworm , yet they never hope to benefit through evil .
They do not create traffic jams , they do not create noise , their charity is never a pathetic transaction .
In their moments of confusion , at the most they would say , ‘ I believe in a Force ’ .
It is not a great line , but it is a pure line — they really do not expect the ‘ Force ’ to do them any favours , like increase their salary .
They just go about their lives without harming anyone , even though they know nobody is watching .
You may say this is too much generalisation , that most bad people are bad because they are godless .
But that is the astonishing thing .
From what I have seen , most criminals ( and criminals who have given themselves fancier names ) are great believers in God .
There is a spiritual movement among the urban affluent to understand life through a guru who is differently dressed but is not expected to do magic .
Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has filled this slot through entrepreneurial brilliance .
A few years ago I interviewed him at a Malabar Hill house ( of course ) .
On the floor were seated Vinod Khanna , Nagma and others like them .
On a throne was Sri Sri .
I was supposed to interview him in front of his devotees , some of the most influential people of Bombay .
As I sat in a chair facing Sri Sri , there were gasps .
I was expected to sit on the floor ( a journalist before me indeed had sat that way ) .
But then I am such a boor .
I asked him questions like why he spent so much time with the rich ( Vinod Khanna laughed in a good - natured way at the foolishness of a young reporter ) .
Sri Sri would reply by saying my facts were wrong ( and the gathering would laugh at me ) , or he would snub me by saying that if only I smiled more often I would understand everything ( and the gathering would laugh again ) .
As I was leaving , he said something about me ( which I could not get ) and the crowd burst out laughing , this time louder .
I really do not know why these people were there on the floor , listening to someone who said something like , ‘ Do n’t fall in love .
Rise in love … We are all one . ’
Surely , they have heard all this before they met him ?
People who do not seek divine mediums , who know that ‘ scepticism ’ is merely a name given to higher intelligence , they do have their just rewards .
They go through life with a clarity of mind which is like a clear , beautiful day .
It is also called joy .
Barack Obama said the US and China will break new ground in their partnership on clean energy technology during a summit in Beijing tomorrow that will also seek to find a new way forward for global climate talks .
A day after backing a delay in the international negotiating process towards a deal in Copenhagen , the US president told a townhall meeting in Shanghai that he and his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao would focus on ways to reduce their carbon footprints .
As the world 's two biggest emitters expand their economies and populations , he said they needed a way to minimise the impact of increased energy use .
" Both countries have a great interest in finding new strategies to combat climate change , " he said .
During the summit , the two nations will announce a new energy cooperation programme , unveil closer collaboration on " cleaner coal " technology and smart grids and establish a joint research centre .
Sources close to the preparations say a memorandum of understanding will be signed in the Great Hall of the People , under which the US Trade Development Agency will fund an office in Beijing to assist US firms to secure government financing for new energy projects .
A group of companies led by Peabody , one of the biggest US coal firms , will receive seed money from the US government money to establish a demonstration facility in China that shows off its scrubbing , washing and emission - reduction technology , the source says .
The firm may also unveil a deepening of its involvement in China 's GreenGen project to pioneer cleaner and more efficient coal burning technology .
General Electric will sign a deal with Shenhua , China 's biggest coal company , to use the former 's coal gasification technology for increased energy efficiency and carbon capture and storage .
But the message of cooperation between the world 's two biggest emitters looks likely to be diluted by the competitive instincts of businesses and politicians who are reluctant to share funding and technology with a rival .
US sources say no public money will be channelled to Chinese firms or projects because the country is seen as a rival .
At the start of his Asia tour , Obama highlighted this point by describing China as a " vital partner , as well as a competitor . "
The potential for friction has been evident in backroom negotiations over the funding of a joint clean energy research centre .
China is thought to have asked the US to provide a larger share of the costs to reflect its greater wealth and historical responsibility for the carbon in the atmosphere .
But the US wanted a 50 - 50 split .
The final amount of its investment in the new centre , which is expected to be unveiled by energy secretary Steven Chu tomorrow , will be in the region of $ 18 m , according to a source familiar with the deal .
US officials have recently been trying to link China 's Qinghua University , MIT in the US , and Cambridge in the UK .
The two nations also talk a different language when it comes to the transfer of technology from west to east , a key concern for China .
On Beijing 's wishlist are salt - resistant materials for offshore windfarms , hi-tech components for large wind turbines , smart - grid control systems and more efficient pumps for nuclear reactors .
But the US side prefers to talk in terms of " technology cooperation " , suggesting more of a two - way street .
Observers say far more could have been achieved with a smoother transition between the Bush and Obama administrations and a greater level of trust .
" There are some areas where China is more advanced , but in key areas , it needs US technology , " said Yang Fuqiang , head of climate solutions at the Worldwide Fund for Nature .
" The difficulty is how to compensate the private sector and how to remove trade restrictions on items that the US does not want to give to China because of its fears a loss of competitive advantage . "
Claims that China needs US technology are disputed .
" There is nothing out there that China does not have access to if it is willing to pay for it .
This is more about money , " said Charlie McElwee , a Shanghai - based American lawyer specialising in environmental issues .
" On carbon capture and storage , China is among the world leaders if not the leader . "
Business optimism about a potential low - carbon market worth $ 1 trillion in China has been tempered by concerns about trade tensions .
US solar panel manufacturers have accused Chinese rivals , such as Suntech , of dumping underpriced photovoltaic panels in the US .
Such concerns have slowed progress .
But industry insiders say tomorrow 's summit could smooth future collaboration .
In panel 1 , these guys look pretty jazzed to be in the loo .
Sorry ladies , not only do we get in and out faster , but our restrooms are just good times all around .
For the full effect , look at the last panel and count out a good five seconds .
The proposal by Bolton Wanderers ' chairman , Phil Gartside , for an expanded two - division Premier League which would include Celtic and Rangers has been revived and is on the agenda for next Thursday 's Premier League clubs ' meeting .
His idea is prompted by what Gartside has described as a " fear factor " among the smaller clubs , who are desperately worried about the financial cost of relegation to the Championship and are overspending to avoid it .
Gartside 's plans did not gain sufficient support when he first unveiled them last year , but he has persisted because he wants a debate about English football 's structure and the financial inequalities now embedded in it .
His proposals are understood to be similar to those produced previously , in which he suggested the Premier League could be expanded into two divisions , possibly of 18 teams each , with Celtic and Rangers included because their size would create more money for the league .
The idea was dismissed by many last time because Gartside appeared to be proposing a self - interested " closed circle " , with no relegation out of the Premier League 's second division .
This time , Gartside is understood to be more flexible , arguing that relegation could be retained but that clubs should meet standards of size and finance , similar to Uefa 's licensing system , if they are to be promoted into the Premier League .
Bolton published their accounts this week for the year to 30 June 2009 , which showed that even though the club finished 13th last season , they lost £ 13.2 m and their net debts rose to £ 64 m .
The Premier League has sold its TV rights separately from the Football League since the top division clubs broke away in 1992 , and its teams now receive on average £ 40 m more from TV money alone than those in the Championship .
That makes relegation a dire prospect .
Gartside wrote in Bolton 's accounts of the need to address this gap : " The same few clubs continue to benefit from the huge additional revenues from the Champions League , and the remaining clubs find it enormously difficult to challenge , " he said .
" At the same time , the gap between Premier League revenues and those of the Championship continues to widen and I believe a fear factor is beginning to emerge amongst Premier League clubs outside the top few .
Addressing this polarisation of clubs will be the major strategic issue for the Premier League over coming years . "
In the summer , the Football League proposed uniting with the Premier League , to sell their TV rights jointly , a plan which could involve a more even distribution of money throughout English football , but the Premier League has so far not entered into discussions .
Few clubs were prepared to comment about Gartside 's proposals in advance of next Thursday 's meeting , but the politics are predictable .
The top clubs , those either in the top four Champions League places or who see themselves as competing for them , earn very well from the current system and are believed to have little interest in changing the structure .
Support for reform , and a more equal distribution of TV money , will come from smaller clubs who , like Hull City and Portsmouth , have overreached themselves trying to stay in the Premier League and for whom relegation is a real fear .
The Wigan Athletic chairman , Dave Whelan , said he did not agree with inviting Celtic and Rangers to cross the football border , but gave qualified support for the plan to expand the Premier League .
" I think it would be fairer to unite the Premier and Football Leagues , " he said , " but the Premier League clubs would not agree to that because they make most of the money as things stand .
The idea is worth debating , because the gulf is huge , with eight to 10 of us clubs just fighting for survival . "
Both Celtic and Rangers , who have long looked to escape from the Scottish Premier League in which they are by far the biggest clubs , would welcome an invitation from the elite English league .
However , any Premier League rule change requires 14 clubs to vote in favour .
Gartside has a great deal of lobbying to do before his plan has any chance of succeeding .
There was a time , once , when geeks everywhere revered the name of George Lucas .
Then The Phantom Menace came out and took him down a few dozen pegs in our collective estimation .
The next two movies did n’t help , either , and changing Star Wars to make Greedo shoot first was the final straw for many geeks .

Yes , though it takes a lot to earn a place on the geek world ’s pedestal , it does n’t take much to fall from it .
We ’ll forgive a few missteps , as we have with Douglas Adams ’s weaker Hitchhiker ’s books ( and of course his untimely death earns him much forgiveness as well ) , but there are definite limits on our patience .
So in this Great Geek Debate , let ’s look at the two men who are arguably the biggest icons in geek entertainment today : Joss Whedon and J.J. Abrams .
Joss Whedon broke into the collective geek consciousness with the 1992 movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer , a fun but uneven take on the vampire movie genre .
His screenplay for Alien : Resurrection going largely ( and deservedly ) overlooked , he truly gained his iconic geek status when the Buffy TV series ( which only really related to the movie in that both were about girls named Buffy fighting vampires ) hit its stride with its second season .
If any doubts remained about his ability to captivate geeks , he removed them when Firefly hit the TV screen in 2002 .
There ’s no way to know what would have happened if Fox had n’t unforgivably mishandled Firefly , moving it around from timeslot to timeslot and thus guaranteeing it would never garner decent ratings , then unceremoniously canceling it entirely .
Maybe the series would have gone downhill ; maybe we would talk about how the first season was an aberration .
But the fact is that by canceling it Fox ensured Firefly ‘s place in geek canon , so much so that its place on the pedestal enabled Whedon to convince Universal Pictures to make and release the movie Serenity two years after the last episode aired on TV .
J.J. Abrams got his start in Hollywood writing such films as Regarding Henry , which is possibly the only film ever to imply that the best thing to do with arrogant , self - centered lawyers is to shoot them in the head .
Probably the first time geeks really noticed him was when he co-wrote the 1998 movie Armageddon , which definitely did n’t earn him many points .
Then he created the TV series Alias in 2001 ( Felicity was n’t especially geeky ) , and we started to realize he had some genuine talent .
Then came Lost , which was so brilliant no viewer could legitimately claim to understand it .
Whatever your opinion of it , you have to admit that Lost was a watershed moment in TV : probably the first show with such a long overall story arc that each episode did n’t have to be understandable on its own .
Then came Mission : Impossible III , which Abrams took over after the original director bailed , and which , while not necessarily good , was nonetheless better than it had any real right to be .
So that ’s the past of both men , and so we come to the more recent years .
Whedon has n’t done much recently , unless you count creating a musical web - based miniseries so brilliant they had to create a new Emmy category so it could win one ( and which also , not incidentally , won a Hugo Award ) .
And then of course there ’s Dollhouse , which while uneven is still one of the few decent science fiction shows on TV , and has had some real flashes of brilliance .
Abrams has been a little busy these past few years .
He created the TV show Fringe , which seems to be of the love - it - or - hate - it variety , but certainly qualifies as geeky either way .
And then of course there ’s a little movie you may have heard about .
Yes , a lot of hardcore Star Trek fans are deeply unhappy with the liberties he took in reinventing their precious universe , but I for one am very pleased with it .
I did n’t love everything about the movie — its story was wildly implausible and it had several huge plot holes — but as a nearly - lifelong Trekkie I ’m absolutely thrilled to see the franchise reinvigorated .
So how to compare the two ?
I like a lot of both of their works .
I think if I look at the collective geek consciousness ( assuming such a thing really exists ) , I have to give the nod to Joss Whedon .
Seriously , if he had done nothing other than Firefly / Serenity and Dr. Horrible , I think he would still win .
I mean , he gave the world Captain Tightpants and ( arguably ) the first genuinely wonderful geek musical !
Those farmers are facing a bounty harvest of challenges : climate change , disappearing natural resources , spikes in food and energy prices .
Putting foods in bowls , banana leafs or tin cups will therefore require ingenuity and support .
As part of that quest , experts gathered in Rome earlier this week to brainstorm ways to feed the world in the next four decades .
No one brought crystal balls or tarot cards , instead aid workers and academics , government officials and farmer representatives debated strategies at the United Nation 's Food and Agriculture Organization .
The past is providing them with a road map but they also pushed to take the roads less traveled .
With one in every six people suffering from hunger today , the race is on to reverse the course by 2050 .
" Agriculture will have no choice but to be more productive , " Jacques Diouf , director - general of the Food and Agriculture Organization said .
The UN says large amounts of food are needed as the world population grows
The UN's food agency says farms will have to produce 70 percent more food over the next 40 years .
In the developing world , the majority of the food will have to grow on existing plots .
For example , farmers in the dusty plains of war - torn Northern Uganda will have to coax more millet from the same land .
Across the globe , farmers in Indonesia crippled by changing weather patterns from global warming must produce more rice from the same square of land .
" Now we have to learn from our past mistakes , " Diouf added .
" What we 're paying for today with the rising numbers of hungry people and rapid spread of malnourishment is our inability to develop or revive local food production in the most needed countries after more than 20 years of neglect of agriculture and underinvestment in the sector . "
In 1980 , global public spending on agriculture was much higher than today .
The devastating pictures of Ethiopians with swollen bellies galvanized the public to end hunger .
Live Aid and other fundraising drives helped feed the world .
Money was spent on storage facilities , seed production system and fertilizer and about 17 percent of aid donations were funneled into agriculture .
Today , the figure has plummeted to five percent .
The FAO claims that agriculture investments will have to increase 50 percent in order to feed the hungry .
Experts at the forum on feeding the world almost universally agreed that the focus should be on farmers , particularly small land - holders who need both a hand out and a hand up .
Governments and private sources must provide financial support and invest in research and development to keep people on the farm .
Pulling up roots
Many farmers are going hungry despite growing crops because they 're not making enough money
Most farmers in the developing world are hungry .
They may be growing crops but the maize or cassava is n't bringing in enough money at the market to allow them to buy other foods for a balanced diet .
The push for increased food production often forgets the health and well - being of the farmers who are growing the food .
" If our task is to end hunger , we have to improve their hunger situation if they are half of the hungry in the world , " Michael Windfuhr , human rights director for Stuttgart - based Bread for the World , told Deutsche Welle .
" We can not just say we only have to think about production .
We have to invest in the people and the people 's ability to feed themselves . "
Windfuhr says African countries have to protect the small farmer .
Usually farmers do n't have a social safety net , unliked developed countries where welfare , unemployment and other benefits are available .
A farmer 's entire livelihood can be wiped out in a single flood , drought or drop in crop prices .
The farmer - and the extended family of a half - dozen others - suffer .
The farmer not only lacks social aid but business support .
African governments facing crippling debts have eliminated agriculture extension programs that provided seeds and shared knowledge .
Cheap credit is no longer available and governments are also being encouraged to open up their markets .
" Let 's take rice farmers in Northern Ghana which had traditionally been supplying Ghana quite well in rice , " Windfuhr said .
" The opening of the marketplace brought rice from countries that subsidized their farmers .
Today they 're confronted with a situation that imported rice is so cheap on the market that they had to give up . "
Hunger is an income problem and development experts recite this like a mantra .
Farmers will continue fleeing their fields for more lucrative opportunities in the urban areas unless incomes improve .
The exodus is already underway and only the women remain behind .
Raising crops and children
As experts look toward 2050 , Tacko Ndiaye is frustrated that her colleagues are n't looking more closely at the farmers .
The person wielding the machete or the hoe is usually a woman and she 's probably also carrying a baby on her back .
" It 's really rural women who are the backbone of the agriculture sector in Africa , " said Ndiaye , a program director with the United Nations Development Fund for Women .
" Who is left there ?
Mothers and grandmothers are keeping the agriculture going . "
She told Deutsche Welle that the women are holding together the farm but often do n't even have the right to own the land they till .
They 're making lower wages and not receiving training or credit .
Even though they 're the majority of farmers , they are absent in leadership roles where their knowledge could help increase production .
" We need also to hear women 's voices , leverage women 's voices in agricultural policy making , " Ndiaye added .
" If it does n't reach women , do n't call it development . "
Keeping the shelves stocked
A buzzword in development is " food security . "
The bureaucratic lingo evokes images of armored grain silos or well - hidden cookies jars .
The term , however , means ensuring people have enough to eat , even during times of crisis .
To feed the world in 2050 , food security is required and the challenges make for a bountiful harvest .
Homi Kharas , a senior fellow with the Brookings Institute , said the biggest challenge to reaching the goal can be summarized in one word .
" Uncertainty , " he said , adding " to solve this issue we know that we need investment . "
Kharas said getting that investment , especially from the private sector , will be very difficult in the current environment .
" You 've got uncertainty over prices , you 've got uncertainty over yields , you 've got uncertainty over markets . "
He said last year 's spike in food prices that prompted riots and widespread hunger came from powerful forces that are n't going to diminish .
Rising oil prices , US dollar fluctuations , market speculators and climate change are throwing rocks in the path of the tractor .
Climate change alone is forecast to reduce productivity in Africa by 30 percent before the turn of the next century if nothing is done .
The developed world 's insatiable need for energy is prompting the cultivation of many crops for biofuel .
The agriculture market is bound to be affected as food goes into gas tanks .
Green revolution : Act II
A comprehensive approach to agriculture will fill the communal bread basket , according to many agricultural experts .
The small - holder farmer , who makes up 80 percent of the farmers in Africa , will lead the charge if provided with adequate support .
A poll of experts at the Feed the World forum overwhelmingly said African small farmers will captain the continent 's agricultural transformation , a second Green Revolution .
Fifty years ago , the Green Revolution was an effort to grow more food for the world and moderate success occurred , namely in Asia .
" In the mid 1950s , there was sort of like a prediction for doomsday .
People were supposed to starve , " said Kwanchai Gomez , the director of the Asia Rice Foundation .
" But the next 40 years proved that human beings could survive if they put their mind to it .
I think that research has been a major factor in making sure that rice production had doubled . "
The technology and know - how of the 21st century make her optimistic .
" I think we will be able to make it even better in the next 40 years , " said Gomez .
Yet many are calling for a more nuanced and modern look at the situation in Africa .
A Green Revolution 2.0 might be in order which would take into account the global economy , modern technology , and the diversity in Africa .
The continent currently has 17 major farming systems , far more than Asia .
" Yes , we need a Green Revolution , " said Kwesi Atta - Krah , deputy director - general of Bioversity .
But he warns that Africa can't simply import Asia 's model .
" What is needed is a rainbow revolution in the sense that we have multiple pathways to development through a revolution . "
Agriculture grows development
Depending on who you ask , GM crops are either a blessing or a curse
The revolutionary battle lines are being drawn over genetically modified crops .
The DNA is altered in the crop , often providing protection from insects and allowing larger yields .
For some , it 's the path to feeding the world and they do n't understand why Africa has n't adopted large - scale GM farming .
" I am absolutely horrified at what has happened in Africa , " Hans Binswanger - Mkhize said during a panel focusing on the continent .
" Who is steering this fear and this global paranoia about the GM cotton and all these GM crops ? " said the Tshwane University of Technology honorary professor .
" I want to challenge those to show us where the corpses are .
The corpses of earthworm , the corpses of bees , the corpses of antelopes and the corpses of humans .
Nobody has yet ever shown us a corpse . "
While the remarks prompted applause , many others took the opposite stance .
" It takes a long time for cancer to develop and by the time you see the corpses on the field , it may be too late , " said Ben Ahunu , a professor at the University of Ghana , adding that more research is needed before introducing genetically modified crops .
Even in the face of all these formidable challenges , the officials , academics and agricultural representatives remained modestly optimistic .
Slightly over half said that the goal of feeding the world in 2050 will be reached .
The food for thought exchanged might make that challenge less arduous .

JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a 10 - month suspension of new building in Jewish settlements in the West Bank , but excluded thousands of units already under construction as well as Jewish building in predominantly Palestinian East Jerusalem .
Obama administration officials said they hoped the Israeli announcement Wednesday would revive moribund peace talks between the two sides , but Palestinians said the partial freeze was insufficient .

I ’ve written before about how to use Google ’s normal search index to find unpublished opinions in Texas .
Google has now formally added legal opinions to another of its products — Google Scholar — promising new ways to research legal case law ( and some legal journals , too ) .
This is something that I have been expecting to see from Google for a few years .
Google has clearly put the extra time to good use .
Its first attempt is quite polished and looks like it might be usable for serious legal work .
And , in typical Google fashion , the price is right .
((
Interestingly , they chose to integrate legal cases into Google Scholar , which lets academic publishers keep the full text of their articles behind a paywall .
I will be curious to see if some legal treatises and reference books show up with those same paywalls attached . ))
The rest of this post is a quick walk - through of the service with some first impressions .
A quick sample search
To get started , click the “ Advanced scholar search ” link that ’s wedged next to the main search box on the Google Scholar page .
It should take you here .
Scan down the page to the “ Collections ” option .
From here , you can specify which legal sources you want to search .
For this demonstration , I ’m going to search for “ sovereign immunity ” and “ declaratory judgment ” by putting those two phrases ( in quotation marks ) in the top search box on this page ( the one labeled “ with all of the words ” ) .
Hit the “ Search Scholar ” button .
( There ’s one at the top right of the page and another at the bottom left . )
Smart results
At first glance , that ’s a pretty smart result set :
It ’s listing some of the most cited cases about those subjects first , although it ’s clearly using other factors , too .
( It shows the number of citations for each entry . )
Perhaps as a byproduct , it ’s listing the state supreme court ( the court with the most legal authority ) first
It ’s giving you an excerpt from the case with the keywords highlighted
In typical Google style , it has a couple of mysterious links taking you to related materials ( the large “ How cited ” link next to the case name and the small “ Related articles ” link beneath the blurb . )
Looking closer
Let ’s look at the first result in detail .
Click the case name , and it takes you to a nice representation of the case — with the West reporter page numbers listed on the left margin , so you can easily cite this in a brief . ((
If you scroll down , you ’ll notice that the IT - Davy case used in this example has three opinions ( majority , concurrence , dissent ) .
Google Scholar does n’t yet have a nice way to navigate these , and I do n’t yet know how smart its algorithms are about distinguishing this text in search results . ) )
Search results are highlighted .
Case citations are hyperlinked to their locations within Google Scholar .
Want a citation tree ?
Go to “ How Cited ”
At the top there is a “ How Cited ” tab .
That takes you to Google ’s take on a citation history .
On the left , you can see snippets from the citing sources .
( Interestingly , those snippets also highlight your original search terms so you can scan for possibly more related hits . )
If you click on an item in that list , you are taken directly to the relevant part of that citing case .
Nice .
A first look at the mysterious “ Related articles ” link
The “ Related articles ” link is more mysterious to a legal scholar .
Clicking it brings up a more spartan list of authorities than the “ How cited ” tab .
It ’s not a citation tree — the number of results is smaller .
It lists the case you ’re starting with as the first result , and the results contain both older and newer cases .
At first glance , it looks much more like a “ Genius Playlist ” in iTunes than a citation tree . (( I do n’t know how Google is calculating this .
( Perhaps someone more familiar with Google Scholar ’s academic offerings can comment . ) ) )
What ’s immediately striking is how the blurbs beneath each entry on the “ Related articles ” page differ from the “ How cited ” page .
Rather than trying to give you the most “ relevant ” text , the blurbs on the the “ Related articles ” blurb are sometimes ( but not always ) the very beginning of the opinions .
My guess is that Google has an algorithm that is trying to give you a sense of the subject matter of the listed case .
The results that algorithm is generating still look pretty primitive , at least for legal results .
But it ’s an interesting idea .
If someone has more insight into this “ Related articles ” feature , please let me know .
I ’m giving it a real - world tryout , and I ’ll report back
With perhaps an abundance of optimism , I ’ve decided to try out Google Scholar on some of my current briefs .
I will report back .
I already see nice ways to limit search results by year .
I do n’t yet see a logical way to search for opinions just from a particular court of appeals , which is an important feature for Texas appellate lawyers .
( Knowing Google , there is a search parameter that will accomplish this . )
I ’ll also pass along some more tips when I have some hands - on experience .
More reading [ added 11/18/2009 ]
Because of the strong response to this post , I wanted to offer a few more links for those of you who were interested enough to read to the end .
Palestinians have formally asked the European Union to urge the UN security council to recognise a fully independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in response to the current impasse in peace negotiations with Israel .
Saeb Erakat , the chief Palestinian negotiator , confirmed that the request to the EU was made on Monday as Israeli ministers repeated warnings that any unilateral moves would trigger counter - measures that could include the annexation of more of the occupied West Bank .
Erakat , speaking in Ramallah , said Israel had for 18 years continued to " impose facts on the ground by stealing Palestinian lands and building settlements and barriers aiming to finish off the two - state project " .
He added : " We will seek the support of all members of the international community . "
EU foreign ministers are due to discuss the issue in Brussels today but are unlikely to reach any decision .
Diplomats said there was no question of EU backing for a unilateral declaration of independence by the Palestinians , which would be likely to be vetoed by Washington .
US senators visiting Jerusalem also warned that such an move would be a non-starter .
But Erakat made clear that the Palestinians were seeking a security council resolution spelling out the parameters for resolving the conflict — crucially without waiting for Israel to negotiate and without Israeli consent .
A key element would be that a Palestinian state must include the West Bank and Gaza Strip , with East Jerusalem as its capital , within the 1967 borders in line with existing UN resolutions .
This move , supported by the Arab League , reflects mounting Palestinian frustration that negotiations with Israel have reached a dead end due to the refusal of Binyamin Netanyahu , the Likud prime minister , to agree to a freeze on settlement activity , as Barack Obama had been demanding until recently when he appeared to back - pedal .
Analysts say the UN move may also be intended to find a way for Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , to remain in office .
Abbas , said to be angry and frustrated , announced last week that he would not stand for re-election , though the elections originally scheduled for January have now been postponed .
The Palestinians first declared independence unilaterally in November 1988 , seeking to build on the achievements of the first intifada and Jordan 's formal disengagement from the West Bank .
That dramatic declaration was recognised by dozens of countries but never implemented on the ground .
It was superseded by the Israeli - PLO Oslo agreement in 1993 , though the negotiations that began then have never been completed .
Israeli settlement activity has also continued unabated since .
In 2005 Israel disengaged unilaterally from the Gaza Strip without any agreement with the Palestinians .
The area was later taken over by the Islamist movement Hamas , which is at odds with Abbas 's western - backed Palestinian Authority .
Hamas said on Monday that it opposed diplomatic moves at the UN , with spokesman Fawzi Barhoum calling Abbas 's approach a sign of desperation .
" It 's clear that this was a reaction by the Palestinian Authority after running out of options after two decades of negotiations , " he said .
Palestinians , added Hamas official Salah Bardwil , should focus on their own " ability to liberate the land " .
Avigdor Lieberman , Israel 's foreign minister , warned : " Any unilateral movement will be countered by a unilateral move on our part . "
Another minister said Israel could respond by annexing some settlements .
Israel annexed East Jerusalem immediately after the 1967 war , while expanding the city 's boundaries , but has always agreed in principle that it would negotiate over the West Bank .
Annexation would close off that option .
US senator Joseph Lieberman said " an essentially unilateral " declaration of statehood would not move the peace process forward .
" I hope and presume that the US would veto such a move if it ever came to the security council , " he said .
Candidate collision event in the CMS detector .

The first protons collided in the Large Hadron Collider today at CERN outside Geneva , Switzerland .
The four largest detectors at the LHC all recorded candidate collision events .
Scientists at CERN , throughout the United States , and around the world celebrated the news .
" This is a very exciting moment after so many years of preparation , ” said Andrew Lankford from the University of California , Irvine , deputy spokesperson for the ATLAS experiment .
Beams were first tuned to produce collisions in the ATLAS detector , which recorded its first candidate for collisions at 2:22 p.m. local time .
" The real accomplishment belongs to the accelerator scientists for bringing the beams into collision so quickly after they were first circulated , ” he added .
These first collisions are another milestone on the way to the ultimate goal : high - energy collisions of protons in the center of the LHC experiments .
They follow a weekend of rapid progress for the LHC .
After more than one year of repairs , on Friday evening , November 20 , beams were once again circulating in the collider .
Over the weekend , the LHC team carefully studied the beams one at a time .
Today at approximately 1:30 local time , two beams circulated at the same time for the first time in the LHC .
As the two circulating beams passed through each other , protons from each beam hit one another , and the resulting spray of particles registered in the ALICE , ATLAS , CMS , and LHCb detectors .
Celebrations on Friday , November 20 , when the first beams of 2009 successfully circulated in the LHC .

“ It ’s a great achievement to have come this far in so short a time , ” said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer in a statement issued by the laboratory .
“ But we need to keep a sense of perspective – there ’s still much to do before we can start the LHC physics programme . ”
These particular collisions happened against the odds .
When the LHC is fully operational , each beam will consist of almost 3000 bunches of more than one hundred billion protons each .
Despite the enormous number of protons , each bunch will still contain mostly empty space , and operators will " squeeze " them to increase the chances of two protons colliding .
Today , during the testing phase of the accelerator , each beam only contained one bunch of several billion protons , and the beams were not squeezed .
Thus the chance of two protons colliding as the bunches passed through each other was very small , and resulted in relatively few recorded collisions in each experiment .
" This is another great technical achievement for the LHC accelerator team and allows the collaborations on the LHC experiments to make further progress in preparing for first high - energy collision data , " said Bob Cousins from the University of California , Los Angeles , deputy spokesperson for the CMS experiment .
" We are getting a chance to test drive our detectors with real collision data . "
More than 1700 scientists , engineers , students , and technicians from 97 US universities and national laboratories have helped design and build the LHC accelerator and its four massive particle detectors , known by their acronyms : ALICE , ATLAS , CMS and LHCb .
They are joined by an estimated 8500 colleagues from 59 countries around the world .
US participation from institutions in 32 states and Puerto Rico is supported by the Department of Energy ’s Office of Science and the National Science Foundation .
“ Everyone ’s very excited , ” said Tom LeCompte from the Department of Energy 's Argonne National Laboratory , the physics coordinator for the ATLAS experiment .
“ We will use these very first collisions to determine if our detector is ‘ in time , ’ by which I mean that when a collision occurs , every part of the detector sees it happening at exactly the same time . ”
Precise timing is critical for these huge detectors , where millions of separate detector elements , some separated from each other by tens of meters , must be synchronized to within one billionth of a second .
The first collisions will also be used by scientists to calibrate and test many other parts of the complex detectors .
The first two protons collided at the relatively low energies with which they were injected into the LHC , 450 GeV each .
Over the next few months , LHC scientists will raise the beam energy , aiming for collisions at the world - record energy of 3.5 TeV per beam in early 2010 .
With these high - energy collisions , the teams on the LHC experiments will embark on their quest to solve some of the mysteries of the universe .
American scientists have contributed critical components to the construction of the LHC accelerator and experiments , continue to play key roles in the operation of the detectors , and will be vital to the success of the experiments in their search for new phenomena such as the Higgs boson and the particles that make up dark matter .

Astronomers have confirmed a blast of gamma radiation spotted earlier this year was the death throes of a star billions of light years away from earth .
It is the most distant object in space ever to be detected and the research has just been published in the journal Nature .
Professor Nial Tanvir led the international team that studied the ancient explosion 's fallout says it is a record - breaking discovery .
" The thing that we detected is something called a gamma ray burst , it 's a kind of exploding star and these explosions are so bright , so incredibly bright , brighter than anything else we know of in the universe that you can see them very far away , " he said .
" It 's actually a complicated procedure to see the thing .
You detect them initially with a satellite which picks up the gamma ray radiation from this explosion , which is happening far across the universe .
" Then we have to use telescopes on the earth which are state of the art , the biggest most powerful telescopes that we have on the earth to make observations of the burst as it sort of fades away . "
Dr Tanvir says the actual explosion would have happened over 14 billion years ago .
" The really interesting thing in cosmology is that when we look out across the universe at great distances , the light that we 're seeing has taken in some cases billions of years to reach us travelling across the universe , " he said .
" So we 're actually looking backwards in time , and what , in this particular case , the era that we 're reaching to is about 600 million years after the start of the universe itself and the big bang .
It 's about 14.1 billion years . "
To measure how far away the explosion occurred , the astronomers look at the light 's red shift .
" It 's a sort of change in the character of the light as it takes place , the light has come so far across the universe to us , " he said .
" By measuring the red shift , you can turn that round and you can infer distance or a time . "
He says looking at explosions in distant galaxies opens a window into the " dark ages of the universe " .
" As we look far away across the universe , we 're looking backwards in time and there comes a point where you could n't see any further , and the reason is not because of the technology just not being up to it , but because basically you look all the way back in time to the big bang itself and so that 's an era we can never see , " he said .
" But the first galaxies that formed after the big bang , the first stars they formed maybe 100 million or 200 million years or so after the big bang .
" For several hundred million years we think those first galaxies started very slowly ... to re-ionise the universe to in fact turn the gas between the galaxies from a cold neutral gas into an ionised plasma .
" So the whole process we refer to the kind of dark era before there really were any stars at all , through to these first stars which changed the state of the gas in the universe . "
Dr Tanvir says that using power telescopes the astronomers have been able to ' map out ' most of the universe , up until these early stages .
" The final area in our map of the universe that we have to still fill in is this dark age region when the first stars were turning on , " he said .
" So I think that 's why we 're particularly excited about this breakthrough , it 's not just a matter of breaking a record , but it 's pushing us finally into this era when all this early activity was taking place . "

Baghdad , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Twin car bombs exploded near three Iraqi government buildings Sunday in central Baghdad , killing at least 132 people .
It was the deadliest attack in the country in more than two years .
More than 500 people were wounded .
The blasts had ripple effects throughout the country , triggering questions about the state of Iraqi security and about national elections planned for January .
No one immediately claimed responsibility .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki vowed to punish " the enemies of the Iraqi people who want to spread chaos in the country and derail the political process and prevent the parliamentary elections from taking place as planned . "
Surveying the carnage shortly after the explosions , al - Maliki said holding the elections as scheduled would send the strongest response and message to the " enemies of the political process who are supported from the outside . "
" The cowardly attack that took place today should not affect the determination of the Iraqi people from continuing their battle against the deposed regime and the gangs of criminal Baath party and the terrorist al Qaeda organization , who have committed the most heinous crimes against the civilians , ' " al - Maliki said in a statement .
Iraqi and U.S. officials had warned of a possible increase in violence ahead of the balloting .
President Obama condemned the " outrageous attacks against the Iraqi people . "
In a statement , Obama called the bombings an attempt to " derail Iraq 's progress " and pledged that the United States would be a " close friend and partner " as Iraq prepares for elections .
According to the statement , Obama spoke Sunday with al - Maliki and Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to express his condolences and reiterate U.S. support .
The area struck Sunday is close to the heavily guarded Green Zone that also houses the U.S. Embassy .
Gen. Ray Odierno , the top U.S. military commander in Iraq , and Christopher Hill , U.S. ambassador to Iraq , condemned the bombings , which came a day after the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Susan Rice , visited the country for the first time .
" We will assist the Iraqi government in any way we can to ensure that those individuals or groups responsible for such horrific acts be pursued and brought to justice , " they said in a joint statement .
The European Union condemned " this terrorist attack " and sent its condolences to the families of the victims , the Swedish presidency said in a statement .
The bombs detonated in quick succession about 10:30 a.m. , as the Iraqi work week began , an Interior Ministry official said .
Among more than 500 people wounded were three American security contractors , the U.S. Embassy told CNN .
The embassy would not give any more details .
One of the bombs exploded outside Baghdad 's governorate building .
The other was outside the Justice Ministry , about 500 meters ( 1,600 feet ) away .
The nearby Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works also sustained severe damage .
Plumes of smoke billowed from the sites of the attacks as victims fled , some with blood streaming down their faces .
The streets were strewn with debris , including charred cars and chunks of concrete from damaged buildings .
Some government buildings and others in the area were heavily damaged .
It was the deadliest attack on Iraqi civilians since August 2007 , when three truck bombings targeted Iraqi Kurds , killing hundreds in Qahtaniya , in northern Iraq .
In August , more than 100 people were killed in a series of bombings in Baghdad in what Iraqis have dubbed " Bloody Wednesday . "
Those attacks shook confidence in the abilities of Iraqi security forces who took over securing urban areas from U.S. troops over the summer .
Security was tightened around Baghdad in the wake of the August bombings .
Blast walls were erected around the city and more checkpoints were set up .
Susan Rice , the ambassador , completed her two - day visit to Iraq on Saturday that included a condolence stop at the Foreign Ministry , one of the sites attacked in August .
Iraqi journalists grilled officials on TV on Sunday , demanding to know how the most recent attacks could have taken place given the new security measures .
An Iraqi official said the government was working to bolster security , but regional cooperation was needed to help fight suicide bombers .
" We are calling on international and U.N. envoys to come and find out why Iraq is being targeted this way , " said Ali al - Dabbagh , the Iraqi government spokesman .
He said Iraq 's setbacks are mainly caused by a fledgling intelligence that has " not been completed . "
The Iraqi government has blamed Syria for harboring former Baath party members who it said planned the August attacks , and asked for their handover .
Relations between the two neighbors were strained after the bombings .
Each withdrew its ambassador from the other 's country .
Sunday 's bombings came on the day Iraqi officials were due to try to break a logjam holding up a new election law .
Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls January 16 , but Parliament still has not passed the legislation , putting the balloting in limbo .
The original deadline for parliament to pass the law was October 15 , because Iraq 's electoral commission says it needs 90 days to organize the process .
Iraq 's parliament failed Wednesday to reach agreement on a new electoral law , so the issue was supposed go to the Political Council for National Security on Sunday .
CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh , Mohammed Jamjoom , and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .
A Tyne and Wear woman whose raucous lovemaking earned her an ASBO and multiple cuffings will declare in court that the order is a violation of her human rights .
Caroline Cartwright , 48 , of Washington , was dragged before magistrates back in April for five breaches of a noise abatement order requiring her to turn down the volume during intimate moments with hubby Steve .
Neighbours described her performances as " murder " and " unnatural " , the Telegraph notes , and " even the local postman and a woman , who walked past the house taking her child to school , complained " .
Sunderland City Council installed " specialist equipment " in neighbour Rachel O'Connor 's flat after she reported she was " frequently late for work because she overslept having been awake most of the night because of the noise " .
The kit recorded noise levels of between 30 and 40 decibels , " with the highest being 47 decibels " .
The court imposed the aforementioned ASBO , ordering her to stop " making excessive noise , knocking , shouting , screaming or vocalisation that can be heard in neighbouring properties or outside the house " .
However , she was arrested on 18 , 22 and 26 April when neighbours complained she was back on the job .
Cartwright has now appealed the four - year ASBO , on the grounds that she is " unable to control her vocalisation during lovemaking , and any attempt at restricting her behaviour is a breach of her human rights " .
Newcastle Crown Court heard she will argue a breach of Article 8 of the human rights act " if her ability to have sex with her husband Steven , 48 , is interfered with " , as the Northern Echo puts it .
To back her case of " being powerless to control herself during lovemaking " , Cartwright will call a " consultant in psychosexual medicine " to support her " involuntary vocalisation " defence . ®

Amazing !
The data ( e- mails ) are right in Man - made global warming supporters face and they still refuse to see the evidence .
These same scientists threatened my job as a scientist with the US Geological Survey because I tried to publish a study showing with higher confidence that global temperature changes were completely natural caused solely by Earth ’s physical processes .
Additionally , these same scientists would not even discuss or refute the science and facts presented .
Instead , they took two days to personally attack me and my family .
I always knew that when man -made global climate change was showed to be insignificant that people would lose faith , note the word “ FAITH ” , in science .
But this event and exposure is way worse for the science community as a whole .
Remember : “ Truth is the daughter of Time ( Francis Bacon ) ” .
Several USGS scientists got fired for the same thing when discussing data manipulation for models developed for the Nevada Nuclear Test Site .
But no outcry and defense for those scientists ?
IF you ca n’t see any problem with this and you do n’t wonder if there ’s been some misleading of the public by these scientists , then you definitely are not scientists , you ’re in denial and would buy any bill of goods sold , and you have no moral principles to stand on .
On 25 November 2009 at 12:15 PM , I tried to post comments on RealClimate.org concerning this matter .
That website obviously refused to post my comments because they know me , which is another attempt to silence objective parties on this subject and since they were the ones that threatened my job …..
Now , think about this .
Al Gore PUBLICLY states that the Earth ’s Mantle temperatures are MILLIONS of DEGREES .
The man does n’t even have the morality , decency , and / or courage to publicly admit he was WRONG .
WHY SHOULD these scientists admit they are wrong ?
They can’t , because if they do , the gig is up …… .
“ The key here is an Afghan surge , not an American surge , ” Senator Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee , said on CBS ’s “ Face the Nation . ”
“ And if the president lays out the case for why our combat forces that are going particularly to the south will increase the speed - up of the Afghan Army , it seems to me that that would be very , very important . ”
With the cost of the war rising , some Democrats have even talked of a surtax .
And a Republican senator , Richard G. Lugar of Indiana , asked : “ If we were talking about several years of time , how many more years beyond that ?
What is the capacity of our country to finance this particular type of situation as opposed to other ways of fighting Al Qaeda and the war against terror ? ”
At West Point , Mr. Obama was expected to describe commitments from Afghanistan ’s president , Hamid Karzai , and specific benchmarks his government must meet : to crack down on corruption , deploy well - trained Afghan troops and police officers , and focus on development in one of the world ’s poorest nations .
Mr. Obama was expected to be far less specific about Pakistan , where Taliban leaders are commanding operations across the border against American forces , and where Al Qaeda ’s central leadership still lives .
“ We agree that no matter how many troops you send , if the safe haven in Pakistan is n’t cracked , the whole mission is compromised , ” said one official who has participated in the debate over the strategy .
“ But if you make too many demands on the Pakistanis in public , it can backfire . ”
The problems in Afghanistan have only been compounded by the fragility of Mr. Obama ’s partner in Pakistan , President Asif Ali Zardari , who is so weak that his government seems near collapse .
On Friday , Mr. Zardari relinquished his position in Pakistan ’s nuclear command structure , turning it over to the prime minister , in what appeared to be an effort to avoid impeachment or prosecution , and retain at least a figurehead post .
On Sunday , one of the Obama administration ’s staunchest allies , Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain , joined in the campaign to press Pakistan to step up attacks on Al Qaeda ’s leadership in Pakistan ’s unruly tribal areas and other militant groups there .
“ People are going to ask why , eight years after 2001 , Osama bin Laden has never been near to being caught , ” Mr. Brown told Sky News , “ and what can the Pakistan authorities do that is far more effective . ”
White House officials have said relatively little about the Pakistan side of the administration ’s evolving war strategy , in part because they have so few options and so little leverage .
They cannot send troops into Pakistan , and they cannot talk publicly about one of their most effective measures , the Central Intelligence Agency ’s Predator drone strikes in the country .
Stealth Travel In The USSR The East German Adventurers Who ' Escaped ' The Other Way
Many East Germans dreamt of Disneyland and shopping in London .
But an adventurous few went East instead , with the aim of climbing the highest peaks and rafting the wildest rivers in the Soviet Bloc .
Von Caroline Winter
( CNN ) --
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has long been known worldwide for its engineering programs , and a symposium at MIT this week will draw scientists from around the globe to focus on a hot facet of the field -- climate engineering .
The title of the symposium itself underscores the questions surrounding climate - changing science : " Engineering a Cooler Earth : Can We Do It ?
Should We Try ? "
Climate engineering may sound a little Frankensteinian and worrisome , but it 's not a new concept .
Governments and militaries have tried over the years to control the weather for various reasons -- and have mostly failed .
In the past decade , though , scientists have made major strides in developing technologies to cool the globe , and some of these processes are are gaining momentum among those who think drastic measures are needed to control the warming Earth .
The subject is rife with controversy , including whether intentional climate engineering itself is even new .
" Very broadly , we 're already engineering the climate .
The question now is whether we should do it on purpose , " said MIT associate professor of environmental policy and symposium participant Judith Layzer .
" That would involve taking action , inventing gizmos , and using them ideally to abate some of the warming that is expected to happen from global climate change . "
But not everyone agrees that , through decades of massive pollution , humans have already interfered with the climate on a global scale , albeit unintentionally .
Jim Fleming is a professor of science , technology and society at Colby College in Maine , and a speaker at the upcoming symposium .
" It 's the inadvertent , ' engineering through pollution ' argument , and I do n't really agree with it , " Fleming said .
" I 'm a historian of science , and I believe humans have been intervening on purpose for much longer than people will admit .
So one of the lessons of climate engineering , I think , is that some climate engineers insist they 're the first generation to purpose this deliberate manipulation .
... I think history says otherwise . "
There are several geo-engineering processes getting a lot of attention right now .
Creating an artificial cloud cover , or modifying clouds to reflect light back into space , is one of them .
But probably the more popular climate engineering technology now involves pumping sulfates into the atmosphere to block the sun 's rays and cool temperatures , similar to what happens in volcanic eruptions .
" In 1830 , the first national meteorologist of the U.S. , James Espy , proposed making artificial volcanoes of his own .
So whether it's weather or climate , this manipulation has been proposed and , in some cases attempted , for a very long time , " Fleming said .
Weather manipulation or modification can be traced to the 1940s and ' 50s , with a process called cloud seeding .
In cloud seeding , many chemicals -- including dry ice and silver iodide -- were tried to produce rain or snow .
In fact , author Kurt Vonnegut 's brother , Bernie Vonnegut , invented silver iodide when he worked at General Electric in the 1950s .
The Chinese and Russians have bragged about having weather - modifying technology for years .
" The Chinese have been claiming to have brought good weather to the Olympics for their parades .
And the mayor of Moscow just said he was going to stop all snow in the city for the whole winter , but he did n't get a good response from the suburbs , " Fleming said .
MIT 's Layzer thinks climate engineering will create new problems that will need their own solutions .
" The idea of taking a symptom of global warming , which is heat , and trying to mitigate that symptom seems to me to be just another form of parceling a large and comprehensive problem into bits and pieces , which will in turn need solutions . "
Layzer also sees it this way : " Climate engineering is just another example of treating a symptom .
Treating problems in a piecemeal way , actually you just move the problem from one place to another .
If you take pollution out of the air , you still have it .
You have to put it somewhere , so you put it in the water .
Then you 've polluted the water . "
All these issues will come up for discussion at the MIT symposium Friday .
Fleming sums up the symposium as a chance perhaps to learn what might not work , in addition to what might .
" Tinkering with the planet is dangerous , " he said .
" The lessons would be very similar to those learned in the weather control experiments .
It would be very difficult to measure and it might have incredible inadvertent and unwelcome side effects . "
The president has urged the police to get tough , but not " trigger happy " South Africa 's police chief has condemned the shooting of a three - year - old boy by an officer .
Bheki
Cele dismissed the officer 's claim that he fired in self defence , believing the pipe the boy was carrying to be a gun .
He told the BBC the killing was a " reckless criminal act " , saying : " Even if it was a real gun , you should not have started by shooting . "
But he defended the police 's right to use " deadly force " when necessary .
Atlegang Phalane was in a car the police thought was being driven by suspected criminals when he was shot in Midrand , near Johannesburg .
The policeman has been charged with murder and remains in custody .
Mr Cele told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
" You could have used other means on the three - year - old . "
Outrage
The police chief was appointed by President Jacob Zuma in July to lead the fight against the country 's high levels of crime .
Police have a right to use a deadly force when their life is under threat
Police chief Bheki Cele President Zuma said at the time that police should get tough , but said they should not be " trigger happy " .
Mr Cele said the police 's shoot - to - kill approach had nothing to do with the wrongful shooting of the boy .
" Police have a right to use a deadly force when their life is under threat , " he said .
" I do n't think that anybody can assess the situation and find that a three - year - old is putting your life in danger and under threat . "
The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says the shooting has caused public outrage and has been widely condemned .
Atlegang 's mother Mapule Phalane has accused the policeman of not being remorseful about the shooting .
" I could not believe my eyes when I arrived at the scene .
" He was busy eating a lollipop .
I approached him and asked why he killed my son , but he looked at me as if I was crazy , " said Ms Phalane , South Africa 's Sowetan newspaper reported .

From last December to this writing , the disease known to epidemiologists as H5N1 avian flu infected twenty - eight people in Vietnam , killing fourteen .
On the scale of global catastrophe that may not sound like a lot .
But World Health Organization officials worry that a worldwide outbreak could kill as many as seven million .
Human populations have proved particularly susceptible to new flu pandemics every twenty to thirty years , as flu strains mutate and overcome built - up immunities .
The most recent major flu pandemic petered out in 1972 , so we may be overdue .
Here are some noteworthy disease outbreaks through history .
1. Pneumonic plague .
Since last December there have been some 300 suspected cases of — and at least sixty - one deaths from — pneumonic plague in eastern Congo .
This is the largest plague outbreak since 1920 , when more than 9,000 Manchurians succumbed .
2. Severe acute respiratory syndrome .
SARS first appeared in China in November of 2002 , and was soon recognized as a coronavirus that caused high fevers and fatal pneumonia .
Over the course of the next eight months the disease infected more than 8,000 people and killed 774 in twenty - six countries .
3. West Nile virus .
Although outbreaks of this mosquito - borne encephalitis were identified as early as 1937 , in Uganda , West Nile did n't reach the United States until the summer of 1999 , when it infected sixty - two people and killed seven in New York City .
Since then more than 15,000 American cases — and more than 500 deaths — have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control .
Anne Pressly 's Murderer Convicted : ' It Was a Big Sigh of Relief , ' Friend Says Family and friends burst into tears as the verdict is read .
Nov. 12 , 2009  --
The verdict meant a huge sigh of relief for the Pressly family , according to a friend .
After only a few hours of deliberation Wednesday , a jury found Curtis Vance guilty in the murder and rape of Little Rock , Ark. , anchorwoman Anne Pressly .
" It feels like we 've held our breath over the last year and we were finally able to exhale a little bit , " Jessica Dean , a friend of Pressly 's , told " Good Morning America " this morning .
Prosecutors told the jurors in the trial that DNA evidence proved that Vance , 29 , was the one who broke into Pressly 's home last October and savagely beat and raped her until she was unconscious .
Pressly died five days later .
Dean described her friend as remarkably funny , smart and dedicated .
" She was the most loyal of friends , " Dean said .
" She was one of those people who made you laugh from the belly all the way up . "
Today the jury will decide whether Vance should receive the death penalty or life in prison .
Prosecutors said the DNA evidence also linked Vance to another attack , the rape of a schoolteacher in Marianna , Ark. , about 100 miles away .
The defense argued that police duped Vance into giving several contradictory confessions regarding Pressly 's death .
Patti Cannady , Pressly 's mother , was the first person to see her daughter lying unconscious , bloodied and beaten " beyond recognition . "
Cannady was among the first witnesses to take the stand .
Dean described Pressly 's parents as " pillars of strength " through the ordeal .
" They have set this example , and I know they have drawn strongly from their faith , " Dean said .
" When we get into the fetal position and can't do it anymore we look to Patti and Guy . "
Pressly 's Mother 's Heartwrenching Testimony
From the witness stand , Cannady stared down at Vance and then , choking back tears , described the nightmare of discovering her daughter 's battered body .
" It was horrific , " she told the jury .
" I absolutely could not take the scene in .
I could not imagine what I was seeing when I found my daughter . "
Pressly was a popular morning news anchor in Little Rock .
Before the attack , her parents used to call at 3 a .m. to make sure she was awake .
But on the morning of Oct. 20 , 2008 , after repeated calls , there was no answer .
Frantic , Cannady rushed to her daughter 's home .
She found the back door wide open , and inside , her daughter was gasping for breath in a pool of blood .
" It was Anne , but she was so swollen and her hair was completely matted with blood , she was beyond recognition , " Cannady said .
" There was blood on the ceiling .
That 's how horrific her attack was . "
A nurse who also testified told the court she had never seen anyone so badly wounded who was still alive .
In opening statements , prosecutors told jurors that DNA evidence would provide all the proof necessary to convince them that Vance is guilty and also linked to another brutal rape .
The defense said Vance was arrested only because police were under pressure to arrest someone in for Pressly 's killing .
Cannady had previously said she was determined to look her daughter 's murderer in the eye .
" I am not leaving , " she said .
" I will see this person eye - to - eye .
They 'll have to face me .
And God . "
Pressly 's Case May Have Helped Solve Another Crime
Police said Vance did not know the anchorwoman before allegedly beating her to death .
As reported on " 20/20 " in December , the investigation into Pressly 's murder may have helped solve a second crime .
Kristen Edwards , of Marianna , Ark. , was raped and attacked in April .
Police said that DNA evidence from Pressly 's crime scene matched Edwards ' attacker , and detectives from both cities collaborated to search for a suspect .
Edwards was attacked while getting ready for work .
" It was a surprise , " Edwards told ABC News .
" He was hiding in my living room , and I never saw it coming .
Never saw it coming . "
Edwards ' attacker had come at her from behind , and forced her to lie on her stomach so she could not see his face .
Edwards said her rapist warned her not to turn around and told her he had a gun and would kill her if she tried to look at him .
And while she feared for her life until the end , she survived .
" I pretty much did as I was told to do , " she said .
" I did n't look , I did n't fight , I stopped yelling -- that sort of thing . "
But Pressly fought back against her attacker .
Doctors also found that her left hand had been broken , a defensive wound .
DNA Evidence Holds Key to Case
From day one , Little Rock police had powerful evidence in Pressly 's case .
She had fought her attacker , and detectives recovered DNA from sperm , blood and his skin , taken from beneath Pressly 's fingernails .
" We believed that we had enough to charge somebody if we just knew who that person was , " said Lt. Terry Hastings , the public information officer for the Little Rock Police Department .
Tip Lead to Arrest of Vance
The case broke when Vance was stopped by police because of a suspicious license plate .
Some things
Vance said make police suspicious , and they asked for a DNA swab , which Vance agreed to supply .
Vance 's DNA matched in both cases , but by then , he had fled from his home , and Little Rock police held a Thanksgiving eve news conference asking for help from the public .
A woman in Marianna said she had seen a man who resembled Vance near her home , and Lori Garner , a personal trainer at a gym a handful of blocks from where Pressly lived , told police she saw a man stalking women around the gym just before the murder .
She and her client agreed Vance was the man they had seen .
" I feel confident with my opinion that it was him , " she said .
The tips paid off almost immediately .
Within an hour and a half , police had surrounded a Little Rock home and Vance gave up peacefully .
While Vance denied the murder , police said , he admitted to being at Pressly 's house .
" We believe he probably saw her in the neighborhood , probably getting gas , maybe doing something else , and then followed her and attacked her , " Hastings said .
" He denied being involved in it in any way .
But his DNA told us otherwise . "
Pressly 's parents said returning to their daughter 's house was difficult .
" When I had to go to Anne 's house and close it up for the last time ...
It was hard , " her father , Guy Cannady , said .
" When I walked out that door , locked the door for the last time and walked away .
It 's something I 'll never forget . "

Eikenberry AP WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The U.S. envoy in Afghanistan , a former Army general who once commanded troops in the country , has objected strongly to emerging plans to send tens of thousands of additional forces to the country , a senior U.S. official said Wednesday .
Ambassador Karl Eikenberry resigned his Army commission to take the job as U.S. ambassador in Kabul earlier this year , and his is an influential voice among those advising President Obama on Afghanistan .
Eikenberry sent multiple classified cables to Washington over the past week that question the wisdom of adding forces when the Afghan political situation is unstable and uncertain , said an official familiar with the cables .
The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations and the classified documents .
Cables are diplomatic messages that may or may not be classified and carry greater heft than other forms of communication such as e-mail .
Eikenberry made the point that the administration should step cautiously in planning for any troop buildup while there are still so many questions surrounding Afghan President Hamid Karzai , the official said .
Eikenberry is the front line U.S. official dealing with Karzai , the U.S. - backed leader whose administration was stained by corruption and mismanagement .
It was a visiting senior senator , Democrat John Kerry of Massachusetts , who was instrumental in persuading Karzai last month to accept the findings of a U.N. panel that his re-election vote in August was too marred by fraud to stand .
Karzai agreed to a second round of voting but was elevated to a second term as president without a runoff election when his challenger dropped out .
Since then , U.S. officials have been alarmed at some of Karzai 's remarks and the lack , so far , of meaningful steps to clean house .
Eikenberry 's objections were a wild card in the midst of what had appeared to be the final days of Obama 's long decision - making process on how to revamp U.S. strategy in the 8 - year war .
Eikenberry has participated in some of Obama 's war council sessions over the past several weeks .
A senior U.S. official told the Associated Press that Obama rejected all four options presented to him at what had been expected to be the last of those sessions Wednesday .
Those options started from the premise that some addition of U.S. forces is necessary , and included ways that Obama could meet or nearly meet war commander Gen.
Stanley McChrystal 's preference for about 40,000 additional troops .
It is not clear whether Eikenberry 's objections played a part in Obama 's decision not to accept any of the choices prepared by military planners Wednesday .
At his Senate confirmation hearing in March , Eikenberry underscored what he called the urgency of the requirement to turn around the war effort , which has evolved into a stalemate in key parts of Afghanistan as the Taliban - led insurgency has gained clout .
" Time is of the essence , " Eikenberry said .
" There will be no substitute for more resources and sacrifice . "
He said Europeans , for example , should be expected to provide more mentors for Afghan police trainees .
Another key to success , he said , is getting more civilian experts such as agriculture specialists and justice experts who can help reduce Afghanistan 's dependence on the illicit narcotics trade .
Eikenberry was the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan for two years before moving to Brussels to be deputy chairman of NATO 's military committee in 2007 .
He had served one previous tour in Afghanistan .

On Thursday it will be 25 years since British scientist Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys invented the DNA fingerprint in his laboratory at the University of Leicester .
The professor 's ' eureka ' moment came at 0905 on the morning of Monday 10 September 1984 , when he went into his darkroom to develop an X - ray film from an experiment looking at highly variable bits of DNA .
The film threw up an unexpected result - every individual in the sample had a different bar code and could be identified with precision .
DNA pioneer on ' eureka ' moment 25 years ago Today , more than 30 m people worldwide have had a DNA profile .
It is a major tool in solving crime , and the standard method of resolving paternity and immigration disputes .
Kirk Bloodsworth has more reason than most to appreciate the impact of the technique .
He was the first man to be freed from death row in the United States on the basis of DNA evidence .
Speaking to Newsnight at his home in Cambridge , Maryland , Mr Bloodsworth described what Prof Jeffreys ' work had meant for him : " He may not have known it at the time , but he was saving my life - and the lives of many others . "
Bid for freedom Mr Bloodsworth spent nearly nine years in prison , and two on death row , convicted of the violent rape and murder of a nine - year - old girl near Baltimore in 1984 .
Five eye - witnesses said that they saw him at the scene .
He was 24 years old when he began his sentence .
Stretching his arms out wide he described his prison cell : " I could take three steps to the back and touch either wall if I put out my hands , " he said .
It was in his cell in 1992 that Mr Bloodsworth read a book describing how DNA fingerprinting in Britain had solved the killings of Dawn Ashworth and Lynda Mann in Leicestershire .
The prime suspect in the case had been found to be innocent , and Colin Pitchfork had become the first man to be convicted of murder on the basis of DNA fingerprint evidence Mr Bloodsworth says that while reading the book he had his own " eureka " moment .
He realised that he could use DNA fingerprint evidence in his case , and that if it could be used to convict someone , it could be used to free them , too .
At that time , there were only two laboratories in the US carrying out DNA profiles , but Mr Bloodsworth pushed for the material evidence against him to be tested .
Initially he was told that the evidence , traces of semen in the victim 's underwear , had been " inadvertently destroyed " .
Exonerated However , he persisted , and the evidence eventually turned up in a paper bag in a judge 's chambers .
We spent four or five years togethe .
He never said a word .
Mr Bloodsworth on sharing a jail with the real killer
The results of the DNA test came back , and his lawyer told him over the telephone that he was " excluded 100 % as the person responsible " .
Mr Bloodsworth described " screaming and hollering " as he ran through the corridors of the prison , knowing that he was soon to be free man .
He was released from prison and paid compensation , but he was not formally exonerated .
It was this , he said , that inspired him to track down the real killer .
Mr Bloodsworth spent the next decade pushing for the DNA sample to be run through a database containing DNA data from crime laboratories in the US , to check if it held the identity of Dawn Hamilton 's real killer .
Despite multiple witnesses having placed Mr Bloodsworth at the murder scene , the man eventually found guilty of the murder , Kimberly Shay Ruffner , turned out to be an entirely different height and weight to Mr Bloodsworth .
In an extraordinary twist , Ruffner , who was already in prison serving time for attempted murder , was held for a time in the same facility as Mr Bloodsworth .
He slept on the floor below and the two men came into regular contact , even lifting weights together .
But Ruffner never gave any indication he was responsible for the murder which Mr Bloodsworth was serving time for .
" We spent four or five years together , " Mr Bloodsworth told me .
" He never said a word . "
Legacy Prof Jeffreys still works in the same laboratory at Leicester University where he made his discovery .

He described meeting Mr Bloodsworth at a London awards ceremony a few years ago : " It was a great privilege , " he said .
" One of the most emotional and touching moments of my life .
No question about it .
To actually meet a man whose life had literally been saved by DNA , was quite remarkable . "
Prof Jeffreys added that he had read Mr Bloodsworth 's book detailing his experiences and said that he was " amazed it has n't been made in to a Hollywood movie " .
Mr Bloodsworth , however , has higher goals .
He now works for the Justice Project , fighting wrongful convictions .
He was instrumental in the passing of a piece of legislation called the Innocent Protection Act , which has a provision known as the Kirk Bloodsworth Post - Conviction DNA Testing Programme .
With $ 15 m of federal funding to help states pay for DNA testing , it is already making a difference across the country .
" I do n't want the fact that I was the first person to be freed because of DNA testing to be my only legacy in life , " Mr Bloodsworth explained .
" I want it to be that I showed the world , I showed the US , that if it happened to me , it could happen to you .
" I know there 's more mistakes out there and none of us should ever sentence an innocent man to death or prison . "
In a final homage to Prof Jeffreys , Mr Bloodsworth quoted Sir Isaac Newton : " Newton said : ' If I see furthest , it 's because I 've stood on the shoulders of giants . '
Jeffreys is one of those giants now , a phenomenal man .
" I just can't thank him enough for what he 's done .
It 's unbelievable .
His gifts in life will be all the men and women he 's got out of jail and convicting the ones that need to go . "
Have your say :
Have you taken a DNA test ?

The tower was built in the 1970s by a foundation of Iran 's former shah US prosecutors have begun legal action to seize four mosques and a New York city skyscraper that are owned by a non-profit Muslim organisation .
Lawyers say the Alavi Foundation has been helping to illegally funnel money to Bank Melli , which is owned by the Iranian government .
The bank is accused of funding Iran 's nuclear weapons programme .
US citizens are banned from dealing with it .
The mosques and the office tower will remain open while the case continues .
The government 's forfeiture action was filed in a federal court in New York .
Any seizure has to be authorised by the court , and it may take a long time for the case to come to fruition , says the BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington .
Sanctions renewed Prosecutors are seeking more than $ 500 m ( £ 300 m ) in assets belonging to the Alavi Foundation , in what could prove to be one of the biggest counter - terrorism seizures in US history .
They include four Shia mosques in New York City , Maryland , California and Houston , as well as a 36 - story office building on New York 's Fifth Avenue .
The Alavi Foundation owns a 60 % stake in the tower , also known as the Piaget building , the Dow Jones news service reports .
Last December , the government filed suit against Assa Corporation , which owns the other 40 % stake in the building , and which is also accused of being under Iranian government control .
In court papers filed last month , Assa asked for the case to be dismissed , saying US prosecutors were attempting to " broaden the scope of the US forfeiture laws beyond Congress ' intent " , Dow Jones said .
Also on Thursday , US President Barack Obama renewed the longstanding US economic sanctions against Iran for another year , the White House said .
Mr Obama sought to reach out diplomatically to Iran soon after taking power in January , but little progress has been made over Iran 's disputed nuclear programme .

How do you create a campaign that gives the players absolute freedom but still leaves the GM in control ?
Recently , Campaign Mastery was asked ,
Is it possible to create a truly player - choice driven campaign ( within reason ) ?
I ’m trying to create a campaign that ’s anywhere from 75 – 90 % roleplaying ( there will be dice , but not battle so much ) .
I ’ve been developing the campaign for some time now and have a list of interconnected rumors which , if followed in the right order , will lead the PCs to bigger and bigger discoveries .
There are even totally different directions in which to take the campaign if another set of rumors is followed … .
The problem is that , even though I ’ve not had any of the rumors be false , if connected in the PCs ’ minds in the wrong manner , the rumors could lead them to believe the wrong thing .
( In trying to start this particular campaign , I had just that very thing happen . )
This can be problematic when trying to have the players wrap their minds around the plot .
Also , to keep things interesting ( since I ’m using rumors as a starting point from the game ) , should I give out red herrings as well ?
Any advice would be appreciated .
Mike ’s Answer :
The good news is that it IS possible .
In fact , it sounds like you are well on your way to achieving your objectives .
However , it also sounds like you are well on your way to running a plot train ( with limited switching points ) and are concerned about it running off the rails .
This would make it no more character - driven than a colouring book ; but again , you seem to have escaped this particular trap fairly adroitly , letting the characters believe whatever conclusions the players have reached , regardless of whether or not that is what is actually taking place .
You should never force the players to wrap their heads around the plot – in a truly character - driven campaign , they will make mistakes and wrong assumptions , and reach faulty conclusions .
But they will also learn from these .
So here ’s my recipe for making your campaign truly character - diven , regardless of the amount of combat that you want to take place , based on the process that I am using in my Shards Of Divinity campaign :
Prerequisite : Active Players with Motivated Characters
The first thing to note is that none of this will work if your players are the types who need their scenarios served up to them on a plate .
And the second thing to note is that it wo n’t work unless the PCs come pre-loaded with back stories that motivate them to be interested .
A little personal stake in the outcome makes a big difference .
The key to achieving the first is something that ’s eluded me for decades , so I ca n’t help you there , but it sounds like you ’ve got that aspect of things cooking along quite nicely anyway ( I ’m moderately jealous , but would n’t trade in the players I ’ve got anyway ) .
The key to achieving the second is to ensure that much of the character backgrounds are open - ended , unresolved , or otherwise unexplained .
Even if the character thinks he knows why the Warlord slew his parents , and that the Warlord was captured and hung for his attempted revolution , and has written as much in his background , you can still place a hidden shadowy figure behind the known villain that the character knows nothing about – in which case , the revolution may have gone underground , but the wheels are still in motion , and rumours of distant events deriving from the revolutionary activities should resonate with this element of the character ’s background .
Establish the big picture
The first step to achieving a truly character - driven campaign is to determine the big picture – who are the various vested interests , and who are the opposition ( in general terms ) .
Note that there will be many of these , and most of them will be side - issues to the real plot .
Power brings power - struggles with it , almost by definition .
It does n’t matter what someone has , someone else will want it .
Every significant power bloc should have a defined opposing power bloc , and the drive of the campaign should emerge from the tension , the move - and - countermove , between these groups .
And do n’t neglect the potential of groups that are being blackmailed into activities they would not normally countenance , or of groups targeting the wrong enemies , etc !
These opposing groups , and the current state of play between them , should be part of your campaign briefing materials , the springboards from which the players generate their character backgrounds .
But it is always possible to reverse - engineer the information from existing character backgrounds .
In fact , I would go further than that , and state that the GM should re-engineer his campaign background after the PCs have been generated , just to make sure that everything fits .
One of the best techniques is to treat the character background generation process as a series of mini one - on - one roleplaying sessions .
Take an hour with each player to work through the past history of the character and how the different factions and campaign history have influenced them .
This can either be done in place of a day ’s play , or can be done away from the table .
Generate rumours
There ’s usually a vast gulf between what is actually happening and what the general public thinks is happening .
Generate rumours that describe the latter , and pre-load your characters with them .
These are usually the mere tip of the iceberg in comparison to the real story , but these breadcrumbs are starting points .
Some of these will never become relevant to the campaign , some should be out - and - out wrong , and some should hold a nugget of truth .
Some should directly conflict with the rumours given to other players .
Some should be wildly improbable .
It ’s up to the character to assess how credible he finds them .
To generate these , I usually start with a true statement describing an event and break it into short , declarative sentences .
I then wash each sentence through a “ Chinese Whispers ” process – rephrasing and restating the message , changing factual information slightly , occasionally inverting or distorting the meaning .
I ’ll generally roll a d6+2 for the number of times each sentence should be ‘ processed ’ – what comes out is a bunch of rumours describing the incident .
Most of these changes will be in the direction of heightened drama , even of melodrama .
Exaggeration , hyperbole , and rumours go hand in hand !
Sometimes I will like the ‘ amped up ’ version so much that I ’ll make it the literal truth and start the process over !
Generate propaganda
Every power bloc will generate propaganda of some kind .
This might be to play up or play down their activities and motivations , or to assign blame for something to their enemies ( however big a stretch it is ) .
Each PC , by virtue of who they are and who they have had contact with , will be ‘ exposed ’ to this propaganda , which can also be stated in the form of rumours ; their relationship with the source will dictate the level of credibility .
If a rumour will not be believed by the character because their opinion is coloured by their existing relationship with the source , that rumour should be rephrased as a ‘ conspiracy theory ’ element before it is given to the character ; instead of a rumour that “ X did Y , ” tell the character that “ The [ prejudice target ] is trying to make people think that X did Y , ” where the ‘ prejudice target ’ is someone that the character already thinks the worst of .
I will often run the results through the “ Chinese Whispers ” process a couple of times before doing so .
Exaggeration and Hyperbole , always !
This is usually impossible to decide until the character histories are known , and hence what rumoured actions the character will find credible .
And the resulting rumours should be interspersed with those from the previous section , more or less at random , so that players ca n’t block - assign credibility assessments .
Determine next actions
Once you know who the power blocs are , and how they operate , you can also decide what each faction ’s next step is going to be , even if the answer is “ lie low until the heat dies down ” .
Have any recent events in the campaign background presented an opportunity that is too good to resist ?
Have a faction take action accordingly .
Have any recent events left a faction vulnerable ?
Alliances may be formed or broken , leopards may change their spots , etc .
Every faction should always be doing something to bring advantage to themselves and disadvantage ( or discomfort ) to their enemies – even if they are nominally on the same side !
Generate rumours of the results
You do n’t have to decide on the outcome just yet – these are events that are taking place concurrently with the PCs adventures , and in which they may take a passing interest or even an active involvement .
You should always scale these broad actions down to determine what the local events are that the PCs will see , first - hand , based on where they are and where they intend to go next .
The other thing that needs to be done is to note when these actions will become apparent to the faction ’s opposition , and how long they will actually take to complete .
Generate rumours of impending enemy responses
Every action has an unequal and opposing reaction , to misstate one of the most famous laws of physics .
This misstatement is literally true when it comes to the maneuverings of factions – their enemies will always take an opposing position , i.e. will react in some manner , and the strength of this reaction will always be greater or less than the original action , depending on the level of threat perceived in the original action .
The smarter the heads of each faction , the more appropriate their response will be .
Some of these reactions will be covert , some will be overt , and many will have a secondary reaction designed to act as a ‘ cover story ’ or misinformation to distract the enemy while the real move is being made .
Of course , no reaction can take place until the target faction knows there is something to react to , and by the time an action is complete , it ’s usually too late to undo the effects .
The numbers assigned to these two time - frames in the previous section dictate the window of opportunity for a counter - operation by the target faction , and the later into that window a reaction comes , the more likely it is that it will need to be some overt response .
Determine actual enemy responses
It ’s my preference to come up with half - a- dozen possible reactions in the form of rumours , ranging from the improbable to the near - certain , wash these through the “ Chinese Whispers ” technique a few times , then pick the actual reaction that will take place .
None of these reactions will take place in a vacuum – all the moves being made by other factions , against other targets , will change the environment just a little .
Other , presently uninvolved , factions may also get involved because they perceive an opportunity or a threat .
Each reaction then becomes a new action in this never - ending game of chess .
Update ‘ The Big Picture ’ regularly
These ‘ boxing matches ’ may be economic , or political , or social , or related to intelligence - gathering , or propagandist , in nature .
A major side - benefit is that the campaign background is never static ; it is always evolving , and introducing new plotlines that the PCs can get involved in .
This obviates any need for plot trains at the same time as it brings the world to life for the players .
The downside is that as each action matures , the campaign background needs to be updated .
For this reason , I like to stagger the outcomes of actions , making some brief and opportunist , and others subtle , preplanned , and long - term .
The nature of the faction clearly needs to be a factor in these determinations .
As a rule of thumb , I like no more than two factions to have acted or reacted in any given post - session update ; this keeps the campaign admin at a manageable level .
Another advantage of this approach is that the material that can be given to new players , or new characters , is always pretty much ready - to - go .
And if you take a holiday it ’s relatively easy to get back into the swing of things by reading through your updated background .
Listen to your players ’s ideas
Your players will put 2+2 together and come out with 7 on a regular basis .
Sometimes , their ideas will be better than yours ; sometimes , you will have a grand plan that their ideas do n’t fit .
You should always take the player ’s theories and consider them carefully to decide whether or not they are better than your own .
And if they are , you smile , give them a metaphoric pat on the back , and never admit the truth !
They will not only think of themselves as brilliant ( and pride goeth before a fall ) , but because you agree with them , they will see you as brilliantly Machiavellian to boot .
Make an INT check for the speaker
One approach is to secretly make an INT roll for the character whose player announces the theory .
Succeed , and their theory is correct ; fail and they ’ve got it wrong .
All game systems have some sort of mechanism that addresses this need , or can be adapted to it .
The result is that no matter how brilliant the player might be , it ’s the character whose brilliance or lack thereof that is reflected in the campaign events .
Of course , if you really like the idea , you can ignore or even fudge this roll !
Even if there are some plot holes or logic errors to be filled in , this can still be a powerful weapon in making the campaign credible .
Red Herrings
These should be part and parcel of any set of rumours .
In fact , many of the results of the steps described above wo n’t be characterised as anything else by most DMs .
The alternative is for the rumours to give a roadmap to the overall plot , once a few side - roads created by mistakes in logic ( or simple misjudgements by the players ) are eliminated .
Nothing kills game - play quicker than being able to predict with certainty every step of the rest of the campaign ; it kills the suspense .
I have seen suggestions that red herrings should outweigh true rumours by 5 - to - 1 or more .
I do n’t agree with that ; much of this quota will be met by rumours that are related to the truth , but heavily distorted , and I do n’t consider those to be true “ red herrings ” as they still advance the plot .
A genuine Red Herring is a deliberately - false rumour that is inserted into the mix for the express purposes of deception .
The problem is that if there are too many of these , players will never be able to sort the wheat from the chaff and , as you put it , “ get their heads around the plot ” .
Worse still , the players may come to feel that the DM is deliberately trying to deceive them .
That ’s why the majority of false rumours are not red herrings per se , just propaganda from one faction or another ; that then becomes something that illuminates the nature of that faction , and something that is “ their ” fault , not something that is “ you vs the players ” .
I think that a ratio of one - in - five or even one - in - ten is about right , representing people who invent wild stories out of thin air for the pleasure of hearing themselves speak ( and to make themselves , however briefly , the centre of attention ) .
Pink Salmon
I am especially fond of rumours that can be easily dismissed as Red Herrings – but are n’t .
A few pieces of “ Pink Salmon ” – to extend the metaphore – makes everything more credible .
It ’s always possible that some of the wild stories invented by these local wits and spread far and wide by the gossip of passing travellers actually hit the nail on the head .
Be selective , though ; you do n’t want to introduce a “ the more improbable it sounds , the more likely it is to be true ” dynamic into your rumours , because that also kills the mystery and suspense of the campaign .
As a rule of thumb , 1 - in - 5 or 1 - in - 10 “ Red Herrings ” should actually be Pink Salmon .
White Salmon
PT Barnum could sell just about anything .
The story is that he once came into possession of a truckload of grey salmon , which are neither especially popular nor tasty .
He relabelled them “ White Salmon , ” ( there ’s no such thing ) “ Guaranteed never to have been pink ” .
And sold the lot at premium prices .
Perception and salesmanship counts for a lot .
Rumours are no good if you do n’t sell them to the players through roleplay .
Any tavern scene should involve a chat with the local gossip to get the latest unofficial news and a sense of local affairs .
These should be two - way conversations , in which the players get to pass on rumours they ’ve heard as well as receive new ones .
In essence , you have to label your rumours as “ White Salmon ” and sell them to the players .
It might seem that it ’s enough to convince the characters of the validity of rumour # 112 , but it ’s not .
The players may have their characters act as though deceived , but it ’s not very satisfying when the players know better .
So make no mistake , this is an essential application of metagaming that can have a major influence on the entertainment value of your game – you might be pitching your rumours at the characters , but it ’s the players you have to convince .
Maintain an atmosphere of uncertainty
This is so important that , even though I ’ve mentioned the maintenance of suspense a couple of times , it bears repeating again .
Some GMs suggest that every time the players figure out what is really going on , the universe should be torn down and replaced with something even stranger ( shades of The Hitch - hiker ’s Guide To The Galaxy ! ) .
Personally , I would n’t go that far ; you risk a complete loss of credibility and of the players losing all confidence in their ability to actively decide their own fates .
In effect , you can convince the players they are on a plot train even when they are n’t , if you go too far – I speak from personal experience .
This requires a judgement call or two on the part of the GM .
Will the player ’s knowledge of the truth impact their immediate activities ?
Then they ’ve got it right , and should be congratulated .
Will their knowledge of the truth have a negative impact on the entertainment value of future scenarios , or will it enhance it by offering a glimpse behind the curtains ?
If the first , then they ’ve got it wrong and the GM needs to introduce a new explanation for what ’s happened ; if the second , then they have it right .
If both these judgement calls leave the question in a gray area in between , then the rule of thumb I use is that the players are probably right , but something prevents them confirming it – for now .
It becomes a deeply - held suspicion of the characters , nothing more .
It is also important to note that juicy rumours do n’t stop just because the PCs have proved or disproved them , and resolved the source upon which they were based ; rumours should linger , and occasionally raise doubts about whether or not the problem really WAS resolved !
Imminence brings revelation and certainty
The more involved in any given faction - fight the characters get , the more reliable should be the information they receive .
The closer to fruition a faction ’s plan becomes , the more blatantly obvious it should become – though this is always a relative value .
Consider the land invasion of the allies in World War II : at first , it was just speculation when and where it would occur ; then it became inevitable that sooner or later it would occur , but where and when were still no more than guesswork ; then preparations for doing so got underway and deception and misdirection were employed to make sure that the enemy did n’t know where and when it would take place ; and then finally it actually happened , at which point it quickly became certain where and when it had taken place .
Example of the “ Chinese rumours ” technique :
1. Bishop Luabird spent $ 100 on lady ’s underwear .
2. A Bishop in good standing spent $ 100 on exotic lingerie .
3 . A disreputable bishop in the south regularly buys exotic lingerie .
4 . A disreputable bishop in the south wears exotic lingerie .
5 . A disreputable bishop in the south wears the skin of a devil as underclothes .
6 . A bishop in the west wears the skin of a devil .
7 . A disreputable bishop in the northeast is controlled by the skin of a devil that he wears under his clothes .
Now feed the last three to the PCs !
Notice that even if the original rumour is true , there is no explanation of why the Bishop needed the underclothes !
Summary :
The key to running a completely character - driven campaign is to work out what the opposition is doing , generate rumours accordingly ( including exaggerations and red herrings ) , and then let the players interpret these as they will .
Rumours will often persist long after the cause of the rumour has been resolved – which should leave your PCs always wondering whether or not they have really solved “ The Riddle Of The Headless Horse Thief ” or whatever .
Then let the players decide what their characters deem interesting enough , or important enough , or even simply credible enough , to get involved in .
And when they make that decision , the first thing they are going to have to do is find out what ’s really going on – which means roleplay .

Great process , Mike !
I especially like the rumour washing .
That ’s a nifty little engine GMs should master because they can get so much value from constant use of it .

One after another , surfers young and older trooped to the microphone to recount their encounters with the polluted waves off Malibu ’s Surfrider Beach .
They told of bouts of diarrhea , conjunctivitis that would n’t heal and heart - damaging Coxsackie B4 virus .
Some talked of inhaling the pervasive Malibu stench and watching raw sewage pour through the city ’s streets and parking lots .
In the end , the testimony of the surfers helped carry the day Thursday for supporters of a ban on new septic systems in the vibrant commercial heart of one of Southern California ’s most exclusive enclaves .
Under the prohibition , no new septic systems will be allowed and owners of existing commercial and residential systems will have to halt discharges within the next decade .

Given that Malibu formed its own city government in 1991 to avoid what it viewed as a scheme by Los Angeles County to install sewers and unleash a wave of development , the decision Thursday marked a turning of the tide .
The years - long battle over water quality in Malibu has been a strange collision of slow - growth advocates who viewed septic tanks and leach pits as a check against rapid development and surfers and environmentalists who contended the systems were fouling the city ’s groundwater and , by extension , Malibu Creek , Malibu Lagoon and Santa Monica Bay .
In the opinion of many , Malibu dragged its feet for so long that regional water quality officials had no choice but to impose a moratorium .
“ The city is recalcitrant still , ” surfer Joe Melchione said .
“ Their record of compliance is abysmal . ”

Malibu is a city that wears its green credentials on its Hawaiian shirt sleeves , but its environmental reputation has taken a beating the last several years .
Its watershed is considered tainted , and its most popular beach often gets an F on the annual Heal the Bay report card .
Researcher after researcher has blamed stressed septic tanks and leaking leach fields as a leading cause of water pollution .
Nonetheless , the septic moratorium did not sit well with many residents and business owners who attended the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board meeting in downtown Los Angeles .
Architect Mike Barsocchini , whose Malibu Knolls neighborhood is affected by the ban , faulted it as an “ iron fist ” approach in a situation that called for a “ velvet glove . ”
Residents who use existing septic systems in Malibu Knolls , Serra Retreat and Malibu Colony will have until 2019 to hook into a central wastewater treatment system or otherwise comply with the mandate .
The Civic Center commercial area must comply by 2015 .
The city projects that homeowners in the moratorium zone would pay about $ 500 a month for centralized wastewater treatment .
Businesses would pay $ 6,800 to $ 17,000 a month , depending on the amount of wastewater produced .

Proud of their pristine canyons and gorgeous stretch of coast , Malibu residents have grown accustomed to pumping septic tanks and hiring waste - haulers , even as federal , state and local water quality officials pushed , prodded and nudged the city to figure out how to clean up the pollution .
“ The lack of adequate sanitation is a basic public nuisance issue , ” said Madelyn Glickfeld , a water board member who lives in Point Dume .
“ Here we are in one of the richest cities in the U.S. , and we have sewage running down the street . ”
Until the vote was taken , Malibu had hoped to avoid the prohibition .
In testimony , Malibu would not even concede that septic systems were a major cause of pollution ; U.S. Geological Service and UCLA scientists testified that fresh samplings of water along the coast suggest that bacteria spikes appeared to be unrelated to on - site wastewater treatment systems .
The city had proposed a phased wastewater treatment plan , with no septic moratorium , for the Civic Center area and Serra Retreat .
Under that plan , Malibu Colony homes and two commercial zones on Pacific Coast Highway east of Malibu Creek would have been required to install disinfection equipment on their existing septic systems .
Advertisement
The board found that plan inadequate .
“ It has been many , many , many years that they were supposed to be on the path to making this happen , ” water board chairwoman Mary Ann Lutz said Friday .
Lutz expressed compassion for residents and business owners who have invested in their personal state - of - the - art wastewater treatment systems .
Rick Margolis , who needed five years to obtain permits to build a house in the moratorium zone , said he is spending $ 150,000 for such a system .
“ Now you ’re telling us that ’s for nothing , ” he said .
“ It ’s just a fairness issue . ”

Lutz said the city was to blame .
" I ’m grateful they built the good systems , but many of them should n’t have had to spend that money .
There should have been a system in place , ” she said .
“ The city should have been ahead of the game or alerting them .
The city took no steps toward ensuring the infrastructure would be there . ”
Malibu City Manager Jim Thorsen said Friday that he was disappointed by the water board decision and found flaws in the moratorium .
“ If we ca n’t disperse it in the ground , we ’re limited in our ability to build a treatment plant , ” he said .
For now , he said , the city will focus on whether it should “ make a concerted effort ” to get the state water board to reject the moratorium .

Glickfeld , the board member who lives in Point Dume , said Malibu should focus on figuring out how to recycle water for irrigation and other uses .
“ With water use and costs so high , they ’re going to need it here , ” she said .
“ I ’m like a doctor , telling Malibu : ‘ Take this , it ’s good for you . ’ ”

* GE will have right to redeem new NBCU stake for cash
* Deal unlikely to be announced before 3 to 4 weeks
* News Corp , Liberty Media interested in NBC - CNBC
( Adds deal details , byline )
NEW YORK , Oct 12 ( Reuters ) - General Electric GE.N could start to exit a new NBC Universal joint venture with Comcast Corp CMCSA .
O as soon as three - and - a - half years after the ink is dried , two people familiar with the talks said on Monday .
Comcast is in talks with NBC Universal ’s parent company GE to buy a controlling stake in the joint venture that has broadcast and cable channels as well as movies and theme parks
Under the proposal , NBC Universal would become a joint venture 51 percent owned by Comcast and 49 percent by GE .
It would be valued at around $ 30 billion .
Comcast would contribute around $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion in cash as well as its collection of cable networks to pay for its stake .
The deal has involved a lot of back and forth negotiations between both sides .
But GE , which has been pressured by investors to offload its 80 percent stake in NBC Universal , is considering a host of proposals for the unit , as partner Vivendi SA VIV .
PA explores whether to sell its 20 percent stake .
GE has negotiated a redemption option , that will give it the right to redeem all or part of its stake in the so - called ‘ newco ’ in exchange for cash at the three - and - a - half year mark and at a seven - year mark , the sources said .
They spoke anonymously because the talks are private .
The new NBC Universal is expected to be able generate enough cash to pay down $ 9 billion in debt that would be added to its books as part of the deal , and purchase the rest of the company from GE .
“ There ’s a sense there will be sufficient cash flow to do that , ” said one person familiar with the talks .
But under the deal being negotiated , Comcast would also provide a backstop of around “ mid - single billion ” dollars , if there is insufficient cash to buy out GE ’s stake within the agreed time frame , according to the sources .
Talks between Comcast and GE continue , and it is unlikely the two sides will reach a deal in the next three - to - four weeks , a second source said .
Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp NWSA.O and John Malone 's Liberty Media Corp LINTA.
O are also interested in NBC Universal , though neither has approached GE so far , CNBC reported , citing sources .
News Corp , which owns the Fox cable network and local TV stations , had been seen as a less likely bidder , analysts have said , because taking a stake in NBC might raise antitrust concerns with the U.S. government .
Liberty Media has been seen as possible bidder for a minority stake in NBC Universal because of its history of taking minority stakes in big media companies .
GE is likely to prefer a sale to Comcast despite the complex structure of the deal being discussed , rather than explore options that would bring even more complexities , the source added .
Spokespeople for GE , News Corp and Liberty Media declined to comment .

While I was growing up I considered myself to be a dedicated Christian .
I attended a conservative Lutheran church which appeared privately opposed to abortion and homosexuality , but appreciative of a scientific setting and a historically accurate study of the bible .
I did n’t feel my beliefs were radical , but that they were righteous and following Christ ’s teachings was n’t just the path to salvation but also an exemplary way to live your life .
This article attempts to describe my recent spiritual journey .
It starts several years ago when I began to feel some discord between the morality of the bible and my own moral compass .
These issues were difficult to investigate because I was heavily invested in my biblical - beliefs .
I tried to repress my doubts but soon ran into more difficulties ; this time being unable to reconcile my religious upbringing with my budding understanding of the natural world .
I also became aware of works by Christian and secular historians who questioned the historical accuracy of the bible .
Finally while studying with a Jehovah ’s Witness I became increasingly sceptical of the methods and integrity of the Protestant churches .
Morality
I really started critically analysing my beliefs the year after I finished high school .
At the time I was definitely a believer , witnessing to my unsaved friends and colleagues , attending church and bible studies , praying and finding strength in my faith .
Towards the end of the year it became an increasing struggle to reconcile some of the things in the bible with my own moral compass .
It began with some issues I had with certain teachings in the old book which I thought sounded nationalistic , racist or homophobic .
Such narrow - mindedness sounded more like the product of feuding desert tribes rather than the wisdom of a benevolent creator .
It seemed plausible that ancient communities could harbour such ideas — discrimination is not unheard of among humans .
While the new testament is an improvement it started to unsettle me that Jesus did n’t speak out about issues such as slavery ( 1,2,3 ) , woman ’s rights ( 1,2 ) or racism .
It did n’t seem befitting that the prince of peace would take such a lousy stance on these human rights issues .
Then , for almost a year I called off my search .
I had too much riding on it .
There had been times while I was growing up that I was presented with what I considered irrefutable evidence that god existed .
I ’d felt the holy spirit , I knew of the deep spiritual energy that can come during worship and the serenity and peace of mind that can come during prayer or quite times of reflection .
I had also been given books , attended camps , and received an education which confirmed that the bible ’s recount of the life of Jesus was historically accurate and scientifically agreeable .
A Scientific Tangent
Sometime after I began my hiatus I started studying science at uni .
As I studied I started pondering new questions that the bible did n’t cover .
For example , if life is sacred , how should we treat viruses ?
Are they even alive ( it ’s debated among biologists and depends on your definition of living ) .
It ’s now possible to completely map out every component of a virus , draw a model of all of the molecules and talk about how it functions .
They ’re nothing more than a bunch of atoms , and outside of a cell they do n’t appear to be alive .
You could argue that outside of a cell a virus has more in common with how a rock functions than how a living cell functions .
So , are they sacred ?
In the field of nanotechnology there are scientists who are using viruses as a scaffold on which they imbed their own customised tools .
Is that ethical ?
What if they were to build their own “ virus ” from the ground up ?
They ’re already using molecular self - assembly to create their own biological machinery , what line do they have to cross before they ’ve created life ?
The argument can be broken down further if we consider the humble prion .
It ’s nothing more than a simple protein , a string of amino - acids .
Yet , when put in the right place it can cause devastating disease .
It seemed clear to me that an independent string of amino - acids that happens to have a biological function should n’t be classified as alive and it does n’t have a soul .
But it ’s a dangerous precedent .
At what point is life deemed significantly sophisticated that it becomes sacred and gets a soul ?
In hindsight , it ’s obvious : souls are simply in the realm of the make - believe .
This revelation does n’t make someone amoral , outside the shelter of the church exist great works by philosophers and ethicists .
In bioethics we were encouraged to consider a reverence for life in all of its forms .
Albert Schweitzer talked about giving recognition to the awe felt when life begins and the importance of respecting each organism ’s inherent will to live .
Life is extraordinary , we should treat it as such .
There were plenty of other scientific topics which helped me to start thinking differently .
Genomics , speciation , ethical animal treatment , transgender / intergender , abiogenesis , the symbiotic origin of mitochondria , and the developmental , genetic ( 2 ) and physical evidence supporting evolution are all interesting subjects which are addressed very poorly in the bible .
For most of the questions that I was asking I was able to defend my faith .
For example , my first thought regarding god ’s purpose for prions ( which only seem to cause illness ) is still that prions either did n’t exist or were n’t harmful before Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge .
Similarly , I ’d always been able to reconcile evolution with my faith by telling myself “ god could ’ve put all of the pieces in place on earth and then overseen evolution ” .
Every time I made such allowances , my faith felt more and more like intellectual dishonesty .
Virtueless Faith
I ’ve just given an overview of some of the issues that made me unsubscribe , however once I started looking for opinions independently from the church I found there were vast differences to what I ’d learnt in sunday school .
I ’d been indoctrinated to believe that the bible ’s canon was a heavily guarded document which remained unchanged over time and that the teachings of “ the church ” were supported by biblical historians .
I still have friends who believe that the Gospels are eye witness accounts written by the disciples .
These views are simply not supported by the majority of academics ( iTunes link ) .
Perhaps though , one of the best exercises I undertook in critically analysing my former beliefs took place well after I became an agnostic atheist .
Early one Saturday morning I answered a knock on the door from a friendly Jehovah ’s Witness .
I gave him the time of day , and as a result ended up studying with him over several months .
I attended his Kingdom Hall on several occasions , visited his home , shared meals , but most of the time we just read the bible and debated theology .
The JWs are an interesting bunch , they ’ve more or less repeated Luther ’s process of deconstructing the dogma and getting back to the original meaning of the texts .
I appreciate the honesty and scriptural backing to their approach .
Of course there are also aspects to their group that I was n’t so fond of ; they are ‘ more cultish ’ than the other denominations in that all members are expected to pull their beliefs into line with the established teachings and they ’re discouraged from having friendships outside of their community .
Anyway , it was a powerful experience , many of the traditions were different and I found myself questioning some things I ’d always considered normal .
For example , the songs they played in their services were fairly mellow .
This made me reflect on the hillsongs played at my former church ( that I still find myself humming from time to time ) .
I recalled the incessant drone and the manner in which Lutherans repeat the chorus , repeat the chorus , repeat the chorus , repeat the last line , repeat the last line , repeat - repeat - repeat .
When combined with the liturgy of droning in unison , the creed and other groupthink during the service , it ’s hardly a discreet attempt at brainwashing .
From the outside , there are aspects to the way the service is conducted which appears to assist the faithful in having a heightened emotional response .
This behaviour is even more blatant in Pentecostal churches and sickening in the documentary Jesus Camp .
The other attribute that I appreciated in the JW ’s was their attempt to practice what they preach .
They spent their time going door to door because it was written in the bible .
Some members worked part time so that they could dedicate more of their life to ‘ storing up riches in heaven ’ rather than gathering mere earthly possessions .
I could see they were making an effort .
Conversely , I get the impression that there are very few Christians with faith strong enough that they ’re willing to put their lifestyle on the line .
I cannot reconcile their affluence with the lifestyle promoted by Jesus .
In Matthew 19:16 - 28 Jesus instructs them :
“ … go , sell your possessions and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven .
Then come , follow me …
I tell you the truth , at the renewal of all things , when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne , you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life . ”
He goes further in Luke 14:26-27,33
“ If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother , his wife and children , his brothers and sisters — yes , even his own life — he can not be my disciple .
And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple …
In the same way , any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple . ”
If you truly believed Christ was God you would n’t ignore his message .
Go then and give your possessions to the poor and dedicate your whole life to him .
I think the truth is that many people do n’t follow through on these teachings because their faith is nothing more than a comfortable paradigm which helps them understand existence .
While it is not something they honestly and literally believe , it remains the cornerstone of their worldview .
Moving On
When I was a child , I spoke as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
– 1 Corinthians 13:11
These days faith is a very strange concept .
Why would I want to trust something without seeking evidence ?
Why would I believe something which was n’t supported by evidence ?
I do n’t think my faith was ever really “ taken on faith ” , and it ’s evident in the ministry .
The church always tries to support their teachings with some form of evidence .
But whenever you seek to rationally support faith it is n’t really faith , its ( bad ) science .
Ultimately , people who have religious beliefs are either intellectually - dishonest , delusional , illogical or uneducated .
These attributes are n’t necessarily bad , but I prefer to strive for an honest , rational , logical , educated outlook .
Scientific belief is founded on an evolving body of knowledge which changes based on independently verifiable and repeatable results obtained using the scientific method .
Riding shotgun lost some its luster today when Ford announced the industry ’s first inflatable seat belts , which it claims will provide five times the protection of a conventional belt and could increase the number of back - seat passengers who buckle up .
The technology is designed to give additional protection to those in the back seat , especially kids and seniors who are more vulnerable to serious injury during a crash .
The new system , essentially a mashup of airbags and seat belts , will appear as an option when the next - gen 2011 Explorer begins production next year .
“ We have taken the top two life - saving devices and brought them to the next level , ” Dr. Srini Sundararajan , Ford ’s head of research and advance engineering , said in announcing the technology today .
Ford showed off the technology eight years ago during the Detroit auto show and has been working on it ever since .
The bag deploys over a vehicle occupant ’s torso and shoulder and inflates on the outboard shoulder side , limiting violent movement of the neck and further protecting the head from the hitting the door .
“ It ’s a very simple and logical system , but it required extensive trial and error and testing over several years to prove out the technology and ensure precise reliable performance in a crash situation , ” Sundararajan said .
Statistics regarding the system 's effectiveness are limited to crash dummies , but Ford claims the belt , when deployed , covers five times the surface area of a conventional seat belt .
This spreads the crash loads over a larger area , reducing the potential trauma to the chest .
This is particularly important for children , who have less calcium in their bones , and the elderly who have lost bone density .
Ford says the belts also will afford small children some of the same protection of a conventional airbag without the risks it poses .
" We ensured that it was harmless , " Sundararajan said .
" One of the extreme conditions we tested was a sleeping - child situation , where the child puts his head on the seat belt and sleeps .
We tested that , and it works great .
We did n't see any cause for concern . "
Aside from some added girth , Ford says the belt looks , feels and functions just like the ones you use now .
It tested a prototype on 1,000 people and claims 90 percent found it similar to , or more comfortable than , conventional seat belts .
The system deploys when the front or side curtain airbags are activated .
A canister under the seat releases cold compressed gas through the belt buckle .
The airbag , folded into the seat belt , takes about 40 milliseconds to inflate and , like a conventional airbag , is good for one use .
Ford says the gas is nontoxic and disperses harmlessly into the air if the bag is punctured .
Ford has no plans to bring the technology to the front seats .
It said installing inflatable belts in the back seat makes sense for a couple of reasons .
Front - seat passengers are protected by government - mandated airbags and automatic seat belt tensioners that cinch the belts .
But more importantly , Ford thinks inflatable belts will encourage more people to buckle up .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says 82 percent of people up front wear their seat belts , but just 62 percent of those in the back do .
“ The advancements in crash protection have focused a lot on front - seat occupants , and this is a way to better protect rear - seat occupants as well , ” Russ Rader , a spokesman for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , told the Los Angeles Times .
“ Safety is now a huge part of the competitive marketplace , and automakers are using safety as a way to sell their vehicles and as a way to show that they are ahead of their competitors . ”
Although the inflatable belts are slated to appear in the Explorer first , Ford plans to roll them out globally sometime after that .
It wo n't say what the technology will cost consumers , but said it will be cheaper than Sync , its wildly popular in - car entertainment , navigation and communication system .
So figure you 're looking at roughly $ 375 .
UPDATE : Sunday , Nov. 8 : As jafo1968 noted in the comments , Ford was n't the first automaker to offer seatbelts ;
Nash offered them in 1949 , six years before Ford .
Nice catch , jafo .

A week ago this “ 450 Peer - Reviewed Papers Supporting Skepticism of “ Man- Made ” Global Warming ” appeared and I figured it was just a matter of days before it started making the rounds of the climate change Denialosphere .

It has recently been claimed that the April–August

Based on this
claim , it was asserted that 2003 was the warmest year in the last six centuries .
Herein , it is shown that the grape - derived temperature estimates are highly unreliable , and thus that the assertion is unfounded .
How the hell does that support “ Skepticism of “ Man- Made ” Global Warming ” ?
Dated
Being old does not make a particular paper or study no longer relevant , but it sure makes some papers totally irrelevant .
Commentaries on 20 year old techniques and methodologies would be an example .
Overlooked scientific issues in assessing hypothesized greenhouse gas warming ( PDF )
( Environmental Software , Volume 6 , Number 2 , pp. 100-107 , 1991 )
– Roger A. Pielke Sr .
“ The questions which need to answered include the importance of other anthropogenic influences suc as landscape changes and enhanced atmospheric aerosol loading , “
They have been answered .
Oh look , the Deniers forgot to mention this bit : “ Controls such as conservation and improved energy efficiency , of course , which are benefits to society should be implemented regardless of global climate change , ”
Do NOT support Denial
The following papers in no way support Skepticism of “ Man- Made ” Global Warming ” , so they are not “ refuted ” so much as explained .
Carbon dioxide forcing alone insufficient to explain Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum warming
( Nature Geoscience , Volume 2 , 576- 580 , July 2009 )
– Richard E. Zeebe , James C. Zachos , Gerald R. Dickens
Explained here and here .
To understand some of the legitimate science that appears on the list I ask you to consider this hypothetical ( and nonsensical ) example :
I say airplanes cannot fly because they are made of metal and metal is heavier than air .
Here are 10 papers that say metal is heavier than air , and here are 10 more that say airplanes are made of metal .
These 20 papers therefore support skepticism about man made airplanes being able to fly .
And it is that lack of logic that puts some of legitimate science on the list ; a completely false and idiotic claim .
Mutually exclusive
As discussed here and here , that a number of the papers are mutually exclusive .
Put simply , if paper A is true , then B can not be .
So by accepting some of the papers as valid the Deniers are necessarily saying that others on the list are false .
If they are false , why are they on the list ?
The answer is naturally that Deniers embrace anything that purports to dispute anthropogenic climate change no matter how absurd or contrary to things they already claim are true .
Denierism is not a coherent position that juxtaposes one set of hypotheses against anthropogenic climate change .
Rather it is the irrational , knee jerk rejection of climate science .
This just a sampling , but this point I decided I had already put more work into the list than the author had and could think of no good reason to do any more .
Looking at the third of the list that I did , not one of the papers is current , relevant , peer - reviewed , and supports the Denier claims , not one .
I do n’t know about you , but if I dig down 1 m below an outhouse and all I find is exactly what you would expect to find under an outhouse , I am satisfied that the next 2 m will just be more of the same .
If anyone can find anything on the list that actually IS a peer - reviewed paper that is current , relevant , and supports skepticism of anthropogenic climate change , well we should talk about it .
Until then , this list seems to be nothing but decomposing shit .
NB : If anyone wants to append comments about any of the papers on the list I will gladly incorporate them into the post .
Thanks

With unemployment over 10 percent in the United States , many Americans are finding job opportunities south of south - of - the - border , in towns like Antigua and Huehuetenango .
Guatemala ’s burgeoning third - world economy has been a welcome respite to formerly high - paid professionals who have toiled for months to get a job state - side .
“ I was out of work for over a year , ” noted Wilson , as he dowsed some meat with a chunky red sauce and handed it to a customer .
“ Now I ’m pulling in 8,000 quetzals a month . ”
That ’s equivalent to about ten US dollars , but according to Wilson it buys a lot more in this country than it does back home .
He also makes “ after hours ” money , performing in front of a live audience at the local gay strip club .
“ I do n’t feel comfortable discussing the details , ” he said , “ but it was part of the deal I had to make to get the food wagon . ”
His wife works as a maid and “ legal ” prostitute for wealthy Guatemalan businessmen .
“ If they decide to pay her , ” noted Wilson , “ they can be very generous . ”
Wilson said the lower cost of living allows his wife and him to live like royalty .
“ Our neighbors call us ‘ Gringo Rico y su Puta ’ — the Rich Americans down the street . ”
It is estimated that over half - a- million job seekers will emigrate from the United States to this Central American country by the end of next year in search of a rewarding new career and , along with it , a renewed sense of self - esteem .
Allison Borden worked on Madison Avenue , creating some of the best - known television commercials of the last decade .
When her firm shut their doors in the spring , she had a hard time relocating .
“ There are only so many positions for advertising creatives , ” she noted .
“ When I could n’t find work , I became desperate . ”
That ’s when she heard about the Guatemala work - incentive program for Americans .
For two days each week , Borden works for the Guatemala Parks Department , giving tours of the 2000 - year - old Mayan pyramids in the ancient city of Tikal .
For the remainder of the week , she serves as the private masseuse for the Minister of the Guatemala Parks Department .
Borden said the pay is more than sufficient for her new lifestyle .
“ And there ’s very little sex involved , ” she explained , “ except for the few times a week he invites his friends over to have sex with me . ”
Wilson and Borden are part of the new reality of the US economy .
Until the domestic job market begins to rebound , more and more Americans will follow their careers paths down to our neighbors in the south , where the greeting of “ Chupa me , verga ! ” – We Have a Job for
You – is graciously extended to all Americans .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama will meet with top congressional leaders from both parties Tuesday to discuss a war in Afghanistan that now appears to be at a potential tipping point .
The meeting on the war comes as the Obama administration conducts a review of its Afghan strategy .
Obama will be joined by , among others , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , House Minority Leader John Boehner , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the heads of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees in the House and Senate , two Democratic officials said .
The meeting comes amid the Obama administration 's comprehensive review of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan .
Several top military leaders and opposition Republicans are pressing Obama to act quickly to increase the present 68,000 - troop level by as many as 40,000 .
" There 's no doubt that , particularly on funding , it 's not going to happen until Congress signs off , " White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday .
" They 're an important part of this , and the president wants to hear from them . "
In March , Obama announced a plan to send more than 20,000 additional troops to the country to provide security for a national election .
That move followed what Obama and others called years of inadequate resources in Afghanistan because of the Bush administration 's focus on Iraq .
The Obama strategy was based on a counterinsurgency mission intended to defeat terrorists based in Afghanistan while winning local support and helping with development .
Gen. Stanley McChrystal , who took over four months ago as the top U.S. commander in the country , has submitted an assessment in which , sources have told CNN , he says he needs additional forces to carry out the counterinsurgency strategy successfully .
Otherwise , McChrystal reportedly warns , the mission could fail , bringing a return of power to the Taliban .
" We need to reverse the current trends , and time does matter , " McChrystal said last week in a speech in London , England .
" Waiting does not prolong a favorable outcome .
This effort will not remain winnable indefinitely . "
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , however , appeared to push back Monday against those who are loudly urging a rapid troop increase .
It 's " important that we get it right , " he told a U.S. Army audience .
Gates said that it's also " important that all of us ... provide the best advice to the president candidly but privately . "
Gen. George Casey , chief of staff of the Army , echoed Gates ' view , telling reporters that he would be sharing his views " in private " and that they'd be " the second to know . "
Obama has yet to respond to McChrystal 's report , prompting opponents to accuse him of indecisiveness and playing politics that puts U.S. soldiers on the ground at risk .
Watch more on the debate over the best way forward »
National Security Adviser James Jones Jr. on Sunday cited three developments since March that have led the White House to reconsider its overall Afghanistan strategy :
• Questions about the legitimacy of Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's election victory .
• McChrystal 's conclusion that the Taliban is stronger than previously thought .
• Neighboring Pakistan 's improved efforts to change the overall dynamic of the border region .
" The key in Afghanistan is to have a triad of things happen simultaneously , " Jones said on CNN's " State of the Union , " listing improved security , economic development and " good governance and the rule of law . "
Jones said Karzai's government " is going to have to pitch in and do much better " than it has to improve the governance situation after the elections , widely considered as tainted by vote fraud in some areas .
Some in Obama 's inner circle , including Vice President Joe Biden , are advocating a counterterrorism approach that focuses on combating al Qaeda through the use of unmanned drones and special forces without involving additional troops .
Others , especially McChrystal , are strongly advocating the broader counterinsurgency approach , which requires a much larger U.S. military footprint in the country .
See who has Obama 's ear on Afghanistan »
Sen . John McCain of Arizona and other Senate Republicans -- as well as other advocates of an increase in troop levels -- are pushing for McChrystal to testify before Congress about his assessment .
Senate Armed Service Committee Chairman Carl Levin , D - Michigan , rejected their request nearly two weeks ago , calling it " premature . "
Eight American troops and two Afghan security force members were killed Saturday when militants opened fire on an outpost with rockets , mortars and heavy - caliber machine guns , according to an initial U.S. military report on the battle .
The bodies of four of those U.S. soldiers -- Army Sgt. Joshua Kirk , of South Portland , Maine ; Specialists Michael Scusa of Villas , New Jersey , and Christopher Griffin , of Kincheloe , Michigan ; and Pfc. Kevin Thomson , of Reno , Nevada -- are scheduled to be brought back to the United States on Tuesday , the Pentagon said .
It was the largest number of Americans killed by hostile action in a single day in Afghanistan since July 2008 , according to CNN records .
CNN 's Ed Henry and Laurie Ure contributed to this report .

Bearing this in mind , I think most people -- including me -- missed the biggest part of the climate emails story .
Sexing up a graph is at best a misdemeanor .
But a Declan McCullough story suggests a more disturbing possibility : the CRU 's main computer model may be , to put it bluntly , complete rubbish .
As the leaked messages , and especially the HARRY_READ_ME .
txt file , found their way around technical circles , two things happened : first , programmers unaffiliated with East Anglia started taking a close look at the quality of the CRU 's code , and second , they began to feel sympathetic for anyone who had to spend three years ( including working weekends ) trying to make sense of code that appeared to be undocumented and buggy , while representing the core of CRU 's climate model .
One programmer highlighted the error of relying on computer code that , if it generates an error message , continues as if nothing untoward ever occurred .
Another debugged the code by pointing out why the output of a calculation that should always generate a positive number was incorrectly generating a negative one .
A third concluded : " I feel for this guy .
He 's obviously spent years trying to get data from undocumented and completely messy sources . "
Programmer - written comments inserted into CRU 's Fortran code have drawn fire as well .
The file briffa_se p98_d.
pro says : " Apply a VERY ARTIFICAL correction for decline !! " and " APPLY ARTIFICIAL CORRECTION . "
Another , quantify_tsdcal.pro , says : " Low pass filtering at century and longer time scales never gets rid of the trend - so eventually I start to scale down the 120 - yr low pass time series to mimic the effect of removing / adding longer time scales ! "
The emails seem to describe a model which frequently breaks , and being constantly " tweaked " with manual interventions of dubious quality in order to make them fit the historical data .
These stories suggest that the model , and the past manual interventions , are so poorly documented that CRU cannot now replicate its own past findings .
That is a big problem .
The IPCC report , which is the most widely relied upon in policy circles , uses this model to estimate the costs of global warming .
If those costs are unreliable , then any cost - benefit analysis is totally worthless .
Obviously , this also casts their reluctance to conform with FOI requests in a slightly different light .
That 's not reason to abandon efforts to control our carbon emissions -- as I say , they 're still very likely to be problematic .
But if the model turns out to be as bad as initial reports seem to imply , we should probably hold off on policy recommendations until we have a slightly better handle on the likely outcomes .
The Environmental Protection Agency has set its first WaterSense specification for a commercial building product -- a water - efficient urinal that 's to use only half as much H2O as a standard fixture .
The current federal standard for the maximum allowable flush volume for a urinal is a gallon per flush , so fixtures eligible for a WaterSense label ( shown below ) must flush using a half gallon of water or less .
The EPA estimates that any urinal qualifying for a WaterSense label will save about 4,000 gallons of water a year .
The agency also estimates that a college of 10,000 students would save enough water to fill an Olympic - sized pool , if the campus installed WaterSense urinals in its men's rooms .
Despite the federal standard that caps flush volume at a gallon per flush , as many as 7.8 million urinals in the U.S. are older , water - guzzling models , according to the EPA .
High - efficiency urinals that use half gallon of water or less to flush are already on the market -- they include models by American Standard , which has a half - gallon flusher as well as a urinal that flushes with just a pint of water ; Sloan , which also makes high - performance urinals using a pint of water per flush ; Zurn , whose EcoVantage line ranges from the " Full Stall Pint " and the " Retrofit Pint " and to the " Nano Pint ; " and Kohler and Toto , which have models that flush using no more than a half - gallon of water .
None , however , bears the WaterSense label as yet , according to the EPA .
An agency spokeswoman said she expects the label will make its appearance on the market on urinals that qualify for the mark in a few months .

If you ’re a writer , and I mean a Writer , then you are probably somewhat insane .
Consider the following quotes for context :
Writing became such a process of discovery that I could n’t wait to get to work in the morning : I wanted to know what I was going to say .
~ Sharon O’Brien
First , find out what your character wants .
Then , just follow him .
~ Ray Bradbury .
Being an author is like being in charge of your own personal insane asylum .
~ Graycie Harmon
Writing is a socially acceptable form of schizophrenia .
~E.L. Doctorow
When I first began writing Antebellum ( formerly known as Woman ’s World ) , all I had was a premise :
What would the world be like if women had been the dominant gender throughout the ages , not men ?
I wondered if there would be peace or war , slavery or freedom , what the government would look like , who would raise the children , would children even be important , and what would men ’s roles be ?
I wanted to examine this world , our world , in a different light .
Ultimately I decided men would be kept as slaves : menial workers and companions , both holding the nation and families together as caretakers and the working class , leaving women to pursue knowledge , science , and art .
I began with a female character about to take her first slave .
I did n’t know her name , or his name , or anything about their society at all .
But as the sentences began to pile on top of each other , it became clear that my characters knew everything I did n’t .
I followed them as a tourist , stalking them through my keyboard , learning about their customs and responsibilities , their emotions and struggles .
They wanted things , and would fight for what they wanted .
I was enthralled .
I also thought I was a little crazy .
In school I was taught that the writing process had definite steps ; first there was a brainstorming session , then a rough draft , then three re-edits until you had a final copy .
In elementary school , this was the way writing was done , and there was no room for negotiation .
In fourth grade , I knew I wanted to be a writer , and loved the creativity of just going at it on paper , but hated this drafting / editing process and knew I would never be able to take being a writer if I had to do that nonsense all the time .
So , when I began writing Antebellum at the age of 14 , I did n’t know anything about real writers or real writing , but I had found this magic world inside myself , this trance - like interaction between my imagination and my more logical self , and I would n’t give it up for anything .
Other aspiring writers I met in school did n’t have this ( they also lacked my natural instinct for grammar and plots not based on their favorite anime ) , and so I felt very alone , a little frustrated , and misunderstood .
My teachers had n’t any inkling what I was talking about , either .
Then , in 9th grade I picked up a book from my English teacher ’s personal library : Fahrenheit 451 , by Ray Bradbury .
It was a quick , strange read , but at the end I found total gold : an interview with the author .
That three - page or so interview completely changed my writing life .
Bradbury revealed that he had the same , strange , magical process of writing .
He likened his writing process to following his characters around with a notepad , writing down what they do .
I had found my people .
There were others like me .
I was n’t strange or half - crazy , no , I was just a REAL writer !
I was thrilled .
I began calling myself a writer from that day on .
It was who and what I was , and what I would always be , published or not .
Writing after that became far more enjoyable .
I learned to listen to my subconscious pulling and give my creative side free range to make up anything it wanted to .
Our brains are so smart once we stop analyzing what and how we ’re actually thinking .
My subconscious had whole plots worked out I was n’t even aware of .
These plans would emerge unexpectedly and surprise me .
For example ( those who read the Antebellum series when it was available on Fictionpress will remember this ) , one day I was sitting at my desk , typing along on my second book , Apostasy , when suddenly one of my characters blurted out to another that she was pregnant .
I stopped , took my hands off the keyboard , and looked at the screen more closely .
Had I really written that ?
That was n’t in my conscious plan .
I had no intention of making this character pregnant .
Her pregnancy had nothing to do with the plot I was developing ; in fact , it threatened to ruin what long - term plans I did have .
However , while my conscious self did n’t have a plan , my subconscious self certainly did .
Later on in the third book this unexpected pregnancy twist surfaced again and revealed its surprising plan , throwing in a most - excellent plot - twist towards the end that intrigued and delighted readers .
It was a leap of faith to accept that unexpected turn of events , and I ’m glad I did .
That experience taught me a lot about the subconscious writing process and about the power of our minds .
It was also useful for helping me trust myself in a similar situation years later , as I was working on my fifth book , Go Look There .
I had just graduated from high school , and my family unexpectedly moved to north Alabama .
For a graduation present , my father bought me a laptop ( which I type this article on now , two years later ) .
We were stuck in corporate housing for what ended up being two months , and I had nothing to do except play on my laptop ( without even the internet ; too cruel ! ) and write .
I had brought some of my current writing projects with me on CD , as my desktop was moved along with the rest of our stuff , and began toying with some short stories I had written .
There was one in particular I was working on which featured a girl with a mental retardation that made her smell attractive to butterflies .
At her 8th grade graduation outside , butterflies came and swarmed her , and the crowd ’s reaction to both this girl and this miraculous event served as a pointed social critique .
This all sounded nice in theory , and the story had hints of what I ultimately wanted the reader to feel ( magic , spookiness , etc. ) , but it was missing something .
It did n’t have what I call ‘ saturation , ’ where every sentence is rich with meaning and / or description , and as soon as you read the first few lines of the story you feel as if you are living it .
I tried several variations of the story , but it still felt flat and unoriginal , so I decided ( going with that subconscious instinct ) , to change the perspective from third person to first person .
For the eyes and ears of the story I chose the school janitor , who had a special relationship with the children and the school that parents attending could not have .
His name was Ephram Carson .
A novel was born .
( You can read this chapter on my website here )
Ephram is the most strongly - defined character I ’ve ever written ( you can see his character analysis on my website , too ) , and he had stories to tell , only the first of which was this strange , haunting butterfly episode .
In fact , it was this experience , along with another tragedy involving a child and butterflies , that created a stigma in the town that functioned as a sort of curse .
Ephram wrote letters to the school psychiatrist , Angelica , recounting the strange , spooky , and often sad stories of the children of the town .
I got to incorporate more of my short stories into the novel and add new ones , and the project turned itself into my favorite novel so far , Go Look There ( never before shared on Fictionpress , unfortunately ) .
If I had n’t have trusted my instincts and changed the perspective of the story , even though it meant a complete rewrite and working with an unfamiliar character ( at first ) , I would never have arrived at the novel my subconscious had in store for me .
Now , whenever I can I try to enlighten other young writers to the subconscious effect , and reassure them they are n’t crazy ; they ’re just legitimate !
In writing , your mind is your most useful tool .
Forget your computer , forget your keyboard , forget your typewriter or your notepad and pens .
If you had nothing else in the world , not even your voice or hands , you could still make up stories .
Your work does n’t come from your tools , but your brain .
Remember that .
Now get out there and make some magic .
PS : I ’m guest - blogging tomorrow at the blog of Jess Granger , whose first book , Beyond the Rain , came out in August of this year ( click the link for sexy / beautiful cover ! )

Part 3 … God ’s own medicine
The Obama administration rescinded the Bush administration ’s quixotic order to eradicate poppy fields in Afghanistan .
Judging by hectare cultivation numbers and harvest yields , the plan was either never fully implemented or failed miserably .
At the very least , farmers in Afghanistan are no longer being punished for trying to make a living .
Like Bush , the Obama administration wants to reform Afghan agriculture and move it away from poppy cultivation .
Unfortunately , these plans are still “ being finalized ” .
To understand the problems inherent in the administration ’s plans and possible futures for Afghan agriculture we need to examine Afghanistan ’s situation , the opium poppy , and the history of opium cultivation .
Papaver somniferum ( the sleep bringing poppy ) has a long history with humanity : seeds have been found in Neolithic burials and recorded use dates to c. 3500 BC in Mesopotamia .
For most of those years it was not an evil scourge , but one of the most important plants in the human cornucopia .
Gods were depicted wearing its flowers .
It offered pain relief without equal in the ancient world , along with mystical visions .
But its downside was noticed at least as early as Galen , who wrote that opium users developed a need for the substance and the negative effects of habituation .
As late as the U.S. Civil War , opium was hailed as “ god ’s own medicine ” .
God is , apparently , merciful as the plant is widely tolerant of temperate conditions ; capable of withstanding drought later in its life cycle ; and not particularly susceptible to pests and diseases .
More importantly , gathering opium is a fairly simple , if laborious , process .
After the flower petals fall , the seed pod is allowed to ripen for roughly two weeks .
Then a series of shallow slashes or pin-pricks are made in the pod ; latex seeps from these incisions and is scraped from the pod .
Sun drying removes the water content , and the result is raw opium .
Not only did our ancestors have an effective pain reliever that could be produced with relative ease , but one that kept indefinitely without processing .
In many parts of the world , opium is still cultivated for these same reasons .
That opium is non-perishable and addictive makes it the quintessential agricultural commodity .
The East India Company built an empire on it and nearly brought down a civilization with it .
Users as varied as English intellectuals , Chinese coolies and Southern belles found themselves ensnared by opium , but opiate addiction was treated as an unfortunate malady rather than a social scourge until the beginning of the 20th century .
( It may be of interest to note that morphine was marketed as a ‘ cure ’ for opium addiction and heroin was claimed to cure morphine addiction . )
Contrary to popular belief , opium addiction does not incapacitate users … that is , the addict will not necessarily waste away in indolence .
In the Orient , laborers were the most common users : opium allowing them to cope with the physical and emotional burdens of their low , social station .
The US annexation of the Philippines set the stage for opium criminalization , when American officials were horrified by the rate of use on the islands .
Until then , cultivation and use was spread broadly around the world , though the former was concentrated in Asia .
A series of control measures were enacted over the course of the 20th century , which partially curbed opiate use – insomuch as you could no longer buy it over the counter – but also pushed the commodity into the black market .
Opium became even more profitable , though it became significantly more dangerous to profit from it .
In 1953 , a follow up to the Paris Convention designated seven nations as legal , export producers and allowed any nation to produce a domestic supply .
The major producer nations left off the list ignored the convention .
One country appealed the decision and asked for an export license , “ arguing opium was a vital cash crop supporting up to 90 percent of the population ” .
( Booth , 188 ) That country was Afghanistan , and the appeal was denied .
So it is incorrect to say that Afghanistan has an opium problem because of the violence that has wracked the nation since the late 1970 ’s ; the violence and instability has only exacerbated the “ problem ” .
A rugged , landlocked nation without significant transport infrastructure that receives seasonal rains has few options in cash crops that are saleable beyond local markets .
More importantly , the horticultural cycle of poppies allows Afghan farmers to get a poppy crop and at least one other crop from the same earth .
The poppy requires c. 120 days to mature ; however , it is planted in the fall and survives the winter as an immature plant beneath the snow .
In this way , opium can be harvested in the spring , leaving the remainder of the growing season for food crops .
It is common for Afghan farmers to plant a second crop like maize , though any vegetable crop could follow poppies .
( There are varieties of Papaver somniferum that mature in as few as 55 days , and as home flower gardeners know , poppies can be perennial … though it would make no economic sense for a farmer to treat the plant as a perennial . )
Many other crops could be more profitable than opium , which is labor intensive , in Afghanistan .
Unfortunately , every factor affecting agriculture in Afghanistan works against other crops and in favor of poppies .
The US would like to see opium replaced by other short season crops , like cucumbers , but few – if any – of them could harvest as early as fall plantings of poppies .
Pushing the date of the first harvest forward constrains the second harvest .
Moreover , non-cereal crops rot .
Without a reliable way to bring farm products to profitable markets , any and every replacement crop will lose the financial battle .
Even as the farm gate price of opium has fallen , farmers still plant it .
This is partially a function of reliability : low prices for opium are better than rotten cucumbers worth nothing .
It is also a function of credit : farmers ( even in the US ) generally start the season on credit , so the crop that will get the loan gets planted .
In Afghanistan that crop is opium , and much to the chagrin of the US , the creditors are corrupt officials or anti-occupation insurgents .
Changing Afghan agriculture will be herculean task .
Only 25 % of Afghanistan ’s pre-war irrigation systems are operational , a fact that does not limit poppy farming but does make it difficult to bring the other half of Afghanistan ’s arable land into production or replace poppies with other cash crops .
Only 58 % of rural Afghans have access to even seasonal roads , and many of them live an average of three miles from those .
Fertilizer prices rose 30 % between 2007 and 2009 .
And , amazingly , there is a perennial shortage of seeds that might grow replacement crops .
( from the CFR )
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is keen on replacing opium with combination of common , market - garden crops and orchards .
Several people have placed great hope in the Pomegranate , for which Afghanistan is famous .
Tree crops , unfortunately , require years of dedicated land before producing reliable yields .
Worse , many of Afghanistan ’s orchards were destroyed after the US invasion …to plant poppies .
Wheat is affected by world commodity market markets far more violently than opium , so any switch to wheat will last only as long as high wheat prices .
Replacing opium in Afghanistan will continue to fail so long as funding for agriculture is anemic .
Between 2002 and 2006 , USAID spent $ 4.4 billion in Afghanistan .
Only 5 % of that went to agriculture .
The $ 24.7 million requested for agriculture related projects in 2009 is paltry compared to other expenditures , and it only raises the total spent since 2007 to $ 107.7 million .
How much of those funds actually reach , and stay in , Afghanistan is questionable .
USAID subcontracts many of its activities to private firms .

And the USDA will only have 64 staffers in Afghanistan by 2010 ; a massive increase from the three who were stationed there in 2003 , but not anywhere near what ’s needed .
If our commitment to Afghanistan is genuine , then our priorities must be rearranged .
Attacking the opium trade is , in the long term , futile .
If anything , all efforts should be directed at trans - shipment out of Afghanistan .
Success in such a strategy would have the perverse effect of increasing farm gate prices , but that would help the Afghans who need it most .
Farmers receiving more for their opium would need to plant less or be able to invest the proceeds in improving their farms .
A civilian surge may well be required , though not under the assumption that Afghan farmers are ignorant and backwards .
What Afghanistan does not need is to have the green revolution , export commodity model of agriculture forced upon it .
A hungry man is an angry man .
Our efforts should focus on building sustainable agriculture models that provide sustenance and economic activity locally and regionally .
High value export crops can be added after agricultural stability is attained , and any farmer worth the soil that he works will seek those out without any help from the USDA or Land ‘ o ’ Lakes .
For the time being , opium fills that niche .
We should avoid trapping Afghanistan in the globalized agriculture market , because that scenario is mostly likely to produce a return to massive poppy cultivation as soon as Afghanistan ’s agricultural sector experiences any shock .
The Afghan government is a long ways from being able to provide stability producing subsidies to farmers as the US does .
For every problem there are an infinite number of solutions and the problem of opium cultivation in Afghanistan is no different .
Unfortunately , it appears the US has settled on the worst solution : lots of money for bullets and paramilitary drug war adventures .
Until such time as our priorities for Afghanistan make sense in Afghanistan for Afghans and we focus our efforts on building the foundation of a stable society ( food : politics starts at the breakfast table ) , we will reap only failure , violence and instability .

Stefan Sagmeister is one of the most talented graphic designers working today , so he knows a little bit about keeping his creativity flowing .
His trick ?
Taking really , really long vacations .
In fact , every seven years , he takes an entire year off .
As Sagmeister describes it in his recent TED talk ( which just made it to the Web ) , we spend our first 25 years learning , the next 40 years working , and the last 15 retired .
“ I thought it might be helpful to cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years , ” Sagmeister says .
And what ’s more : “ That ’s clearly enjoyable for myself but probably even more important is that the work that comes out of those years flows back into the company and the society at larger rather than benefiting just a grandchild or two . ”
You have to admit it ’s a pretty great way of looking at things .
And incidentally , it ’s one that neoclassical economists such as Milton Friedman would endorse–those types are always rattling on “ consumption smoothing “ –the idea that consumers will spread their income or goods ( such as leisure ) over time , so that overall consumption is even .
Sagmeister channeling Friedman ?
Who knew ?!
Sagmeister notes that the first sabbatical was n’t terribly useful because it was n’t structured enough .
But when he segmented his day into activities –from “ storytelling ” to “ future thinking ” –things started to pop .
In fact , Sagmeister argues that all seven years of work after his time off sprung from ideas that were formed during the previous sabbatical .
His proof is his own charming portfolio–including one example of a brilliantly flexible logo system he designed .

A clearing firm that worries about the rules and whines about not being able to locate this or that stock is not going to keep the business of a lot of these day traders .
So you see a lot of cut corners .
This video is an example of a cut corner .
did
There is no third alternative .
Folks , I have a confession to make : I was in a minor auto accident the other day .
I am really not in the mood for any massive fight with some guy who likes to call people " assholes . "
I have a sensitive disposition , am in a bad mood , and I do n't think my constitution could take it .
But nevertheless , we have an interesting situation here : Matt Taibbi , who writes for Rolling Stone , posted the other day what he described as a " video " showing a " naked swindle " as in " naked short selling " in action .
The video is here
One of several responses from Clusterstock is here Taibbi 's response to that is here
The back - and - forth over the video has been vitriolic , but this blogger seems to have a good handle on the thing .
Two things struck me as odd about this whole situation .
One is that naked shorting conspiracy theorists , who you 'd expect to rally around Taibbi in a situation like this , were strangely silent .
So was Penson Financial Services , the actual location of the naked swindle in question , according to Taibbi : Well , there you go .
That 's the guilty party : Penson and only Penson , according to Taibbi .
No other brokerages are mentioned by Taibbi as being involved .
This is a serious accusation .
If Penson okayed a " locate " of a massive number of shares without good cause , if it " cut a corner " as he put it , Penson could be accused of being an accomplice ( or accessory or something ) to a genuine market manipulation .
See , while I 've said numerous times that naked shorting conspiracy theories are overblown hooey , the fact remains that if someone actuallyuse naked shorting to drive down the price of a stock , that would be market manipulation .
If a trading system or clearing firm allows naked shorting that could drive down the price of a stock , it 's a big problem .
And by the way , that 's got nothing to do with Regulation SHO or any of the other sturm und drang from the SEC over the past few years .
Market manipulation has always been illegal .
If not , it 's Taibbi who 's got the big problem .
Someone gave him a " fugazy " video and he got taken in .
Is that what happened ?
I went to the Penson website and noticed that the chief spokesperson there is a gent named Andy Yemma .
I wrote him to ask if there was a response , and he emailed me a letter Penson has sent to the SEC : So either Penson Financial Services is a bunch of crooks that just committed a criminal act and compounded it by lying to the SEC , or Matt Taibbi is the victim of a hoax .
At first I thought that maybe Taibbi got this from one of the conspiracy theorists themselves .
But now I 'm not to sure .
Was Taibbi set up ?
Was he sandbagged ?
See , I 'm a bit conspiracy - minded myself .
Of course , the NSS conspiracy types are not always the brightest bulbs in the package , and they do indeed traffic in sheer hokum .
But Taibbi is on record rather profanely rejecting the charge that he was the victim of a hoax .
Since he 's standing by his story , what I can't understand is why Taibbi underplayed the seriousness of this whole thing .
What he 's saying is that Penson - - a rather large Wall Street firm -- is a criminal enterprise .
Remember , he 's saying that unequivocally , no weasel words .
He 's claiming direct culpability by that firm , by Penson , not by some broker clearing trades by the firm .
He says Penson " cut corners " and that the video proves it .
He 's got a big story on his hands .
Bigger than Madoff !
Unless it 's a hoax , that is .
By the way , if it 's not a hoax , where are the naked shorting conspiracy sites ?
Why are n't they flocking to his side ?
Hmmmmm ?UPDATE : Penson issued a vigorous denial in a letter to the SEC , which is unwise if it is n't innocent .
Taibbi would not respond to an email from a reporter from a Wall Street trade publication .
Guess he wants it to go away .
It wo n't .
See my follow - up here
It seems pretty likely now that the video is a hoax , probably concocted by a naked shorting conspiracy nut .
In this post I describe how the naked shorting loons systematically lie , sometimes crudely , in the hope of trapping the unwary .
Taibbi would appear to be their latest target . © 2009 Gary Weiss .

While the Western press has been occupied recently with accounts of fraudulent elections in Afghanistan and the alleged role of President Hamid Karzai ’s brother as a paid CIA agent , a stranger but perhaps more instructive story was playing out in Afghanistan that reveals the rather shallow penetration NATO and Coalition efforts have made in building trust and confidence in that country , as well as giving some indication of what can be expected from a Karzai administration that does not sense full support from its former backers in the West as it begins a second term .
In addition the controversy demonstrates the very different perceptions of the counterterrorism struggle in the West and in Afghanistan .
For several weeks now , Afghanistan has been consumed by stories of mysterious “ foreign helicopters ” ferrying Taliban fighters to a new front in northern Afghanistan .
These helicopters are alleged by no less than President Karzai to belong to “ foreign powers ” such as the United States and its allies .
The helicopters are said to land in remote regions , but their activity has supposedly been noted by nomads who travel through the deserts of Baghlan and Kunduz province ( Hasht-e Sobh , October 13 ) .
Without mentioning guilty parties or offering evidence , President Karzai suggested the reports of helicopters delivering terrorists to north Afghanistan were true , saying , “ We have received reliable reports from our intelligence service .
We have received reliable reports from our people , and today I received a report that these efforts [ to transfer Taliban fighters ] are also being made mysteriously in the northwest .
The issue of helicopters has also been proved .
We do not make any more comments now and investigations are under way to see to whom and to which foreign country these helicopters belong ” ( Tolo TV , October 11 ) .
According to Karzai , the “ unknown ” helicopters had been taking Taliban fighters to Baghlan , Kunduz and Samangan provinces in northern Afghanistan .
The president ’s remarks were quickly followed by a call from the Lower House speaker , Muhammad Yunis Qanuni , for a government debate on the issue .
“ When the president of Afghanistan , as the first man of the country , is raising a fact and a problem , then it shows that the problem is important and serious . ”
According to Takhar MP Habiba Danesh , the helicopter airlifts were already underway before the elections ( Tolo TV [ Kabul ] , October 13 ; Ferghana.ru , October 12 ; Hasht-e Sobh [ Kabul ] , October 13 ) .
Kunduz governor Muhammad Omar claimed the fighters being brought to his province at night were members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan ( IMU ) , a group that recently lost its longtime leader Tahir Yuldash and is now hard pressed by the Pakistani government in South Waziristan , their home since 2001 .
The governor pointed to the detention of 15 militants by U.S. Special Forces south of Kunduz , whom he described as supporters of the late Tahir Yuldash ( Afghan Islamic Press , October 11 ; Eurasia.net , October 13 ) .
At the same time , the governor noted the security situation in his province was improving ( Tolo TV , October 11 ) .
The governor of Baghlan province , Muhammad Akbar Barakzai , also claims to have received intelligence that unidentified military helicopters are making midnight landings in remote areas of his province ( Tolo TV , October 21 ) .
Dr. Abdullah Abdullah , Karzai ’s former rival for the presidency , accuses the Afghan government of being behind the transfer of Taliban fighters to the northern provinces .
“ They have sent to the north of the country the most evil people , the most notorious and criminal people who are involved in killing the people of Afghanistan and crime against the people of Afghanistan …
I have the names of these people ; they sent them to the north by helicopters so that they carry out their mission .
Is this a government ? ” ( Tolo TV , October 11 ) .
Iran ’s state television network , Press TV , sought to exploit the controversy by adding a large number of details to the helicopter story in an October 17 report , all according to unnamed “ diplomats ” :
• The British Army was responsible for relocating Taliban fighters with Chinook helicopters to the northern provinces from Helmand province in south Afghanistan ( though this might come as a surprise to critics of the UK ’s Ministry of Defence , who have suggested the military has not provided enough transport helicopters to meet British needs – BBC , August 30 ) .
• The death of Afghan interpreter Sultan Munadi in a September British Special Forces raid that freed a New York Times reporter from Taliban captivity , has already been a controversial issue in Afghanistan , with repeated calls for an inquiry into the circumstances of his death .
Press TV claimed Munadi was killed during the raid by a British sniper because he had documents and photographs verifying the British role in the alleged airlift .
• American forces were supplying the Taliban militants in north Afghanistan with weapons seized during the 2001 invasion .
Most date back to the era of Soviet occupation .
• Afghan Interior Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar , a British educated Pashtun , was working under the direction of the UK .
The Interior Ministry has funneled arms to the newly relocated Taliban through Pashtun police officers .
The distribution of arms to Taliban fighters by the Afghan police was also reported by Kabul daily Arman-e Melli on October 13 .
Not all Afghan officials believe in the nocturnal activities of the “ mystery helicopters . ”
Amrullah Saleh , the chief of the National Directorate of Security ( NDS – the Tajik - dominated national security agency ) , dismissed the helicopter reports , as did many other members of Afghanistan ’s security services .
Amrullah maintains that the reports are designed solely with the intention of reducing trust in Western forces engaged in Afghanistan ( Hasht-e Sobh , October 13 ) .
Even a member of Karzai ’s campaign team , MP Nur Akbari , noted diplomatically that the president ’s assertions were “ unexpected , ” saying that security officials had not provided any such information in the past ( Hasht-e Sobh , October 13 ) .
President Karzai ’s endorsement of the “ mystery helicopter ” theory compelled U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry to issue a clear denial of “ the rumors about the reinforcement of the Afghan government ’s armed opposition in the north by the U.S.A .
These rumors are baseless ” ( Tolo TV , October 14 ) .
Nevertheless , one Afghan daily reported widespread belief in the “ mystery helicopter ” phenomenon .
“ The people strongly believe that these helicopters belong to the British and U.S. forces .
They also believe that these helicopters have transferred some armed residents of the neighboring provinces to northern provinces and the killing of several armed men from these areas in the north seem to confirm this issue ” ( Arman-e Melli [ Kabul ] , October 13 ) .
It was not long before the “ mystery helicopters ” were seen in Pakistan , where the “ foreign allies ” of the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) were alleged to be rescuing Taliban militants from the government offensive in South Waziristan .
An Islamabad daily reported the belief of “ some experts ” that the airlift was part of a deal between the Western nations and the so - called “ good Taliban ” ( Pakistan Observer [ Islamabad ] , October 19 ) .
Existing rumors of a Western airlift of Taliban fighters were no doubt adopted and exploited by the Karzai administration to express its displeasure with the West ’s refusal to rubber stamp his election victory , but they mask a more serious problem – how has the Taliban managed to expand its operations in the north and what can be done to stop it before the Taliban is in a position to interfere with vital NATO supply lines that cross the region ?
By endorsing such rumors , President Karzai appears ready to endanger years of Western civil and military efforts in Afghanistan if he feels it necessary to ensure his domestic political survival .
Villagers ' say turtle is god '
( Agencies )
Updated : 2009-11-11 09:34
Residents of an east Indian village have claimed that a Hindu deity has visited them in the form a turtle .
Visitors have flocked to the temple in the coastal district of Kendrapara , eastern Orissa bearing rice and fruit and the villagers have refused to hand over the creature to authorities , Reuters reports .
Senior government wildlife official P.K. Behera said : " We have asked the villagers to hand it over as it is illegal to confine a turtle , but they are refusing . "
Priest of the temple Ramesh Mishra explained : " Lord Jagannath has visited our village in the form of a turtle .
We will not allow anybody to take the turtle away . "
According to Indian law , anyone found keeping a turtle without permission can be fined and jailed for a year or more .
Chuck Schumer talks to Rachel 's fill in Alison Stewart about what the next steps are as negotiations continue on what 's in the final version of the health care bill .
As Schumer explains , what happens next is in Harry Reid 's hands .
Stewart :
You called the bill you voted on today “ Not ideal but a good bill ” .
Despite your best efforts the public option was not part of it .
Why not ?
Schumer :
Well , we did n’t have the votes obviously but we are making good progress once again .
We never thought we ’d win in the Finance Committee but thirty Democrats have signed a letter saying the public option must be in the combined bill .
There are many others who are supportive .
The four of us in the leadership did n’t sign the letter because they were to the leadership .
We ’re for it as well and I am very optimistic that we ’re going go get a strong public option .
The House is standing firm on public option and I think all of those when they saw the vote in the Finance Committee who thought “ Oh it ’s over ” had n’t really read the situation correctly .
Stewart : Well , how do you get it done ?
How does it end up in the final bill ?
Schumer : Well , first Leader Reid has the option of putting it in the final bill .
If he puts it in the final bill , in the combined bill then you would need sixty votes to remove it and there clearly are not sixty votes against the public option .
If … and so we ’re urging him to do that and he ’s seriously considering it .
Once it passes the Senate if that were to happen , it ’s in the House Bill , it ’s in the Senate bill and it would have to be in the final product .
So it ’s very important to see if a public option is in the bill that Leader Reid puts together .
He has n’t yet made up his mind , but many of us who believe in the public option are urging him to do so and so far we ’re getting , we ’re getting heard .
In recent reports on climate change , scientists warn that unless humanity acts quickly , we are doomed to devastating consequences .
News stories on how our addiction to carbon based fuels and nonstop emission of greenhouse gases may lead to numerous crises — such as rising sea levels , ocean acidification , and extreme weather patterns — can leave many with an overwhelming sense of despondency .
However , Al Gore believes that not only is there hope for humanity , but also that we have all the technological advances and ideas necessary to avert catastrophe — today .
“ I ’ve come away with the absolute conviction , with no exaggeration , that we have all the tools and solutions to solve three or four climate crises — and we only have to solve one , ” Gore said .
Rather than focus on a single technology or action to solve global warming , Gore stressed that governments must employ an “ all of the above ” approach , employing multiple piecemeal solutions , at a promotional event for his new book Our Choices : A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis .
For example , while much attention has focused on the importance of promoting energy efficiency and renewable fuels , societies must also curb two other practices that are large sources of greenhouse gas emissions — deforestation and tilling soil in farming practices .
Gore pointed to countries such as Brazil and Indonesia as leading the charge to stop deforestation , coming up with plans that have a limited impact on industrial production .
In order to combat certain farming practices , he believes governments should subsidize no -till farming and other carbon sequestration technologies .
For example , Gore thinks biochar , which is basically porous charcoal , may be able to sequester 40 percent of annual carbon dioxide emissions .
He also believes that most of the solutions should be enacted on their merits alone , regardless of their effect on the climate .
According to Gore , conservation biologists stress that deforestation , which is contributing to the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth , should be stopped to prevent disastrous effects on our current ecological balance .
Furthermore , while deforestation often leads to short term economic gains in industries such as logging and farming , these profits are not sustainable over the long term .
Managing deforestation ensures these industries have a longer future .
While current tilling practices achieve the highest yields and quickest returns in agriculture , they destroy soil quality for successive harvests .
Thus , sustainable farming and carbon sequestration may be some of the most effective tools “ to fight the food insecurity and poverty of developing nations , ” Gore said .
Also ,
Gore stresses that governments should start to enact policies to slow the population growth that leads to higher energy demands .
While past studies suggest that industrialization is what brings about smaller birth rates , current research demonstrates this is not the case .
Key components of modernized societies such as the education of girls and higher child survival rates are stronger predictors of decreases in population growth .
The two other main influences are the availability of fertility management resources and the empowerment of women to take part in decisions made in their societies .
“ We should be encouraging this for obvious , beneficial reasons anyway , ” Gore said .
Gore related these ideas to over 900 people at the American Museum of Natural History on November 3 , while promoting his new book , a follow - up to his bestselling book and Academy Award winning documentary , An Inconvenient Truth .
While An Inconvenient Truth focused on the problem of global warming , Gore said Our Choices focuses on the solutions .
According to Gavin Schmidt , a climatologist at NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies , who spoke to Gore along with many colleagues for the book , researchers involved in this work applaud Gore ’s in - depth understanding of all these solutions .
“ He actually asks about science , ” Schmidt said to The Guardian .
“ Nobody that we have dealt with has ever taken as much time to understand the subtlety of the science and all the different complications and what it all means as Al Gore . ”
Gore culled all his information from more than 30 “ solution summits , ” often interviewing the experts from these summits “ four or five times sometimes for as long as entire day ” after meeting them .
While Gore understands enacting these changes will be difficult , he believes that “ knowing that the solutions are available is a source of hope . ”
His main concern revolves around the apparent lack of political will to take steps toward making necessary changes .
“ We have to become active as citizens , ” Gore told the audience .
“ It ’s what our democracy is based on .
Just remember , here in the United States , political will is a renewable resource . ”
One of the most malicious computer viruses ever created has been launched against unsuspecting users .
Rather than jeopardize the financial well being of an individual , however , this new form of malware looks to ruin reputations by suggesting that innocent people are pedophiles .
In this twisted practice , hackers are now unloading dozens of prohibited photographs into computers worldwide .
Virus Payload Not Random Acts of Chaos
The motivation for doing something so sinister is baffling , to say the least .
While many would believe that hackers are engaging in this practice for the purpose of framing an individual or to cause random acts of chaos , the situation is likely much more disturbing .
According to some analysts , the hackers are the actual pedophiles .
Rather than risking getting caught by the authorities or tarnishing their own reputations , these people are stashing their illicit photos on unsuspecting " dummy " computers .
There , hackers can view their material without fear of being caught .
If the police do apprehend the owner of a " dummy " computer , the hacker can simply move their ' loot ' to the next victim 's computer .

$ 250,000 in Legal Fees to Clear Name
In one unfortunate case , Michael Fiola was given a state - issued laptop in his place of employment .
It was later revealed that when Fiola and his wife went out for dinner one night , someone logged onto the computer and flooded it with pictures of illegal photos .
The material was found by a technician at work .
Since then , Fiola has been subject to death threats , slashed tires and social exclusion .
He was able to endure the $ 250,000 legal fees by liquidating his savings , taking out a second mortgage and selling his car .
( Source : chron.com )
Eventually the charges were dropped , 11 months later , after a series of tests confirmed that the laptop was severely infected with viruses .
While the result was a happy ending for Michael Fiola , law enforcement officials have shown concern over the fact that the court ruling will set up an unwanted precedence for future ( actual ) pedophiles brought before the court .
Police are expected to treat all future claims with skepticism , until it can be proven otherwise .
The Church of Scientology in Sydney is currently undergoing renovation The Australian Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , has said he will consider calls for a parliamentary inquiry into the Church of Scientology .
But he said the evidence must be looked at carefully before proceeding .
Senator Nick Xenophon launched a scathing attack on Scientology , citing letters from former followers alleging extensive criminal activity .
Scientology spokesman Cyrus Brooks said the senator 's attack had been an abuse of parliamentary proceedings .
Senator Xenophon tabled seven letters from former Scientologists who he said were willing to co-operate with New South Wales and Australian federal police .
" The letters received by me which were written by former followers in Australia , contain extensive allegations of crimes and abuses which are truly shocking , " he said , citing other letters from people who prefer to stay anonymous .
Kevin Rudd says many Australians share concerns about Scientology Senator Xenophon said their correspondence implicated the organisation in a range of crimes , including forced imprisonment , coerced abortions , physical violence and blackmail .
" In my view , this is a two - faced organisation , " he told the Senate .
" There is the public face of an organisation ... that claims to offer guidance and support to its followers and there is the private face of an organisation that abuses its followers and viciously targets its critics , and seems largely driven by paranoia .
" These victims of Scientology claim it is an abusive , manipulative , violent and criminal organisation , " said Senator Xenophon .
" Scientology is not a religious organisation , it 's a criminal organisation that hides behind its so - called religious beliefs , " he said .
A Scientology statement said the allegations were " about as reliable as former spouses are when talking about their ex-partner " .
Many people in Australia have real concerns about Scientology
Kevin Rudd
Australian Prime Minister
It described the former members ' statements as constituting a " propaganda campaign that would suit a totalitarian regime , not Australia , a country that recognises freedom of religion " .
Mr Rudd said he would consider Senator Xenophon 's call for a parliamentary inquiry , noting he had made " grave allegations " .
" Many people in Australia have real concerns about Scientology , " he told reporters .
" I share some of those concerns .
Let us proceed carefully and look carefully at the material he has provided before we make a decision on further parliamentary action . "
" I do n't want to rush into any judgement on this , " the prime minister added .
The Church of Scientology has provoked controversy since it was founded by science fiction author L Ron Hubbard in 1953 .
Given religion status in many countries , it enjoys tax - free privileges - but revelations from former followers have sparked huge legal battles in Europe where in several countries it is deemed a sect , not a religion .
Last month , a French court convicted the Church of Scientology of fraud .

Ok , assuming we take all combinations of letters from " Beartato " as words , is n't that still only 10,080 ?
Even 8 ! is only 40,320 .
Are the other 81,920 words magical ones made from a letter too beautiful for the human mind to comprehend ?

The question is " how many words can you spell from the letters in the word ' BEARTATO ' ? "
On my interpretation , there 's no limit that we can only use the letter T twice or whatever .
The question is how many words use only letters in the set a , b , e , o , r , and t .
Doing this in Python using OS X's Unix dictionary of English , we get :
>>> dictionary = open ( " /usr/share/dict/words " ) .readlines ( )
>>> sum ( 1 for word in dictionary if all ( letter in " abeort
" for letter in word ) )
372

These puzzles are hard and stoopid and you 're stoopid for coming up with them :(
From : shihtzu

Actually they are examples of puzzles proven by important mathematicians ( in bow ties ) to be unsolvable
They are not the homework
In order to combat piracy the UK Internet provider Virgin Media has has teamed up with Universal to offer their customers unlimited DRM - free music at a fixed monthly rate .
However , as with every innovative music service , some major labels fear that Virgin 's all you can eat plan will cannibalize their existing digital sales .
The Internet , MP3 players and file - sharing services have changed the music habits of an entire generation .
Instead of buying a few singles or albums each year , consumers now demand unlimited access to music , without restrictions such as DRM .
In an attempt to fulfill this need and to convert illegal file - sharers into paying customers , the UK ISP Virgin Media recently announced that it will offer an unlimited music download service to all their subscribers .
Such a service would allow customers to download all the music they want and keep it permanently .
Universal and several smaller labels are backing Virgin ’s plan , but not all the major labels are as happy .
NMA reports that insiders at EMI and Sony Music do n’t think that Virgin ’s unlimited download service will convert illegal music downloaders into legitimate customers .
They say that the model is flawed and will hurt existing digital sales .
“ We want to work with Virgin Media as a partner but any deal has to sit comfortably with how we value our assets against how it values its customers , ” an EMI insider said .
“ We have to evaluate each deal as it comes in and make sure we ’re happy with the overall value of the proposition . ”
An insider at Universal does n’t think that the worries expressed by EMI and Sony Music are justified , as customers with unlimited access will only download a few dozen tracks per month .
On the other hand he stressed that it is vital for the labels to innovate and compete with piracy .
Virgin Media meanwhile is undeterred by the rift between the different labels and will go full steam ahead .
They hope to release their unlimited music download service by the end of the year .
“ We ’re forging new ground and want to provide a truly compelling offering for consumers and industry , ” a Virgin Media spokeswoman said .
Good Lord !
It 's the Jesus diet :
How more people are turning to religion to help them lose weight
Praying to be thinner : Religion - based diets claim to make you feel spiritually full
New diet fads constantly offer hope to the unhappily overweight , before fading away , leaving only disappointed expectations and stubborn flab .
The more extreme the eating plan , the more keenly it 's adopted - until its followers realise that measuring portions with a thimble is n't sustainable in the long term .
But there 's a new diet trend which claims dizzyingly high success rates , promises painless life - long commitment and allows dieters to eat anything they want .
Faith - based diets take the principles of Christianity and apply them to our overwhelming craving for chocolate , chips and cheese .
Advocates say dieters learn to fill the spiritual hole inside themselves with something more powerful than saturated fats .
The basic principle common to the U.S. programmes Christian Weigh Down and Thin Within ( ' Helps you grow in faith while shrinking your waistline ' ) , and the British equivalent Fit For Life Forever , is that dieters need to identify the deeper reasons why they over - eat , before they can hope to lose weight and keep it off permanently .
The trend began in America in the Eighties , but it 's finally taking hold here , with Christian weight - loss groups springing up , and dramatically increased sales of ' spiritual dieting ' books such as What Would Jesus Eat ? , Hallelujah Diet and The God Diet .
The most famous remains The Weigh Down Diet , a programme launched in Tennessee in the late Eighties by Christian fundamentalist and nutritionist Gwen Shamblin .
Her unique method of cheerleading support , underpinned with the threat of God 's displeasure , has encouraged hundreds of thousands of Americans to throw off their excess flab and praise the Lord .
There are more than 30,000 Weigh Down groups in America , and the concept has just crossed to Britain .
Shamblin is a perma tanned , frosted - blonde size 6 , given to homey pronouncements such as : ' God created the wonderful flavours of blue cheese dressing , pepperoni pizza and chocolate brownies .
He wants us to enjoy them - within His boundaries !'
' Most of us eat for emotional reasons which conventional dieting can't begin to address '
She describes any desire to eat , apart from physical need , as ' head hunger ' , which , she insists , can be solved by an open heart rather than an open fridge .
Evangelical testimonials litter her website - ' Praise God for removing 300 lb from my morbidly obese body ! ' cries Maggie Sorrells of Texas , as if God is some sort of celestial liposuction surgeon .
Weigh Down does n't advocate particular foods , but suggests that , once participants learn to fill their spiritual hole by other means , they 'll rejoice in being able to ' stop eating that candy bar halfway through ' .
But Dr Elisabeth Weichselbaum , of the British Nutrition Foundation , is concerned by the lack of specific dietary guidance .
' If you follow this diet , you could end up eating nutritionally unsound foods , ' she warns .
' Choosing meals that do n't satiate your hunger means you could still consume too much energy . '
She is much more impressed by the What Would Jesus Eat ?
diet , whose author , Dr Don Colbert , has identified a whole new angle on the Mediterranean lifestyle .
Colbert explains : ' Jesus ate primarily natural foods in their natural states - lots of vegetables , especially beans and lentils .
He would have eaten wheat bread , fruit , drunk a lot of water and also red wine .
And he would only eat meat on special occasions , maybe once a month . '
What would Jesus eat : Nutritionists say his Mediterranean diet of vegetables and lentils is a healthy act to follow ( picture shows actor Jim Caviezel portraying Jesus in The Passion of Christ )
' This diet takes a very sensible approach , ' says Dr Weichselbaum .
' The staple food would be bread , and food from plant sources , with moderate amounts of proteins .
' This is exactly our advice - eat anything in moderation .
It also recommends asking yourself : " Why am I eating this ? "
It makes you aware of what you consume and encourages you to think about it . '
Experts have less praise for the best - selling Hallelujah Diet , the work of Reverend George H. Malkmus , who advocates eating only plant - based foods , arguing ' the Lord gave us everything we need in the Garden of Eden : fruit , vegetables , nuts and seeds . '
Dr Weichselbaum says : ' Malkmus says his diet is based on the Bible and we should eat only natural foods - then he recommends a diet supplement .
Protein seems to be totally missing , which could be damaging to health .
' He also recommends distilled water .
In fact , we need the trace minerals in water , as without them you can suffer gastric problems .
This diet is lacking a great deal ; you 'd be hungry the entire time . '
While some aspects of ' faith diets ' work , certain exponents of putting your belief in a higher power and your biscuits on a higher shelf are somewhat lacking when it comes to nutritional good sense .
But the core of this diet is the focus on issues behind weight gain , which dieters are encouraged to address through prayer and discussion .
Banish sweet treats :
The diets make you think about why you are over - eating
In this , it is remarkably similar to the secular culture of psychotherapy , and bears a strong resemblance to the Alcoholics Anonymous 12 - step programme , which also requires participants to place their trust in a higher power and share their pain with a supportive group to confront their demons .
' Both offer a sense of spirituality , and recognise that someone greater than yourself is in charge - it's not all down to you , ' explains Church of England Reverend Jan Harney , from Preston , Lancashire .
' These groups offer a useful support network , driven by the belief that God wants the best for you , and helps to identify what 's holding you back . '
She agrees the American weight - loss programmes are a little evangelical for British tastes and seem to suggest God will punish believers for putting on a few pounds .
' The jargon can be quite extreme if you 're not familiar with that world , ' she adds , perhaps thinking of Gwen Shamblin 's air - punching testimonials .
' Of course , there are always extremists , but most Christians believe that God loves you whether you deserve it or not , and you can always admit your mistakes and start again . '
Regardless of whether dieters are eating nuts and seeds or Shamblin 's unlikely ' brownies and blue cheese dip ' , the real key to sustained weight loss is the opportunity such groups offer to examine the underlying causes of weight gain in a supportive environment .
Sue Prosser , 60 , from Burton - on - Trent , founded her own Christian weight - loss programme in 2004 .
Since then her book , Fit For Life Forever ( published by Kingsway ) , has been reprinted twice , and more than 100 churches run her 12 - week courses of the same name .
' I 'd always yo - yo dieted , but a few years ago , I realised if I wanted to lose weight permanently I needed to address the root causes , ' she says .
' The issues I needed to tackle were also the areas my Christian faith covers - unresolved pain and low self - esteem .
' The Bible does n't have specific teachings on diet , and gluttony is only part of the story .
Most of us eat for emotional reasons which conventional dieting can't begin to address . '
Sue is no nutritionist , but having worked on church Outreach programmes for years , felt her own experiences could help others lose weight .
Big issue
One in four people is obese , and every year 30,000 die prematurely from obesity - related conditions
' On the course , we include Bible readings to give spiritual focus , rather than focusing on the food or nutritional supplements - though we do encourage healthy , balanced eating , ' she says .
' I want to free people from the " diet mentality " that loses the joy and intuition of eating .
There 's a scripture that says all things are permissible , but not all things are helpful ; we teach to eat freely but responsibly . '
Sue has kept her weight off for five years and has hordes of slimmed - down Christians offering testimonials to her methods .
Hilary Hawley , 54 , from Derbyshire , lost more than a stone on the Fit For Life Forever plan .
' I was n't very overweight , but my friend lost 2st 10lb through Sue 's method , ' she says .
' It concentrates on listening to your body , with lots of prayer .
Before , I felt dieting was an external thing , but it taught me to ask the right question : what do I really feel hungry for ?'
Hilary now runs the courses herself , but adds : ' It could definitely work for people who are n't religious .
It 's not weird or wacky , we just pray and talk . '
While praying is one route to fulfilment , the diet 's principles can surely work for dieters of any denomination .
Books like these are helping people to lose weight using spiritual methods
Focusing on the root causes of weight gain , and engaging with other people in a similar situation while channelling your physical hunger into more spiritual areas ( such as meditation , helping others and writing poems ) , sounds like a perfectly reasonable approach .
Common to all the faith diets is the slightly questionable belief that God wants us to be thin , and losing weight is just another step along the path to righteousness .
' Weigh Down teaches that we are to take personal responsibility for our eating habits , ' thunders its website .
' No more blaming genetics , the food content or stress for our weight gain .
The main reason for being overweight is overeating - we help you discover what His will is regarding the body . '
Although the Scriptures appear to be remarkably free of diet tips , the growing trend simply highlights what struggling dieters are really crying out for - someone to listen .
If they feel God is supporting them in the battle against weight gain , and can relax in the certainty that nobody 's going to weigh them in public , it 's not surprising the method works .
More non-judgmental support and more focus on the issues underpinning weight gain might make a difference to most dieters , religious or not .
In the meantime , it 's worth remembering that nobody ever suffered eternal damnation for eating a few extra chips .
Not even ones coated in blue cheese dressing .

AppleInsider has published an excellent article that compares AT&T ’s network to Verizon ’s network .
The article gives information about the difference between the two companies and their coverage .
Definitely an article you will want to check out .
You can view the full article HERE .
This historical setting allows Verizon to compare its entire data network against just the faster portion of AT&T ’s 3G mobile data network while ignoring AT&T ’s existing 2.5G network that approaches Verizon ’s EVDO in speed .
By only comparing the newest segment of AT&T ’s network , Verizon can advertise “ 3G maps ” that are technically accurate , but grossly misleading to users who want to obtain data service to download email and access the web .
It also appears that Verizon is counting its service areas providing less than Rev A service as part of its 3G coverage , when in fact these deliver about the same performance as AT&T ’s EDGE service .

Eye Opener : Is EPA silencing Obama critics ?
By Ed O'Keefe
Updated 4:44 p.m. ET
Happy Tuesday !
The Environmental Protection Agency has ordered two agency attorneys to remove a YouTube video they produced that criticizes climate change legislation backed by the Obama administration .
Laurie Williams and Allan Zabel , who are married and live in San Francisco , received clearance from EPA to post the video , but were told they could mention their EPA employment only once .
Agency officials ordered the couple to take down the video last Friday , saying it violated agency policy .
But Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility says the agency reversed course only after The Washington Post published an op -ed by Williams and Zabel .
" The House and Senate climate bills are not a first step in the right direction , " the couple wrote in The Post on Oct. 31 .
" They would give away valuable rights in cap - and - trade permits and create a trillion - dollar carbon - offsets market that will not lead to needed reductions . "
" EPA is abusing ethics rules to gag two conscientious employees who have every right to speak out as citizens , " PEER Executive Director Jeff Ruch said in a statement .
Ruch re-posted the original video and its script on the PEER Web site .
" EPA reversed itself because someone in headquarters had a tantrum about their Washington Post essay . "
Ruch also notes that Williams and Zabel clearly stated that they were expressing their views as private citizens and not as EPA employees .
In a statement , EPA General Counsel Scott Fulton told the New York Times that “ EPA has nearly 18,000 employees and all of them are free to -- and many do -- publicly express their views on issues of the day . "
“ The only requirement is that employees adhere to the government ’s ethical regulations , which are in place to ensure that EPA and other agencies maintain the highest possible ethical standards at all times , " Fulton said .
The couple does not face disciplinary action since they made efforts to remove the video .
But it 's not clear how PEER 's decision to re-post the video will impact the couple .

It all began tonight with an NPR article about Huntington ’s disease .
Charles Sabine , a famous journalist , had a family history of HD and decided to undergo genetic testing .
The test revealed that he will inevitably die from the genetic mutation and its horrific outcome .
I continued reading and was brought to tears about how he and his wife decided to conceive “ anyway ” .
They decided to have their 17 - month - old daughter tested as well , and – thankfully – discovered that she does not have the mutation .
This all got me thinking about the courses that I ’ve taken in which genetic testing , and the bioethics that come along with it , came up .
I always enjoyed the debates and controversy over it all .
I thought , “ Hey , that ’s interesting - these people have a chance to know their fate , in a way .
They should take advantage of recent scientific advances and get that figured out right away ! ”
I began thinking again about selective abortion in cases such as Down ’s syndrome , in which a pregnant woman can know with certainty that her child will have the disorder .
It all got worse , however , when the topic hit Home .
I suddenly heard the familiar voices of family members wagging their fingers and advising me to get genetic testing .
You see , I have a pretty long list to check off when it comes to my family health history .
When I visit a medical office for the first time , it ’s not the burden of the time that it takes to fill out the forms , nor the shame that accompanies answering such intrusive questions for complete strangers to read , that bothers me .
It ’s the worry that overcomes me when glancing at my chart once it ’s filled out !
I ’ve got a history of it all : diabetes , heart disease , epilepsy , brain aneurysm , stroke , AND breast cancer ( there ’s probably even more ) .
My mother is a breast cancer survivor and , ironically , an ex- mammogram technician .
When I was in high school and she was only about 40 years old , my Mom underwent radiation therapy and a double mastectomy .
Now , I wo n’t get into the trauma that our family incurred as a result ; there are countless similar stories on the Internet for you to sob through .
The point is that it has left me terrified of cancer and the fact that I am at elevated risk .
Anyway , my habitual glance at the front page of NPR led to a tidal wave of emotion and a frantic series of google queries .
Back at age 20 , I asked my doctor when I could get my earliest mammogram , considering my family history .
Two women staffers debated about it , and eventually declared “ 35 ” an appropriate age .
Shit , I felt like I deserved one right then and there ….

DARPA ( the same , that brought us the Internet after all ) financed a research project of AeroVironment .
They build some sort of new helicopter , that flies like a hummingbird .
Recently it flies just for several seconds , but should show the potential of a new kind of technologies .
Applications should be something like " spy- drones " , that are small , lightweight and have dynamic abilities , for example to fly " 10 meters per second " and that can " withstand 2.5 - meter - per - second wind gusts " .
Darpe just handed AeroVironment another new 2.1 million dollars to build a new , improved version of the " hummingbot " .
Robotic insects and birds are going to come .
I personally find this Butterfly robots from Japan a little more charming .

Carcasses of adult crocodiles do not usually signal the return of winter in South Africa , but mass death seems to be becoming the harbinger of the season .
Rangers at the Kruger National Park have found Nile crocodiles floating in the Oli­fants River or bloated and decaying along its banks .
Investigators are rushing to figure out the cause and worry that the deaths might be signaling the presence of toxins or pathogens that could threaten not only the croc population but also the livelihoods of the people living near the river .
The Olifants River runs several hundred kilometers through three South African provinces and into Mozambique .
It supplies water to industrial agriculture operations that send food to Europe and to the local rural communities , which also depend on those waters for fishing and farming .
The first sign of croc trouble in the river came in the winter of 2008 , when rangers collected 170 dead individuals , sometimes at a rate of 20 bodies a week .
A survey at the end of this May showed nearly 400 crocs living in the park ’s gorge , down from at least 1,000 in 2008 .
So far , as of Au­­gust 7 , rangers and scientists have found 23 carcasses .
After slicing open some of the crocodile corpses last year , researchers determined some kind of pansteatitis — an inflammation of adipose tissue — was killing the animals .
Specifically , their tails were swollen with the hardened , enlarged fat deposits , which had stiffened and immobilized the crocodiles and left them unable to hunt .
Samples of the fat showed the deposits had oxidized to bright yellow .
[ Slide Show : Photos of a croc crisis , including an image of the yellow fat ]
The disease may not be limited to crocs .
Scientists found the same kinds of fat deposits in fish in the Olifants River .
And in the river ’s gorge just upstream from Massingir Dam in Mozambique , which also has seen croc declines , birds were absent , raising the possibility that they , too , have succumbed to the same agent .
But the cause behind the strange fattening remains a mystery .
In June a team led by Henk Bouwman of North - West University , Potchefstroom Campus , in South Africa reported test results from crocodile tissues at two European chemistry meetings .
“ Everything is there , ” Bouwman says , referring to the detection of DDT , PCBs , dioxins and brominated flame retardants , “ but nothing is screaming , ‘ it ’s me , it ’s me , it ’s me . ’ ”
One possibility could be related to dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria found upstream in the catchment , which might be releasing toxins similar to those that cause red tides in marine environments , says Peter Ashton , a water resources specialist at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in South Africa and the University of Pretoria .
“ It never is a quick , easy solution ” in which it takes one test to find a culprit , explains Danny Govender , a disease ecologist for South African National Parks .
She notes that samples taken from live crocs in 2007 showed that the fat of some crocodiles was beginning to harden .
Along with Bouwman , she hypothesizes that all these toxins , found below harmful levels individually , could be acting together in a deadly brew .
Govender cites changes to the river ’s ecosystem that stem from infrastructure outside the park , including hundreds of coal - mining operations upstream , where crocodiles have disappeared almost completely , and a dam downstream of the gorge .
For the first time in the two decades since it was built , the dam ’s reservoir was full last year , slowing down the Olifants ’s flow through the crocodiles ’ gorge .
Govender wonders if the slowed water enabled toxins to build up along the crocodiles ’ stretch of the river .
Indeed , hydrogen sulfide , ammonia and other compounds from river sediments probably caused massive fish deaths in July , scientists have concluded , and crocs eating these contaminated fish could have been affected .
Even if researchers find the culprits , the impacts could reach further than suspected .
“ We really underestimated [ the number of dead ] crocodiles from last year ’s count , ” Govender adds , noting that their bodies could have been eaten by other crocs or sunk to the bottom of the river .
“ I suspect we ’re losing a lot of breeding females , ” whose carcasses are smaller and more easily scavenged .
If that is the case , she says , the gorge ’s crocodile population may not ever recover , even if scientists can pinpoint the cause of the die - off .
As for the people who depend on the Olifants River , “ I do n’t know what to tell them , ” Bouwman says .
His colleague Henrik Kylin of Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala wants to go into Mozambique to test fish there , and possibly people , to see if the croc killer kills more than just crocs .
Note :
This article was originally printed with the title , " Hunting a Croc Killer . "
The authors of these bills have tried to foster efficiencies .
The Senate bill would initiate several interesting experiments designed to make the system more effective  giving doctors incentives to collaborate , rewarding hospitals that provide quality care at lower cost .
It ’s possible that some of these experiments will bloom into potent systemic reforms .
But the general view among independent health care economists is that these changes will not fundamentally bend the cost curve .
The system after reform will look as it does today , only bigger and more expensive .
As Jeffrey S. Flier , dean of the Harvard Medical School , wrote in The Wall Street Journal last week , “ In discussions with dozens of health - care leaders and economists , I find near unanimity of opinion that , whatever its shape , the final legislation that will emerge from Congress will markedly accelerate national health - care spending rather than restrain it . ”
Rather than pushing all of the new costs onto future generations , as past governments have done , the Democrats have admirably agreed to raise taxes .
Over the next generation , the tax increases in the various bills could funnel trillions of dollars from the general economy into the medical system .
Moreover , the current estimates almost certainly understate the share of the nation ’s wealth that will have to be shifted .
In these bills , the present Congress pledges that future Congresses will impose painful measures to cut Medicare payments and impose efficiencies .
Future Congresses rarely live up to these pledges .
Somebody screams “ Rationing ! ” and there is a bipartisan rush to kill even the most tepid cost - saving measure .
After all , if the current Congress , with pride of authorship , could n’t reduce costs , why should we expect that future Congresses will ?
The bottom line is that we face a brutal choice .
Reform would make us a more decent society , but also a less vibrant one .
It would ease the anxiety of millions at the cost of future growth .
It would heal a wound in the social fabric while piling another expensive and untouchable promise on top of the many such promises we ’ve already made .
America would be a less youthful , ragged and unforgiving nation , and a more middle - aged , civilized and sedate one .
We all have to decide what we want at this moment in history , vitality or security .
We can debate this or that provision , but where we come down will depend on that moral preference .
Do n’t get stupefied by technical details .
This debate is about values .
Just a short clip of an owl coming in for a landing , up close and personal .
A month ago , we covered Wikitude , an augmented reality app for Google Android .
Augmented reality takes virtual data , places it on your phone , and allows you to interact with it using your compass , camera , and GPS .
The end result is the ability to see virtual items and information in the real world .
Wikitude 's AR app combines Wikipedia and geotagged information from its users and places it in your hands .
But while it 's been on Android for some time , it has n't been on the iPhone .
That 's because has Apple has only recently begun to accept AR on the iPhone , inadvertently starting with Yelp 's easter egg .
But now we 've learned from ReadWriteWeb that Wikitude has made its debut on the iPhone .
The free app is now available in the iTunes store [ iTunes link ] .
The app , which only works on the iPhone 3GS model ( since it has a compass ) , utilizes three layers of information and superimposes them on your iPhone : information from Wikipedia , local reviews from London - based Qype , and finally crowdsourced information from its Wikitude .me website .
With it , you can tag any location with personal notes that others can see .
You can't tell me that is n't awesome .
Apple 's been slowly opening the doors to more and more AR apps , but Wikitude is one we 've specifically been waiting for .
There are just so many possibilities with augmented reality that we can't help but be excited about this development and the future of AR .
I have written previously about a bill in Congress to audit the Federal Reserve .
There are currently 280 sponsors and cosponsors of this bill in the House of Representatives .
This is enough to pass the bill with a substantial majority and only 11 supporters short of a veto - proof majority !
Remember , this bill is about transparency .
It is about letting the American people know where trillions of their dollars went .
The Federal Reserve is a private corporation which controls our nation ’s money supply and interest rates .
It has been around since 1913 and has never been audited .
On top of that , the Federal Reserve ’s Chairman , Ben Bernanke , doesnt seem to know whats going on in his own shop .
When asked by Democratic Congressman Alan Grayson which foreign banks received over $ 500,000,000,000 [ $ 500 billion ] , Bernanke DID NOT KNOW THE ANSWER .
Watch :
We have just started to step up efforts in the Senate .
There are currently 21 sponsors and cosponsors of this bill in the Senate .
On top on this , Senator ( and former hall of fame pitcher ) Jim Bunning has come out in support of this bill , but has not sponsored it as of today .
I have been leading a campaign to bombard two Senators each day ( one Democrat and one Republican ) with phone calls in support of this measure .
Hundreds of phone calls are being made daily .
This really is a grassroots effort .
Those who follow me on Facebook are probably well aware of this campaign .
Many of you have stepped up and adopted the status messages I have posted regarding this effort .
I urge those of you who havent been involved yet to get involved .
This is grassroots Democracy at its finest .
For those of you on Facebook , I urge you to spred the word about this effort to your friends .
I recommend adopting the following Facebook status messages for the rest of the week :
Status for today ( 7/29 ) :
S. 604 ( The Audit the FED Bill ) Now has the support of 21 Senators !
Victory is within reach .
Lets target 1 Democrat and 1 Republican today and bombard them with calls to get their support .
Democrat : Al Franken ( MN ) ( 202 ) 224-5641 .
Republican : Jeff Sessions ( AL ) ( 202 ) 224-4124 .
It literally takes less than 2 minutes to call !

The university said it was the first incident of its kind
Fifteen university students have been permanently scarred after branding themselves with heated coat hangers .
The group from the University of Exeter branded their chests with the initial of the halls they lived in last year .
A reshaped metal coat hanger was heated on a stove before being pressed against the participants ' flesh for 10 seconds .
Following the private house party last month , three of the branded students were treated in hospital and given antibiotics to fight infections .
A burns specialist has warned the students will have permanent scarring .
' No coercion '
According to the university 's student newspaper , Exepose , one of the students involved said it had not been a spontaneous action , but had been talked about and planned .
It was viewed as a challenge by a group of friends with " a bit of a daredevil culture " , the student added .
Onlookers said large amounts of alcohol had been consumed at the party , but another unnamed student added there was no coercion involved .
A spokeswoman for the university said : " This is the first incident of its kind and it is not one we would condone .
" Nevertheless we wish the students involved a speedy recovery . "
There would be no formal investigation into the incident , the university spokeswoman added .

There is not enough money in NASA 's Planetary budget to both support continued preparation of MSL and all of the other missions listed above .
And how do you propose to save money by delaying MSL ?
I see no evidence that the '01 lander was cancelled to fund MRO and MER .
Indeed , when the '01 lander was cancelled , MRO and MER were not even formal proposals .
It was cancelled for engineering reasons , not budgetary reasons .
The launch of the '01 lander was n't delayed 6 years to save money for other missions .
The '01 lander was CANCELLED .
Full stop .
And by the time it was reborn as Phoenix the cost had jumped massively .
The total 2001 budget for MODY and 2001 Lander at the time of the 2001 lander cancellation was $ 283 M .
Before cancellation - figures suggest the '01 lander had cost $ 100 M .
Phoenix was supposed to be a $ 325 M cost capped scout .
Then $ 386 M .
Then $ 420 M .
Add the $ 100 M already spent - and Phoenix was a $ 520 M mission .
Take half the orig ' 01 budget , $ 142 M , and - according to your supposition that it was delayed to get things in order and rectify budget problems - it ended up costing nearly 4 x more than that .
So on what basis do you think delaying MSL will make it any cheaper or free up any money ?
It will inevitably cost more .
The logical path at this point is to get it off the ground at the earliest safe opportunity , because once it's off the ground , you 're spending money on flight operations , not ATLO , and they are a lot cheaper .
Also - I do not see evidence that Juno , Maven and Grail are suffering greatly because of MSL .
Indeed - it has been stated that :
QUOTE
The other major planetary mission in development ( Juno Jupiter mission ( 2011 launch ) , lunar GRAIL mission ( 2011 launch ) , and the Mars MAVEN mission ( 2013 launch ) ) would proceed as planned .
Furthermore - heritage from the MSL design is required for missions already planned in the 2016 + time frame .
Delaying MSL until that time frame would push those missions off into mid 2020's and beyond .
It has been conceded that the Mars Program can not continue like it is .
Hence the NASA / ESA partnership for future missions .
But to get to that place , MSL needs to go first so that a clean interface ( MSL derived descent stage to payload ) can be presented for international cooperation .
MSL is massively , massively expensive and massively massively over budget .
It should have been considered a flagship class mission from day 1 .
It needs a full independent review conducted by outsiders from industry and other NASA centres to establish how and why it 's budget was so wrong at the beginning , after it 's launched .
It 's going to cost $ XM to finish it from now .
It 's going to cost $ XM + some quite large yet probably unknown amount that will , inevitably , suffer it 's own budget creep to delay .
Delaying it 5 years would :
Not save money .
It would cost more .
Not positively impact other missions , as more money would , in total , be spent .
Negatively impact , massively , the 2016 +
Mars program
Put at risk the NASA / ESA partnership for Mars exploration in that time frame .
Reduce the likelihood of MODY , MRO and MEX being available for relay .
Before continuing , I would urge you to review the forum rules , especially regarding politics which technically , your first post breaks .
But this IS an interesting discussion , so I 'll let that go - but the admin team is keeping a close eye on this thread .

Three scientists who harnessed the power of light in ways that helped turn the Internet into a global phenomenon and launched the digital - camera revolution were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics on Tuesday .
Charles Kao , who received half the total prize money of $ 1.4 million , was lauded for a breakthrough that led to fiber - optic cables , the thin glass threads that carry a vast chunk of the world 's phone and data traffic and make up the circulatory system of the Internet .
The other half of the prize was shared by Willard Boyle and George Smith for work that led to the charge - coupled device , the " electronic eye " of a digital camera that turns light into electrical signals .
The device , which eliminates the need for capturing images on film , paved the way for both today 's point - and - shoot digital cameras and the Hubble Space Telescope .
The Nobel committee described the three physicists as " masters of light . "

For more than thirty years , women have been at the losing end of this fight .
Since Roe v.
Wade , the men of our government have systematically voted against us .
With every further restriction of our reproductive freedoms , they have said , in no uncertain terms , that women do not have the right to control their own bodies .
It is a right men enjoy , and a right women do not .
And we 've fought this war on their terms .
Even the " pro-choice " Democrats are apologetic about it .
Even the " pro-choice "
Democrats start from the position that abortion is bad and wrong and tragic , but a necessary evil .
As if that has anything to do with our rights .
In 2004 , the Democratic presidential nominee said he was personally opposed to abortion -- as if his personal opposition to a medical procedure has anything to do with women 's autonomy .
And every time we fight this war on their terms , we lose .
Every time we acknowledge the legitimacy of those who oppose reproductive freedom , we lose .
Every time we pride ourselves on our big tent , and how great it is that there are enemies of women among us , we lose .
And I am sick and tired of losing .
My autonomy is not about your religious beliefs .
My autonomy is not about your " concerns . "
My autonomy is not about your arbitrary belief that rape victims are entitled to reproductive health care , but women who " use it as contraception " or " change their minds " or " forget to use birth control " are somehow not entitled to reproductive health care .
I refuse to argue the minutia anymore .
I refuse to beg for the right to be a full and equal citizen .
I refuse to be taken for granted by the Democratic party , who tells me I have no choice but to vote Democrat in elections , and then congratulates itself for its big tent when it comes time to vote on legislation .
Do n't tell me how you feel about abortion .
I do n't care how you feel about abortion .
Tell me how you feel about my rights .
Tell me whether you believe I am a full and equal citizen .
Tell me whether you really believe the Democratic party stands for women .
It is time for every member of the Democratic party to answer one simple question :

Iraq war inquiry will be no whitewash , Chilcot says
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The man in charge of the inquiry examining events surrounding the Iraq war has said his committee will not produce a report that is a " whitewash " .
Sir John Chilcot , a retired career civil servant , has promised to produce a " full and insightful " account .
Evidence from senior government figures will start on Tuesday and politicians , including former Prime Minister Tony Blair will be called early in 2010 .
The report will not be released until after the General Election .
Critics have questioned whether a committee chosen by Downing Street can be independent of the government .
But Sir John has insisted he and his four colleagues are impartial and open minded .
' Public scrutiny '
" When you set up an independent inquiry of this sort , you set the members of it free to do what they will , " he said .
" Our determination is to do not merely a thorough job but one that is frank and will bear public scrutiny .
" All five members of the committee are now completely independent from different perspectives and bodies of experience . "
Opposition politicians have also asked why a barrister will not be used to cross -examine politicians and civil servants .
Instead , the committee will question witnesses .
But Sir John said he was conducting an investigation , not a trial or a court hearing .
If there was a gap we would know it and find it
Sir John Chilcot
Q&A : Iraq war inquiry
He believes the fact he has access to all government records will deter people from lying because , as he puts it , " the stuff is there on paper anyway " .
" We have complete access to the entirety of the government 's records from top to bottom throughout the nine years and we have already seen more than enough to know nothing is being held back because it can't be , " he said .
" If there was a gap we would know it and find it . "
In the run-up to Christmas , witnesses called will include senior officials , diplomats and military officers .
He said his team had been working its way through an " absolute mountain range " of documentary evidence .
Members have also met the families of most of the 179 British service personnel who lost their lives in the course of the campaign , which began with the US - led invasion of 2003 .
Key questions
Through this work some of the main areas the inquiry will focus on have already become clear , he said .
They included the perennial issue of resources - whether there was enough " manpower and material " - the interaction between political decision - making and military planning , and aftercare for the bereaved and wounded .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We deserve to hear the whole , unvarnished truth Malcolm , Glasgow But Sir John acknowledged that , for many people , the overriding questions would be whether Britain was right to go to war and whether the conflict had been legal .
Asked if he could provide the definitive answers , he said .
" Definitive in one sense , yes , but not definitive in the sense of a court verdict of legal or illegal .
" It is much closer to high policy decisions - was this a wise decision ?
Was it well - taken ?
Was it founded on good advice and good information and analysis ? " he said .
Sir John said he hoped to finish the report before the end of next year .
He argued it would be irresponsible to publish any interim findings ahead of the General Election , because there was a serious risk they could prove to be incomplete or unsatisfactory and have to be changed .

Hats off to Elizabeth Blackburn , Carol Greider and Jack Szostak , the three American scientists awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine yesterday .
Their cell research demonstrates that we 're on the cusp of an era of medical innovation that could radically improve lives and life spans , if government lets it blossom .
The trio was honored for discovering how chromosomes act to protect themselves from degrading when cells divide by using an enzyme called telomerase .
Subsequent studies have found that telomerase ...

Sitting in a car at a busy intersection in downtown Toronto , another car approaches the intersection , barely slowing down before making a right turn on a red light – tires screeching as he proceeds through the turn .
Ten seconds earlier and he may have been the latest driver to run down a pedestrian at a Toronto intersection – and if the pedestrian was really unlucky , she would have been the 27th pedestrian to die this year on Toronto streets .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
Last week a Toronto Sun video rubbed me the wrong way .
For once , it was n’t solely the result of poor reporting – it had more to do with irresponsibility of the Toronto Police Service for ignoring the real problem on our streets .
The video consists of a report by Toronto Sun reporter Chris Doucette on the death of a 65 - year - old pedestrian who was killed last Tuesday in North York while crossing Greenwood Village Road near Bathurst and Steeles .
Here are some points pulled from the video :
Police are urging pedestrians to be more careful when crossing the street
The city has seen 40 fatalities on our streets – 26 were pedestrians – 16 of those were seniors
Police released a top 10 list of dangerous intersections in our city
Pedestrians need to realize their life is at risk every time they cross the street
There are some things pedestrians can do to increase their odds of reaching the other side safely
Make yourself visible , wear bright clothes and make eye contact with drivers when crossing
Although I think it ’s good to remind pedestrians to be cautious when crossing the road , there is nonetheless a gaping hole in the logic used by the Toronto Police Service .
There is absolutely no mention whatsoever in this report that calls for drivers to be more cautious when entering these dangerous intersections .
For the Toronto Police Service to focus on pedestrians instead of focusing on the core issue on our streets is completely irresponsible and illustrates how complacent we have become as a society .
It confirms that we have created a society where drivers need n’t be responsible for their actions by blaming the vulnerable victims who have needlessly died as a result of these drivers ’ careless actions .
This same mentality is common when discussing cycling in the city as well .
I have heard people make comments such as “ cyclists who ride without helmets deserve what ’s coming because they have no regard for their own safety . ”
This ass - backwards logic of putting the onus on the most vulnerable users of our roads makes absolutely no sense .
It has created a sense of entitlement for drivers and it creates unnecessary risk for everybody else .
Drivers have the greatest responsibility on our roads because their actions can have fatal results on the more vulnerable users of the road ( pedestrians , cyclists , motorcyclists , etc. ) .
Instead of having the police enforce the law – or at the very least lowering city speed limits – police have taken the easier route by encouraging pedestrians to be responsible for protecting themselves from careless drivers .
It ’s almost comical to hear a police spokesperson say “ your life is at risk every time you cross the street ” .
I wonder if the thought crossed his mind that maybe we should do something about the root cause of the problem rather than trying to put a band - aid solution on top of it .
Copenhagenize ’s Mikael Colville - Andersen highlights the irrationalness of our car - dominated society in his recent article that discusses “ pedestrian flags ” that are being trialed in Berkley California .
It may sound like a joke , but it ’s real .
The car is still king in this city and anyone who gets in its way should have known better than to mess with the king .
Better days will be upon us and I hope we will look back at this article and laugh at how asinine we used to be .

NoSQL East 2009 - Summary of Day 1
After using a non-relational database while creating was it up ?
I 've learned first hand that MySQL or PostgreSQL is n't always the best solution .
Since was it up ?
is a web monitoring service it needs to be distributed to minimize the likelihood of downtime .
Tokyo
Tyrant was therefore used with a master to master replication setup so that write operations still could be carried out if one node went down .
But Tokyo
Tyrant is n't the only database solution with a distributed nature for handling scaling or high availability demands .
I therefore went all the way to Atlanta , GA for the NoSQL East conference to learn more about these other offerings in the non-relational database world ( sponsored by my generous employer : BEKK ) .
What follows is the highlights of the talks that I attended .
Cambrian Explosion -- John Willis
John have done work on Ubuntu One which is Euqalyptus based .
He 's focusing on operational side of cloud computing .
What are the new data centers going to look like ?
The average guy can now actually use a DSL that abstracts this phenomenoal technology .
Argues that we are at the base of an explosion of innovation driven primarily by four factors :
Abstract and fault tolerant components : the components are abstracted , so they are easy to put together for consumers .
Unlimited infrastructure : we never run out , there is no shortage of resources since they are reproducible and duplicateable .
World wide collaboration : you can have loads of people working on projects together without never meeting each other ( prevalent in the open source world ) .
Changes in intellectual property : open source is the primary driver in changing how we see intellectual property .
NoSQL was a great name to get the conversation started .
But it 's not an either or .
You 'll have to think about the use cases first .
Not everything fits in the standard table and column layout of relational systems .
John started with big data in the 70s when he worked on a backup system with a IBM 3850 which had 500 GB of data .
This setup costed $ 20,000,000 back then .
Contrast this with a Western Digital HDD from 2009 with 500 GB storage for $ 50 .
How did we get to todays world where big data is getting easier and cheaper than yesterday ?

Voldemort -- Geir Magnusson -- Gilt Groupe
The traditional e-commerce data model leads to denormalization for performance and decoupling purposes .
For instance , in order to saperate user data and credit card data one can not use joins anymore .
Once you go down this path your standard tooling breaks apart ( ORMs ) .
In the end of the day one have to start looking into other persistence solutions .
Voldemort is a distributed map with consistent hashing ( so that one easily can add new nodes without rebuilds ) , vector clocks to determine version ordering , a pluggable storage backend , and has no master ( no single point of failure ) .
Voldemort has several choices of serialization and storage backends :
Serialization : String , JSON , Protocol Buffers ,
Thift
Serialization : BDB , MySQL , memory , Hadoop , MongoDB .
The basic architecture consists of ( from top to bottom ) a client API layer , conflict resolution layer , serialization layer , routing and read repair layer , failover layer , and a storage layer .
Data is organized into named stores that can have independent configurations with regards to the storage engine and request routing settings .
The client API is simply :
get ( key )
getAll ( [ key1 , key2 , key3 , keyN ] )
put ( key , value , version )
delete ( key )
delete ( key , version )
Gilt Groupe is an invite only e-commerce store for very high end products .
It has millions of page views each hour with fast ramp up , high volume of transactions ( registration , login , wait list ) , and high volume shared state ( add to chart , checkout ) .
The challenge is that the traffic spikes enormously when the products goes on sale a particular time each day .
They could actually almost turn off their systems half of the day .
The backend is Rails based with several share nothing app servers , which scales horizontally with Zeus as a load balancer in front .
The problem is ( as always ) that their single PostgreSQL DB is the large bottleneck when sufficient Rails servers are running .
They solved this by using Voldemort for the shopping cart and order processing system , while still keeping PostgreSQL at the bottom of the stack .
They chose Voldemort since it was the only solution freely available which were in production use at the time .
While deciding on what storage backend to use they looked at Tokyo Cabinet .
The problem was that when the dataset was larger than memory performance decreased vastly .
BDB worked better since it persist data in memory to disk asynchrounously ( like Redis ) .
Gilt Group did not abandon SQL entirely , so their solution is AlongsideSQL instead of NoSQL .
Dynomite -- Cliff Moon--Microsoft / Powerset
Dynomite is a distributed key / value store modeled after the Dynamo paper from Amazon , written in Erlang .
It 's good at storing large data as it was designed for storing images .
At Microsoft / Powerset they used it to mirror Wikipedia and Flickr 's photos .
If you do a search on Bing which lists pictures , the images are served from Dynomite .
Cliff Moon talks about Dynomite .
Picture taken by Paul Stamatiou .
Dynomite uses merkle tree replication , cluster wide quorum settings ( the author regrets this choice ) , vector clock read repairs , physical token partitioning scheme ( buckets are real buckets on disk ) , loads of protocol adapters ( binary Erlang , Thift , ASCII ) , and pluggable storage backends .
After Microsoft acquired Powerset Cliff could not push code back to the Dynomite project ( not even in his free time ) .
The project has therefore stagnated .
He has written several improvments since then , but he 's unable to push them upstream .
Hopefully the lawyers at Microsoft will allow him to publish these changes in the future .
It 's therefore not advised to use Dynomite right now as there are three disparate versions .
The architecture described in the Dynamo paper is very generic , one could distribute any stateful service and not just storage .
A Dynomite framework could be created where logic is distributed alongside data -- persistence for any data model .
The advantages of such a system is lower latency and you do n't have to rely on a stateless app server .
The disadvantages is that it would only work for purely RESTful applications ( since one would need URIs that maps to keys of the store ) .
CouchDB-- Mike Miller -- Cloudant
CouchDB is a schema - free document database written in Erlang .
It 's primary focus was robustness , high concurrency , and fault tolerance .
One key differentiator compared to other systems is its bi-directional incremental replication .
CouchDB now has over 100 production users , 3 books are in writing , and the community is vibrant .
Mike Miller talks about CouchDB. Picture taken by Paul Stamatiou .
CoucbDB 's documents are JSON based and they can have binary attachments .
Each document has a revision which are deterministically generated from the document content .
CoucbDB is very robust since it never overwrites previously written data .
There are therefore not a repair step after a server crash , and one can take backups with cp .
Concurrency is another of the pillars in CoucbDB 's design .
It uses Erlangs approach with lightweight processes which means one process per TCP connection .
The architecture is also lock free .
The API is REST based , using standard verbs : GET , PUT , POST , and DELETE .
Map / reduce views are used for generating persistent representations of document data .
These are generally written in JavaScript .
A really interesting feature of the views are that they are generated incrementally .
The views are stored in a B - tree and kept up - to - date when new data is added .
The bi-directional replication is peer based ( two nodes ) .
One can replicate a subset of documents meeting a certain criteria .
The replication happens over HTTP , which makes replication across datacenters easy and secure .
In a multi-master replication setup CouchDB can deterministically choose which revision is the winner ( with the loosing revision saved as well ) .
One of the first adopters of CouchDB of scale was BBC .
They needed flexibility in schema and robustness .
They used CouchDB as a simple key / value store for their existing application infrastructure .
It has proven to be robust in production for several years and continutes to scale to their demands of data and concurrency .
Meebo chose CoucbDB since it was flexible , easily queryable , and could scale to hundred of millions of documents .
They wrote their own sharding library ( sitting on HTTP ) called Lounge ( Nginx and Twisted based ) .
They are generally happy with CouchDB but wishes CouchDB would be more performant .
Scoopler is a realtime aggregation service with large and rapidly growing data volume .
The schema flexibility was crucial when they selected CouchDB .
A unnamed realtime analytics service migrated from a 40 + table PostgreSQL setup to a single CoucbDB document type with only two views .
Ubuntu 9.10 includes the Ubuntu
One system which stores user 's address books in CouchDB .
Replication is the killer feature in this scenario .
Riak -- Justin Sheehy -- Basho Technologies
Riak is a document oriented database and decentralized key / value store .
It 's influenced by Amazon Dynamo , CAP Theorem , and the Web ( the most successful distributed system to date ) , and operational experience with large networks ( growth , traffic spikes ) .
Riak emphasizes write availability .
Unlike other Dynamo based systems Riak supports map / reduce .
Therefore most of the work happens where the data sits .
Map / reduce are more scoped when used in Riak than with Hadoop and CouchDB .
One application request can process a small and efficient map / reduce function .
Traversing links on the Web is a perfect match for map / reduce jobs .
All of the relation following can be a map / reduce function .
The CAP theorem seems to be used in an overly simplified manner .
It 's not just : " pick two of consistency , availability , and partition tolerance " .
It 's about what compromises you 'd like to make , which you want to prioritize : " choose your own levels " .
Scalable is not about big and not about fast .
It 's about understanding and predicting how much it 's going to cost you to get better .
It tells you how much you have to spend to get more .
The point is that a statement about scalability has to be prefixed for what and how it 's scalable .
Distributed just means that it 's composed of multiple systems working saparately but in harmony .
It 's also useful to know if a system is decentralized and / or homogeneous ( no bottlenecks , no single points of failures , no special nodes ) .
Designing systems with individual failures in mind is a plan for predictable success .
One have to assume failures will happen - - be resilient .
Eventually consistent : brief sacrifices of consistency in failure conditions .
This is not an excuse for losing user data .
Cassandra -- Arin Sarkissian-- Digg
Digg is probably the only large site which have Cassandra in production ( Facebook runs a forked version ) .
Up until now Digg has used a normal LAMP stack .
Step one was to shard MySQL .
First vertical partitioned , then horizontally partitioned .
The database is no longer relational ( no joins ) .
They went out and looked at alternatives .
They wanted something open source , scalable , performant , and easily administrable .
They picked Cassandra because the promise of easier administration , no single point of failure , more flexible than a simple key / value store , very fast writes , the community was growing , and it was Java based ( 3 out 4 of the people in the team was comfortable with Java ) .
Digg implemented the green flag feature ( users you know have dugg this article ) in Cassandra as a proof of concept .
They did a dark launch with MySQL running alongside .
First they just wrote data to Cassandra , then they enabled reading from Cassandra .
Based on the results of the proof of concept Digg are going to port the entire application to Cassandra .
So far they have an internal prototype of this .
They test the prototype on live data by reading logs with JSON items written by Scribe from the live site .
They also hit the test cluster when an actual request comes in to the live site ( also through the Scibe powered log ) .
An replay feature is also implemented which can send historical request to the test cluster .
Crated Lazyboy , a ORM like interface to Cassandra with easy CRUD and views for handling secondary columns .
The new architecture of Digg has a services layer in Python between the PHP frontend and Cassandra , Memcached , and MySQL at the bottom .
Communication from PHP to Python is using Thrift .
Digg is going to continue to use MySQL some places .
Use the right tool for the job .
MongoDB-- Kyle Banker -- 10gen
MongoDB is JSON document oriented database .
These documents are stored in the database as BSON ( binary JSON ) .
BSON is efficient , fast , and is richer in type than JSON ( i.e. regex support ) .
Documents are grouped in collections which are analogous to relational tables , but are schema free .
GridFS is a specication for storing large binary files like images and videos in MongoDB .
Every document has a 4MB limit .
GridFS chuncs the large files into such 4MB parts inside a collection , with a saperate metadata collection .
MusicNation.com stores all music and video alongside the application data in MongoDB ( about 1TB ) .
MongoDB has its own wire protocol with socket drivers for several languages .
The drivers serializes the data to BSON before transfer .
Replication is used for failover and redundancy .
Most commonly a master - slave setup is used .
It 's also possible to setup a replica pair architecture .
MongoDB provides a custom query language which should be as powerful as SQL .
MongoDB understands the internal structures of its documents which enables dynamic queries .
Map / reduce functions are also supported in the query language .
BusinessInsider.com has been using MongoDB for two years with 12 M page views / month .
They like the simplification of the data model .
Posts for instance have embedded comments .
They also store real - time analytics in MongoDB which enables fast inserts and eased data analysis with dymanic queries .
Uses a single MongoDB database server , 3 Apache web servers , and Memcached caching only on the front page .
TweetCongress.org are users of MongoDB and likes that code defines the schema , and one can therefore version control the schema .
They use a single master with snapshots on a 64 - bit EC2 instance .
SourceForge.net had a large redesign this summer where they moved to MongoDB .
Their goal was to store the front pages , project pages , and download pages in a single document .
It 's deployed with one master and 5 - 6 read - only slaves ( obviously scaled for reads and reliability ) .
Tin--Tim Anglade -- GemKitty LLC
Sequential data is data this is primarily oriented along one column .
I.e. stocks , bank transactions , sensor data , Twitter feeds , and Facebook walls are all ordered along time .
Oracle and SQL Server was pushed to the limit at NASDAQ .
The architecture was optimized for writes , but was not very good at reading it back .
Petabytes of data accumulated each year .
This was resolved by outputting data to a CSV file , upload the file to S3 with an easily guessable name , and serve the file over HTTP .
Stupidly simple .
Sharding in Tin is done by splitting your data into text files .
The file names needs to be guessable , logical , and not too large ( HTTP limits ) .
Too large files hinders redundancy .
REST is the interface for querying .
Standard URLs with shortcuts ( served by Sinatra ) , i.e .
http://stocks.com/GOOG/today(.txt)
The HTTP Range header is used for fetching specific parts of these files .

It has often been proclaimed that Fox TV ’s 24 glamorizes torture , and some have suggested that CIA agents and independent contractors who went beyond the authorized interrogation techniques on real life detainees were influenced by the fictional show .
Now it turns out that the country ’s most powerful person was preoccupied with a show that many say featured “ torture porn . ”

Former President George W. Bush is evidently a big fan of the hit Fox network show that follows counter - terrorism agents in “ real time ” — so big , in fact , that when he ran into 24 co-star Carlos Bernard a few years back , he immediately wanted to know if Bernard ’s character , Tony Almeida , was a goner for sure .
According to the UK’s Daily Express :
The actor [ said ] , “ He grabbed me at a baseball game in the US .
A big guy came up to me and said , ‘ Excuse me , the President would like to speak with you . ’
I went over , and it was George W. Bush , and he said ‘ Hey Carlos , when are you coming out of that coma ?
All I can do is watch that show of yours .
Are you coming back ? ’
I was like , ‘ You do n’t have anything better to do ? ”
Bernard does seem to be a little confused about when the meeting transpired , since the only time his character was ever in a coma happened in Season 3 , which was in late November , after the 2003 baseball season had already concluded .
Almeida ’s character was believed to be killed off in Season 5 , but he later returned to become a triple agent villain in Season 7 .
Fox ’s 24 has taken some hits from observers who say the show has promoted torture .
The Parents ’ Television Council counted no less than 67 torture scenes in the show ’s first five seasons .

But other observers have pointed out the show takes a balanced view towards the controversial practice .
Kevin Drum at Washington
Monthly argued that , while the show ’s premise may be conservative , its politics are liberal .
Two years after making a brief cameo appearance in a 2006 episode , Senator John McCain , during his failed 2008 presidential bid talked to Marie Claire about his love for the show .
MC : You liken Obama to Britney in your famous ad , while portraying yourself as the more serious candidate .
Which celebrity would you like to be compared to ?
Bob Dylan ?
Jack Nicholson ?
JM : Kiefer Sutherland .
[ laughs , imitates a voice from the show 24 ] “ It ’s Jack Bauer . ”
We have a lot in common because he escapes all the time .
MC : Um , he ’s also a torturer .
JM : Yeah , that ’s right .
That ’s where Jack and I disagree .
He believes in torture , but I do n’t .
He says , “ Tell me where the weapons are . ”
The person says , “ I wo n’t . ” Bam !
“ OK , I ’ll tell . ”

McCain told Comedy Central ’s Jon Stewart in 2007 : “ I watch it all the time .

Afghan insurgent and former prime minister Gulbadin Hikmatyar has told Aljazeera that Usama Bin Laden is alive and well .
Hikmatyar , once the recipient of 20 percent of all the funds disbursed by US intelligence for fighting the Soviets , is now fighting US troops in eastern Afghanistan .
He condemned bombings against the Pakistani military , saying that only foreign , non-Muslim troops should be targeted .
He also said his group refuses to coordinate with the Haqqani Network , a rival fundamentalist militia .
He said that US troops could be given safe passage to leave Afghanistan if they would agree to go .
Online News reports of Hikmatyar : “ he said that Taliban government came to end in Afghanistan due to the wrong strategy of Al - Qaeeda . ”
This open criticism of Bin Laden by Hikmatyar points to a larger split between al - Qaeda on the one hand , and the Taliban & other insurgents on the other .
Analysts worried about al - Qaeda taking back over Qandahar should consider another possibility , which is that the neo-Taliban and neo-Mujahidin wo n’t be so stupid as to tolerate Arab al - Qaeda types in Afghanistan .
As Hikmatyar noted , the mass murderers after all got Mulla Omar overthrown and exiled .
Note that the old Taliban and other insurgents are alleged by the US to control 10 - 15 percent of Afghanistan .
Yet Jim Jones says there are less than 100 al - Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan .
Ipso facto neo-Talibanism does not imply the return of al - Qaeda .
Meanwhile , on Tuesday NATO announced that it had killed 140 Taliban in the northern Qunduz province during the first week of November .
As the nation awaits President Barack Obama ’s decision on Afghanistan strategy , it should not be forgotten that the country ’s poor and displaced face a hard and sometimes fatal winter .

Trivia Tidbit of the Day : Part 702 -- Government Land .
Federal Government Owns A Lot Of Land -
There are few more striking measures of the government ’s size than the land mass of the Federal estate .
The vast majority of federal lands fall within one of four agencies : the Interior Department ’s Bureau of Land Management , National Park Service and US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Agriculture ’s US Forest Service .
At over 258 million acres , the Bureau of Land Management alone is bigger than France and Germany combined .
When combined with the other aforementioned agencies , the land area is equal that of ten European nations .
In the United States , 30 % of the land is owned by the federal government .
In Texas , only 2.6 % of the land is owned by the federal government .

Valerie Plame Wilson cannot publicize details of her work as a CIA operative , even though a government official already outed her as an agent in an attempt to discredit her husband , Joseph C. Wilson , a federal appeals court says .
Plame Wilson , who served as chief of the unit responsible for weapons proliferation issues related to Iraq , argued that confidentiality agreements she signed to win her employment more than two decades ago should be nullified .
The CIA has prohibited her from discussing her pre-2002 employment in her 2007 memoir , Fair Game : My Life as a Spy , My Betrayal by the White House .
She maintained the confidentiality agreement should be set aside because government officials leaked to the press that she was an agent .
Also , as part of a battle to obtain retirement benefits , her 20 - year - employment status became part of the congressional record .
Given that she has been revealed as a operative , the First Amendment allows her to sidestep her confidentiality agreement , she argued .
But the appeals court , in siding with a lower court and a CIA review board prohibiting her from describing her work prior to 2002 , said the nation 's national security could be compromised ( . pdf ) by the disclosures she 'd planned in her book .
In addition , the court said , it was irrelevant whether it was widely known that she was working under cover .
" That Ms. Wilson 's service may have been cut short by the failure of others to respect the classified status of her employment may well have warranted investigation .
But these circumstances do not absolve Ms. Wilson of her own secrecy obligations , " a three - judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday .
In a concurring opinion , Judge Robert Katzmann agreed that the court 's hands were tied .
But Katzmann suggested that it made no sense for the CIA to claim national security .
The CIA 's position , he wrote , " blinks reality in light of the unique facts of this case and the policies behind the doctrines at issue here . "
Nearly three years after the so - called " Yellowcake " scandal , Plame Wilson resigned in 2006 after concluding she was of little value to the CIA , given that her identity had been leaked to Novak .
Before the press outed her , Plame Wilson 's husband published an op -ed in The New York Times discrediting President George W. Bush 's assertion that Saddam Hussein sought significant quantities of uranium yellowcake from Africa .
The husband was the former chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq and had previously investigated the uranium allegations at the behest of the CIA .
In response to the column , however , the conservative columnist Robert Novak revealed Plame Wilson 's identity , writing that it was the wife 's idea to have sent her husband to Niger to investigate Iraq 's alleged uranium purchases .
According to a grand jury investigation in Vice President Dick Cheney 's chief of staff – I . Lewis Libby – Richard Armitage , Karl Rove , and Libby leaked Plame Wilson 's identity to members of the press .
President Bush commuted Libby 's 30 - month sentence following his conviction of obstruction of justice , perjury and making false statements
To assist in Libby 's prosecution , the government officially disclosed that Plame Wilson worked for the CIA from at least 2002 .

Big Brother quiz for new school parents : Officials launch 83 - point probe into families ' lives
Parents of five - year - olds starting school have been sent an 83 - point questionnaire that probes personal details of their lives .
It asks whether their children tell lies or bully others , and if they steal at home or from shops .
Parents are questioned over whether they have friends , if they can speak freely with others in their family and how well they did at school themselves .
Parents of five - year - olds starting school have been sent an 83 - point questionnaire that probes personal details of their lives such as how well they did at school themselves ( file photo )
The form also delves into family routines , questioning whether they eat takeaways and if the children drink water with their meals .
Thousands of families in Lincolnshire were sent the forms as part of trials of a ' Healthy Child Programme ' being developed in Whitehall .
The Department of Health wants all families in England and Wales to fill in similar forms .
The information will be held indefinitely on NHS databases for the use of health workers .
Planners want new forms submitted each year to build up a detailed picture of the family and their children 's development .
Children themselves will fill in questionnaires when they become old enough .
The aim is to ' enhance children 's life chances ' but critics warned of unprecedented intrusion into family life and the growth of a major new state database .
Parents have been told the information is ' confidential ' but it will be available to health workers who will decide whether families should be approached by health visitors offering ' support ' .
It will also be used to identify districts with widespread health and social problems so officials can plan and target health campaigns .
There is no legal compulsion to fill in the School Entry Wellbeing Review forms , but parents who do not are likely to be visited by community nurses charged with identifying vulnerable families .
Dylan Sharpe of the Big Brother Watch pressure group said : ' This is incredibly intrusive and asks questions which , quite frankly , Lincolnshire Community Health Services do not need to know and have no right knowing .
' Even worse , the NHS Trust has failed to make it clear that this is a voluntary questionnaire .
I would advise any parent receiving this to stick it straight in the bin . '
Jill Kirby of the centre - right think tank Centre for Policy Studies said : ' This is badly wrong for a number of reasons .
' Parents are not told how the information will be used , nor that they can refuse to give it and it will create worry and suspicion among many families .
' It risks labelling children and families as problem cases when the aim should be to help children escape from difficult backgrounds .
It will make families wary and those most in need of help are likely to retreat from it . '
Joy Wood , clinical team leader at Lincolnshire Community Health Services , said shorter questionnaires had been sent in previous years .
This year 's trial was intended to help identify vulnerable children .
She said : ' The intention is that the children that need our services will be supported .
We are not keeping this information to be divulged to third parties . '
After a complaint from a parent , letters are being sent out making it clear that filling in the form is voluntary .
The Department of Health said last night : ' Many local areas currently administer a questionnaire to parents as the basis for a review at school entry .
' The Healthy Child Programme includes the commitment to build on good practice to make available a standardised , evaluated version .
' We will ensure this complies with legal requirements in relation to data handling and approaches to encourage take - up .
In a warm bath with a razor is the most comfortable way to commit suicide .
That ’s what I remember hearing from my moms at a relatively young ( for that kind of information ) age .
My mother ’s first serious male lover killed himself , not in a bathtub but I do n’t remember how , after buying the ring but before popping the question .
His mother showed my mother the ring , after the funeral .
When our distant cousin ’s husband killed himself ( with a gun , after trying the bathtub thing ) , her best friend came over to see the scene and to see his body – so that my cousin would n’t be alone carrying around that vision in her brain ( she had found him , dead in their bedroom ) .
That was a mitzvah , my mother said .
At the shiva , my mother told his family that he was n’t in his right mind , because by definition people who commit suicide are not , and they should n’t ever think they could have done anything differently or better , and prevented this outcome .
That was a partial lie , which was also a mitzvah , because sometimes suicide is sane .
Euthanasia should be illegal to prevent exploitation , but sometimes letting someone you love die can be a loving gift , and helping someone you love die can be a sacred duty that transcends the level of morality to which law is limited .
I was looking away from the hospital bed , talking to my aunt , when my mother died .
Later , my co-mother , who had fallen in love with my mother when they were fifteen and fourteen , told me that she ’d held a pillow over her face , to help her go .
By then she ’d been lying drugged up and unconscious in that bed for three days , after a year of radiation , chemotherapy , wheelchairs , and bedsores .
I do n’t know if it ’s true – by that time my co-mother ’s mental state was already compromised with as yet undiagnosed early onset dementia , and I do n’t remember seeing her near the head of the bed .
But it was comforting for her to think that she could serve my mother , one last time , in this way .
They talked about reincarnation .
They had found each other , in one life time after another , over centuries .
Sometimes they had many years together and some times not even a day .
The next time , they would meet and my mother would be wearing red heels .
My co-mother ’s dementia , not Alzheimer ’s but another kind that begins in the frontal lobe and seems to leave the memory intact as it gradually destroys the mind and body , was diagnosed two years later .
Since my mother was dead and I ’m the oldest sibling , I became responsible .
We signed all kind of forms about my legal power over her .
She did understand what was happening to her , and its inevitable course , but even at the time I was n’t sure about her objective mental competence to sign those forms .
At some point it went beyond willful ignorance and I began lying , over and over again , as necessary .
‘ Yes , she had consented to me selling her condo . ’
Well , she did n’t say anything when I told her I was doing it .
By then she had been mute for a year and a half .
I needed the money to keep paying for her nursing home – I stopped being able to take care of her when she could still move enough to leave the house on her own but did n’t really respond to things like traffic lights , or traffic .
It was before she moved into the nursing home ( for my sake , she said , so that I could go on with my adventures ) , that she mentioned that she would buy a Roman ticket .
‘ What ’s that ? ’
I do n’t remember exactly how it all worked , but it referred to a one way ticket out of living .
I ’m not sure how she would have done it , or when she would have even been able to .
But I asked her not to .
‘ I still need you .
We still need you . ’
We , my brother and I , were twenty - three and twenty - one .
She stayed .
That ’s how I became responsible for her dying .
I failed .
I continue to fail .
She still lives in a nursing home .
She makes no sounds .
This year she stopped being able to walk on her own .
Her right side works even less than her left and she keeps her right hand curled in a tight ball all the time .
She ca n’t read and she does n’t have the attention span or concentration or acuity to be read to , or even to watch television .
She lies down and sometimes she sits .
Sometimes she seems to smile / cry with her eyes , and give just the tiniest hint of puckering her lips , when I ’m kissing her cheeks .
But now I do n’t live in her city anymore and I only see her every six weeks or so , and every time I go , I ’m wondering , ‘ do I still need her ?
Do I really still need her ?
Is it human of me to let her live ? ’
I do n’t know how I ’d kill her .
I ’ve never even gotten that far .
Every time I think of her not being alive any more , I remember the intensity of the difference between the world with my mother in it , unconscious on a hospital bed , and the world without her in it at all , and I ca n’t bear to think her really , truly gone .
Though every time I come back to find her in the same state in which I left her , whether after a day or a month , I question and despise myself a little more .
I ’m scared of a murder trial or conviction , yes , but I ca n’t help but think that if I really wanted to , I could find a way .
But I ca n’t – I ca n’t help her die .
But I do n’t know yet how to live with myself , letting her live .
She was a stoic outside a time of stoicism .
She loved the story of The Count of Monte Cristo and the ideal of the Jedi Knight .
“ Wait and Hope ” is what she wrote for herself on her computer screen , after she understood her diagnosis but before she stopped being able to play her favorite computer role - playing game .
What am I making her wait for now , especially if somewhere , somehow , my mother is wearing red shoes , waiting for her ?
Boulder , CO , USA - A timely debate on " United States Coal Peak Production " will enliven the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Portland , Oregon , today .
Highly regarded experts David B. Rutledge of the California Institute of Technology and Robert C. Milici from the U.S. Geological Survey will be keynote speakers presenting opposing views .
Coal peak production has been a seriously debated topic for the past few years outside the coal - science community .
" We hope to spur science - based discussions by membership of the coal geology and geology and health communities , " said session co-chair Romeo Flores .
" Regardless of the magnitude of coal peak production , there will be a commensurate effect with respect to the overall environmental impact on CO 2 emissions from coal - fired power plants and its relation to global climate change , health , and economic growth . "
Dr. Rutledge 's impact on the subject of coal peak production began with a critical assessment of the world 's coal reserves by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which he estimated to be much lower than previous calculations .
His newly created model , using principles from M. King Hubbert 's concept of oil peak production , projects ultimate coal production to 665 billion metric tons .
This amounts to 59 percent of the corresponding number of reserves , which the World Energy Council estimated as 847 billion metric tons of coal as of year - end 2005 .
Thus , if the lesser estimate of world coal reserves is indeed the most reliable , then the resulting lesser amounts of CO 2 ultimately emitted will tend to mitigate future impacts on global climate change .
The National Research Council 's Committee on Coal Research , Technology , and Resource Assessments agrees with many of Dr. Rutledge 's criticisms but maintains positive coal reserves scenario .
The highlight of these criticisms was presented at the 2008 American Geophysical Union Fall meeting in which he suggested that governments have overestimated coal reserves .

Dr. Milici and co-authors Romeo Flores and Gary Stricker ( also USGS ) , also using M. King Hubbert 's methodology for estimating peak oil production , apply several estimates of potential coal reserves to calculate peak coal production for the United States .
Reserve depletion is related to economic factors rather than to physical exhaustion of the remaining coal in the ground .
However , because the amount of coal in the U.S. that may be considered as a potential reserve is uncertain , they estimate that peak U.S. coal production will occur sometime between the years of 2062 and 2105 .
Additional digital coal resource studies are essential so that we can reduce the uncertainty in our coal reserve estimates , and make informed decision on future energy supply .
At present , most of the coal produced in the U.S. comes from several large mines in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming .
As the coals reserves at these large mines are exhausted within the next few decades , coal production will be replaced either by developing new reserves locally or by the opening of new mines elsewhere within remaining large blocks of economically producible coal .
As these more economically producible coal deposits are exhausted , production costs will rise until at some point other methods of producing electric power will become economically more competitive , and eventually replace coal as a primary source for electricity .
Note : Scheduled keynote speaker , Dr. Frank A. Clemente from The Pennsylvania State University , notified co-presenters Sunday that he was unable to attend due to unforeseeable circumstances .

Colin Beavan sat under the light of a single bulb , freaking out .
Along with his wife and young daughter , he had just spent a year trying to reduce their net environmental impact to almost zero .
With a flip of a switch , they had cut their Manhattan apartment off from the electrical grid .
They had stopped using anything disposable or buying anything new .
In a city of skyscrapers , they had given up elevators .
They went everywhere by bicycle , bought food directly from local farmers , had even sworn off toilet paper .
It had been a year of rules , a year in which nearly every aspect of their lives had been shaped by what they were not allowed to do .
And now it was over .
So Mr. Beavan sat at home .
If he had to get up to go to the bathroom , he would walk to the other room and turn on the light there — and then run back to turn off the first light .
He just could n't let himself light up more than one bulb at once .
He walked around the apartment unplugging things .
Once , Beavan and his wife , Michelle Conlin , had lived lives of take - out dinners and taxi rides , recreational shopping and reality TV .
But as his family cut back — and as he learned more about the devastation wrought worldwide by human consumption — he had found relief , and an easier conscience .
Now , as he turned the lights back on , he had to admit that he was once again part of the problem .
The new freedom and the old guilt .
It felt awful .
Beavan 's experiment with the extreme had played out in public ; he had blogged about it on his site " No Impact Man " ( which would beget a book under the same name , published last month , and a documentary ) .
But now , like so many of us who are grappling with a growing awareness of the dangers faced by the planet and the damage our lifestyles cause , Beavan and his family were faced with the challenge of finding their own middle ground .
With their years of excess and their year of simplicity behind them , how would they choose to live ?
Little Isabella was not yet 2 when the experiment began , but she already knew who " the man " was .
Nearly every morning , as her family prepared for the day in their one - bedroom , lower Fifth Avenue apartment , " the man " would arrive with a bag of breakfast bagels .
At night , he 'd pass their doorman carrying a plastic bag filled with cartons from Big Enchilada .
Or with Chinese food .
Or with deli fare .
On the street , Bella would spot a bicyclist riding by , and she 'd point and yell : " There 's the man ! "
In the evenings , they 'd settle down to eat in front of their TV .
Conlin , a journalist who writes for Business Week , was obsessed with reality shows : " The Bachelorette , " '' Paradise Hotel , " '' Temptation Island . "
One day , in the depths of " Bridezillas , " she looked over and saw Bella was n't just sitting next to her — she was watching intently .
Conlin 's heart sank a little .
This was n't what she wanted for her daughter .
Meanwhile , Beavan — a self - professed guilty liberal who had written books on the history of forensics and of D - Day — found himself railing about the travesty of global warming .
But after returning to his apartment from a meeting with his agent only to discover he'd left the air conditioner running , he started to question whether he had any right to complain .
So Beavan arrived at the idea for the experiment , both as environmental activism and as subject for his next book .
Mrs. Conlin , eager to eliminate what she felt were her addictions , suggested that shopping , TV and movies should be among the first things to go .
Instead of " the man , " food now came from the farmers .
They began eating vegetarian and shopping at the local farmers ' market , eating only things they already had in their apartment or that were grown within 250 miles .
At night , the three of them would sit around the table together and ... talk .
" The hearth was the TV before ' No Impact , ' " Conlin says now .
" After we gave away the TV , the hearth became our family table .
... I gave up reality TV for reality . "
It was a trade they had no intention of reversing , once the experiment was over .
So much of what they'd thought would feel like sacrifice had ended up being nothing of the sort .
When the year was over , Conlin and Beavan did n't want to set any more rules for themselves .
After all the restrictions , they wanted to finally let it all go and see what felt right .
Mostly , they stuck to buying their food at the farmer 's market .
But if they were short on groceries after a late night at work , they would stop at the supermarket — despite the packaging on the food on the shelves , despite the distance it had traveled .
While the amount of garbage they produced increased from a single quart every four days to five gallons , this was a far cry from the 90 gallons they produced before the experiment .
Their refrigerator is back on , but their freezer is gone .
They started buying olive oil and some seasonings , even though they 're not made nearby .
They began saying yes when friends invited them out to dinner .
And they started using toilet paper again — but now it was made from recycled paper .
Neither of them wanted to bring back their giant , 46 - inch TV .
But once a week or so , if they 're in the mood , they 'll watch a drama on a laptop .
It was an obvious choice to keep the rickshaw bikes they 'd come to love — three - wheelers with space for groceries and a seat for Isabella .
But now , when it rains , they sometimes take the subway .
The air conditioners once seemed like a necessity .
But take them away , and the heat and the lack of electronic entertainment drove the family outside , where they spent most evenings at the fountain at Washington Square Park .
They cooled off in the mist of the fountain , looked around at the virtual circus of performers who have made the public plaza their stage .
They talked with neighbors .
No longer hunkered down in their family 's lonely bubble , they were out in the city .
They loved it .
At one point during the experiment , Isabella woke up sick in the middle of the night and threw up .
Staring at the sheets and pajamas , Beavan just could n't face piling them into the bathtub and washing them by hand .
Feeling a bit like a failure , he headed downstairs to the building 's electric laundry machine and gave in .
The next time he had a pile of laundry , he figured if he had broken the rule once , a second time would n't hurt .
After that , the slippery slope became a laundry landslide .
It was a rule he did n't really regret breaking .
There are some resource conservation measures , it turns out , that could turn even the most fervent environmentalist against going full - out green .
Conlin , too , found her limit .
Coffee beans are not grown anywhere near the Eastern seaboard , but local food or no , caffeine was one addiction she could n't shake .
She did , however , ask cafes to fill a portable container so she would n't waste a cup .
Toward the end of the experiment , Conlin would talk about how much she wanted a dishwasher again .
But when they flipped the power switch , the machine stayed dead .
There was no way to fix it , and an attempt to buy a used model flopped .
So Conlin did her research and found a new one that seemed the most responsible purchase .
But when they got to Home Depot and saw it , she could n't stop thinking :
All those shiny new parts .
The huge box it would come in .
All that packaging .
" I just could n't pull the trigger , " she says now , sitting in her apartment , all the lights turned off in favor of the afternoon sunlight wafting through the windows .
Still , she says , " I foresee myself at some point in my life having a dishwasher . "
Her husband looks at her in some surprise : " What has to happen before you can do that ? "
" We 've had so many arguments about the dishwasher , " he says , laughing .
" So basically the subtext here is do n't let Colin for a minute think that he 's won this fight . "
" When I want one , I 'll get one , " she says with a smile .
Some of the post - experiment adjustments have been painful .
The day after the project ended , Conlin got into a hybrid livery cab with Isabella and set off for the airport for a Thanksgiving trip to see her parents in California .
As they pulled up to the airport curb , she was overcome by a weird feeling of grief .
It was over .
And here she was getting on an airplane , a decision that by some counts would wipe out all her carbon savings of the last year .
Beavan stayed at home .
He just could n't bring himself to get on a plane .
When Christmas rolled around , they looked into taking the train , but discovered the tickets for the three of them to see her family in Minneapolis would cost a whopping $ 2,500 , more than double the plane fare .
So this time Beavan sucked it up , and he went with them to the airport .
The last few weeks he 's been flying for his book tour .
He still agonizes over it .
Beavan tries to make up for the damage by requiring those paying for his travel to make a substantial donation to a renewable energy project .
He and Conlin are taking fewer trips to visit family , and staying longer when they go .
Their experiences with travel have been a reminder of one of the lessons of the experiment :
Although their family 's project made a small - scale difference , and had inspired others in ways they had n't foreseen , it was not a replacement for larger social change .
Compared with the introduction of , say , an affordable national railway system , individual action pales .
As Beavan sees it , it 's just like a graph he sketched during the year of no impact .
With either extremely high or very low resource use , quality of life was poor .
But there was a virtual sweet spot , right at the peak , when they had enough to be happy but not so much that they were weighed down .
Since the year ended and left them to their own devices , they 've been trying to find a way to get back to that point .
" In some ways , the project actually really began the day we ended , " Conlin says now .
Beavan chimes in : " We still have n't actually figured out the way we want to live . "
No matter how happy they are with the changes they 've made , some things have been lost .
For Conlin , the thrill of shopping is gone .
A few months after the experiment ended , she ventured into a department store to replace a frayed suit for work .
But there was none of the rush , the excitement of the perfect find .
While once , on impulse , she had spent nearly $ 1,000 on a single pair of stiletto boots , she bought this suit mostly because it was practical , inexpensive , and necessary .
And they 're reconsidering some decisions that they 've made .
In a fit of what may have been overeager enthusiasm , they gave away all their fans , even though they use comparably little energy .
They 've started taking elevators again , but they say they miss the exercise they got on the stairs .
And Conlin finds herself missing the worm composting bin ( in its stead , they donate their organic waste to farmers at the market ) .
She had been disgusted by the worms , even imagining them staging a breakout and getting into the family food .
But Isabella was fascinated by them .
And the worms had given Bella a glimpse of the natural cycle of things — a rare gift for a city girl .
But other gifts remain .
At their community garden plot , where they 've been growing giant zucchini each the size of a human forearm , Bella helps them plant , and wanders through the greenery , eating tomatoes as if they were apples .
There 's no longer one nameless " man " delivering their food on a bicycle .
Now they themselves are on wheels , breeze in their faces , exploring the city .
On their frequent excursions to the park , Isabella often asks to talk to a stranger .
Usually , her parents say yes .
Often , Isabella and Beavan head out the door , no destination in mind .
And in a ritual that began during the year that taught them so much , he turns to her and says : " Let 's go see what happens . "

This is a composite image of the most distant galaxy cluster yet detected .
This image contains X - rays from NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory , optical data from the Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) and optical and infrared data from the Digitized Sky Survey .
This record - breaking object , known as JKCS041 , is observed as it was when the Universe was just one quarter of its current age .
X - rays from Chandra are displayed here as the diffuse blue region , while the individual galaxies in the cluster are seen in white in the VLT 's optical data , embedded in the X - ray emission .
JKCS041 was originally detected in 2006 with infrared observations from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope ( UKIRT ) .
The distance to the cluster was then determined from optical and infrared observations from UKIRT , the Canada - France - Hawaii telescope in Hawaii and NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope .
However , scientists were not sure if it was a true galaxy cluster , rather than one that has been caught in the act of forming .
The shape and extent of the X - ray emission in the Chandra data , however , provided the definitive evidence that showed that JKCS041 was , indeed , a galaxy cluster .
The Chandra data also allowed scientists to rule out other possible explanations for the data , including a group of galaxies , or a filament of galaxies seen along the line of sight .
Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally - bound objects in the Universe .
Scientists have calculated when they should start assembling in the early Universe , and JKCS041 , at a distance of some 10.2 billion light years , is on the early edge of that epoch .
Follow - on observations of JKCS041 will provide scientists with an opportunity to find important information about how the Universe evolved at this crucial stage .
It turns out those leaked shots of a supposed new firmware for our beloved PlayStation 3 consoles were real .
Firmware 3.10 has officially been announced , and includes some nice social networking functionality as well as general UI improvements .
Built - in Facebook functionality will include automatic posts to your account ’s feed when you earn new trophies or make a purchase / download from the PlayStation Store .

WASHINGTON : Implicitly heeding New Delhi���s grievance for the first time about its Paksitan policy , the United States has set exacting conditions on military aid that country to ensure the assitance is focused on the war on terror and not diverted for a confrontation against India .
The US move came in amendments attached to the Defence Authorisation Bill of 2010 , amid continuing anger and dismay in Islamabad over the so - called Kerry - Lugar Bill .
That bill also conditions civilian aid to Pakistan ending its covert sponsorship of terrorism and nuclear proliferation , and reigning in its overbearing military which is seen as the root cause of the country ���s instability .
On Thursday night , the US Senate voted 68 - 29 on measures which aim at ensuring that U.S military resources provided to Pakistan are not squandered or diverted to adversely affect the ' ' balance of power in the region , '' an oblique reference to New Delhi���s long standing gripe that Pakistan ends up using U.S military aid to wage war against India .
" This provision simply ensures that the American peoples ' tax dollars are being used for their intended purpose , " Senator Bob Corker , Republican from Tennessee and co-author of the measure along with Democrat Robert Menendez of New Jersey , said .
" That fight ( against terrorism ) is important to our own national security , and we have to ensure that our support for it is not being squandered or diverted , '' Menendez added .
Neither mentioned India directly .
Both Senators ignored the hysteria in Pakistan over the Kerry - Lugar bill in pushing for the measures , which was supported by a majority of their colleagues .
The US House of Representatives had passed a similar measure earlier on October 8 .
Lawmakers were helped in this regard by reported acknowledgement by Pakistan���s former dictator Pervez Musharraf that he had diverted US aid to Pakistan to bulk up against India .
The matter was first brought to the notice of Congress and the administration by US government audits , which noted that very little of US military aid was in fact going to the purported war on terrorism .
Pakistan 's subsequent whining about the conditions in the Kerry - Lugar Bill has in fact begun to now anger Congress .
Earlier this week , Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf was reported to have snapped at visiting Pakistan Senator Syed Zafar Ali Shah when he complained about conditions being attached to US aid to Pakistan .
' ' I know why are you here ... if you don���t like the bill don���t take the money , '' an angry Wolf was quoted by a Pakistan journalist as having told Shah .
Senator John Kerry , co-author of the Kerry - Lugar bill conveyed pretty much the same message more politely during his recent visit to Islamabad , saying Pakistan was not obliged to take accept the money if it did not like the conditions .
The White House too has endorsed the line , and President Obama is expected to sign this legislation too without changes , as he did with the Kerry - Lugar bill .
Broadly , the Indian argument that any US assistance ��� civilian or military ��� is fungible and provided Pakistan the resources to mobilize militarily against India unless otherwise ensured , seems to have found some traction in Washington .
The Corker - Menendez amendment also demands scrutiny over Coalition Support Funds , which Pakistan says is largely reimbursement for money it first spends in providing logistical help to U.S in the region .
The proposed restrictions on Pakistan are buried in hundreds of pages of legislative fine print that constitutes the $ 680.2 billion defence authorisation bill .
They include new requirements for registration and end - use monitoring of weapons and mandates that the US administration certifies that the aid serves America���s interests .
But inasmuch as the legislation demands scrutiny , there is also enough wiggle room for the administration to conduct policy on its terms .
For instance , in the matter of end - use restrictions , while the bill enjoins the Secretary of Defence to ���establish and carry out a programme to provide for the registration and end - use monitoring of defence articles and defence services transferred to Afghanistan and Pakistan , ��� it also allows him to ���exempt a defence article or defence service from the registration and end - use monitoring requirements if he deems it in the US interest to do so .�� �
The Swiss are to decide this weekend whether to ban minarets on mosques , in what is in effect the first direct vote in a European country on Islam and the practices of Muslims .
The controversial referendum on Sunday , accompanied by a prohibition campaign denounced as racist and in violation of human rights , is the latest tussle in Europe over the limits of multiculturalism and immigrant lifestyles .
Pushed by anti-immigrant rightwing populists , it has triggered months of debate in a country that uses direct democracy for single - issue politics .
The referendum has turned into much more than a vote on architecture and urban planning .
" The minaret has got nothing to do with religion .
It 's a symbol of political power , a prelude to the introduction of sharia law , " argued Ulrich Schlüer , of the rightwing Swiss People 's party , an architect of the campaign .
Two years ago the SPP became the strongest party in Switzerland , with an anti-immigrant election campaign that featured posters of three white sheep kicking a black sheep off a red and white Swiss flag .
UN experts and human rights activists condemned the campaign as overtly racist .
This time the SPP has plastered the country with posters showing the same flag as a base for several black minarets , portrayed as missiles , alongside a woman clad in a black burqa .
Church leaders , the Jewish community and Muslim leaders have all opposed the campaign .
The foreign minister , Micheline Calmy - Rey , warned that a vote in favour risked turning Switzerland into " a target for Islamic terrorism " .
The city of Basel and other towns have proscribed the incendiary posters .
Amnesty International said : " Freedom of religious belief is a basic human right and changing the Swiss constitution to ban the construction of minarets would clearly breach the rights of the country 's Muslims . "
UN human rights experts have said the proposed ban violates freedom of religion and liberty .
The Swiss justice minister , Eveline Widmer - Schlumpf , has agreed , declaring that it would breach anti-discrimination laws and rights to free religious observance , raising the question of why the campaign has been allowed .
The rightwing anti-immigrant lobby has led the campaign , but it has been joined by some secularist leftists and liberals fiercely critical of Islam .
Julia Onken , a prominent feminist and psychologist and bestselling author of self - help books , last week called on women to vote for the ban .
" Mosques are male houses , minarets are male power symbols , " she declared .
" The building of minarets is also a visible signal of the state 's acceptance of the oppression of women . "
There are about 400,000 Muslims in Switzerland , 5 % of the population .
Most are immigrants from the Balkan regions of Kosovo , Albania and Bosnia and are not practising Muslims .
Of about 150 mosques or Islamic prayer houses in Switzerland , only four have minarets .
" And we do n't want any more , " said Schlüer .
" There 's no sense in banning them once you 've got hundreds .
What 's the point in waiting for that ? "
Prohibitionists and prominent SPP officials argue that the four minarets are the thin end of the wedge , to be followed by sharia law , honour killings , oppression of women and stoning .
Opinion polls indicate the anti-minaret movement will lose on Sunday , but a sizeable minority – at least one - third of voters – could support the call for a ban , and their ranks appear to be growing as the referendum nears .
People are to vote on the statement : " The construction of minarets is forbidden . "
This would be added to article 72 of the Swiss constitution if endorsed .
The government , the political mainstream and the powerful business lobbies in one of the world 's richest societies all oppose the ban for reasons of tolerance , trade prospects and fears of Muslim radicalisation and a backlash .
The business lobby is worried about the potential impact on Swiss exports to the Middle East , pointing to the experience of Denmark in the wake of the Muhammad cartoons controversy four years ago .
The arguments over the place of Islamic architecture in western Europe are not confined to Switzerland , with big mosque - building projects currently the focus of opposition in places as diverse as Copenhagen and Marseille .
Italy , Austria , Germany , and the Netherlands have all been locked in disputes over mosques in recent years as some of the biggest Islamic prayer houses and cultural centres in Europe spring up .
( CNN ) --
A search has been launched for a 50 - year - old sex offender suspected in the killings of six people whose bodies were found in and around a house in Cleveland , Ohio , police said Friday .
The incident began unfolding a month ago , when a woman accused Anthony Sowell of rape and felonious assault , Cleveland Police spokesman Lt. Thomas Stacho told CNN .
" Once we were able to get the cooperation of the victim , we secured an arrest warrant for Mr. Sowell and subsequently a search warrant for his premises , " Stacho said .
On Thursday , detectives from the department 's sex - crimes unit and members of its SWAT team went to Sowell 's home to execute the warrant and to arrest the suspect , but he was nowhere to be found , Stacho said .
What they did find were the badly decomposed remains of two bodies on the third floor of the house , which is owned by an elderly relative of Sowell who did not live there , Stacho said .
A subsequent search on Thursday revealed what appeared to be a freshly dug grave under the stairs in the basement , he said .
On Friday , investigators returned to the house , dug up the grave and found a third body , he said .
A further search of the house and property found two more bodies in a crawl space and a sixth body was found in a shallow grave outside the home , Stacho said .
Read local coverage on CNN affiliate WJW
None of the bodies has been identified , and the genders of only two -- those found on the third floor -- have been determined , he said .
Both were female .
" He apparently is a serial rapist , " Stacho said about Sowell , who he said makes his living as a " scrapper . "
" He walks around and picks up scrap metal and takes it to junk yards to make a few pennies . "
Sowell pleaded guilty to attempted rape in a 1989 case for which he was imprisoned from 1990 to 2005 , Stacho said .
Authorities plan to continue their search of the house on Saturday .
Guardsman Janes died in Helmand province in October Gordon Brown has telephoned the mother of a soldier killed in Afghanistan to apologise after apparently misspelling his name in a letter of sympathy .
Guardsman Jamie Janes , 20 , from Brighton , East Sussex , was killed in an explosion in October .
In a video distributed by the Sun newspaper , his mother Jacqui called the letter a " hastily scrawled insult " .
But Mr Brown said he was sorry " for any unintended mistake " , adding that his writing could be " difficult to read " .
Guardsman Janes , of 1st Battalion The Grenadier Guards , was killed in an explosion while on foot patrol in Helmand province .
' Personal sadness '
According to the Sun , his mother Jacqui was angry when she received the prime minister 's letter of condolence in which he appeared to misspell Guardsman Janes 's name as " James " .
In a statement , he said : " I take very seriously my responsibility to the bereaved .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Every time I write a letter to mothers and fathers and partners who have suffered bereavement to express my sincere condolences , it is a moment of personal sadness to me .
And I am in awe of the bravery and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces .
" I send a handwritten letter to every family and I often write to more than one member of the family .
" I have telephoned Jacqui Janes to apologise for any unintended mistake in the letter .
" To all other families whom I have written to , I can only apologise if my handwriting is difficult to read . "
The prime minister has previously admitted problems with his eyesight after a childhood rugby injury .
He added : " I have at all times acted in good faith seeking to do the right thing .
I do not think anyone will believe that I write letters with any intent to cause offence . "
' Debt of gratitude ' But Mrs Janes told the Sun that the letter had been " scrawled so quickly I could hardly even read it " and that " some of the words were half - finished " .
She described it as " disrespectful " and an " insult " to her son .
It has emerged that Mr Brown got Jamie Janes 's name wrong in the House of Commons on 14 October when he read out a list of 37 soldiers killed in Afghanistan .
The reason this is a story is because of the widespread sense of doubt about the continued value of British forces fighting and dying in Afghanistan
Nick Robinson
BBC political editor
Read Nick 's thoughts in full The Sun declared during the Labour Party conference that it was switching its support to the Conservatives for the next general election .
George Pascoe Watson , who was the newspaper 's political editor until last week , told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that it was not the Sun attacking the prime minister but Mrs Janes herself .
He added : " The Sun , believe it or not , does n't want to personalise it on the prime minister although in a case where a prime minister has written a personal letter it's hard not to personalise it . "
' No disrespect ' Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said the story had to be seen in the " context " of the fact that the Sun had chosen to " campaign against Gordon Brown and Labour " in the run-up to the next election .
He added : " Anyone who knows the prime minister knows that his handwriting is not great .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" But it is absolutely unthinkable that he would want to show any sort of disrespect , not only to Mrs Janes , but to all those who have suffered bereavement and to whom he writes letters .
" He cares very deeply about them , which is why he puts a lot of thought into those letters .
I hope , as he and others will do , that Mrs Janes will understand that and not take any offence . "
It is official policy for the prime minister to write to the families of all service personnel killed in action while on operational duties .
According to Ministry of Defence guidelines published on the Parliament website , the letter is drafted by military officials and should ideally be sent within two working days of the death being announced .
The defence secretary writes to the families of members of the armed forces who die in service , including those not on operations .

What motivates people to rebel against global brands — or consumption in general ?
A new study in the Journal of Consumer Research examines the connection between nationalism and the anti-consumption movement in India .
Authors Rohit Varman ( Indian Institute of Management , Calcutta ) and Russell W. Belk ( York University , Toronto ) examined a movement against Coca - Cola based in the village of Mehdiganj in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh .
They found that the movement employs a version of the nationalist ideology of swadeshi , an ideology that has been associated with Ghandhi and the overthrow of British colonialism .
" According to swadeshi , indigenous goods should be preferred by consumers even if they are more expensive and inferior in quality , " write the authors .
" The contemporary processes of globalization have again unleashed a resurgence of opposition , this time involving neo-nationalism .
As a result , the ideology of swadeshi continues to shape the ongoing debate about the concept of nationhood in India . "
The researchers examined the practices of organizations involved in the struggle against Coca Cola .
They conducted interviews with activists , villagers , and Coca Cola workers and managers .
They observed protest activities and analyzed written material on the movement .
In the course of their research , the authors found that the concept of swadeshi has morphed from its origins .
" Whereas Gandhi 's villain was colonialist Britain symbolized by its machine production , postcolonial India faces the invasion of Western branded goods , " the authors write .
" The anti-consumption movement against Coca Cola in Mehdiganj is shaped by this discourse against globalization . "
The authors found that the anti-consumption movement invokes imagery of foreign invaders , poisoned farmland , and exploited workers .
" We offer an understanding of how prominent global brands run the risk of becoming anti-national icons of oppression , " write the authors .
" These results have implications for multinational corporations , policy makers , and civil society groups . "
A Brazilian university has publicly expelled a woman who was heckled by hundreds of fellow students for wearing a short , pink skirt to class , taking out newspaper ads today to publicly accuse her of immorality .
The private Bandeirante University in São Bernardo do Campo , outside of São Paulo , said 20 - year - old Geisy Arruda disrespected " ethical principles and academic dignity and morality " .
Arruda made headlines last month when she had to be escorted away by police after she tried to go to class wearing the mini-dress .
She put on a professor 's white coat and left amid a hail of insults and curses .
Video footage of the incident , which occurred last month , was posted on YouTube and picked up by Brazilian networks .
It shows her being heckled by hundreds of other students .
Arruda has since appeared frequently on television , saying she is struggling to return to normal life after being humiliated .
Bandeirante University published advertisements accusing Arruda of attending class with " inadequate clothing " and having a provocative attitude that was " incompatible with the university environment . "
In the ad , titled " Educational Responsibility , " the college said it had warned Arruda to change her behaviour and decided to expel her after talking to students , staff and Arruda herself .
It accused her of posing for pictures and provoking other students .
Arruda told Folha Online that she was appalled .
" I was the victim , " she said .
" How can I be expelled ?
It 's absurd . "
Arruda said she learned of her expulsion through the news media and had not received official notification .
She said university officials told her last week she would be allowed to return to classes with the protection of a security guard .
Back in April , at the time of launch of iPhone 3G S , it was rumored that the next iPhone ( current iPhone 3GS ) would be capable and enabled to play true HD video in 720 p and 1080 p to television via the Apple Composite AV cable .
When it was finally released the iPhone 3GS still played video like its predecessors only supporting SD 2.5 M bps Mpeg 4 or H264 video .
As things turn out this is an arbitrary limit set by Apple possibly to conserve battery life or to simply match previous models .
A user of chinese site WeiPhone did a lot of testing with the iPhone 3GS and discovered it can smoothly play back HD video at 30 Mbps in 1980 ×1080 resolution .
The test was done by uploading various HD movies to the iPhone 3GS using the program FileAid and then running them via the iPhones built - in video player .
Not that this has any real usage in everyday life since HD video does n’t have much of a point on the small iPhone screen .
You could however pick up one of those Apple Composite AV cables and run some high - def from iPhone to TV if you REALLY needed to .
Talking about the Hardware , Samsung - branded system - on - a- chip ( SoC ) featuring a multi - format codec with untapped HD video playback and capture capabilities .
“ The S5PC100 enables the integration of various functionalities , such as , wireless communication , personal navigation , camera , portable gaming , portable music / video player , mobile TV and PDA into one device , ” the South Korea - based electronic maker says in a PDF published to its website .
“ The S5PC100 adopts a 32 - bit ARM Cortex A8 RISC microprocessor and a 64/32 - bit internal bus architecture , and operates up to 833MHz . ”
Apple appears to have chosen run the chip , which is rebranded with the following markings , below its maximum clock speed for optimal power consumption .
But the additional 233MHz are n’t the only capabilities of the S5PC100 that Apple has chosen to forgo in the iPhone 3G S .
Samsung also notes that its chip sports a high definition multi format codec enabling higher resolution multimedia functions at low power consumption .
Specifically , it states that the S5PC100 “ features a built - in , 720 p multi format codec ( MFC ) video Engine which ensures smooth 30 fps video encoding and playblack at low power consumption , and supports three types of TV out interface ( NTSC / PAL / HDMI ) . ”
Apple has thus far decided not to take advantage of these HD capabilities for video recording , as the iPhone 3G S video camera will only capture clips in VGA - quality .
Early reviews of handset were mixed in their assessment of the resulting video quality , with some saying it pales in comparison to that from the popular $ 229 Flip pocket camcorder , while others called it “ quiet decent ” and said the quality was “ impressively smooth and natural . ”

London , England ( CNN ) --
Research teams at the Danish Golf Union have discovered it takes between 100 to 1,000 years for a golf ball to decompose naturally .
A startling fact when it is also estimated 300 million balls are lost or discarded in the United States alone , every year .
It seems the simple plastic golf ball is increasingly becoming a major litter problem .
The scale of the dilemma was underlined recently in Scotland , where scientists -- who scoured the watery depths in a submarine hoping to discover evidence of the prehistoric Loch Ness monster -- were surprised to find hundreds of thousands of golf balls lining the bed of the loch .
It is thought tourists and locals have used the loch as an alternative driving range for many years .
The footage shot by underwater robotics team SeaTrepid , can be seen below .
With an increasing number of golf balls discarded each year , the Danish Golf Association devised a number of tests to determine the environmental impact of golf balls on their surroundings .
It was found that during decomposition , the golf balls dissolved to release a high quantity of heavy metals .
Dangerous levels of zinc were found in the synthetic rubber filling used in solid core golf balls .
When submerged in water , the zinc attached itself to the ground sediment and poisoned the surrounding flora and fauna .
Course manager for the Danish Golf Union , Torben Kastrup Petersen , said the scale of the problem is unknown : " There has been very little research on the environmental impact of golf balls , but it 's safe to say the indicators are not good .
We are planning to collaborate with environmentalists in America to conduct more tests to fully explore the extent of the problem . "
Local government ministers in Scotland have also complained about the level of golf ball littering .
UK lawmaker Patrick Harvie told CNN : " From the moon to the bottom of Loch Ness , golf balls are humanity 's signature litter in the most inaccessible locations . "
And he 's not wrong .
On February 6 , 1971 , astronaut Alan Shepherd was filmed taking a swing with a six iron on the surface of the moon .
According to Shepherd , the balls flew off in the distance and landed a few kilometers away .
Although the balls were left for future golfers to discover , it is believed the extreme temperatures on the surface would have dissolved the balls many moons ago .
In many cases , removing a partially degraded ball from a lake or woodland area could result in further damage to the wildlife .
So what is the solution ?
Harvie had this advice : " Keep your balls on the fairway or invest in a stock of biodegradable balls . "
I did have it there last sat , its been completed for a few months now , its getting old

Declaration from World Meeting of Left Parties , November 19 - 21 , Caracas , Venezuela
November 21 , 2009 -- Political parties and organizations from Latin America , the Caribbean , Europe , Africa , Asia , and Oceania commemorate and celebrate the unity and solidarity that brought us together in Caracas , Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela , and from this libertarian city we would like to express our revolutionary rebelliousness .
We are glad of and committed to the proud presence of the forces of change in a special moment of history .
Likewise , we are proud to reaffirm our conviction to definitively sow , grow and win Socialism of the 21st century .
In this regard , we want to sign the Commitment of Caracas as a revolutionary guide for the challenges ahead of us .
We have gathered with the aim of unifying criteria and giving concrete answers that allow us to defend our sovereignty , our social victories , and the freedom of our peoples in the face of the generalized crisis of the world capitalist system and the new threats spreading over our region and the whole world with the establishment and strengthening of military bases in the sister republics of Colombia , Panama , Aruba , Curacao , the Dutch Antilles , as well as the aggression against Ecuadorian territory , and the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan .
We consider that the world capitalist system is going through one of its most severe crises , which has shaken its very foundations and brought with it consequences that jeopardize the survival of humanity .
Likewise , capitalism and the logic of capital , destroys the environment and biodiversity , bringing with it consequences of climate change , global warming and the destruction of life .
One of the epicentres of the capitalist crisis is in the economic domain ; this highlights the limitations of unbridled free markets ruled by private monopolies .
In this situation , some governments have been asked to intervene to prevent the collapse of vital economic sectors , for instance , through the implementation of bailouts to bank institutions that amount to hundreds of billions of dollars .
Said governments have been asked to stimulate their economies by increasing public expenditure in order to mitigate the recession and the private sector decline , which evidences the end of the supposedly irrefutable “ truth ” of neo-liberalism that of non-intervention of the State in economic affairs .
In this regard , it is very timely to promote an in - depth discussion on the economic crisis , the role of the State and the construction of a new financial architecture .
In summary , the capitalist crisis cannot be reduced simply to a financial crisis ; it is a structural crisis of capital which combines the economic crisis , with an ecological crisis , a food crisis , and an energy crisis , which together represents a mortal threat to humanity and mother earth .
Faced with this crisis , left - wing movements and parties see the defence of nature and the construction of an ecologically sustainable society as a fundamental axis of our struggle for a better world .
In recent years , progressive and left - wing movements of the Latin American region have accumulated forces , and stimulated transformations , throwing up leaders that today hold important government spaces .
This has represented an important blow to the empire because the peoples have rebelled against the domination that has been imposed on them , and have left behind their fear to express their values and principles , showing the empire that we will not allow any more interference in our internal affairs , and that we are willing to defend our sovereignty .
This meeting is held at a historic time , characterized by a new imperialistic offensive against the peoples and governments of the region and of the world , a pretension supported by the oligarchies and ultraconservative right - wing , with the objective of recovering spaces lost as a consequence of the advancement of revolutionary process of liberation developing in Latin America .
These are expressed through the creation of regional organizations such as ALBA , UNASUR , PETROCARIBE , Banco del Sur , the Sao Paulo Forum , COPPPAL , among others ; where the main principles inspiring these processes are those of solidarity , complementarity , social priority over economic advantage , respect for self - determination of the peoples in open opposition to the policies of imperial domination .
For these reasons , the right - wing forces in partnership with the empire have launched an offensive to combat the advance and development of the peoples ’ struggles , especially those against the overexploitation of human beings , racist discrimination , cultural oppression , in defence of natural resources , of the land and territory from the perspective of the left and progressive movements and of world transformation .
We reflect on the fact that these events have led the U.S administration to set strategies to undermine , torpedo and destabilize the advancement of these processes of change and recuperation of sovereignty .
To this end , the US has implemented policies expressed through an ideological and media offensive that aim to discredit the revolutionary and progressive governments of the region , labelling them as totalitarian governments , violators of human rights , with links to drug - trafficking operations , and terrorism ; and also questioning the legitimacy of their origin .
This is the reason for the relentless fury with which all the empire ’s means of propaganda and its agents inside our own countries continuously attack the experiences in Venezuela , Ecuador , Nicaragua , Bolivia , and Paraguay , as with its maintenance of the blockade against revolutionary and independent Cuba .
Part of the strategy activated by the U.S. Empire is evidenced by the coup in Honduras , as well as in other destabilizing initiatives in Central America , attempting to impose the oligarchic interests that have already left hundreds of victims , while a disgusting wave of cynicism tries to cover up the dictatorship imposed by the U.S. administration with a false veil of democracy .
Along with this , it is developing a military offensive with the idea of maintaining political and military hegemony in the region , for which it is promoting new geopolitical allies , generating destabilization and disturbing peace in the region and globally through military intimidation , with the help of its allies in the internal oligarchies , who are shown to be complicit in the actions taken by the empire , giving away their sovereignty , and opening spaces for the empire ’s actions .
We consider that this new offensive is specifically expressed through two important events that took place this year in the continent :
The coup in Honduras , and the installation of military bases in Colombia and Panama , as well as the strengthening of the already existing ones in our region .
The coup in Honduras is nothing but a display of hypocrisy by the empire , a way to intimidate the rest of the governments in the region .
It is a test - laboratory that aims to set a precedent that can be applied as a new coup model and a way to encourage the right to plot against the transformational and independent processes .
We denounce the military agreement between the Colombian government and the United States administration strengthens the U.S. ’s military strategy , whose contents are expressed in the so - called “ White Book ” .
This confirms that the development of the agreement will guarantee a projection of continental and intercontinental military power , the strengthening of transportation capability and air mobility to guarantee the improvement of its action capability , in order to provide the right conditions to have access to energy sources .
It also consolidates its political partnership with the regional oligarchy for the control of Colombian territory and its projection in the Andes and in the rest of South America .
All this scaffolding and consolidation of military architecture entails a serious threat for peace in the region and the world .
The installation of military bases in the region and their interrelation with the different bases spread throughout the world is not only confined to the military sphere , but rather forms part of the establishment of a general policy of domination and expansion directed by the U.S.
These bases constitute strategic points to dominate all the countries in Central and Latin America and the rest of the world .
The treaty for the installation of military bases in Colombia is preceded by Plan Colombia , which was already an example of U.S. interference in the affairs of Colombia and the region using the fight against drug trafficking and terrorism as an excuse .
However , it has been shown that drug trafficking levels have increased in Colombia ; therefore , the plan is no longer justified given that no favourable results have been obtained since its implementation , that would justify a new treaty with the U.S .
Today , the global strategy headed by the U.S. concerning drug trafficking is a complete failure .
Its results are summarised by a rapid processes of accumulation of illegal capital , increased consumption of drugs and exacerbation of criminality , whose victims are the peoples of Latin America , especially the Colombian people .
This strategy should be revisited and modified , and should be oriented towards a different logic that focuses on drug consumption as a public health issue .
In Colombia , drug trafficking has assumed the form of paramilitarism , and turned into a political project the scope of which and persons responsible should be investigated so that the truth is known , so that justice prevails and the terror of the civilian population ceases .
We , the peoples of the world , declare that we will not give up the spaces we have managed to conquer after years of struggle and resistance ; and we commit ourselves to regain those which have been taken from us .
Therefore , we need to defend the processes of change and the unfolding revolutions since they are based on sovereign decisions made by the peoples .

SPECIAL DECLARATION ON THE COUP D’ÉTAT IN HONDURAS
We , left - wing parties of Latin America , Africa , Europe , Asia and Oceania , present in the international encounter of left - wing parties , reject the coup d’état against the constitutional government of citizen ’s power of the President of Honduas Manuel Zelaya Rosales .
Cognizant of the situation of repression , persecution and murder against the Honduran people and the permanent military harassment against president Manuel Zelaya Rosales , which represents a breach of the rule of law in the sister nation of Honduras :
We support the actions of the national resistance front in its struggle to restore democracy .
We demand and support the sovereign right of the Honduran people to call for a national constituent assembly to establish direct democracy and to ensure the broadest political participation of the people in public affairs .
We denounce the United States intervention and its national and international reactionary right - wing allies and their connection with the coup , which hinders the construction of democracy in Honduras and in the world .
We condemn and repudiate the permanent violation of political and social human rights as well as the violation freedom of speech , promoted and perpetrated by the de facto powers , the Supreme Court of Justice , the National Congress of the Republic , the Ministry of Defence and Security since June 28 , 2009 .
We reiterate our demand to international governments and bodies , not to recognize the results of the general elections to be held on November 29 , 2009 in Honduras , due to the lack of constitutional guarantees and the legal conditions necessary for a fair , transparent and reliable electoral process , the lack of reliable observers that can vouch for the results of this electoral process , which has already been rejected by most international governments , bodies and international public opinion .
To propose and promote an international trial against coup plotters and their accomplices in Honduras before the International Criminal Court , for the illegal actions , abuses and crimes they committed , while developing actions aimed at denouncing to the relevant bodies and in the framework of the international law , the violation of the rights and the kidnapping of the legitimate president of Honduras Manuel Zelaya Rosales , because it is necessary to establish the responsibility of those who participated directly and internally in the perpetration of this crime .
We urge national and international human rights organizations to support these measures , to carry on the campaign of denunciation and vigilance with permanent observers in face of the renewed human rights violations , particularly the persecution and sanction through the loss of jobs for political reasons against the members and supporters of the resistance and president Manuel Zelaya .
We repudiate and condemn the attacks against the diplomatic corps of the embassies of the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Republic of Argentina , and the embassies of the member countries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our America ( ALBA ) ; and express our solidarity with the heroic work of the staff of these diplomatic missions , who have been victims of harassment and hostility by the coup plotters .
We agree to establish coordination among left - wing parties of the world to exert pressure to oust the de facto government and for the restoration of the constitutional president and the right of the Honduran people to install a national constituent assembly that allows for deepening direct democracy .
We urge governments , international bodies and companies to maintain and intensify economic and commercial sanctions to business accomplices and supporters of the coup in Honduras , and to maintain an attitude of vigilance , to break all relations that recognize the coup plotters and the de facto government officers , as well as to take migration control measures that hinder the movement of people who have the purpose of voting in another country where elections are held with the aim of changing the results through the transfer of votes from one country to the other .
We agree not to recognize the international and national observers of the
electoral process who are aligned and conspire to attempt to give legitimacy to an
electoral process devoid of legality and legitimacy .
We demand that rather than
observing an illegal and illegitimate process , the return of the state of democratic law and the constitutional government of citizen power Honduras President Manuel Zelaya Rosales is guaranteed .

Special decision on a Fifth Socialist International
The international encounter of Left - wing Political parties held in Caracas on November 19 , 20 and 21 , 2009 , received the proposal made by Commander Hugo Chavez Frias to convoke the Fifth Socialist International as a space for socialist - oriented parties , movements and currents in which we can harmonize a common strategy for the struggle against imperialism , the overthrow of capitalism by socialism and solidarity based economic integration of a new type .
We assessed that proposition in terms of its historical dimension which calls for a new spirit of internationalism and agreed , for the purpose of achieving it in the short term , to create a WORKING GROUP comprised of those socialist parties , currents and social movements who endorse the initiative , to prepare an agenda which defines the objectives , contents and mechanisms of this global revolutionary body .
We call for an initial constitutive event for April 2010 in the City of Caracas .
Furthermore , those parties , socialist currents and social movements who have not expressed themselves on this matter can subject this proposal to the examination of their legitimate directive bodies .

Wave is proving its worth in the scientific community , as one of the new collaboration tools which scientists are using to work together and conduct research .
" Google Wave offers two specific things , " says Cameron Neylon , senior scientist for bio-molecular sciences at the Science and Technology Facilities Council .
" What it looks like is this cross of e-mail and instant - messaging , which is great fun .
Where it really wins for science is that actually these documents or ' Waves ' can be made automated so we can connect up documents and ideas with each other . "
He says the real power of tools like Google Wave lies in automation - where it collects data without any need for extra human effort .
" A particular chemical compound , for instance , could be labelled and linked back to a database , " adds Mr Neylon .
" That lets us start to link up all the references to that single chemical compound and connect all of those together .
But it can also do all this without necessarily requiring the user to do too much work . "
Pairing people and papers Victor Henning is the co-founder of Mendeley , an online collaboration tool which was created specifically for scientists .
The free software allows scientists and researchers to upload papers which are then trawled for bibliographic data - author , title , issue and so on - and paired up with similar papers already in the database .
Using those tools to more effectively push those objects around to other scientists has got to be a good thing .
Cameron Neylon Mendeley is supposed to take the work out of managing these [ research ] papers . , " explains Mr Henning .
" You can just drag and drop your collection of PDFs into the software and it'll automatically extract all the bibliographic data - all of the stuff that you 'd usually have to type in manually .
" What Mendeley is designed to do is give you recommendations which compliment your existing library . "
Biggest thinkers
The software is proving a hit with high - profile scientists working within top institutions including MIT , Stanford , Harvard , Cambridge and the University of Michigan .
Mr Henning says the site has roughly 70,000 users , and is growing at a rate of 40 % each month .
He says the site 's current features will remain free , but they hope to build up a profitable model too .
" We will be introducing additional premium features later this year , such as more storage space , more sharing features for labs . "

More than 1,000 Toyota and Lexus owners have reported since 2001 that their vehicles suddenly accelerated on their own , in many cases slamming into trees , parked cars and brick walls , among other obstacles , a Times review of federal records has found .
The crashes resulted in at least 19 deaths and scores of injuries over the last decade , records show .
Federal regulators say that is far more than any other automaker has experienced .
Owner complaints helped trigger at least eight investigations into sudden acceleration in Toyota and Lexus vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the last seven years .
Toyota Motor Corp. recalled fewer than 85,000 vehicles in response to two of those probes , and the federal agency closed six other cases without finding a defect .
But those investigations systematically excluded or dismissed the majority of complaints by owners that their Toyota and Lexus vehicles had suddenly accelerated , which sharply narrowed the scope of the probes , the Times investigation revealed .
Federal officials eliminated broad categories of sudden - acceleration complaints , including cases in which drivers said they were unable to stop runaway cars using their brakes ; incidents of unintended acceleration lasting more than a few seconds ; and reports in which owners did not identify the possible causes of the problem .
NHTSA officials used the exclusions as part of their rationale to close at least five of the investigations without finding any defect , because -- with fewer incidents to consider -- the agency concluded there were not enough reported problems to warrant further inquiry .
In a 2003 Lexus probe , for example , the agency threw out all but one of 37 customer complaints cited in a defect petition .
It then halted further investigation , saying it “ found no data indicating the existence of a defect trend . ”
Meanwhile , fatal crashes involving Toyota vehicles continued to mount .
In a written statement , the NHTSA said its records show that a total of 15 people died in crashes related to possible sudden acceleration in Toyota vehicles from the 2002 model year and newer , compared with 11 such deaths in vehicles made by all other automakers .
The Times located federal and other records of 19 fatalities involving Toyota and Lexus vehicles from the same model years in which sudden or unintended acceleration may have been a factor , as well as more than 1,000 reports by owners that their vehicles had suddenly accelerated .
Independent safety expert Sean Kane , president of Safety Research and Strategies , said he has identified nearly 2,000 sudden - acceleration cases for Toyota vehicles built since 2001 .
Other experts say the numbers may be far higher , pointing to a 2007 NHTSA survey of 600 Lexus owners that found 10 % complained they had experienced sudden acceleration .
Most sudden accelerations did not result in a crash , but there were notable exceptions .
Bulent Ezal , a retired engineer , plunged 70 feet off a Pismo Beach cliff into the Pacific Ocean surf .
He was hospitalized with minor injuries , but his wife of 46 years was killed .
“ By the time they pulled me out , the tide was about to cover the car , ” Ezal said .
He said his 2005 Camry had suddenly accelerated in a parking lot .
In its research , The Times examined thousands of federal defect investigation records , complaints filed with NHTSA by Toyota and Lexus owners , lawsuits against the company , and reports by independent safety experts and local police agencies .
Toyota has been under a spotlight since Aug. 28 , when off - duty California Highway Patrolman Mark Saylor and three members of his family died in a Lexus ES 350 that accelerated to more than 100 mph and crashed in San Diego County .
Toyota has blamed the Saylor crash on an incorrectly installed floor mat that jammed the accelerator pedal .
The company announced a recall of 3.8 million vehicles in September and is designing a fix aimed at preventing sudden acceleration caused by floor mats .
The recall affects the following Toyota models : the 2007 - 2010 Camry , the 2004 -2009 Prius , the 2005 - 2010 Avalon , the 2005 - 2010 Tacoma and the 2007 - 2010 Tundra , as well as the 2007 - 2010 Lexus ES 350 and the 2006 - 2010 Lexus IS 250 and IS 350 .
Last week , the NHTSA called the issue a “ very dangerous problem ” and said the remedy remains to be determined .
The agency declined a request for interviews , but issued a statement defending its past actions , saying its officials have continuously monitored Toyota vehicles for potential defects and that many of the reports of sudden acceleration involved only momentary surges of engine power that did not result in any loss of vehicle control .
“ NHTSA takes every allegation of safety problems seriously and that is why we read every consumer complaint within one business day of its receipt , ” the agency said .
“ In the case of complaints about sudden acceleration in Toyota vehicles NHTSA moved very quickly to respond to them . ”
Toyota Motor Corp. defended its Toyota and Lexus vehicles and the validity of prior investigations .
“ Over the past six years , NHTSA has undertaken several exhaustive reviews of allegations of unintended acceleration on Toyota and Lexus vehicles .
In each case , the agency closed the investigation without finding any electronic engine control system malfunction to be the cause of unintended acceleration , ” the company said in a statement .
Whatever the cause , Toyota and Lexus owners have grappled with the dangerous consequences .
* Jean Bookout awoke in an Oklahoma hospital a month after a crash in her 2005 Camry .
She said the car sped out of control on a freeway , then smashed into an embankment after she swerved it onto an exit ramp , leaving behind long skid marks from attempts to stop the vehicle with her brakes and emergency brake .
Bookout sustained permanent memory loss , and her best friend died .
“ I did everything I could to stop the car , ” she said Tuesday .
* Nancy Bernstein , a vice president for a Long Beach community garden and former science teacher , said she was taken on an 8 - mile high - speed ride by her 2007 Prius while she was following her husband in a group bicycle tour in Wisconsin .
She said her Prius accelerated from 45 mph to 75 mph on a winding , two - lane highway crowded with 100 cyclists .
“ I was sure I was going to kill someone on a bicycle or myself , ” she recalled .
“ I stood on the brakes with both feet .
All of a sudden , I see fire .
I thought , sure , my brakes are on fire .
I thought about maybe trying to sideswipe a tree to slow down . ”
Eventually she was able to stop at the bottom of a hill , using her brakes and emergency brake .
A local resident rushed out with a fire extinguisher .
* Dr. David .
W. Smith , an emergency room physician from San Dimas , has yet to receive a satisfactory answer from Toyota about his Lexus GS 300 .
Smith said he was driving with his cruise control in Central California on Highway 99 last year , not touching the accelerator , when suddenly the vehicle accelerated to 100 mph .
The brakes did not release the cruise control or slow down the vehicle , Smith recalled .
Finally , he shifted into neutral and shut off the engine .
“ I am sure it is the cruise control , ” he said .
“ I have n’t used it since . ”
In reviewing consumer complaints during its investigations , the NHTSA relied on established “ positions ” that defined how the agency viewed the causes of sudden acceleration .
Cases in which consumers alleged that the brakes did not stop a car were discarded , for example , because the agency ’s official position was that a braking system would always overcome an engine and stop a car .
The decision was laid out in a March 2004 memorandum .
When asked to submit its own complaint data to the NHTSA , Toyota eliminated reports claiming that sudden acceleration occurred for “ a long duration , ” or more than a few seconds .
Elsewhere , the company said a fail - safe in its throttle system makes such an event impossible .
NHTSA officials acknowledged in a statement that the exclusions were made , but defended the practice .
“ While some vehicles may be excluded from the scope of an investigation into a specific defect allegation , all are continuously reviewed , along with other relevant information , in order to identify other emerging issues of concern , ” the statement said .
A reduced pool of reports created the appearance that the problem was much smaller than the total number of complaints suggested , making a broader vehicle recall seem less necessary , critics say .
“ NHTSA has ways of pigeonholing reports , categorizing them as brake failure rather than sudden acceleration , ” said attorney Edgar Heiskell of Charleston , W.Va. , who is suing Toyota over a fatal crash in Flint , Mich .
“ By excluding these braking and long - duration events , they have taken 80 % of the cases off the table . ”
In 2004 , the NHTSA began a probe into a defect petition filed by Carol J. Mathews , a registered nurse who was then director of health services for the Montgomery County , Md. , school system .
Matthews reported that she had her foot on the brake of her 2002 Lexus ES when it took off and hit a tree .
In its subsequent investigation , the NHTSA and Toyota both winnowed down other reports of sudden acceleration involving 2002 and 2003 Lexus ES and Camry models .
When the agency asked Toyota to disgorge all of the reports it knew about , the company eliminated an unknown number in five broad categories , including cases in which drivers said they were unable to control a runaway engine by applying the brakes .
In closing the probe , federal investigators said only 20 cases were considered relevant .
But The Times ’ examination of consumer complaints and a sampling of reports from Toyota dealers found more than 400 reports of sudden acceleration involving those models .
And federal records show that the NHTSA knew about 260 of those cases and another 114 cases identified by Toyota .
As for its position that brakes can always overcome a vehicle ’s engine , the safety agency and Toyota now acknowledge that a braking system cannot always counter a wide - open throttle , as is the case in sudden acceleration .
The NHTSA began investigating the problem of sudden acceleration in the mid-1980s , after a flood of complaints about the Audi 5000 .
One outgrowth of the subsequent investigation was the NHTSA view that acceleration events at high speed are a different issue than events at low speed .
In 2005 , for example , Jordan Ziprin of Phoenix , who had experienced a minor accident he blamed on sudden acceleration , filed a defect petition with the NHTSA that included nearly 1,200 owner complaints about Toyota vehicles .
The automaker argued that the majority should be eliminated because they dealt “ with two completely different issues . ”
When owners said the “ vehicle unintentionally or suddenly ‘ accelerated , ’ ” Toyota claimed that represented a different issue than when they said “ the vehicle ‘ surged ’ or ‘ lurched . ’ ” The NHTSA ultimately went a step further , eliminating every single complaint except Ziprin ’s , finding them to have “ ambiguous significance . ”
The agency also has thrown out evidence for other reasons .
In 2008 , the NHTSA opened a probe of the Toyota Tacoma after a consumer found that the truck had accumulated 32 times as many sudden - acceleration complaints as any other pickup .
But Toyota at the time said the complaints stemmed from “ media and Internet exposure . ”
The NHTSA closed the case without a finding after it whittled down a list of more than 450 complaints to just 62 .
“ To this day I still ca n’t find evidence online of a flood of media exposure , ” said William Kronholm , the Helena , Mont. , man who said he requested the investigation after he experienced two acceleration events in his 2006 Tacoma .
“ They never dealt with the question I presented in any real way . ”
The NHTSA has declined to reconsider previous investigations , even in the face of new evidence .
In March , Jeffrey Pepski of Plymouth , Minn. , formally requested that the NHTSA reopen two closed investigations into Toyota and Lexus vehicles for the acceleration problem , arguing in part that 10 other motorists had experienced sudden acceleration that could not be explained by floor mats .
The NHTSA looked at the 10 cases and tossed them out .
The agency ’s way of looking at them sharply contrasted with the drivers ’ original accounts .
In one case , the driver of a 2007 Lexus ES 350 reported that the sedan accelerated into a building , bounced backward , struck another vehicle and ended up on top of a snowbank .
But federal officials described the same case as a “ single incident of alleged engine surge while parking vehicle .
No trouble found by dealer . ”
The NHTSA denied Pepski ’s petition last week , arguing that further study was “ not warranted . ”

Advertisement What do French gendarmes , Andalucian school children , Wikipedia and San Francisco International airport have in common ?
It is not the set up for a tortuous pun .
Instead all of them are big users of the free Ubuntu operating system .
The French national police force runs its operations on the open source OS ; computer systems supporting Spanish schools have their own version ; the online encyclopaedia runs its hundreds of servers on Ubuntu and SFIA 's internal computer system is based around it .
Ubuntu is based on Linux - the open source operating system that is maintained , expanded and extended by legions of fans and professional programmers around the world .
Thanks to their efforts Ubuntu has become the most popular of all the Linux distributions .
On 29 October , version 9.10 of Ubuntu is released .
All versions of the operating system have an alternative alliterative appellation .
Ubuntu 9.10 is known as Karmic Koala .
The launch comes in the wake of Microsoft 's fanfare around Windows 7 - the latest incarnation of its flagship operating system .
Factory mode While Ubuntu 's developer Canonical can not quite match the hoopla surrounding Windows 7 for its launch , the software competes where it matters , said Chris Kenyon , one of Canonical 's OS evangelists .
" For the first time in 20 years you can buy Ubuntu pre-installed from more than one manufacturer , " he said .
" That 's an extraordinary story . "
Faced with such consumer inertia it's hard to see Linux making much progress in boosting its minuscule market share
Rory Cellan- Jones
Technology correspondent
Read Rory 's thoughts in full Computer makers HP , Dell , Toshiba and Acer now all offer the OS as a choice on machines people buy via their websites .
The number of models varies by territory with the software proving more popular in some places than others .
Dell China , said Mr Kenyon , has more than 40 models with Ubuntu available .
Before now , he said , many people installed the software themselves on laptops and desktops that formerly ran Windows .
Their experiences varied because the development effort that helps to keep Ubuntu updated sometimes lags behind what people are using .
But , he said , with the software increasingly likely to be installed at the factory those days of frustration may be on the wane .
" Hardware problems are only really solved through installation , " he said .
" That 's going to become increasingly the case over the next 12 months . "
Competition time
The steady march of technology was also removing many of those stumbling blocks that stopped people plumping for Ubuntu and kept them with Windows or Apple 's OS X , said Mr Kenyon .
Microsoft now lists
Canonical under threats in its regular stock filing Some have been reluctant to move to Ubuntu and open source software because it would mean learning their way around programs that were the equivalent of what they used on older machines .
But , said Mr Kenyon , the growing use of web applications - such as Google Docs - was eroding those differences quickly .
" The web is making the compatibility part far easier , " he said .
To help with that ease of use Ubuntu 9.10 has Firefox 3.5 onboard that works with the many web - based programs , such as the BBC iPlayer , that are becoming increasingly popular .
With the web levelling the playing field between the different OS makers , Mr Kenyon said the fact that Ubuntu runs faster and is more secure than rivals on the same hardware will convince many to try it .
He admitted that some of the security of Ubuntu was down to the fact that cyber criminals do not target it in the same way as they do Windows .
" Some of the security is through obscurity but it 's also better by design , " he said .
" Fundamentally it requires you to run a safer system .
It 's there from the ground up . "
Canonical is also making it easier to road test Ubuntu with a " live mode " that lets potential users run it off a USB drive to check its compatibility with the hardware on their desktop or laptop .
Evidence that it is being taken seriously can be found , he said , in the annual " 10 - K form " that Microsoft files with the SEC .
Every public firm must file one of these to outline the market conditions and competitors it believes pose the greatest threat to its business .
In 2009 , for the first time , Canonical got a mention .
Given that Microsoft recognises its success , Mr Kenyon is convinced that it 's only a matter of time before Ubuntu 's 12 million strong pool of users is joined by many more .
" We 're nearing a tipping point , " said Mr Kenyon .

Most people know by now that I love the new Headway 1.5 premium WordPress theme .
If anyone asks what theme they should go with on their blog or website , I always recommend Clay Griffiths ’ theme .
Now that Headway 1.5 has been officially released , however , the real power behind it will start to show as more people start exploring its engine room .
This goes for normal bloggers like me as well as hardcore developers and coders .
For example , one of the features that some WordPress theme developers are talking about is the drop - down navigation menu .
This is a really useful option to let you highlight features and services that you might offer but would otherwise take up space on your navigation bar .
The problem is , most other themes need you to mess with the CSS code just to enable drop - down navigation .
Not Headway 1.5 .
In fact , not only can you set up a drop - down nav menu , you can rearrange the tabs as you go , as well as the position of the nav menu itself .
And did I mention this is all without a single drop of CSS coding ?
And better still , all the changes happenin front of your eyes – no need for jumping back and forth between saves to see the changes .
While content may be king , you ca n’t dismiss good site design and Headway 1.5 makes it simple for anyone to have the latter taken care of .
And who does n’t like simple ?
Note :
This blog no longer runs on the Headway framework .

WASHINGTON : The number of students from India enrolled in US universities and colleges crossed 100,000 for the first time ever this year even as international enrollments in America registered the largest percentage increase since 1980 , defying broad economic trends .
As the number of international students at colleges and universities in the US increased by 8 % to an all - time high of 671,616 in the 2008/09 academic year , students from India made up 103,260 of the overall number , according to the Open Doors report , which is published annually by the Institute of International Education ( IIE ) in collaboration with the US government .
The Indian numbers went up 9.2 per cent from 94,563 in 2007/2008 to cross 100,000 for the first time to retain its position as the top place of origin for international students in the United States .
China remained in second place , although there was a sharp 21 per cent spike in students from China , going up from 81,127 last academic year to 98,235 this year .
South Korea ( 69,000 to 75,000 ) remained in third place .
This is the eighth consecutive year that India has remained in the top spot .
In course of a preview of the forthcoming visit to Washington of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh next week , Indian officials said on Monday that Indian student inflow contributed nearly $ 3 billion to the US economy last year .
Overall , international students contribute $ 17.8 billion to the US economy , through their expenditures on tuition and living expenses , according to the US Department of Commerce .
Authors of the report said the findings do not reflect the full impact of the past year 's economic downturn , since decisions to come to the United States to study were made before the financial effects were fully felt in the sending countries .
They also reported that the largest growth this year was seen in undergraduate enrollments , which increased by 11 % , compared to a 2 % increase in graduate enrollments .
This growth was driven largely by increases in undergraduate students from China , they said , suggesting that increased affluence is enabling Chinese to send their children to US for undergrad education , where there is typically less scholarship and funding .
According to Open Doors 2009 , universities in California hosted the largest number of foreign students with 93,124 , up 10 % , followed by New York with 74,934 , up 7 % , and Texas with 58,188 , up 12 % .
The New York City metropolitan area continues to be the leading city for international students , with 59,322 enrolled in area schools , up 8 % .
The Los Angeles metropolitan area is in second place with 42,897 international students , up 11 % .
For the eighth consecutive year , Open Doors reports that the University of Southern California hosted the largest number of international students , this year reporting 7,482 .
New York University held in second place with 6,761
international students , and Columbia University , also holding steady in third place , hosted 6,685 .
Rounding out the top five 2008/09 host institutions are University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign ( 6,570 students ) and Purdue
University ( 6,136 students ) .
Open Doors reports that 171 US campuses each hosted more than 1,000 students .
The top ten most popular fields of study for international students in the United States in 2008/09 were Business and Management ( 21 % of total ) , Engineering ( 18 % ) and Physical and Life Sciences ( 9 % ) , Social Sciences ( 9 % ) , Mathematics and Computer Science ( 8 % ) , Health Professions ( 5 % ) , Fine & Applied Arts ( 5 % ) , Intensive English Language ( 4 % ) , Humanities ( 3 % ) , Education ( 3 % ) , and Agriculture ( 1 % ) .
There was also a significant 20 per cent uptick in the number of American students studying in India , part of the an overall growth in American students going abroad for academic purpose .
The number of Americans studying in India rose from 2627 in 2006 / 2007 to 3146 in 2007/2008 , making India the 17th in the list of countries for US students .
The top five spots went to UK , Italy , Spain , France and China , the last of which had more than 13,000 American students .

The Information Awareness Office is a branch of the Department of Defense 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency whose mission is to " imagine , develop , apply , integrate , demonstrate and transition information technologies , components and prototype , closed - loop , information systems that will counter asymmetric threats by achieving total information awareness . "
The IAO is headed by John Poindexter , former National Security Advisor in the Reagan Administration and chief architect of the Iran - Contra Affair .
Logo
The IAO , and its stated mission , is a gift to conspiracy theorists and paranoiacs everywhere , particularly with its use of the Masonic eye - in - pyramid symbol in its logo .
The IAO 's Illuminati-esque logo features the all - seeing eye of God from the Great Seal of the United States replaced with the all - seeing eye of the Information Awareness Office gazing at the Earth , and the Latin motto " scientia est potentia , " meaning " knowledge is power " .
On approximately December 19 , 2002 , the pyramid logo was removed without comment from the official IAO webpage , presumably in response to widespread criticism of its Masonic / Illuminati overtones .
The biographies of senior staffers also disappeared .
A mirror of the old page may be found here .
Mission
The IAO 's stated mission is to gather as much information as possible about everyone in a centralized location for easy perusal by the United States government , including Internet activity , credit card purchase histories , airline ticket purchases , car rentals , medical records , educational transcripts , driver 's licenses , utility bills , tax returns , and any other available data .
In essence , the goal of the IAO is to be able to recreate a life history of thoughts and movements for any individual on the planet on demand , which the Bush administration deems necessary to counter the threat of terrorism .
Critics claim the very existence of the IAO completely disregards the concept of individual privacy and liberties and is far too invasive and prone to abuse .
Background
The IAO was first mentioned in the media by New York Times reporter John Markoff on February 13 , 2002 , with few details available as to the agency 's role or activities .
In the following months , as more and more information emerged about the IAO 's full scope , protest among civil libertarians grew over what they claim is the IAO 's disturbingly Orwellian mission , especially within the larger framework of other invasive homeland security measures and policies implemented by the Bush administration .
Also at issue is the integrity of Poindexter as head of the IAO , as he was convicted on five felony charges for lying to the Congress and deliberately altering and destroying documents pertaining to the Iran - Contra Affair .
On January 16 , 2003 , US Senator Russ Feingold introduced legislation to halt activity of the IAO and the Total Information Awareness initiative pending a Congressional review of privacy issues involved .
A similar measure introduced by Senator Ron Wyden would bar the IAO from operating within the United States unless specifically authorized to do so by Congress , and would shut the IAO down entirely 60 days after passage , unless either the Pentagon prepared a report assessing the impact of IAO activities on individual privacy and civil liberties , or the President certifies that the program 's research is vital to national security interests .
Any action in the US Congress to attempt to halt a specific internal Department of Defense project is highly unusual , underscoring the grave threat to civil liberties and privacy that many lawmakers perceive in the Information Awareness Office .
Public Protests Against the Information Awareness Office
There has been extensive criticism of the IAO in the media and on the Internet from both left - wing and right - wing civil libertarians who feel that the unprecedented systematic categorization and access to information that it will enable is a grave threat to individual liberties , and another step farther down the slippery slope to a totalitarian state .
On November 27 , 2002 , San Francisco Weekly columnist Matt Smith decided to illustrate the perils of information proliferation to John Poindexter personally by publishing a column containing Poindexter 's home address and phone number , along with those of his next door neighbors .
The information quickly propagated through the Internet and protestors created numerous web sites with this data , as well as with satellite photographs of Poindexter 's house .
Congressional Oversight
No government agency may deploy or implement any component of the Terrorism Information Awareness ( formerly Total Information Awareness ) program without Congressional notification and authorization , according to a provision adopted by the House of Representatives .
The " Limitation on Deployment of Terrorism Information Awareness Program " was included in the 2004 Defense Appropriations
Act that was approved by the House on July 8 .
See the text of the provision ( H.R. 2658 Sec. 8124 ) here .
Funding Threatened
In July 2003 , the program is having a bit of an uphill battle getting started .
On July 14 , 2003 , Wired News reports that " The Senate 's $ 368 billion version of the 2004 defense appropriations bill , released from committee to the full Senate on Wednesday , contains a provision that would deny all funds to , and thus would effectively kill , the Terrorism Information Awareness program , formerly known as Total Information Awareness .
TIA 's projected budget for 2004 is $ 169 million . "
This development generated quite a discussion on ' Slashdot ' .
Funding Rejected
Per Conference Report on H.R. 2658 , Department of Defense Appropriations Act , 2004 ( September 24 , 2003 , House Report 108-283 ) :
Sec. 8131 . ( a ) Notwithstanding any other provision of law , none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available in this or any other Act may be obligated for the Terrorism Information Awareness Program ...
the term " Terrorism Information Awareness Program " means the program known either as Terrorism Information Awareness or Total Information Awareness , or any successor program , funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , or any other Department or element of the Federal Government , including the individual components of such Program developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
In subsequent review [ 1 ] , however , the restrictions have been regarded as only for " deployment and implementation " , not for research . [ 2 ]
Gov't Quietly Brings Back Total Information Awareness
Reuters has obtained a Congressional report that shows nine months after Congress shut down the controversial Pentagon computer - surveillance program called Total Information Awareness , the U.S. government continues to comb private records and databases to sniff out suspicious activity .
Peter Swire , who served as the Clinton administration 's top official said " I believe that Total Information Awareness is continuing under other names . " — reported by Democracy Now ! , June 3 , 2004 .
IAO Research
As part of the IAO 's " Total Information Awareness " program , several new technologies are being researched .
Effective Affordable Reusable Speech - to - text , or EARS , has a stated goal of " developing speech - to - text ( automatic transcription ) technology whose output is substantially richer and much more accurate than currently possible . "
This program is focusing on broadcast and telephone human conversations in multiple languages , necessary for the computerized analysis of the massive amount of phone tapping the IAO now has the right to perform without a legal warrant .
Futures Markets Applied to Prediction , or FutureMAP , intends to " concentrate on market - based techniques for avoiding surprise and predicting future events . "
It will analyze data from the world 's economy in attempt to predict political instability , threats to national security , and in general every major event in the near future .
The IAO 's stated strategy for this division includes " the markets must also be sufficiently robust to withstand manipulation , " possibly suggesting the intention of altering future events to further the goals of the United States .
See prediction market for more detail on the general phenomenon and its relationship to propaganda efforts .
Genisys is the name given to the database system which will be implemented as the center of information for the IAO .
Currently used database systems designed in the 1980s are insufficient for the massive amount of data to be gathered .
Genoa " provides the structured argumentation , decision - making and corporate memory to rapidly deal with and adjust to dynamic crisis management . "
In essence , this program is designed to make conclusions and decisions based on available information , incorporating human analysis , corporate history , and a structured set of thinking .
This research project was finished in fiscal year 2002 , and is being followed up by Genoa II , which effectively automates the collaboration between government departments .
Human Identification at a Distance , or HumanID , " is to develop automated biometric identification technologies to detect , recognize and identify humans at great distances . "
This program intends to be able to implement a face and gait identification system effective up to 150 meters at all times by fiscal year 2004 .
An extreme proposed version of this is called cognotechnology and would rely on nanotechnology .
Translingual Information Detection , Extraction and Summarization , or TIDES , is being developed to detect , translate , summarize , and extract information in speech or text in multiple languages .
Demonstration of machine capabilities and integration into Total Information Awareness systems is expected in 2003 .
Wargaming the Asymmetric Environment , or WAE , is intended to develop automated technology capable of predicting terrorist attacks , identifying predictive indicators by examining individual and group behavior in broad environmental context .
The WAE will also develop intervention strategies based on the motivation of specific terrorists .

* Analysis on all satellites seen by year ’s end
* Collision seen as seminal event
* Air Force analysis efforts still decades behind
( Adds general ’s quotes , analyst reaction , byline )
By Andrea Shalal - Esa
WASHINGTON , Nov 3 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military said on Tuesday it is now tracking 800 maneuverable satellites on a daily basis for possible collisions and expects to add 500 more non-maneuvering satellites by year ’s end .
The U.S. Air Force began upgrading its ability to predict possible collisions in space after a dead Russian military communications satellite and a commercial U.S. satellite owned by Iridium collided on Feb. 10 .
General Kevin Chilton , commander of U.S. Strategic Command , called the collision the “ seminal event ” in the satellite industry during the past year and said it destroyed any sense that space was so vast that collisions were highly improbable .
He said military officials had wanted to do more thorough analysis of possible collisions in space , but had lacked the resources .
Before the collision , he said they were tracking less than 100 satellites a day .
“ It ’s amazing what one collision will do to the resource spigot , ” he told a space conference in Omaha , Nebraska .
The crash , which was not predicted by the U.S. military or private tracking groups , underscored the vulnerability of U.S. satellites , which are used for a huge array of military and civilian purposes .
Chilton said the Air Force was tracking more than 20,000 satellites , spent rocket stages and other objects in space , up from just 14,000 a few years ago .
But he said that was just what U.S. could “ see ” and there were estimates that the actual number was much greater , posing a potential threat to satellites on orbit .
Air Force Lieutenant General Larry James , who heads U.S. Strategic Command ’s Joint Functional Component Command for Space , told reporters the Air Force met its goal for tracking possible collisions among 800 satellites that have the ability to be moved in September , ahead of an October target date .
“ Our goal now is to do that conjunction assessment for all active satellites ... roughly around 1,300 satellites ... by the end of the year and provide that information to users as required , ” James told reporters on a teleconference during a space conference in Omaha , Nebraska .
Some of the 500 satellites still to be assessed cannot be shifted because they do not carry extra fuel that would be needed to move them once in orbit .
To increase its ability to predict possible collisions , the Air Force has been buying more computers and hiring analysts .
It also works with commercial satellite operators to share data collected by their spacecraft and by U.S. government sources .
Chilton lauded the efforts , but said the work was still too reliant on Air Force analysts and needed further improvement .
“ We are decades behind where we should be , ” he said .
Victoria Samson , with the nonprofit Center for Defense Information , said the Air Force needed more trained operators to do the analyses and the goal of adding 500 more satellites to the analysis might be “ somewhat optimistic . ”

Stephon Marbury cannot stay out of the spotlight .
Once again he his making news off the court as he rants about the state of the Knicks , Lebron James ’ future , and how he compares his time away from basketball this year to that of Michael Jordan , retiring for a year to build his empire and expand his endorsement deals .
The delusional former All Star has made more news off the court rather than on it over the past few months while clowning himself in his live show on Justin.tv where he has gotten into a car accident , cries while listening to Kirk Franklin ’s “ Lean on Me ” , danced like a gay pirate to Michael Jackson , and even ate Vaseline for a sore throat .
This time around , Marbury did an interview for the New York Post in which he attempted to rationalize why he is n’t playing in the NBA this season .
Steph claimed that it was he , who decided to take a year off to rest and “ be like Michael Jordan and do all of the things he has n’t been able to do , and build his empire . ”
He also claimed to have made a prudent business decision , “ not to go to Boston for that money , ” insinuating that he was worth much more than the 1.3 million that the Celtics had offered him .
Talk about a WTF moment .
He averaged a mear 4 points and 3 assists while playing only 18 minutes for Boston last season .
Granted , he has career averages of 19.3 points and 7.6 assists , but he is now 32 years old and has n’t come close to sniffing that type of production since his rookie ’ 04 - ’05 season in New York … … .
Hopefully he fired his financial advisor .
Last that anyone heard , Boston was the only team offering anything .
His empire consists of his “ Starbury ” line of cheaply priced shoes and clothing , which he recently had to take to selling exclusively online since the Steve and Barry ’s Stores , where they were sold , have closed due to bankruptcy .
What a better way to advertise the Starbury brand than to be on the court , sporting his shoes , with that large Starbury brand log tatoo on his head ………………… That would be a great business decision !
Steph then delved into commenting on the current state of his former team , the NY Knicks .
Marbury asked out loud , ” As a fan , why would I give you my money to watch them ? ”
He also commented after watching a few recent preseason games where the Knicks launched an alarming 72 three point shots and stated that , “ The coaching is horrible .
What kind of coaching is this ?
Guys coming down the court , just raising 3 pointers from anywhere !
New Yorkers deserve better decisions from the front office ! ” I guess the native New Yorker wont be getting a call for his services from GM Donnie Walsh anytime soon .
He also chimed in on the possibility of Lebron James coming to the Big Apple once his contract is up next Summer .
He commented , ” Why would he come to a rebuilding team ?
It makes no sense .
Is this franchise built to win championships or make money ? ” I actually may have to agree with Steph on this one .
When pondering his future , one has to wonder , what is he thinking ?
He was forced to sit out this season because virtually no other NBA franchise wanted him .
It has been a tough market for players with baggage this offseason .
I definitely would rate Marbury a few notches below Allen Iverson , and it took all Summer for the A.I. show to land a gig in Memphis .
If he is seriously considering a return to the league , he should have accepted the Boston deal , proving himself , and earning another lucrative free agent deal next Summer .
He is n’t ancient in NBA standards , but he would then be 33 years old and will have played only 47 games over the past 3 seasons , if he attempts a comeback in 2010 .
Then a team would have to weigh his on court production against his ability to be a cancer in the locker room , one which I feel would be a losing proposition to any club .
Marbury ’s final comments from the interview speak volumes about his state of mind , ” A year from now , you do n’t know what I ’m going to be like .
I ’m from the gutter .
I can go anywhere . ” ……………………….. Do n’t count on it Steph !

I do n’t support a lot of charities because , like most Americans , I ’m fat , lazy , and far too obsessed over my own pathetic little microcosm to give a rat ’s ass about the suffering of others .
That ’s why people like Zombie Walk Detroit are around : to goad slobs like me into giving a crap about their community .
The fine folks at Zombie Walk Detroit figured out that , to motivate that apathetic , they ’d need a hook .
That hook : the walking dead .
That ’s right , they use the unholy power of necromancy for charity , which is pretty cool if you ask me .
This was the second zombie walk I ’ve participated in .
The first claimed over two hundred zombies , and raised enough money for over six thousand meals .
I think this year did even better , but then I ’m not really all that good about estimation ( for instance , I ’d estimate that I ’ve written about five hundred words so far , but I would be sadly mistaken ) .
Without further a due , feast your eyes on some of my award winning * photography :
* Award may not actually exist .
This has been Dave sayin ’ : “ Ooh , I ’d bring a gun . ”
Update :
Here ’s some more photos while I ’m waiting on the final numbers :
UPDATE : It seems that there were significantly more zombies this year .
At least 450 zeds showed up during the initial registration , with many more trickling in afterword .
Larry Langford , who is 61 or 63 , was found guilty of taking about $ 236,000 in cash and gifts from Montgomery investment banker Bill Blount and lobbyist Al LaPierre .
Both pleaded guilty in the case and testified they made cash payments to Langford while he was the president of the Jefferson County Commission to ensure business for Blount 's investment bank , Blount Parrish & Co .
" We all have our trials , this too will pass , " Langford said as he walked from the courtroom followed closely by his wife .
" The citizens of Birmingham have been fantastic to me , " he said outside the courthouse .
He said the verdict will be appealed .
" I 'm no crybaby , but ... "
" At the end of the day , I shot my best shot , but the jury ruled the way that they did , " he said , in a wide - ranging press conference outside court .
" All this trial did was interrupt my Bible study classes for two weeks , " he said , adding he faces a potential sentence of 805 years .
He said if he lived to be 80 , he would have to die and " come back 10 more times " to serve such a sentence .
Judge Scott Coogler
decided Langford would forfeit
$ 241,843 .
The lawyers agreed .
Coogler ordered a sentencing report within 90 to 120 days and said Langford would remain free until then on the existing $ 50,000 unsecured bond .
Birmingham City Council President Carole Smitherman is now mayor of Alabama 's largest city .
( Corrected : A swearing in is not required )
Other elected leaders were quick to react .
" I hate it to the high heavens for him and his family .
It 's just devastating , " Rep. John Rogers , D - Birmingham , said .
" He 's a good man .
He 's got flaws .
We 've all got flaws .
Sometimes when you 've got flaws people prey on your weakness .
I think it sends a lesson to all public officials to be very , very careful , " Rogers said .
" They ( the jury ) must have had their mind already made up , " Rogers said .
Sen. Scott Beason , R - Gardendale , said it 's a message to elected officials .
" I 'm pleased .
We 've been hearing about these kinds of things for years , " Beason said .
" I think it 's a step in the right direction .
Elected officials need to understand if they are involved in corruption they are eventually going to ( get ) caught up with . "
State Sen. Linda Coleman , D - Birmingham , disagreed , saying she was shocked by the verdict and feared it would hurt Birmingham , Jefferson County and the state of Alabama .
'' It is a very sad day for Birmingham .
This is going to set us back , I think .
I look at all the progress that 's been made .
I look at all the projects on the books , '' Coleman said .
'' I saw a new hope for Birmingham .
I 'm just really saddened .
I do n't see how anybody how anybody could find any joy in this . ''
State Rep. Oliver Robinson , D - Birmingham , said he 's known Langford for many years and that he 's a good - hearted person .
'' Larry is really a good - hearted man , '' Robinson said .
'' I 've always had a great deal of respect for him .
He 's just a genuinely nice individual .
I really feel sad for his family , his wife and all of his family . ''
Gov. Bob Riley said in a prepared statement : " These kind of convictions do n't have to happen , " he said .
" We must finally pass anti-corruption laws that will bring accountability and transparency to state and local governments so we can prevent this very kind of situation . "
Langford was convicted on these counts :
Count 1 Bribery Langford received $ 69,000 in cash from lobbyist Al LaPierre and Bill Blount of Blount Parrish & Co. that went into Langford 's personal bank account .
Count 3

For a while there it looked like 2009 would be remembered as the Year of the Dead Celebrity .
But Michael , Farrah , Walter , Ed , and all the rest may have to move over .
This is rapidly becoming the Year the Data Died .
Exhibit A , of course , is the T - Mobile Sidekick Debacle , with Microsoft subsidiary Danger in the key role as the clueless initiator of disaster .
( " Gee , I wonder what pushing this button will do ... " )
They screwed the pooch in a half - dozen ways , starting with a weeklong outage that went completely unacknowledged until Sidekick users started kicking up a fuss in forums and the media picked up on it .
[ Also on InfoWorld : " Microsoft screwup puts T - Mobile users in Danger " | Stay up to date on Robert X. Cringely 's musings and observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
Then it took them another few days to warn users to not reboot their Sidekicks ( which is the first thing you 're told to do when something is n't working right ) because that would wipe out their data .
Then the announcement last weekend the data was lost forever , followed by another announcement that maybe some of the data would n't be lost forever .
T- Mobile -- which appears to be mostly blameless in this scenario , yet is getting a ton of heat for it -- reacted by offering free data service for October , a $ 100 credit , and a halt to new Sidekick sales , and reportedly is letting people out of their contracts without penalty .
No matter ; its reputation is still toast .
Microsoft / Danger have yet to explain what happened , but speculation is rampant .
There can only be two reasons for this kind of bungling :
One is a Keystone Kops level of ineptitude by a lot of different people at Danger ; the other is sabotage .
And given the rancor following Microsoft 's mostly unreported layoffs of key people at Danger last May , the sabotage theory is starting to gain some traction .
All you need is one disgruntled employee with some technical savvy to leave a software time bomb behind .
Exhibit B : The Apple Snow Leopard upgrade .
Amazingly , some unlucky Mac users who access their systems using the " guest " login get a special treat : Snow Leopard wipes out their personal data .
( As the saying goes , that 's no way to treat a guest . )
Apple has acknowledged the problem , says only a small number of users have been affected , and is working on a fix .
If not for Microsoft 's complete bungling of the Sidekick situation , Apple would be in the hot seat this week .
Exhibit C : For the past 10 days or so , Facebook has been grappling with a data loss problem of its own , which it finally acknowledged yesterday .
About 0.05 percent of its users -- roughly 150,000 if Facebook 's subscription numbers are to be believed -- had their personal profiles flushed down the technology toilet .
I 've been in touch with a well - connected Cringester who lost close to 5,000 contacts in Facebook and was in the process of slowing rebuilding her friends list , one FBer at a time , when her account was finally restored .
She received an e-mail that attributed the disappearing act to " an extended technical issue . "
Hmm , ya think so ?
However , parties close to sources inside Facebook tell me the service was hacked .
( If I can confirm that , or learn more about the actual cause , I 'll let you know . )
If that 's true , it would n't be the first time it 's happened -- though it would be the first time so many user profiles were totally scotched .
Still , regardless of the cause , it 's troubling , especially because I do n't know of any way to back that stuff up .
Wait , we 're not done yet .
If you live in Sweden , for a brief period you were transported back to the pre-Internet era when a software script updating DNS records left out the dot in the " .se " country - level domain -- effectively making nearly a million Swedish sites invisible to the InterWebs .
No data was lost , as far as I know .
But think about it .
The entire Web can be taken down for want of a single period .
Does that make you nervous ?
It should .
The lessons du jour : Back up early , back up often , and do n't rely entirely on something that might not be there when you need it most .
Has a service provider ever lost your precious data ?
If so , what did you do about it ?

NASA assessing dented booster from Ares 1 - X launch , Spaceflight Now
" Photographs taken by the recovery crew show the four - segment shuttle booster floating upright in the Atlantic Ocean shortly after splashdown .
An initial inspection , sources said , revealed the sort of paint blistering that is typically found on shuttle boosters , along with a good sized dent in the lower segment that was photographed by divers . "
30 October 11:48 am EDT update : NASA KSC speaker on Ares 1 - X parachutes : " we had one good one , one completely failed one , and one partially opened .
That caused the booster to hit at high speed . "
This vhicle had 15 % more weight than the actual weight of an Ares 1 ...
The dent on the booster was due to water impact ... we are not dwelling on the damage because we never planned to use this booster again .
...
We do not consider this to be a significant event .
We like to see the world in black and white : a landscape of villains and victims ; good and evil ; right and wrong .
These labels allow us to make easy moral judgements about others , to apportion blame and sympathy .
It seems to be an involuntary human response .
Who has suffered ?
Who is at fault ?
Indeed , many of the stories in today 's news are about the process of allocation : the Iraq War Inquiry ; reports of crimes and the courts ; response to the credit crunch .
We extract complexity and nuance until we have distilled events to the point where their human constituents can be placed in monochrome boxes marked " saints " and " sinners " .
Every narrative becomes a morality play .
Take the heart - rending story of Baby P .
The toddler we now know as Peter was a tragic victim of abuse - torture which ultimately led to his death .
Those who carried out the abuse have been described as " evil " .
Blame was also heaped on some of the professionals involved in the case .
But what if Peter had been saved ?
What kind of person would he have grown up to be ?
We can never know , of course .
But we do know that young children who suffer serious abuse are more likely to develop a personality disorder ( PD ) in later life .
In a recent academic paper , researchers studied 50 people with PD .
Of those , 44 had experienced abuse and most of them blamed it for their problems .
The deviant and sometimes anti-social behaviour which defines PD may well result in such individuals ending up in the criminal justice system , at which point the victim becomes the villain .
Peter 's mother was herself seriously abused as a child .
At some point in her life , she was moved from the white box to the black .
The question about Baby P was raised by psychiatrists at a conference I attended last week .
The first National Personality Disorder Congress brought together professionals , PD service users and their carers to " celebrate developments in the personality disorder field " .
But for all its up - beat tone , the event forced me into uncomfortable territory , a place where moral and medical judgements are blurred and the idea of personal responsibility is tested .
Where does fate end and fault begin ?
Two hundred years ago , clinicians began to focus on criminals whose offences were so abhorrent that they appeared insane and yet did n't suffer from any recognised mental illness .
The term " moral insanity " was coined , a description of a condition where intellectual faculties are unimpaired but morals are deemed " depraved or perverted " .
However , as early as 1874 , the pioneer of psychiatry Henry Maudsley suggested that the phrase portrayed " a form of mental alienation which has so much the look of vice or crime that many people regard it as an unfounded medical invention " .
We now use the term personality disorder , but the argument has not changed .
Recent guidance from the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) notes that : " there is considerable ambivalence among mental health professionals towards those with personality disorder .
" Some see this label as sanctioning self - indulgent and destructive behaviour , encouraging individuals to assume an ' invalid role ' thereby further reducing whatever inclination they might have to take responsibility for their behaviour . "
" The alternative view " , NICE continues , is that people with PD " have complex health needs that ought to be identified and addressed , either within or alongside the criminal justice system " .
I met dozens of people with personality disorder at last week 's conference , many of whom had had dealings with the police and courts over the years .
But none looked like Hannibal Lecter .
The woman pictured is Kayla Kavanagh , an Irish musician who is a regular on the festival circuit , has just completed a national tour , is working on an album and has just released her first single .
Performing at the conference she came across as charming , intelligent and talented .
Kayla has also been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder ( BPD ) .
She talks openly about her " destructive behaviours " , the " state of mind that you just can't switch off " on a short video ( which you can watch here ) .
BPD is described as " a disorder of emotion regulation " which " may be associated with episodes of impulsive aggression , self - injury , and drug or alcohol abuse " .
Typically , people with BPD will have " highly unstable patterns of social relationships " in which attitudes towards family and friends may suddenly shift from deep love to intense hatred .
BPD and other personality disorders are classified by the World Health Organisation as " a severe disturbance in the character , logical condition and behavioural tendencies of the individual , usually involving several areas of the personality , and nearly always associated with considerable personal and social disruption " .
So when Kayla lashes out or cuts herself is she a victim of her condition or a villain who should control her behaviour ?
What about Andy Brooker , another delegate at the conference ?
Andy has been diagnosed with " severe personality disorder " and spoke about one incident in which he found himself throwing furniture out of the window of his mum 's flat .
The television , tables , ornaments all went flying - passers - by had to dive for cover .
When the riot police turned up with shields raised , the front - door opened to reveal a man naked to the waist with his chest dripping with blood from self - inflicted slash marks .
Victim or villain ?
Although he says he was at this stage entirely passive , officers put him in a strangle - hold and were verbally aggressive towards him .
Andy , incidentally , is also highly respected as an advisor to government and the NHS on personality disorder , a director of the charity Emergence and a practising artist having had exhibitions at the Tate Modern and other galleries .
Such people do not easily fit into black and white boxes .
Instead , they present us with disconcerting questions about free will and self - determination .
Should we pity them or punish them ?
Treat them or imprison them ?
The rule of thumb for most people , I suspect , is whether such people are capable of controlling their behaviour .
But what does capable mean ?
A woman whose drink problem causes her to neglect her child is likely to be regarded as a villain .
A woman whose depression has the same result might well be seen as a victim .
And yet alcohol abuse and depression may be different sides of the same coin , both perhaps triggered by some historic trauma .
People with PD will say that when they behave in a deviant way , it is prompted by something inside them that they cannot control .
We all " lose it " sometimes , a display of temper , unkindness , self - loathing or self - centredness which we bitterly regret later .
" I was n't myself " , we might say .
It seems to me that personality disorder sufferers " lose it " more often and more intensely - sometimes with devastating consequences for themselves or others .
The head of the Department of Health 's Personality Disorder Programme , Nick Benefield , produced this slide to give an idea of the range and scale of PD in England .
Included in his definition are more than five million people .
It is likely , therefore , that everyone reading this post will either be a sufferer of PD or will know someone who is .
One piece of UK research suggests that up to 13 % of the general population , 25 % of GP consultations in deprived urban areas , most people in prisons , at least half of homeless people and between a third and two thirds of inpatients in psychiatric hospitals have diagnosable PD .
Officials generally work on a figure of about 4 % who would benefit from help - roughly two and a half million people in Britain .
If you want to see whether your own characteristics would potentially lead to a diagnosis for PD , there are online assessment tools here and here .
I sometimes wonder whether these very broad definitions help or hinder .
There is such a difference between a violent psychopath and someone with mild obsessive - compulsive PD that there must be a risk that attitudes to the former may hinder help for the latter .
A useful primer on the subject - Ten things to know about Personality Disorder explains how many clinicians and service users dislike the term because of its pejorative sense .
They also find the 10 categories of PD ( defined here ) unhelpful as most people with severe problems have a mixture of them , and the exact diagnosis does not help in deciding on treatments .
One of the psychiatrists I met at the conference , Dr Ian Kerr from Lanarkshire , told me in an e-mail that " the term PD MUST BE SCRAPPED " ( his capitals ) .
He argues that there are many reasons why it is unhelpful :
" [ S ] tigmatising , historic baggage , implication that it is something about the core or essence of an individual that is somehow ' wrong ' , or the confusion and overlap in forensic circles about PD and ' murderous crazed psychopaths ' which has nothing to do with the majority of so - called PD sufferers . "
Dr Kerr thinks it would be better to describe it as " post- complex - trauma syndrome / disorder " which gives a clue to what some experts think triggers the disorder .
The trauma might be childhood abuse or , as in the case of one PD sufferer whose family talked movingly at the conference about her suicide , it resulted perhaps from nearly choking to death on a walnut shell as a toddler .
We do n't know .
Research is thin .
And there are some who argue that doctors ' attempts to find a therapeutic label for it are in danger of simply medicalising bad behaviour .
However , we have come a long way since the term " moral insanity " was coined in the early 1800s .
In January this year NICE published its guidance on how to treat both borderline and anti-social PD , official recognition that people with a diagnosis for personality disorder deserve help and can benefit from treatment .
But the dilemma remains .
Not every trauma victim goes on to abuse .
Not every neglected child self - harms .
Society cannot easily forgive or excuse those that commit appalling crimes on the basis that it is a consequence of a troubled past .
The question is still unanswered .
Where does personality end and disorder begin ?
Remember Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins ?
The one man band looks pretty cool , and you have to give credit to anyone who can pull it off .
When you run your own SEO , sometimes it seems exactly like you are trying to play all the instruments you
rself – simultaneously .
As in an - house SEO , you ahve to juggle all the facets of your company ’s search engine marketing .
This means producing positive results without specialist support – you literally have to do it all .
Search strategy and tactical execution will probably both be assigned to you ; this means that effective management of your time will be critical to your success .
Delegate
Get others to help you when possible ; for example , IT personnel can usually be convinced they are the only ones who can do redirects , etc , so slough off some of the busy work in the coding field to them .
Copywriters can be engaged to help with content and generation of tags and descriptions , to save more time .
It could take mere hours to train someone to do this task , and save you days of tedium .
Outsource
Sometimes specialty jobs need to be done in support of SEO and you may be able to outsource some of these if you can convince your company it is cheaper and more efficient than , say , paying you overtime .
You can often hire out such one - off tasks as landing page design , custom script development or CMS modifications .
may be most expeditiously accomplished by contracting out the work .
Paid search is the most obvious candidate for outsourcing , unless that is your primary job .
Automate
Some portions of SEO can be automated by programmatically pushing database fields .
For reporting , configure analytic reports to eliminate any need for manual data extraction .
This takes up front time , but saves you in the long run .
Manage
Educate your company about your job !
There is no better way to get the respect you deserve than to give along presentation that manages to keep their interest and ends with a reporting of how much you have increased profits .
Learn
Do n’t let opportunities to learn more about your trade be sacrificed ( or delegated to off - work hours ) .
Insist that you are in a field with rapid changes , and that investing in your ongoing education increases your value to the company .
Do it
Every day , ask yourself the question , “ what SEO did I do today ? ”
You should always have a specific answer .
Each day , no matter how swamped you are , find an hour or two to actually do SEO , even if it is as simple or lowly as redirecting a URL adding metatags or posting a blog .
That keeps you from feeling that a day of meetings and report summaries was not worthless .
Keep on doing your best buy following these tips , and being a one man band will beceom something you love to do !
Following its October 2009 removal report , AV - Comparatives has released its November 2009 retrospective / proactive comparative .
This is actually the second part of the August 2009 comparative , where 16 products , last updated on August 10 ( new samples were taken between August 11 , 2009 and August 17 , 2009 ) , were set on the same highest detection settings ( except for Sophos and F - Secure ) and put to the test .
The results of the second part are only available now as they required a bit more work and analysis .
To recap , there were two sets of malware : Set A , which contains malware from December 2007 to December 2008 ( of which most products could detect over 97 percent ) , and Set B , which contains malware from the last seven months ( 1.6 million samples ) .
The set included the following categories of malware : Trojans ( 69.5 percent ) , Backdoors / Bots ( 20.7 percent ) , Worms ( 6.1 percent ) , other malware ( 1.5 percent ) , and Windows viruses ( 0.4 percent ) .
This test focused on malware being detected proactively , without being executed , using complex generic signatures , behavior analysis , heuristics , and so on .
The idea is to see how well new malware can be caught without having to download new signatures , which is meant for filling in the gaps .
That said , here are the proactive detection results ( rounded to the nearest percent ) :
AVIRA AntiVir Premium 9.0.0.446 : 74 percent G DATA Antivirus 20.0.4.9 : 66 percent Kaspersky AntiVirus 9.0.0.463 : 64 percent ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4.0.437.0 : 60 percent F - Secure Antivirus 10.00.246 : 56 percent Microsoft Security Essentials 1.0 beta : 56 percent Avast Professional Edition 4.8.1348 : 53 percent BitDefender Antivirus 13.0.13.254 : 53 percent eScan AntiVirus 10.0.997.491 : 53 percent AVG Antivirus 8.5.406 : 49 percent Trustport Antivirus 2.8.0.3017 : 49 percent McAfee VirusScan Plus 13.11.102 : 47 percent Symantec Norton Antivirus 17.0.0.136 : 36 percent Sophos Antivirus 7.6.10 : 34 percent Norman Antivirus & AntiSpyware 7.10.02 : 32 percent Kingsoft Antivirus 2009.08.05.16 : 32 percent
After taking these results into consideration , while also looking at the fact that some products detected three to 15 false alarms ( BitDefender , eScan , F - Secure , Microsoft , Avast , AVG , Kaspersky , G Data , ESET , and Symantec ) and others detected over 15 false alarms ( AVIRA , Sophos , McAFee , TrustPort , Norman , and Kingsoft ) , AV - Comparatives rated the security companies from best to worst in three categories :
Advanced + : G DATA , Kaspersky , ESET , F - Secure , Microsoft , Avast , BitDefender , eScan
Advanced : AVIRA , AVG , Symantec
Standard : McAfee , TrustPort , Sophos , Norman , Kingsoft
It 's worth noting that AV - Comparatives also said Windows Live OneCare would have scored the same as Microsoft Security Essentials .
In the more recent removal test last month , MSE fared better than OneCare .
OneCare went the way of the dodo in June 2009 , meaning Redmond essentially left the market for paid consumer security solutions .
MSE , the company 's free real - time consumer antimalware solution , arrived in September 2009 , and AV - Comparatives has yet to put the final release through its paces ( only beta versions have been tested so far ) .

Oregano vs. parasites
( Natural News )
It 's not widely known , but oregano extracts are extremely effective at eliminating parasites in humans .
And a lot of people have parasites they simply do n't know about .
So here , we 've collected a number of supporting statements about the anti-parasitic properties of oregano .
You 'll learn a wealth of information by reading what follows .
But before we present the list , let me recommend three sources for oregano oil that you might want to check out after reading this : Global Healing Center : www.GHChealth.com North American Herb & Spice : www.P-73.com Vitacost : www.vitacost.com
Just search for " oregano " on any of these three websites and you 'll find what you 're looking for .
I strongly recommend all three of these companies , and I personally know their owners .
( I have no financial relationship whatsoever with any of these companies and do n't earn anything from the sales of oregano products . )
Also called wild marjoram and Mexican wild sage , oregano has a peppery flavor with a hint of sage and thyme .
Chinese doctors have used oregano for centuries to treat fever , vomiting , diarrhea , and skin problems .
It helps to loosen and remove mucus .
It is a digestive aid and is thought to help get rid of intestinal parasites .
Oregano is known to have powerful antioxidant and anticancer activity .
In a study at Georgetown University , essential oil of oregano inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus ( staph ) bacteria in the test tube as effectively as antibiotics did .
Some herbs and their extracts , too , may be helpful , such as oil of oregano , garlic , citrus seed extract , berberine , plant tannins , undecylenate , and caprylic acid .
Intestinal parasites are not uncommon and also should be identified and treated .
A stool sample sent to an experienced lab can identify most intestinal parasites .
Treatment often requires medications such as Flagyl , Humatin , or Yodoxin , although some herbals , such as artemisia , oil of oregano , and berberine , may also be helpful .
The essential oil of Oregano has been demonstrated to be a potent antioxidant .
The non-polar fraction of the residue obtained after the essential oil is removed from Oregano also exhibited antioxidant activity .
Tocopherols , especially gamma tocopherol , have been identified as the major antioxidative components of the non-polar fraction , accounting for as much as 1 % of the constituents of the non-polar fraction .
Oil of Oregano inhibited enteric parasites in adults .
In one study , 77 percent of patients treated for enteric parasites were parasite free after taking oil of oregano in tablet form for six weeks .
At this writing , it has inhibited the growth of at least ten different microbes , including Candida albicans ( yeast ) .
To top it off , oregano - like its relative rosemary - contains the powerful compound rosmarinic acid , which has been found to have anti-mutagenic and anti-carcinogenic properties .
Medicinal oregano grows wild in mountainous areas of Greece and Turkey and is rich in minerals such as calcium , magnesium , zinc , iron , potassium , copper , boron , and manganese , which adds to its therapeutic value .
Oregano oil has become popular in recent years as an alternative to prescription antibiotics .
Grapefruit seed extract is derived from the bioflavonoids found in the seed and pulp .
Its anti-germicide action has shown a growth - inhibiting effect on bacteria , fungi , parasites , and viruses in several in vitro studies .
In another test tube study , volatile oils of oregano , thyme , cinnamon , and cumin were individually able to stop the growth of another food - borne pathogen called Aspergillus parasiticus .
Higher concentrations of these volatile oils were also able to stop the production of aflatoxin , a potent poison from the food mold Aspergillus .
Together these facts suggest the volatile oils in oregano used during food processing have an important role in preventing the spoilage of food and in reducing the risk of ingesting harmful bacteria , fungi , and parasites .
Nearly all our common kitchen herbs and spices have a beneficial effect , including basil , oregano , marjoram , parsley , thyme , celery seed , peppermint , spearmint , bayberries , caraway seed , cardamom seed , catnip , cloves , coriander , lemon balm and sarsaparilla .
You can find many digestive herbal tea blends in health food stores .
Some symptoms of parasites appear to be like any other digestive problem .
Chronic diarrhea is often a sign of a parasitic infection .
Antifungal and antibacterial herbs include garlic , German chamomile , aloe vera , ginger , cinnamon , rosemary , licorice , oil of oregano , and tea tree oil .
Hydrogen peroxide therapy works as a defense system , directly destroying invading bacteria , viruses , yeast , and parasites .
Ayurvedic medicine and acupuncture may also be helpful for ridding the body of Candida .
Of the spices tested , garlic , onion , allspice and oregano effectively killed all the bacteria they were stacked up against , including salmonella and staphylococcus , while other spices killed between 50 % and 75 % of the harmful bacteria .
The plants themselves use these chemicals to protect against parasites , which explains how they protect us .
Oil of Oregano from Nature 's Answer is full of vitamins and minerals and contains thymol and carvacrol , compounds that discourage the growth of microorganisms , viruses , and parasites .
Picrorrhiza , an Indian herb used in Ayurvedic medicine , is a powerful immunostimulant that boosts all aspects of immune function .
St. John 's wort is a natural blood purifier and fights viruses such as HIV and Epstein - Barr virus .
Take an inventory of the factors that may be compromising your immune system and take steps to correct them .
Olive leaf extract , oregano oil and grapefruit seed extract help to maintain proper intestinal health , fights bacteria , fungi , viruses and parasites .
Follow the directions on the individual labels .
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO MINIMIZE PARASITES : Get in the habit of using garlic , oregano , and coconut , which are naturally anti-parasitic and anti-microbial .
Eat onions , figs , and pumpkin seeds to create an uninhabitable environment for worms .
Eat a diet rich in protein and vitamins .
As absorption in the intestines is impaired by infestations , the body requires large amounts of nutrients found in fresh organic vegetables , almonds , and blackberries .
Take a daily high quality probiotics supplement ( friendly bacteria , such as those found in fermented foods ) .

Google Inc. took another major step in its quest to ensure that wherever consumers go -- whether to their laptops to search sports scores or videos or to their phones to find a restaurant -- advertisers will be there too .
On Monday the search giant said it was buying AdMob Inc. , a developer of technology that plops ads into thousands of mobile phone applications , for $ 750 million in Google stock .
It ’s one of the largest acquisitions yet for the 11 - year - old company and illustrates Google ’s double - barreled strategy of attracting consumers with free tools to access billions of Web pages , books , maps and movies -- and then charging advertisers to pitch their wares to its huge audience .
“ Despite the tremendous growth in mobile usage and the substantial investment by many businesses . . . the mobile web is still in its early stages , ” Susan Wojcicki , Google ’s vice president for product management , said in a blog post .
“ We believe that great mobile advertising products can encourage even more growth .
That ’s what has us excited about this deal . ”

Google ’s advertising business generates nearly all of the company ’s $ 22 billion in annual revenue , but Google has been constantly adding to its smorgasbord of free services and applications to draw in the audiences that are valuable to advertisers .
Among search engines , Google has become a household name and receives nearly two - thirds of U.S. Web search queries .
But the company has been expanding into dozens of other industries , enabling users to find books , send e-mail , make phone calls and watch video -- services that cost money before the rise of the Web .
But as Google ’s free products have disrupted one industry after another , questions have mounted about whether its rapid expansion is catalyzing competition or crippling it .
In the last month , Google has burrowed deeper into several major markets .
Advertisement
In a surprise challenge to Apple Inc. 's dominant iTunes music service , Google unveiled a music search feature that enables users to find , play and buy millions of songs .
On the same day , Google sent tremors through the hand - held navigation industry by announcing that new Google - powered phones would come with turn - by - turn driving directions -- a service for which consumers have long had to pay .
Some industry observers are wondering whether there are any limits to the services and features Google could eventually offer .
“ They define everything in the universe as information , ” said Siva Vaidhyanathan , a media studies professor at the University of Virginia , “ which means everything in the world is potentially in their domain . ”
Advertisement
Because Google is fundamentally an advertising company , Vaidhyanathan said , its highest priority is to “ harvest users ’ attention ” and sell that commodity to eager marketers .
But its method of capturing attention -- supplying free Web services -- deals heavy blows to competitors .
When Google announced that it would include free Global Positioning System navigation software in phones with the new version of its Android mobile operating system , investors dumped stock in manufacturers of for - pay GPS devices .
Shares of Garmin Inc. and TomTom , two leading GPS device makers , have dropped 25 % and 32 % respectively .
Whether Google ’s practice of offering free services in formerly paying markets is fair is a complicated question , said Layne Kruse , an antitrust attorney at Fulbright & Jaworski .
Advertisement
Offering a free service is not inherently harmful to competition , Kruse said .
“ In antitrust law we say you ’re not out to protect competitors , you ’re out to protect competition . ”
“ People go out of business all day , ” Kruse said .
“ But as long as you have other businesses that can step in and compete , then the market still works . ”
But regulators could take action if free Google services -- like its GPS software , its search engine or even YouTube -- become so widely adopted that newcomers would find it too difficult to compete .
Google , however , does n’t appear worried .
Speaking at a recent press event , Chief Executive Eric Schmidt defended the company ’s pricing model .

“ Obviously we like the price of free because the consumers like that as well , ” Schmidt said , adding , “ We can figure out ways to use advertising to pay for it . ”

The work was carried out on rabbits Tissue created in a laboratory has been used to completely replace the erectile tissue of the penis in animals .
The advance raises hopes of being able to restore full function to human penises that have been damaged by injury or disease .
Rabbits given the engineered tissue by the scientists from Wake Forest University in North Carolina had normal sexual function and produced offspring .
The study appears online in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Professor Anthony Atala said : " Further studies are required , of course , but our results are encouraging and suggest that the technology has considerable potential for patients who need penile reconstruction .
" Our hope is that patients with congenital abnormalities , penile cancer , traumatic injury and some cases of erectile dysfunction will benefit from this technology in the future . "
Reconstructing damaged or diseased penile erectile tissue is a tough challenge because of the tissue 's complex structure and function .
ENGINEERED TISSUE
Known as the corpora cavernosa penis
Two columns of sponge - like material , forming a significant part of the organ
The structures , bound together with connective tissue and covered with skin , fill with blood during an erection Different approaches have been tried - including the use of silicone prostheses - but with limited success .
The Wake Forest team has already achieved considerable success in the field of tissue engineering , developing whole human bladders that have been implanted into patients .
In a previous study , the researchers engineered short segments of rabbit erectile tissue with 50 % of full function .
In the latest work , they harvested smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells from the animals ' erectile tissue .
These cells were multiplied in the laboratory and used to seed a three dimensional scaffold , which was implanted into the animals ' penis .
Organised erectile tissue with blood vessel structures began to form as early as a month later .
The researchers believe the key was the fact that the cells were injected into the scaffolds on two separate days , enabling them to hold almost six times as many smooth muscle cells as in previous studies .
Tissue engineering techniques may well lead to clinical advances with time
Tim Terry
British Association of Urological Surgeons During an erection , it is the relaxation of smooth muscle tissue that allows an influx of blood into the penis .
The relaxation is triggered by the release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells .
Tests showed that vessel pressure within the engineered tissue was normal and that blood flowed smoothly through it and drained away from it normally after an erection .
When the animals with the engineered tissue mated with females , vaginal swabs contained sperm in eight out of 12 cases .
Four of the 12 females were impregnated .
Tim Terry , honorary secretary of the British Association of Urological Surgeons , described the study as " fascinating " .
He said complex , highly invasive surgery was often the only option for patients with damaged erectile tissue and the latest work offered long - term hope of a better alternative .
However , he said , much work would be required before the technique could be tested on humans , with potential problems including finding a suitable place to embed the new tissue and ensuring it had an appropriate nerve supply .
" Nevertheless , tissue engineering techniques may well lead to clinical advances with time , " he said .

All of those twentysomethings who voted for Barack Obama last year are about to experience the change they have n't been waiting for : the return of income tax bracket creep .
Buried in Nancy Pelosi's health - care bill is a provision that will partially repeal tax indexing for inflation , meaning that as their earnings rise over a lifetime these youngsters can look forward to paying higher rates even if their income gains are n't real .
Americans of a certain age have seen this movie before .
In 1960 , only 3 % of tax filers paid a 30 % or higher marginal tax rate .
By 1980 , after the inflation of the 1970s , the share was closer to 33 % , according to a Heritage Foundation analysis of tax returns .

Hopefully Sarah Palin realizes she 's been invited to Hong Kong almost certainly as a practical joke .
CLSA , the Asia - focused broker who invited Mrs. Palin as keynote speaker for an Asian investment conference , is well known for their cheeky takes on investment research .
In the past , they 've polled Asian fortune tellers for index targets , hired anime cartoonists to draw Japanese research , and generally love to push the boundaries between entertainment and analysis .
They are a real research firm , it 's just that they love to sprinkle in some hilarity every now and then as a smart marketing gimmick .
Sarah Palin is this year 's big laugh for them .
Her invitation as keynote speaker in Hong Kong is so ridiculous that its absurdity can't be accidental .
WSJ : Palin " who 's never been to East Asia and is n't exactly famous for her mastery of public speaking or her expertise in finance and international affairs " might seem an unusual choice for an event that , according to CLSA , is Asia 's premier investment conference providing unrivalled corporate access to 1,300 global fund managers from 32 countries , representing more than $ 10 trillion in funds under management .
AP : " Our keynote speakers are notable luminaries who often address topics that go beyond traditional finance such as geopolitics , " company spokeswoman Simone Wheeler said in a statement .
" We just felt it would be a fabulous opportunity for CLSA clients to hear from Mrs. Palin , " Wheeler said , adding that CLSA approached Palin with the offer .
This is the straight - faced professional comedy which CLSA does so well .
Palin probably does n't know what she 's in for .
If you will , she 's being " Borat'ed " and does n't have the Asia knowledge to realize it .

I recently re-read a classic piece by J.L. Mackie ( April 1955 ) , entitled “ Evil and Omnipotence , ” a stupendous philosophical essay about why theologians like Richard Swinburne are forced by their belief in an omnipotent , omnibenevelont and omnipowerful god into incredible and rather painful feats of mental gymnastics .
One of Mackie ’s minor points in the essay is that the so - called “ free will defense ” for the existence of evil in the world is problematic because the concept of free will itself is incoherent .
Although , sometimes accusations of incoherence are thrown around a bit too easily in philosophy , I think this one has the potential to stick .
( Mackie goes on with a devastating critique of the free will defense , a critique that remains effective even if the core concept should in fact prove to be coherent . )
Philosophically speaking , I still think that the best treatment of free will is the one given by Dan Dennett in his Elbow Room , which is a delightful book to read in its own right .
Nonetheless , one may wonder whether the concept that emerges from Dennett ’s analysis is in fact what most people would recognize as “ free will .
” Of course , both words making up the term have the potential to be problematic , since it is not necessarily clear what we might mean by “ will . ”
However , for the purposes of this discussion I will simply say that the will — insofar as human beings are concerned — is whatever set of motivations ( and underlying neurological mechanisms ) are behind the fact that we do certain things rather than others or , indeed , that we do anything at all .
( Indeed , patients affected by severe damage to their amygdalas , for instance , seem to loose the will to do anything , likely because they 've lost any emotional attachment to themselves and to things in the world : just like David Hume famously predicted , without emotions “ It is not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger . ” )
Moreover , I do not see a problem in , for instance , the Aristotelian concept of “ akrasia , ” or weakness of the will .
Some people find it contradictory , because if I end up doing something out of my own volition — like eating a piece of chocolate cake — I cannot simultaneously claim that I did this “ against my will , ” because I knew that eating chocolate cake is n’t healthy .
However , any human being who has struggled with food , sex , and other desires can make perfect sense of the idea of a weak will that makes you act against your own best interest even when you know perfectly well where such interest lies .
Anyway , back to the “ free ” part of free will .
The obvious question is : free from what ?
That ’s where coherence quickly becomes a problem .
Unless you are a dualist — a thankfully dying breed among philosophers — you ca n’t possibly mean free from causal interactions with matter / energy , i.e. independent of the laws and materials of the universe .
The will , whatever it is and however we like to conceptualize it , is grounded in the biological activity of our neurons .
And last time I checked our neurons are made of matter , exchange energy ( in the form of electrical currents and chemical reactions ) , and are subject to the laws of physics .
So if that ’s what you mean by “ free , ” it ’s a no starter .
The next popular argument for a truly free will invokes quantum mechanics ( the last refuge of those who prefer to keep things as mysterious as possible ) .
Quantum events , it is argued , may have some effects that “ bubble up ” to the semi-macroscopic level of chemical interactions and electrical pulses in the brain .
Since quantum mechanics is the only realm within which it does appear to make sense to talk about truly uncaused events , voilà ! , we have ( quantistic ) free will .
But even assuming that quantum events do “ bubble up ” in that way ( it is far from a certain thing ) , what we gain under that scenario is random will , which seems to be an oxymoron ( after all , “ willing ” something means to wish or direct events in a particular — most certainly not random — way ) .
So that ’s out as well .
It now begins to look like our prospects for a coherent sense of free will are dim indeed .
If it ai n’t random - quantistic or independent from causal interactions with the rest of the world , in what sense is it “ free ” ?
But if the will is not free , are we then not simply lumbering robots at the mercy of a mechanical , uncaring universe ?
( Or , worse yet , puppets in some god ’s hands ? )
This conclusion strikes most people as intuitively deeply unsatisfactory .
Moreover , would n’t that mean that human behavior would be predictable , at least in principle , if reductionist / mechanistic science became sufficiently advanced ?
That also strikes many as clearly off the mark .
One possible response is that , frankly , if the conclusions of a rational analysis go against your deepest held intuitions , so much the worse for your deepest held intuitions .
But of course we also know that there are in fact non-deterministic physical systems ( the time of decay of an individual atom , for instance ) , and we even know of perfectly deterministic systems whose behavior is for all effective purposes impossible to predict ( chaotic , i.e. highly non-linear systems whose status at any given point in time is highly sensitive to initial conditions ) .
So having a will that is causally connected to the rest of the physical world does not imply that our behavior is rigid or predictable .
Still , does that mean that we are in fact lumbering robots , whose illusion of being free is a combination of our ignorance of the causal web within which we are embedded and of our limited ability to compute our own future status ?
I think the best answer here comes from research in the cognitive sciences , which increasingly points to ( at least ) two levels of decision making in the brain : on the one hand , we now know that our subconscious makes a lot of decisions before we are consciously aware of them ( think of those experiments showing the time - delay in electrical potential between when a muscle is being activated to perform a given action and when the subject becomes aware of having made the decision to perform that action , for instance ) .
On the other hand , consciousness still seems to be a bit more than just a “ rationalizing ” process , taking on instead the role of high - level filter , or moderator , of unconscious brain processing ( e.g. , we can still stop an ongoing action if our conscious attention becomes focused on it ) .
What all of this seems to suggest is that the undeniable feeling of “ free will ” that we have is actually the result of our conscious awareness of the fact that we make decisions , and that we could have — given other internal ( i.e. , genetic , developmental ) and external ( i.e. , environmental , cultural ) circumstances — decided otherwise in any given instance .
That ’s what Dennett called a type of free will that is “ worth having , ” and I consider it good enough for this particular non-dualist , non-mystically inclined human being .
Fossils , too , are telling evidence for shared descent , but evolution does not need them to make its case , for we can see it happening before our eyes .
I was fascinated to learn that , in 1971 , Belgian scientists transferred a group of lizards from one small island off the Yugoslav coast to another , free of native members of that species , nearby .
During that same summer , a few miles inland in the wild backwoods of Croatia , I myself was hard at work moving thousands of snails between habitats in the hope of picking up differences in survival .
Thirty - seven years later , the descendants of the transferred lizards had changed – evolved – to gain stronger jaws and a modified gut to deal with their new and more vegetarian diet ; but , alas , just a year after moving the molluscs I could find almost none of them ( which proves not that evolution is wrong but that experiments in the wild usually do not work ) .
Column
Sunday Old School : Budgie
Continuing on from last week 's edition of Sunday Old School , which focused on Black Sabbath , this week 's column takes a look at another band from the very first wave of heavy metal , in this case , Welsh rockers Budgie .
Budgie is perhaps best known for their song , " Breadfan " because Metallica frequently covered the song during live performances ( Metallica has also covered another Budgie song , " Crash Course In Brain Surgery . " )
Metallica is n't the only big name band to have covered Budgie either .
Iron Maiden covered the song , " I Can't See My Feelings , " Van Halen covered the title track from the 1974 album , " In For The Kill , " and Soundgarden recorded a cover of " Homicidal Suicidal , " which comes from Budgie 's self - titled debut .
Many people , myself included , feel that Budgie never really got the full recognition they deserved and when comparing the two bands , one could state that Budgie was , " the RUSH that did n't quite make it . "
However , their influence on heavy metal remains to this day , with the band still holding a large fan base in Poland , an to a lesser extent , Australia and the United Kingdom .
Budgie - " Breadfan "
Budgie - " Breaking All The House Rules "
Budgie - " Zoom Club "
Budgie - " Napoleon Bona Parts 1 & 2 "
Budgie - " Pyramids "

Jerald Reodica documents the corruption and greed in the heart of the California State University system that have led to budget cuts .
ACTIVISTS AT almost all the 23 campuses of the California State University ( CSU ) system are mobilizing for a strike and day of action on March 4 -- the date chosen at a statewide conference of activists at the University of California - Berkeley on October 24 .
A variety of actions are planned , including walkouts , rallies , marches to the capital in Sacramento , teach - ins , occupations and strikes -- all with the goal of building the confidence to fight the cuts among CSU students , faculty and staff hit hard by furloughs , cut classes , higher fees and a lower quality education .
Activists around the state also recognize the importance of organizing to reverse the privatization of CSU , a key public institution that 's already crawling with corruption .
A July 6 San Francisco Chronicle article , titled " CSU chancellor hires two lobbyists without bids , " shed new light on CSU management .
Over the last decade , the CSU has paid more than $ 2 million in public funds to two Sacramento lobbying firms -- Capitol Advocacy LLC and Sloat , Higgins , Jensen & Associates .
Students protest cuts across the California State University system ( Tim Pulling )
While the board of trustees increased student fees , canceled classes and implemented more faculty and staff layoffs , CSU management paid these private lobbyists to block bills aimed at full disclosure of CSU salaries -- a shameful abuse of public funds .
Instead of finding ways to increase revenue for the CSU to cover the $ 584 million budget deficit -- the largest in the system 's history -- the board of trustees , with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger at the helm , has decided to further increase student fees , lay off lecturers and force the workers who remain to choose whether to see more of their colleagues fired or take deeper pay cuts .
CSU Chancellor Charles Reed has indicated that he plans to eliminate more classes , student enrollment positions and faculty until the CSU system is downsized to match the $ 584 million in cuts .
This is in addition to closing the doors on 40,000 prospective enrollees , out of CSU 's 450,000 total , by the 2010 - 2011 school year .
Students who are n't able to register for all the classes they need to graduate will face greater financial burdens , as they are forced to attend CSU for another semester or two .
Already , as of last year , the average student graduated with more than $ 20,000 in loan debt .
The board of trustees voted for a 10 percent fee increase in student fees last May and another 20 percent fee increase two months later in July -- and now it 's set to vote November 17 to administer " significant reductions in labor costs . "
SOME PEOPLE have talked about the importance of an organization like the Alliance for the CSU in trying to win back the reductions .
But there can't be an alliance when it includes members of the board of trustees -- the uber - wealthy of California - - and the overpaid upper management on CSU campuses .
Take Dr. Glen Toney , a CSU trustee since 2006 .
For 23 years prior to his retirement in 2002 , Toney served as a top executive with Santa Clara , Calif . - based Applied Materials .
Applied Materials has negotiated contacts with the Pentagon to create semiconductor equipment for weapons systems .
Toney is n't the only war profiteer on the board .
Raymond Holdsworth Jr. is the president of Los Angeles - based AECOM Technology Corp. , and has been a trustee since 2004 .
AECOM Technology Corp. has provided military maintenance support to U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and received contacts worth $ 293.7 million from 2004 - 2006 .
Then there 's Dr. Robert Corrigan , president of San Francisco State University ( SFSU ) since 1988 - - 21 years is an unheard - of tenure for a college president .
Before he came to SFSU , Corrigan resigned from his chancellorship at the University of Massachusetts at Boston following the discovery of his secret " Chancellor 's Fund " by his vice chancellor .
The Boston Globe specified the details of an audit revealing that $ 127,000 had been deposited into this special account .
Much of the funds --$ 70,000 - - had been withdrawn by Corrigan from the Boston Food Services Trust Fund without authorization .
Curiously , Corrigan was never charged with embezzling funds from the university system .
Instead , upon resignation , Corrigan received farewell compensation .
At SFSU , Corrigan 's privatization efforts continue , as he implements the SFSU Campus Master Plan , a long - term redevelopment of campus .
This " Plan " includes an on -campus Recreation and Wellness Center , which will cost $ 93 million to build .
Two student - run organizations , Associated Students Inc. ( ASI ) and the Cesar Chavez Student Center Governing Board , as well as Campus Recreation , a program under Student Affairs , are pushing this project along .
Initially , ASI proposed the Center and paid Brailsford & Dunlavey , a private architectural firm , $ 300,000 in student fee money to assess the " feasibility " of the project , without ever informing students .
This corporation has successfully gentrified more than 300 campuses across the nation , including most of the schools in the CSU system .
Additionally , according to GuideStar , a searchable database of the activities and finances of U.S. nonprofits and charities , SFSU 's very own Cesar Chavez Student Center holds a series of investments to the tune of over $ 4.8 million .
At the end of the 2008 fiscal year , the center held $ 1.35 million in publicly traded securities while holding over $ 3.5 million in other investment securities .
These investment holdings include companies such as Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Pfizer , Proctor & Gamble , DuPont , Monsanto , McDonald 's and Halliburton .
It goes without saying that this project will have an impact on struggling students , mostly poor students forced to work multiple jobs to pay for an increasing cost of living , and people of color , unable to keep up with fees .
At the beginning of this semester , while students attempted to crash classes , the Student Fee Advisory Committee - - a group in charge of reviewing proposed changes and recommendations to President Corrigan -- scrapped democracy ( via a student fee referendum ) and opted instead for a potentially biased petition requiring minimal approval from students on campus .
SUCH APPALLING actions at SFSU and the 22 other campuses must be challenged and blocked through grassroots democracy .
General assemblies , such as those that took place over the last couple months at various California public educational institutions , are spaces where dissension can be voiced , and where both students and workers may pose alternatives to corruption and gentrification .
Democratization is a process ; people must be able to come together in an inclusive space that aims to eliminate inequality and build trust networks .
Such networks were necessary during the 1968 student strike led by the Black Student Union and the Third World Liberation Front .
In 1968 , SF State students battled with police and inspired faculty to go on strike themselves early the next year .
As a result of struggle , and student and worker unity , the College of Ethnic Studies , along with the Educational Opportunity Program , was won .
Now , however , this college at SFSU is facing disproportionate cuts .
The American Indian Studies Department , for example , has been cut down from 20 sections to only seven this semester .
In addition , the Student Resource and Empowerment Center - - which offered credit for students who worked as interns , and provided information and referrals to students in need of financial aid , jobs , scholarships , housing , psychological and health services , academic counseling , legal aid , crisis intervention and more -- has been indefinitely closed .
Now is the time to revive the legacy of activism at SFSU and the rest of the California public educational sector to inspire others to build resistance to budget cuts .
Another university is possible .
He has represented Lil ' Kim , mobsters , and gang leaders .
But somewhere along the way , he allegedly became quite the criminal himself .
Federal prosecutors say Paul Bergrin had a wintess killed in a drug case , hired a hit man to kill another , and used a Newark restaurant as front for a cocaine ring .
The Philadelphia Inquirer has the full story here .
Talking Points Memo covered it here .
The Inquirer : Bergrin , a former federal prosecutor , [ was ] ... arraigned [ Monday ] with seven codefendants in U.S. District Court in Newark .
All were named in a superseding indictment handed up earlier this month that expanded on charges originally filed when Bergrin was arrested in May ...
Though the indictment includes one murder and one murder conspiracy , investigators contend that witnesses have linked Bergrin to at least three other homicides .
They also say Bergrin routinely bribed witnesses to win cases .
And , they contend , when bribery was n't an option , he resorted to violence .
Bergrin once represented Jason Itzler , the " King of All Pimps " who ran the escort service New York Confidential .
Prosecutors say Bergrin took it over once Itzler was sent to jail .
Bergrin is reported to be a tough character ( " No witness , no case " he often said ) and recorded conversations support that description .
In talking to a potential hit man -- who was actually a witness cooperating with the government -- Bergin reportedly said , " Put on a ski mask and make it look like a robbery .
. . .
It can not under any circumstances look like a hit . . . make it look like a home - invasion robbery . "
In another conversation , the " hit man " spoke to a co-defendant in the case , who indicated Bergrin himself had " done work , " underworld parlance for committing murder .
" Paul 's a stone killer , bro , " he said .
sjbrown 's Writing Games Tutorial
By Shandy Brown .
Please send comments / corrections via email to tutorial@ezide.com
Last Update : March 2011
We will start by trying to create a program where a little man moves around a grid of nine squares .
This is a overly simple example , but easily extensible so we wo n't get tied up in the game rules , instead we can focus on the structure of the code .
We have n't even got to the Model yet , and already we have a difficulty .
If you are familiar with using PyGame , you are probably used to seeing a main loop like this :
# stolen from the ChimpLineByLine example at pygame.org main ( ) : ... while 1 : # Handle Input Events for event in pygame.event.get ( ) : if event .
type == QUIT : return elif event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN : fist.punch ( ) elif event.
type == MOUSEBUTTONUP : fist.unpunch ( ) # Draw Everything allsprites.update ( ) screen.blit( background , ( 0 , 0 ) ) allsprites.draw( screen ) pygame.display.flip ( )
ControllerTick ( ) : # Handle Input Events for event in pygame.event.get ( ) : if event .
type == QUIT : return False elif event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN : fist.punch ( ) elif event.type == MOUSEBUTTONUP : fist.unpunch ( ) return True ViewTick ( ) : # Draw Everything ... main ( ) : ... while 1 : if not ControllerTick ( ) : return ViewTick ( )
Rationale Readers with some experience writing games may be balking at this point , thinking MVC is more complex than necessary , and that it will add unneeded overhead , especially when the goal is to create a simple , arcade - style game .
Now historically , arcade games were just that , games written for arcade machines .
The code ran " close to the metal " , and would squeeze all the resources of the machine just to get a 3 - color ghost to flash blue every other frame .
In the 21st century , we have resource - rich personal computers where applications run a couple layers above the metal .
Hence , organizing your code into a pattern has a small relative cost .
For that small cost , you get the following advantages : more easily add networking , easily add new views ( file loggers , radars , HUDs , multiple zoom levels , ... ) , keep the Model code " cleaner " by decoupling it from the view and the controller , and I contend , more readable code .

Let 's examine the infinite while loop in the last bit of code .
What is its job ?
It basically sends the Tick ( ) message out to the View and the Controller as fast as the CPU can manage .
In that sense it can be viewed as a piece of hardware sending messages into the program , just like the keyboard ; it can be considered another Controller .
Perhaps if " wall clock " time affects our game there will be even another Controller that sends messages every second , or perhaps there will be another View that spits text out to a log file .
We now need to consider how we are going to handle multiple Views and Controllers .
This leads us to the next pattern in our architecture , the Mediator .
We implement the Mediator pattern by creating an EventManager object .
This middleman will allow multiple listeners to be notified when some other object changes state .
Furthermore , that changing object does n't need to know how many listeners there are , they can even be added and removed dynamically .
All the changing object needs to do is send an Event to the EventManager when it changes .
If an object wants to listen for events , it must first register itself with the EventManager .
We 'll use the weakref WeakKeyDictionary so that listeners do n't have to explicitly unregister themselves .
[ TODO : more weakref rationale . gc , etc ]
We will also create an Event class to encapsulate the events that can be sent via the EventManager .
class Event : " " " this is a superclass for any events that might be generated by an object and sent to the EventManager " " " def __init__ ( self ) : self.name = " Generic Event " class EventManager : " " " this object is responsible for coordinating most communication between the Model , View , and Controller . " " " def __init__( self ) : from weakref import WeakKeyDictionary self.listeners = WeakKeyDictionary ( )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def RegisterListener ( self , listener ) : self.listeners [ listener ]
= 1 #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def UnregisterListener ( self , listener ) : if listener in self.listeners.keys ( ) : del self.
listeners [ listener ]
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Post ( self , event ) : " " " Post a new event .
It will be broadcast to all listeners " " " for listener in self.listeners.keys ( ) : # NOTE : If the weakref has died , it will be #automatically removed , so we do n't have # to worry about it .
listener .
Notify ( event )
class KeyboardController : ... def Notify ( self , event ) : if isinstance ( event , TickEvent ) : # Handle Input Events ... class CPUSpinnerController : ... def Run( self ) : while self.keepGoing : event = TickEvent ( ) self.evManager .
Post ( event ) def Notify ( self , event ) : if isinstance ( event , QuitEvent ) : self.keepGoing = False ... class PygameView : ... def Notify ( self , event ) : if isinstance ( event , TickEvent ) : # Draw Everything ... main ( ) : ... evManager = EventManager ( ) keybd = KeyboardController ( ) spinner = CPUSpinnerController ( ) pygameView = PygameView ( ) evManager.RegisterListener( keybd ) evManager.RegisterListener( spinner ) evManager.RegisterListener( pygameView ) spinner .

Diversion : Event Types and Selective Listeners
As we get more and more listeners , we may find that it 's inefficient to spam every listener with every event .
Perhaps some listeners only care about certain events .
One way to make things more efficient is to classify the events into different groups .

One way to make things more efficient is to classify the events into different groups .
For the purpose of this guide , we 'll just use one kind of event , so every listener gets spammed with every event .
Advanced Event Managers
If you try to use this particular Event Manager class for your own project , you might notice it has some shortcomings .
In particular , if a block of code generates events A and B sequentially , and a listener catches event A and generates event C , the above Event Manager class will process the events in the order A , C , B , instead of the desired order of A , B , C .
In the later examples , you can see an example of a more advanced Event Manager that always delivers events in the desired order .

Here is a Model that has worked for me and is general enough to adapt to many types of games :
In our example , " little man " will be our sole Charactor .
In our example , the Map will be a discrete Map having a simple list of nine sectors .
In our example , we will allow no diagonal moves , only up , down , left and right .
Each allowable move will be defined by the list of neighbors for a particular Sector , with the middle Sector having all four .
This example makes use of everything covered so far .
It starts out with a list of possible events , then we define our middleman , EventManager , with all the methods we showed earlier .
Next we have our Controllers , KeyboardController and CPUSpinnerController .
You 'll notice keypresses no longer directly control some game object , instead they just generate events that are sent to the EventManager .
Thus we have separated the Controller from the Model .
Next we have the parts of our PyGame View , SectorSprite , CharactorSprite , and PygameView .
You 'll notice that SectorSprite does keep a reference to a Sector object , part of our model .
However we do n't want to access any methods of this Sector object directly , we 're just using it to identify which Sector object the SectorSprite object corresponds to .
If we wanted to make this limitation more explicit we could use the id ( ) function .
The Pygame View has a background group of green square sprites that represent the Sector objects , and a foreground group containing our " little man " or " red dot " .
It is updated on every TickEvent .
Finally we have the Model objects as discussed above and ultimately the main ( ) function .
Here is a diagram of the major incoming and outgoing events .
The code in the following sections is written incrementally , so do n't expect to just take the code from the first section and write a game with it .
Subsequent sections sometimes address problems with the previously shown code and explain how to overcome those problems .
Rapid Development
One of the goals of this tutorial is to show how game development can be done rapidly .
Usually anything involving networking is anathema to " rapid " because once you introduce networking , you introduce multiprocessing , latency , error handling , and general hair - pulling .
A principle of the code examples in this tutorial is to make sure that the game can be run without even turning on networking .
The networking feature should have zero impact on the code in example .
py -- running the game in single - player mode should not execute any networking - related code paths .
By being strict about this separation , we hope to make it possible to develop the game rapidly , no matter what snags the networking code may introduce .

In the " Strict " Client - Server structure , there is one " 3rd party " server that all the clients connect to .
Any change to the authoritative game model must happen at the server .
A client can predict the authoritative state , but it must not put faith in game state until it hears from the server that that is , in fact the case .
An example game would be World of Warcraft .
Client - Server @ Wikipedia
In the " Servent " Client - Server structure , one of the players , usually the one that starts the game , acts as the server as well .
This suffers from the drawback that other players trust the game state as much as they trust that particular player .
However no 3rd party is needed .
Examples can be found in many first person shooter games .
This structure is often paired with a 3rd party " matching " server that connects players with each other and then hands off to the Servent host .
Servent @ Wikipedia
In the Peer to Peer structure , all hosts have identical roles .
The great benefit of a Peer to Peer structure is that it robustly deals with network disconnects from individual hosts .
However trust is compromised .
Trust can be bolstered by adopting token passing strategy such that the host holding the token acts as a Servent .

For our examples , we will examine the " Strict " Client - Server structure .
This asynchronous quality is fundamental to network - related code .
Luckily designing our code such that there is an independent EventManager and well - defined events will make dealing with asynchronous messages from the network fairly painless .
This tutorial will use the Twisted framework for network - related code .
I recommend reading the Twisted documentation , though it should not be necessary to get through this tutorial .
( note , a lot of the Twisted documentation focuses on writing servers where the client implementation is unknown .
I recommend skipping forward to the sections on Perspective Brokers )
The ideas presented here should be independent from the choice of Twisted ; the examples could just as well be implemented with raw sockets or carrier pigeons .
Twisted is a framework that hides the queue from us , it expects the programmer to call reactor.run ( ) , which is a mainloop that consumes the queue and fires off callbacks .
The callbacks are provided by the programmer .
Normally a server is something that runs as a daemon or in a text console ; it does not have a graphical display .
We can do this simply by replacing PygameView with a TextLogView as follows :
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ class TextLogView : " " " ... " " " def __init__ ( self , evManager ) : self .
evManager = evManager self.evManager.RegisterListener( self )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Notify ( self , event ) : if isinstance ( event , CharactorPlaceEvent ) : print event.name , " at " , event.charactor.sector elif isinstance ( event , CharactorMoveEvent ) : print event.name , " to " , event.charactor.sector elif not isinstance ( event , TickEvent ) : print event.name
Another thing we do n't need in a server is keyboard input , so we can remove the KeyboardController .
Where do input messages come from instead ?
They come from the network , so we 'll need a Controller object for the messages sent by the clients , NetworkClientController .
from twisted .
spread import pb #------------------------------------------------------------------------------ class NetworkClientController( pb.Root ) : " " " ... " " " def __init__ ( self , evManager ) : self .
evManager = evManager self.evManager.RegisterListener( self )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def remote_GameStartRequest( self ) : ev = GameStartRequest ( ) self.evManager .
Post ( ev ) return
1
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def remote_CharactorMoveRequest( self , direction ) : ev = CharactorMoveRequest ( direction ) self.evManager .
Post ( ev ) return
1
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Notify ( self , event ) : pass
Caveat
It could be tempting to make all of the objects remotely referenceable .
( ie , inherit from pb. Referenceable )
The problem with that approach is that it tightly couples the networking code with the rest of the code .
It 's preferable to separate the networking code so that the other objects just use the event passing strategy described by the Mediator pattern .

In our examples , we 're only going to have one class in the server that is referenceable , and also only one class in the client .
[ TODO : expand on this ]
We also do n't need the CPUSpinnerController in the server , so we 've removed that , and replaced it with Twisted 's reactor , which similarly provides a run ( ) method .
def main ( ) : evManager = EventManager ( ) log = TextLogView ( evManager ) clientController = NetworkClientController ( evManager ) game = Game ( evManager ) from twisted .
internet import reactor reactor.listenTCP (
8000 , pb.PBServerFactory( clientController ) ) reactor.run ( )
Previously , we used the Tick event to start the Game , now we 'll need to explicitly start the game with our new GameStartRequest event .
class GameStartRequest ( Event ) : def __init__( self ) : self.name = " Game Start Request "
If we play some dirty tricks , we can see what our server does without writing a client .
Instead , we will just connect to it using the Python interactive interpreter .
Now , reactor.run ( ) is a blocking call that does not return until the reactor is shut down , so in order to get back to the interactive prompt , we have to crash the reactor and then call reactor.iterate ( ) in order to communicate with it .
It should go without saying that this is not a recommended practice .
Also , if you replicate the session below , you may have to call iterate ( ) multiple times before you see any result .

We can fake the client in a more proper way by using a tool that comes with Twisted , twisted.conch.stdio .
We just start a python interpreter with this module and then we can omit the reactor abuse :
$ python - m twisted.conch.stdio >>> from twisted .

The previous example of a server gave a good introduction to the basic networking technique , but it 's a little too simple for our purposes .
We do n't really want to write a new function for every message the server can possibly receive .
Instead , we 'd like to leverage our already existing Event classes .
This brings us to one of the most important parts , but possibly the most tedious part of implementing networking .
We need to go through all the possible events and answer these questions about each :
Do we need to send it from the client to the server ?
Do we need to send it from the server to the client ?
Are there security issues with sending this data over the network ?
Is the data formatted in a way that it can be sent over the network ?
If we must , how do we reformat the data so that it can be sent ?
While there are many ways of doing this with Twisted , I will outline a strategy that tries to minimize the amount of code written ( to combat the tediousness of this task ) and to maintain the separation of the networking requirements from the remainder of the code .
Using Twisted , we must do three things to a class to make it possible to send instances of it over the network : make it inherit from twisted.spread.pb.Copyable , make it inherit from twisted.spread.pb.RemoteCopy , and call twisted.spread.pb.setUnjellyableForClass( ) on it [ TODO : ask someone who knows Twisted if that 's really necessary ] .
Things can become even more complicated when we consider questions 4 and 5 from our list above -- does the data require special formatting to send it over the network ?
The only data that does n't require special formatting are the literal types : string , int , float , etc. , None , and containers ( lists , tuples , dicts ) thereof .
While examining the Events , two cases will occur , either it will not require reformatting , and we can just mix - in pb.
Copyable and pb.
RemoteCopy , or it will require reformatting and we will have to create a new class that has a routine to change the original data into something that can be sent over the network .
[ TODO : link to explain Mixins somewhere ]
In this next example , we 've split the code into multiple files .
All the events are in events .py .
In network .py , we try to answer all of the above questions for each event in events .py .
If a message can go from the client to the server , we append it to the clientToServerEvents list , and likewise for the serverToClientEvents list .
If the data in the event is simple , like integers and strings , then we can just mix - in the pb. Copyable and pb.RemoteCopy classes and call pb.setUnjellyableForClass( ) on the event .
# from network .
py
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # GameStartRequest # Direction : Client to Server only MixInCopyClasses ( GameStartRequest ) pb.setUnjellyableForClass(GameStartRequest , GameStartRequest ) clientToServerEvents.append ( GameStartRequest )
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # CharactorMoveRequest # Direction : Client to Server only # this has an additional attribute , direction .
it is an int , so it 's safe MixInCopyClasses ( CharactorMoveRequest ) pb.setUnjellyableForClass(CharactorMoveRequest , CharactorMoveRequest ) clientToServerEvents.append ( CharactorMoveRequest )
On the other hand , if an event contains data that is not network - friendly , like an object , we need to make a replacement event to send over the wire instead of the original .
The simplest way to make a replacement is just to change any event attributes that were objects to unique integers using the id ( ) function .
This strategy requires us to keep a registry of objects and their ID numbers , so that when we receive an event from the network referencing an object by its ID number , we can find the actual object .
# from network .
py
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # GameStartedEvent # Direction : Server to Client only class CopyableGameStartedEvent( pb. Copyable , pb.RemoteCopy ) : def __init__ ( self , event , registry ) : self.name = " Game Started Event " self.gameID = id( event.game ) registry[ self.gameID ] = event.game pb.setUnjellyableForClass(CopyableGameStartedEvent , CopyableGameStartedEvent ) serverToClientEvents.append ( CopyableGameStartedEvent )
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ # CharactorMoveEvent # Direction : Server to Client only class CopyableCharactorMoveEvent ( pb.Copyable , pb.RemoteCopy ) : def __init__ ( self , event , registry ) : self.name = " Charactor Move Event " self.charactorID = id ( event.charactor ) registry[ self.charactorID ] = event.charactor pb.setUnjellyableForClass(CopyableCharactorMoveEvent , CopyableCharactorMoveEvent ) serverToClientEvents.append ( CopyableCharactorMoveEvent )
From the server , changes need to be sent out , so we need to create a new View on the server .
# from server .
py
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ class NetworkClientView( object ) : " " " We SEND events to the CLIENT through this object " " " def __init__ ( self , evManager , sharedObjectRegistry ) : self .
evManager = evManager self.evManager.RegisterListener( self ) self.clients = [ ] self.sharedObjs = sharedObjectRegistry
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Notify ( self , event ) : if isinstance ( event , ClientConnectEvent ) : self.clients.append ( event.client ) ev = event # do n't broadcast events that are n't Copyable if not isinstance ( ev , pb. Copyable ) : evName = ev.__class__.__name__ copyableClsName = " Copyable " + evName if not hasattr ( network , copyableClsName ) : return copyableClass = getattr ( network , copyableClsName ) ev = copyableClass ( ev , self.sharedObjs ) if ev.__class__ not in network.serverToClientEvents : # print " SERVER NOT SENDING : " + str ( ev ) return # NOTE : this is very " chatty " .
We could restrict # the number of clients notified in the future for client in self .
clients : print " =====server sending : " , str ( ev ) remoteCall = client.callRemote( " ServerEvent " , ev )
NetworkClientView.Notify ( ) is primarily interested in Copyable events .
The event passed in to Notify ( ) might already be Copyable , due to the mixing in of pb.
Copyable in network .py .
In that case , isinstance ( ev , pb.Copyable ) returns True .
If it 's not Copyable , there still might be a replacement class in the network module , and we can check by prepending " Copyable " to the event 's class name because we used that naming convention for the replacement classes in network .py .
As can be seen in NetworkClientView .
Notify ( ) , the server expects the client to send it a remotely accessible object ( like one that inherits from Twisted 's pb.Root ) when the client connects .
Thereafter , the server can use that object to notify the client of events .
Now we 'll ( finally ) get started on the client .
From the point of view of the client , the incoming messages from the server represent a Controller , so we 've got a NetworkServerController class in client .py .
As you might be expecting , the client will also send events to the server through a View , the NetworkServerView .
# from client .
py
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ class NetworkServerView( pb.Root ) : " " " We SEND events to the server through this object " " " ...
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Connected ( self , server ) : self . server = server self.state = NetworkServerView.STATE_CONNECTED ev = ServerConnectEvent ( server ) self.evManager .
Post ( ev ) ...
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def AttemptConnection ( self ) : ... connection = self.reactor.connectTCP(serverHost , serverPort , self.pbClientFactory ) deferred = self.pbClientFactory.getRootObject( ) deferred.addCallback(self.Connected ) deferred.addErrback(self.ConnectFailed ) self.reactor.startRunning ( ) ...
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Notify ( self , event ) : ev = event if isinstance ( event , TickEvent ) : if self.state == NetworkServerView.STATE_PREPARING : self .
AttemptConnection ( ) ...
# from client .
py
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ class NetworkServerController( pb.Referenceable ) : " " " We RECEIVE events from the server through this object " " " def __init__ ( self , evManager , twistedReactor ) : self .
evManager = evManager self.evManager.RegisterListener( self )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def remote_ServerEvent( self , event ) : self.evManager .
Post ( event ) return
1
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Notify ( self , event ) : if isinstance ( event , ServerConnectEvent ) : # tell the server that we 're listening to it and # it can access this object event.server.callRemote( " ClientConnect " , self )
We will create a PhonyModel on the client side whose state we will keep in sync with the authoritative model on the server .
This PhonyModel provides the same interface as the server 's model , but it has a special role - to ensure that the local game objects do not change the game state when they do n't have the authority to do so .
In our example , this is accomplished by keeping two EventManager objects , one called phonyEventManager , which just discards events that it receives , effectively silencing all events coming from the local game objects , and one called realEventManager , which propogates events received from the server .
Events posted to the realEventManager will show up in the View objects , events posted to the phonyEventManager will not .
Because our example is very simple , we can get away with this simple implementation .
One can imagine situations where we might want to allow a local game object to change the local state .
This could be accomplished by making PhonyEventManager propogate these special events .
Another approach could be to not have a local Model on the client , only a View object on which incoming events from the server had a direct effect .
Here 's the tricky part : how do we send complex objects like Players or Charactors over the channel we 've created ?
This is called serialization .
To serialize our objects , we need to do two things .
Create a registry that maps unique IDs to game objects
For each class , have a way to change all of its internal data into numbers and strings , and a way to change those back into useful objects
When events referencing complex objects get to the NetworkClientView on the server , the objects are serialized starting in the constructor of the Copyable event .
# from server .py class NetworkClientView : ... def Notify ( self , event ) : ... ev = event if not isinstance ( ev , pb. Copyable ) : evName = ev.__class__.__name__ copyableClsName = " Copyable " + evName if not hasattr ( network , copyableClsName ) return copyableClass = getattr ( network , copyableClsName )
# It is here that serialization starts ev = copyableClass ( ev , self.sharedObjs ) elif ev.__class__ not in serverToClientEvents : return for client in self.
clients : self.RemoteCall ( client , " ServerEvent " , ev )
# from network .py class CopyableCharactorMoveEvent ( pb.Copyable , pb.RemoteCopy ) : def __init__ ( self , event , registry ) : self.name = " Copyable " + event.name self.charactorID = id ( event.charactor ) registry[ self.charactorID ] = event.charactor
When the client is sent the CopyableCharactorMoveEvent , the PhonyModel picks it up ( the PhonyModel is the only object interested in events that start with " Copyable " ) .
# from client .py class PhonyModel ...
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Notify ( self , event ) : ... if isinstance ( event , CopyableCharactorMoveEvent ) : charactorID = event.charactorID if not self.sharedObjs.has_key(charactorID ) : charactor = self.game.players[0].charactors [0 ] self.sharedObjs[charactorID ] = charactor remoteResponse = self.server.callRemote(" GetObjectState " , charactorID ) remoteResponse.addCallback(self.StateReturned ) remoteResponse.addCallback(self.CharactorMoveCallback , charactorID )
This is a very generic approach to solving the problem .
Server :
Hey , dude X just moved !
Hey , dude X just moved !
Client : Oh really ?
Tell me everything you now now about that guy .
Oh really ?
Tell me everything you now now about that guy .
Server : Well , he's in the " ACTIVE " state , and he's in the sector with the unique ID 123567 .
Well , he's in the " ACTIVE " state , and he's in the sector with the unique ID 123567 .
Client ( to self ) : Ah , excellent .
I already know about that sector , so I 'll just change my little model of the universe and move that dude into that sector .
Server :
Hey , dude X just moved !
To sector 123567 !
Hey , dude X just moved !
To sector 123567 !
Client ( to self ) : Ah , excellent .
I already know about that sector , so I 'll just change my little model of the universe and move that dude into that sector .
Back to the code snippet , if the client has already received that object from the server , self.sharedObjs.has_key ( ) will return true , and it can grab a reference to the object from the registry and carry on as normal .
If it has n't received that object yet ( as is the case the first time this event is received ) , it must first create a placeholder object , and then copy the state of the object on the server into this new placeholder object .
It does this by calling GetObjectState ( ) with the unique ID of the needed object .
GetObjectState ( ) basically just finds that object on the server ( in this example , the Charactor that has moved ) , and serializes it's data with a call to getStateToCopy ( ) .
GetObjectState ( ) returns the dict and the object ID that was requested .
# from network .
py
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ class CopyableCharactor : def getStateToCopy ( self , registry ) : d = self.__dict__.copy ( ) del d[' evManager ' ]
sID = id ( self.sector ) d[' sector ' ] = sID registry [ sID ] = self . sector return d def setCopyableState ( self , stateDict , registry ) : neededObjIDs = [ ] success = 1 if stateDict [ ' sector ' ] not in registry : registry [ stateDict [ ' sector ' ] ] = Sector(self.evManager ) neededObjIDs.append ( stateDict [ ' sector ' ] ) success = 0 else : self.sector = registry [ stateDict [ ' sector ' ] ] return [ success , neededObjIDs ]
The client receives this information in the StateReturned ( ) function , which is probably the most difficult function to follow in this whole tutorial .
I 'll try to go through it step - by - step .
The client first requests the Object state .
When the response comes , the callbacks StateReturned and CharactorMoveCallback are queued to be called in sequence .
# from client . py def Notify ( self , event ) : ... remoteResponse = self.server.callRemote(" GetObjectState " , charactorID ) remoteResponse.addCallback(self.StateReturned ) remoteResponse.addCallback(self.CharactorMoveCallback )
# from server.py def remote_GetObjectState( self , objectID ) : ... return [ objectID , objDict ]
# from client .
py
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def StateReturned ( self , response ) : " " " this is a callback that is called in response to invoking GetObjectState on the server " " " objID , objDict = response if objID == 0 : print " GOT ZERO -- better error handler here " return None obj = self.sharedObjs[objID ] success , neededObjIDs =\ obj.setCopyableState(objDict , self.sharedObjs ) if success : #we successfully set the state and no further objects #are needed to complete the current object if objID in self.neededObjects : self.neededObjects.remove(objID ) else : # to complete the current object , we need to grab the #state from some more objects on the server .
The IDs # for those needed objects were passed back # in neededObjIDs for neededObjID in neededObjIDs : if neededObjID not in self.
neededObjects : self.neededObjects.append(neededObjID ) self.waitingObjectStack.append( ( obj , objDict ) ) retval = self .
GetAllNeededObjects ( ) if retval : # retval is a Deferred - returning it causes a chain # to be formed .
return retval
However , if " success " was False , that means more data is needed to complete the originally requested object 's state .
The PhonyModel keeps a list of neededObjects that must be requested from the server before the originally requested object is complete .
Each of these needed objects may also append to the neededObjects list for subsequent objects they need .
So when we call GetAllNeededObjects ( ) the recursive behaviour begins .
# from client .
py
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def GetAllNeededObjects ( self ) : if len( self.neededObjects ) == 0 : # this is the recursion - ending condition .
If there are # no more objects needed to be grabbed from the server # then we can try to setCopyableState on them again and #we should now have all the needed objects , ensuring # that setCopyableState succeeds return self.
ConsumeWaitingObjectStack ( ) # still in the recursion step .
Try to get the object state for # the objectID on the top of the stack .
Note that the recursion #is done via a deferred , which may be confusing nextID = self.neededObjects [ - 1 ] remoteResponse = self.server.callRemote(" GetObjectState " , nextID ) remoteResponse.addCallback(self.StateReturned ) return remoteResponse
As you can see , another call is made to GetObjectState on the server that will result in StateReturned being called .
Notice that this is n't truly recursive .
GetAllNeededObjects does n't block .
It returns immediately .
But it returns a Deferred object , remoteResponse .
So the original Deferred had it 's first callback called , and that returned a new Deferred object .
This is called Chaining Deferreds and it causes the first callback to block until the second Deferred 's callbacks are finished .
Hence we get recursion over the network .
Here is a flowchart that summarizes the actions taken when the client gets an event containing a complex object .
Notice that we must make sure that the event we send over the network has enough information to update the client with any relevant changes to the state of the server .
The client may already have a local version of an object , but if that object has changed , the client still has to call GetObjectState ( ) , as is demonstrated with the CharactorMoveEvent .
With that in mind , a question is raised : where do we put the intelligence do determine what object states we need to retrieve ?
Right now , we 've put all this logic in PhonyModel .
Notify ( ) [ TODO : is this the best place ?
what about inside Copyable events ? ]
The previous discussion is a good start and provides some useful code .
I encourage you to play around with it and see if you can get your game sending objects back and forth .
As your code becomes more complex , you will run into some more problems :
What if we do n't have enough information to call __init__ for some attributes in setCopyableState ( ) ?
What if we do n't know the specific subclass for an attribute in setCopyableState ( ) ?
To clarify , here 's an example of when an issue like this might come up .
Lets say we write a game where two Penguins fight each other .
Each Penguin has a weapon , and every weapon is initialized with a name , like " Deathbringer " or " Destroy - o - Matic " , or " Daffodil " .
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ class Weapon : def __init__ ( self , evManager , name ) self .
evManager = evManager self .name = name
CopyablePenguin would thus look something like this :
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------ class CopyablePenguin : def getStateToCopy ( self , registry ) : d = self.__dict__.copy ( ) del d[' evManager ' ] wID = id ( self .
weapon ) registry [ wID ] = self .
weapon d[' weapon ' ]
= wID return d
def setCopyableState ( self , stateDict , registry ) : neededObjIDs = [ ] success = 1 wID = stateDict [ ' weapon ' ] if not registry .
has_key ( wID ) : #registry did n't have the object , so create a new one self .
weapon = Weapon ( self .
evManager , #WELL CRAP !
I do n't yet know what its name is , so how am I going to initialize it ?
... wID = stateDict [ ' weapon ' ] if not registry .
has_key ( wID ) : #registry did n't have the object , so create a new one self .
weapon = ???
# MORE CRAP !
I do n't even know what class of object it should be !
We can solve this problem with a Placeholder object that is very similar to the Lazy Proxy design pattern .
... [ TODO : finish this section ]
We will add a couple new events , PlayerJoinRequest , PlayerJoinEvent ( the Player object is no longer created by when the Game is constructed ) , and CharactorPlaceRequest .
The KeyboardController is also modified to detect new keypresses , p and c to fire off those request events , and the o key to switch between active players .
( see screenshot above ) .
You can try this out by running python example .py from the example 4.tar.gz archive below .
When it starts , press p twice to request 2 PlayerJoin events , then press space bar to start the game , then press c to place one character , o to switch to the other player , then c again to place the second character .
Direction keys move the charactor around , as per usual .
We want to ensure that Player One 's client cannot control Player Two 's charactor .
We want the server to reject any request where the player instance contained in the request is not an instance the sender is allowed to control .
As a first step , we need to be able to uniquely identify clients .
Then we need to map clients to a set of Player objects ( or more commonly , just one ) that they are allowed to control .
Then we need to filter out any events that should not be allowed based on that map .
Luckily , Twisted provides a rich set of tools to identify clients , aka " authentication " .
Most of this is explained in [ TODO ] Authentication with Perspective Broker in the Twisted docs .
I 'll go over the specific usage in our example , but you should also review those docs .
Our first change will be to change the server 's NetworkClientController from a pb.
Root object into a pb.
Avatar object :
# from server.py class NetworkClientController ( pb. Avatar ) : " " " We RECEIVE events from the CLIENT through this object
There is an instance of NetworkClientController for each connected client . " " " def __init__ ( self , evManager , avatarID , realm ) : self .
evManager = evManager self.evManager.RegisterListener( self ) self.avatarID
= avatarID self .
realm = realm ...
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def perspective_GetGameSync(self ) : ...
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def perspective_GetObjectState(self , objectID ) : ...
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def perspective_EventOverNetwork( self , event ) : ...
As you can see , the class now inherits from pb.
Avatar , and the methods that were previously named remote_BlahBlah are now named perspective_BlahBlah .
Also , the NetworkClientController objects will need to keep track of their realm and their avatarID .
The realm is basically a factory on the server that gets requests for new client connections , and creates new NetworkServerViews and NetworkServerControllers for each successful connection .
# from server .py class MyRealm : implements ( portal .
IRealm ) def __init__ ( self , evManager ) : self .
evManager = evManager # keep track of avatars that have been given out self.claimedAvatarIDs = [ ] # we need to hold onto views so they do n't get garbage collected self.clientViews = [ ] # maps avatars to player (s ) they control self.playersControlledByAvatar = {} #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def requestAvatar ( self , avatarID , mind , * interfaces ) : if pb.
IPerspective not in interfaces : raise NotImplemented Error if avatarID in self.claimedAvatarIDs : # someone already has this avatar .
raise Exception ( ' Another client is already connected ' ' to this avatar ' ) self.claimedAvatarIDs.append(avatarID ) ev = ClientConnectEvent ( mind , avatarID ) self.evManager .
Post ( ev ) self.playersControlledByAvatar[avatarID ] = [ ] view = NetworkClientView ( self .
evManager , avatarID , mind ) controller = NetworkClientController(self.evManager , avatarID , self ) self.clientViews.append( view ) return pb.
IPerspective , controller , controller.clientDisconnect
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def knownPlayers ( self ) : ...
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Notify ( self , event ) : if isinstance ( event , ClientDisconnectEvent ) : self.claimedAvatarIDs.remove(event.avatarID ) removee =
None for view in self.clientViews : if view.avatarID == event.avatarID : removee = view if removee : self.clientViews.remove( removee )
If you look at the body of the requestAvatar method , you see where the network views and controllers get created .
The requestAvatar method is also where the avatarID comes into play .
It is created internally to Twisted , and passed to our code .
It is an identifier guaranteed to be unique for each client .
Effectively , it is a " username " .
requestAvatar gets called as a result of calling login ( ) during the AttemptConnection method of the client :
# from client.py avatarID = None def main ( ) : global avatarID if len( sys.argv ) > 1 : avatarID = sys.argv [ 1 ] else : avatarID = ' user1 ' class NetworkServerView ( pb.Root ) : " " " We SEND events to the server through this object " " " ...
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def __init__( self , evManager , sharedObjectRegistry ) : self .
evManager = evManager self.evManager.RegisterListener( self ) self.pbClientFactory = pb.PBClientFactory ( ) self.state = NetworkServerView.STATE_PREPARING
self.reactor =
None self .server = None self.sharedObjs = sharedObjectRegistry
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def AttemptConnection ( self ) : self.state = NetworkServerView.STATE_CONNECTING if self.reactor : self.reactor.stop ( ) self .
PumpReactor ( ) else : self.reactor = SelectReactor ( ) installReactor( self.reactor ) connection = self.reactor.connectTCP(serverHost , serverPort , self.pbClientFactory ) userCred = credentials .UsernamePassword(avatarID , ' pass1 ' ) controller = NetworkServerController ( self .evManager ) deferred = self.pbClientFactory.login(userCred , client=controller ) deferred.addCallback(self.Connected ) deferred.addErrback(self.ConnectFailed ) self.reactor.startRunning ()
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Disconnect ( self ) : if not self .
reactor : return self.reactor.stop ( ) self .
PumpReactor ( ) self.state = NetworkServerView.STATE_DISCONNECTING
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def Connected ( self , server ) : self . server = server self.state = NetworkServerView.STATE_CONNECTED ev = ServerConnectEvent ( server ) self.evManager .
Post ( ev )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def ConnectFailed ( self , server ) : self .
state = NetworkServerView.STATE_DISCONNECTED
Now that we 've got these usernames dictated by Twisted , we might as well use the information in our Model .
[ TODO : expand ... ]
All that remains is changing the KeyboardController .
The KeyboardController keeps track of which player is " active " and controls only that player , switching when the " o " key is pressed .
That works fine when running as a single process , but now that there are a couple clients and which player a client controls is regulated by the server , we need to adjust the KeyboardController .
First we 'll give the constructor an optional argument , " playerName " .
By making the default value None , we can check to see if it 's set , and anywhere it 's not set , we keep the single - process behaviour .
[ TODO : paste in code ]
The only change to make is the reaction to a PlayerJoinEvent .
In single - process mode , it makes sense to always control the new player , but with multiple clients , that new player could have come from a remote host and the server wo n't let this local host control it .
So only try to control players that match the playerName .
The next question may be " where does the playerName get set then " .
It is simply during the main ( ) function of the client code .
[ TODO : paste in code ]
[ TODO : I need a section here on why to chain deferreds when the client receives events from the server .
On a received event , the client starts getting new state information from the server .
Because of the asynchronous nature of networked programs and the choice we made to not send ALL the needed information at once , there are points in time when we 've collected incomplete information from the server .
If we populated our phony Model with that incomplete information and then the User Interface got Ticked , it will likely result in a crash or at least a UI bug .
So we chain deferreds , get all the state information we need , and once it's all collected , then we update our phony Model and post events . ]
[ TODO : I need a section here talking about how to refine the client code so that you do n't need a waiting Objects queue .
Basically , with a better Placeholder class , and some Python self .
__class__ = foo magic , we do n't have to keep a queue and solidify the Placeholders after everything has been downloaded . ]
A GameSync is a request from the client to pull sufficient information about the game to recreate its current state from nothing .
In our example , we just send the Game object from the authoritative model .
Start by creating a new event , GameSyncEvent :
# from events .py class GameSyncEvent ( Event ) : def __init__ ( self , game ) : self.name = " Game Synched to Authoritative State " self .
game = game
Add another remotely callable method on the server , and the server - side code is done :
# from server.py class NetworkClientController ( pb. Avatar ) : ... def perspective_GetGameSync(self ) : " " " this is usually called when a client first connects or when they reconnect after a drop " " " game = sharedObjectRegistry.getGame( ) if game == None : raise Exception ( ' Game should be set by this point ' ) gameID = id ( game ) gameDict = game.getStateToCopy ( sharedObjectRegistry ) return [ gameID , gameDict ]
Next we need to hook up the client side .
When should a GameSync be requested ?
It needs to be done at a time when the client has a connection to the server , but the client - side model ( PhonyModel ) has not yet been populated .
A good place is the ServerConnectEvent handler in PhonyModel itself .
# from client .py class PhonyModel : ... def Notify ( self , event ) : if isinstance ( event , ServerConnectEvent ) : self . server = event . server # when we reconnect to the server , we should get the #entire game state .
if not self.
game : self.game = Game ( self.phonyEvManager ) gameID = id( self.game ) self.sharedObjs[gameID ] = self.game remoteResponse = self.server.callRemote(" GetGameSync " ) remoteResponse.addCallback(self.GameSyncReturned ) remoteResponse.addCallback(self.GameSyncCallback , gameID ) remoteResponse.addErrback(self.ServerErrorHandler , ' ServerConnect ' ) ...
These two functions are straightforward ; they just populate the client - side sharedObjs and send the GameSyncEvent to the client - side event manager .
# from client .py class PhonyModel : ... def GameSyncReturned ( self , response ) : gameID , gameDict = response print " GameSyncReturned : " , gameID self.sharedObjs[gameID ] = self .game # StateReturned returns a deferred , pass it on to keep the # chain going .
return self .
StateReturned ( response ) ... def GameSyncCallback( self , deferredResult , gameID ) : game = self.sharedObjs[gameID ] ev = GameSyncEvent ( game ) self.realEvManager.Post ( ev )
The last detail of the reconnection involves example .py .
After a client reconnects , it will have a fresh KeyboardController object .
This KeyboardController wo n't receive a PlayerJoinEvent to set up it 's activePlayer because the game is already underway ( in the authoritative model , both players had already joined ) .
So we add some new code to example .
py ( compromising the principles set out in the Rapid Development aside , but it 'll be harmless , I promise .
( can anyone suggest a better way to do this ? ) ) to take a GameSyncEvent and figure out which player the KeyboardController should control .
# from example .py class KeyboardController : ... def Notify ( self , event ) : ... if isinstance ( event , GameSyncEvent ) : game = event.game self.players = game.players [ :] # copy the list if self .
playerName and self .
players : self.activePlayer = [ p for p in self .
players if p.name == self.playerName ] [ 0 ] ...

What license is all this code under ?
Unless otherwise stated , everything here is in the Public Domain .
Why do you use from module import * ?
Do n't you know that 's bad coding style
?
Do n't you know that 's bad coding style Yeah , my bad .
I promise i'll clean all those up before i declare this " finished " .
Why do n't you use Twisted 's Cacheable ?
It seems like you 're just reimplementing it .
I am a bit of a newbie when it comes to Twisted .
I read a bit about the Cacheable stuff , but it seemed to me I 'd have to make the classes of my Model be Cacheable , and I did n't want the network code to be coupled with my model code .
And seeing as I would have to write serialization code even if I used Cacheable , I just bulldozed ahead .
Would it be possible to use Cacheable without coupling it with the Model code ?
Could someone who is familiar with Twisted point me in the right direction ?

I ’ve been craving Solium Infernum all year .
It ’s almost certainly going to be the last of the 2009 Unknown Pleasures to debut before the year wraps up .
For those who were n’t around back then , Solium Infernum is a turn - based wargame that places you as an aspirant to the throne of hell .
And frankly , that ’s a perfect set - up for a game as I can think of .
With late - Beta code , I ’ve had a chance to prod around and see what I think .
What I think is that I want to prod around it some more .
Much like Cryptic Comet ’s last game – the genuinely brilliant Armageddon Empires – this is a hard nut to crack .
If you remember , it took me a third of a year to actually persist enough with Armageddon Empires for it to click .
Even then , it took until after the end of the year for anyone else to have properly explore it – and Alec , my equal and opposite in ‘ orrible indie strategy – found it had worked its way into his heart .
Jim never tried .
And if John did , he ’d have another one added to the list of games which made have made him cry .
Much like with Armageddon Empire , I ’ve played a game , realised I did n’t get anything , restarted , and learned a little more .
In fact , I managed to pull of a victory on my second go on a fairly small map .
And – unlike Armageddon Empires – I actually sat down to at least skim the manual , because the first experience of the game was so genuinely bewildering .
( I could n’t work out why I could n’t actually end the turn , as it said there was something I still had to respond to .
Except I could n’t find it anywhere .
Now , I realise that there ’s multiple tabs for end - of - turn responses , which stick on whichever one you were on last , which … oh , it does n’t matter .
Suffice to say , while the UI seems slicker than Armageddon Empires , it ’s still going to be a serious barrier . )
It ’s lucky because the entrance is a little slicker , because Solium Infernum , while it ’s a wonderfully crafted universe with its own challenges , it does n’t play like any other strategy game I can think of .
Despite appearances of screenshots , it ’s less like a wargame and more like a a particularly aggressive dinner party .
So yes , your armies go marching out claiming hexes like any other game .
So you see something you want ?
Well , you ca n’t invade because you ’re not at war .
Well , declare war ?
No .
This is hell .
Things are terribly polite here .
You need an excuse , so you have to manufacture one .
So , for example , you can make a demand of another player – resources , terrain or valuable equipment .
If they refuse , you can be offended , and state a vendetta .
Alternatively , just insult them in open council .
If they stand up for themselves , it ’s vendetta time again .
But you see the problem .
If they accept that – yes – indeed , they are a petty lapdog of heaven or actually hand over what you demanded , you ’re screwed .
You get what you wanted , but you do n’t get to declare war .
As long as they ’re willing to be your proverbial bitch , you ca n’t touch them .
Of course , there ’s reasons why they wo n’t do that .
The more you give up , the bigger demands the opposition can make .
It ’s easy to just give up a few spare souls to stop someone invading you when you ’re not ready .
When they ’re asking for your throne of skulls that amps up your most powerful demon legion , it ’s a harder pill to swallow .
Even insults hurt – because the main way of winning the game ( And I ’m not even going to go into the other ways of doing so ) is gaining prestige .
Whoever has the most at the end of the game wins .
You accept an insult and you lose prestige , so pushing you further away from winning .
And the person who ’s doing the insult or demanding is wagering prestige on you wimping out too .
In other words , it ’s a game which embraces the idea of an aristocratic – and a bureaucratic – hell , and spins it out in as many ways as it can think of .
For example , you do n’t build armies , but purchase what ’s available from an infernal bazaar .
So you ’re bidding against your opponents for units .
And , much like Armageddon Empires , it ’s a game that ’s based on a strict limitation of actions .
You only get to give two orders a turn , unless you ’ve upgraded your archdemon a little .
At a maximum , you can get six .
Me ?
In the two games I ’ve played , I ’ve only ever got three – and that ’s because I purchased a special ability giving me an extra one .
When “ demand resources ” – as in , get stuff which you can use to do stuff – counts as an action , you can imagine how much you have to calculate what needs to be prioritised .
You gather resources .
You move an army .
And … no , that ’s it , this turn .
If you want to use rituals , upgrade your archdemon , start a diplomatic drive or go shopping , you ’ll have to stop one of them this turn .
In other words , intense .
When my second game was cooking towards its conclusion – which I won – things were hectic in terms of me working out ways to prevent all the demonic wrath descending on me .
Where to move my forces ?
When ’s best to submit ?
How much can I get on my knees to Belial while still staying ahead of him ?
Fun , unique strategic stuff .
Mechanising the diplomacy to such a degree is a terribly clever move .
My main reservation now – except for just getting into it – is that the game does seem to have a slow start , bubbling along for some time before things seem to grow nastily intense .
I suspect it ’s because I simply do n’t understand what ’s going on , and there ’s many things which I should be considering which I ignored in favour of marching out and getting as much terrain as possible .
And – most importantly – this is primarily designed as a Play - by - e - mail game , and I have n’t faced off against another human ( or five ) .
I plan to do so soon , as it ’s got ridiculous numbers of ways to amusingly screw over your friends .
Quinns not having enough iron will be the least of his problems .
But yeah – this is oddly atmospheric , unique stuff .
I especially like how the world map loops , subtly enhancing the overworldly vibe of it .
I was wrestling with what I thought was a terrible tactical position , with half my armies on the other side of the world to the enemy offensive and only a few troops needed when I realised that they were so far over there that we ’d actually sandwiched the enemy between all my armies .
Woo !
I ’ll show you hell , demons .
Also , it features a picture of an enormously fat man .
Go fattie !
Highly promising , in short .
Keep an eye on its site , chew over Bill Harris ’ notes and I ’ll say more when I play more .

Obama announces smart grid plans
President Barack Obama announced a $ 3.4 billion investment of stimulus funds to modernize the electric grid Tuesday , saying that creating the nation ’s new clean - energy economy will require an “ all - hands - on - deck approach ” like the one that put a man on the moon .
“ The growth of clean energy can lead to the growth of our economy , ” Obama said at a solar - energy facility in Arcadia , Fla .
But he predicted some would fight the changes , including his proposed legislation designed to reduce greenhouse gases , but called on the nation to seize the initiative in pursuing clean energy .

“ The closer we get to this new energy future , the harder the opposition is going to fight , ” Obama said .
“ It ’s a debate between looking backwards and looking forward , between those who are ready to seize the future and those who are afraid of the future , and we know which side the United States of America has always come down on . ”
Obama announced that 100 private companies , utilities , manufacturers , cities and others will receive grants of between $ 400,000 and $ 200 million to help build a nationwide " smart energy grid " that will cut costs for consumers and make the nation 's electrical system more reliable .
The grants are expected to create tens of thousands of jobs and also lay down the infrastructure to create a new renewable energy industry , one of Obama 's longstanding goals .
The stimulus funds will draw an additional $ 4.7 billion in private investment to match the grant awards .
“ The smart grid is something that has a transformational impact on how energy is delivered , ” Carol Browner , Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change , said ahead of Obama ’s speech .
“ This is about building more than just miles of wire , it ’s about building … something that works . ”
Also , Vice President Joe Biden announced a plan to reopen a closed General Motors factory to produce plug - in hybrid cars in Wilmington , Del .
Obama ’s speech put climate and energy initiatives center stage , just as the Senate kicks off hearings about a climate bill sponsored by Sens.
John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) and Barbara Boxer , ( D - Calif . )
On Tuesday , the Senate Environment and Public Works committee will hear testimony from five top administration officials on the legislation .
The bill would create a cap and trade system that would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 .
Improving the electrical grid , say administration officials , will increase energy efficiency and independence by encouraging growth in renewable power sources like solar , geothermal , and wind .
The administration has set a goal of getting at least 20 percent of energy from renewable sources by 2020 .
The funding will be used to install 700 automated substations , more than 200,000 smart transformers , 170,000 smart thermostats , 40 million smart meters , and other new technologies .
The projects will cut electricity costs for consumers and give consumers in 49 states access to renewable power sources .
They ’ll also help prevent power outages , which the administration says costs consumers about $ 150 billion annually , and help utilities respond more effectively when electricity disruptions occur .
Jared Bernstein , Biden 's chief economist , said the funding will create new jobs for manufacturers , electricians , equipment installers , business analysis , IT system designers , data entry clerks , and others .
Posted by John , November 13th , 2009 - under Learning , Sesame Street , Teachers , Teaching .
Nicole Colson in the US magazine Socialist Worker looks at the 40 - year legacy of the children ’s show Sesame Street , and the way it revolutionized television .
THIS MONTH marks the 40th anniversary of the television show that may have had a greater impact on the lives of multiple generations of people around the globe than any other .
I ’m talking , of course , about Sesame Street .
Currently on the air in some 125 countries , Sesame Street is the longest - running children ’s TV program in U.S. history .
It has become a staple of American life , with one 1996 survey finding that 95 percent of American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were age three .
Sesame Street has become such an important part of life for millions of kids in the U.S. that , when the transition to digital television was scheduled earlier this year , it was delayed for several months in part due to fears that low - income families would find themselves suddenly without the show .
The show began as an experiment in a seemingly simple , yet revolutionary , idea : that TV could be used to help teach very young children .
Although there were kids ’ shows like Captain Kangaroo and Howdy Doody , Sesame Street was the first show to consciously explore the potential of TV to teach kids basics like numbers and letters , and how to navigate emotions and social interaction .
The idea for what would become Sesame Street grew out of a dinner party thrown in 1966 by public TV producer Joan Ganz Cooney .
The party included Lloyd Morrisett , then - vice president of the Carnegie Corporation .
The concept for Sesame Street was shaped by the social movements of the 1960s and growing progressive politics that , on a national scale , had seen the implementation of the Johnson administration ’s “ War on Poverty . ”
The resulting 1965 Head Start program would target low - income pre-school aged children for early intervention with educational , health and nutritional assistance and other social services .
In 1968 , the Children ’s Television Workshop was founded , with money from Carnegie , the Ford Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting–a creation of the 1967 Public Broadcasting Act , which , for the first time , authorized federal funds for the production of culturally enriching content for public television .
The Workshop ’s first project was Sesame Street , which would debut the following year .
When it premiered , Sesame Street had the distinction of having “ the most extensive planning for any TV show to date , ” the New York Times wrote at the time .
The show ’s research team designated a “ curriculum focus ” for each season , and identified and emphasized a “ set of related objectives ” that were written into each episode .
Learning was reinforced through constant repetition and reinforcement of concepts–each episode has a “ letter of the day ” and “ number of the day ” featured in multiple segments throughout the show , grounded by a running story set on the “ street ” featuring adults and monsters interacting .
Segments were written with some sly adult humor as well –the use of celebrity guest appearances , for example , and re-workings of popular songs ( such as , Johnny Cash singing “ Do n’t Take Your Ones to Town , ” a take - off on his hit “ Do n’t Take Your Guns to Town , ” or REM singing “ Furry Happy Monsters , ” a spoof of “ Shiny Happy People ” ) –which encouraged parents to view the show alongside their kids .
This season featured a Mad Men parody , complete with opening credits , for “ Muppet Men ” –where the advertising Muppets make commercials that prompt emotions .
As Michael Davis , author of Street Gang : The Complete History of Sesame Street , writes , the show ’s creators “ came together at a star - crossed moment in American life when people of means who lived in comfort chose to dedicate their energies to the less fortunate and the forgotten , the rural poor and the underprivileged of the urban ghettos .
Sesame succeeded beyond their wildest imaginings and , in doing so , changed the world , one child at a time . ”
Famously left - wing pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock predicted early on that Sesame Street would result in “ better - trained citizens , fewer unemployables in the next generation , fewer people on welfare and smaller jail populations . ”
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
THAT MAY be a more than a slight overstatement , but the show struck a nerve from its debut on November 10 , 1969 .
Nearly 2 million households tuned into the first episode .
By the end of its first season , 7 million children a day were watching the show .
Ten years after it began , according to Davis , some 9 million American children under the age of 6 were watching Sesame Street daily–and 90 percent of children from low - income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show .
Sesame Street was unique in the approach it took : geared toward urban kids , the “ street ” was set in an urban landscape , complete with graffiti , peeling paint and trash cans ( the street has a more “ cleaned - up ” look today ) and a multigenerational and multiracial cast .
This ruffled some feathers .
In 1970 , a state commission in Mississippi briefly banned the show because of its integrated cast .
“ Mississippi was not yet ready ” for the multiracial cast , one member of the commission told the New York Times .
The vote was reversed when the story made national news .
Linda ( actress Linda Bove ) was the first regular deaf character on American television .
And today , Leela ( Nitya Vidyasagar ) is one of the only Hindu characters .
Much of the joyous nature of the show is due , of course , to late - puppeteer Jim Henson and his Muppet monsters .
( Cooney had insisted that either Henson create the puppets for the show , or no puppets be used at all . )
Initially , the humans and monsters were never supposed to interact –the “ street ” scenes were for humans only , while the monsters would appear in various skits or interspersed segments .
Child psychologists had advised the show that young children would be confused by the combination of the real world and Muppets .
But when producers tested early episodes , they found that children were fascinated by the monsters and utterly bored by the human scenes .
The decision was made to create Muppets to interact with the humans–and Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch were born .
Big Bird remains , in many ways , the heart of the show : a 4 - year - old trapped in an eight - foot - tall yellow - feathered body .
He has the innocence and wonder of a small child , and sometimes the confusion or sadness of one as well .
Other Muppets embody character foibles that are easily relatable –Oscar the Grouch ’s constant grumpiness , Bert ’s anal retentiveness , Telly ’s worrying , Grover ’s frustrated flailing .
As Davis notes ,
Considering that most Muppets start out as bath mats with appliqués , it ’s fairly miraculous that they seem to have more dimensionality to their personalities than do most human characters on TV … [ Henson ] understood that viewers would suspend their sense of disbelief if they saw pieces of themselves in the characters .
The show was also groundbreaking for the way that serious issues were tackled head - on .
Children ’s questions were always taken up in a way that was honest , thoughtful and without condescension .
Perhaps the most famous instance was the death in 1982 of actor Will Lee , who played shopkeeper Mr. Hooper –the most popular character on the show .
Lee was an amazing figure in his own right–an early proponent of Method acting and a member of the left - wing Worker ’s Laboratory Theater and the Theater of Action during the 1930s .
He was also a victim of the McCarthy blacklist after he refused to testify when called before the anti-communist House Un- American Activities Committee in 1948 .
After Lee ’s death , it was decided that a new actor would not be hired to replace him , Instead , the show dealt with his death on air , in a famously poignant episode [ 1 ] , that included the grown - ups explaining to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper would not ever be coming back , and that people die “ just because . ”
In other words , Mr. Hooper ’s death was explained in a way that 4 - year - olds could understand and grieve .
The show where Mr. Hooper ’s death was announced was scheduled for Thanksgiving , so that more parents would be at home with their kids , and was publicized so that parents could watch with kids and answer their questions .
Writers also made sure not to say that Mr. Hooper died in hospital , so that kids would n’t be scared of going to a hospital .
Since then , Sesame Street has tackled topics including the Iraq War ( furry red monster Elmo has a father who , in one special , spends “ lots and lots ” of days in Iraq before finally coming home ) ; adoption ( the Street ’s veterinarian Dr. Gina became a single mom when she adopted a baby boy from Guatemala ) ; and Hurricane Katrina ( a five - part series had Big Bird ’s nest destroyed by a hurricane and Muppets and people helping to rebuild it ) .
Part of what makes the Street special has always been its social conscience –teaching kids how to treat the people in their communities with love and respect , and to feel pride in themselves .
In one episode in 1971 , a then 30 - year - old Jesse Jackson led kids in reciting the spoken - word poem “ I am somebody ” [ 2 ] .
It included the lines : “ I may be poor , but I am somebody … I may be on welfare , but I am somebody / I may be small , but I am somebody . ”
Another classic from the 1970s captured the burgeoning women ’s movement .
“ Women Can Be ” [ 3 ] includes female Muppets singing about being daring surgeons , astronauts and lion tamers .

THE IMPORTANCE of the show extends far beyond the U.S.
It “ has arguably had an even greater impact overseas , especially in places like Kosovo and South Africa , where the show is made in partnership with local TV producers and tailored to local concerns , ” noted the New York Times .
In 2002 , Takalani Sesame , the South African version of the show–in which Bert speaks with a black South African accent and Ernie with a white one –debuted a Muppet named Kami , an orphan who was infected with HIV .
At the time , one in every nine South Africans was infected with HIV .
Yet people with AIDS still faced tremendous prejudice , and the government of Thabo Mbeki openly denied the value of medication to treat the virus .
“ We are living in a society that is very stigmatizing and discriminatory , ” said Musa Njoko , an AIDS activist , told the Associated Press when Kami was created .
The introduction of Kami “ is going to create a culture of acceptance . ”
In her first episode , Kami wanders onto Sesame Street , scared that no one will want to play with her .
But people and Muppets alike welcome her–and allow her to teach them about HIV .
“ They say they do n’t want to touch me because they think I ’ll make them sick , ” she explains to her new friends about why children at school refuse to play with her–a reality facing many South African children at the time .
Sometimes , political realities have forced the show make drastic changes .
Jointly produced segments that showed characters from the Palestinian show , Shara ’a Simsim , interacting with characters from the Israeli version , Rechov Sumsum , had to be scrapped after the Second Intifada , in part because of political difficulties over scenes of Palestinian and Israeli children interacting as part of everyday life .
Even the decision of where to show the characters meeting posed problems .
As New York Times reporter Samantha Shapiro detailed in a recent profile of the Palestinian show [ 4 ] :
[ T ]he Israelis were in favor of spontaneous Muppet drop - bys , but the Palestinians insisted the visits had to be by invitation only .
“ The only Israelis who come to Palestinian neighborhoods uninvited are settlers , ” [ executive director Daoud ] Kuttab explained to me .
The Israelis told me they were trying to emulate the philosophy of Sesame Street , to portray the world they wished for , more than the world that was …
For Kuttab , the Israeli idea that Palestinian and Israelis on the show would be best buddies who casually drop in on each other was absurd .
In real life , the Israeli production staff refused to travel to Ramallah even for informal visits –they feared for their safety–and many of the Palestinian crew did n’t have permits to enter Jerusalem .
Today , a new version of Shara ’a Simsim is in production .
According to the Sesame Workshop Web site [ 5 ] , the need for a new Palestinian version of the show is clear :
According to UNICEF research , children in nearly one - third of Palestinian families were experiencing anxiety , phobia , or depression as of June 2007 …
“ Hope comes in many forms , ” Kuttab says .
“ We believe that giving the children positive , wholesome programs that speak with their dialect , reflect their own communities , and deal with issues they face daily will give them a smile–and ultimately hope .
Although the show is careful to avoid direct references to political conflict , it consciously explores the trauma that Palestinian children experience through metaphorical avenues –showing the community working together to repair damage after a storm , for example .
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
AS THE New York Times noted , “ The show ’s original intent was to present enjoyable and beguiling preschool education to poor children who did not have access to decent preschools while bringing diversity to children ’s programming .
Sesame Street was n’t the only children ’s show with a social message …
But it was the mixture of whimsy , pop music and didactic rigor that distinguished Sesame Street from everything else . ”
But whimsy has enemies–and the show has , at times , run afoul of conservatives , often for absurd reasons .
In 1994 , for example a group of fundamentalist ministers accused Bert and Ernie of being gay , and PBS was forced to issue a statement that the two were just friends and roommates .
During the so - called “ Republican Revolution ” of the 1990s , Newt Gingrich waged a frontal assault on idea of publicly funded TV , declaring that PBS was “ this little sandbox for the rich . ”
He pushed to cut all federal funds to the network , and dismissing PBS supporters as “ a small group of elitists who want to tax all the American people so they get to spend the money . ”
The show is not without its weak spots .
Female Muppets tend to be less prominent on the show and extra-girly , like the pink fairy - in - training Abby Cadabby .
And anyone who ’s ever had to listen to a toddler play with “ YMCA Elmo , ” “ Chicken Dance Elmo ” or “ Tickle Me Elmo ” has surely wished a pox on the Sesame Street marketing machine .
There are also questions to be asked about the idea that young children should be guided toward learning a set curriculum that will prepare them for elementary school–rather than exploring learning in a less - structured and more self - selected way .
And it should go without saying that TV , even TV as good as Sesame Street , could never replace quality day care , preschools and teachers .
But Sesame Street has filled an important need for 40 years–and transformed the landscape of American TV while doing so .
After all , there would be no Dora , Diego , Blue ’s Clues or Wonderpets if not for the big yellow bird that came first .
As Michael Davis recently told the Dallas Morning News , when asked about the show ’s legacy , just try to imagine a world without Muppets .
“ I think it ’s all but impossible to do , but even if you can , what a sadder and drearier world that would have to be , ” Davis said .
“ It ’s not just an iconic piece of a past magical time ; it ’s still standing , growing , evolving .
Here ’s a show on a medium where things often do n’t last 40 minutes , and it ’s lasted 40 years and is still going strong . ”
The kingpin once responsible for sending more Colombian cocaine into the United States than anyone has been sentenced to 45 years in prison .
A federal judge in Miami also ordered 48 - year - old Diego Montoya Sánchez to pay $ 500,000 ( £ 301,000 ) in restitution today .
In August he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import cocaine , racketeering conspiracy and obstruction of justice .
Authorities say Montoya , known as " Don Diego , " headed the North Valley cocaine cartel from 1990 to 2004 .
In that time , the cartel exported 1.2 m pounds of cocaine worth $ 10bn .
Montoya said he started down the wrong path after his family abandoned him at age 14 .
He apologised to families of those killed by drug violence and said he now hopes to live " a life of peace and purpose " .
What they did n’t teach me in college ¶
Updated at the bottom of the post .
Warning :
This is a bit of a brain dump .
In the software industry there is a lot of back and forth about the value of a college degree .
This post wo n’t go into that too much , I just want to talk about the notable things that were left out of my Computer Science degree .
Mostly things that are used in the day to day environment outside of a university , but are n’t used extensively inside of them .
My degree was a more classical CS degree , which focused on algorithms and theory .
However , there was a decent bit of actual “ real world ” knowledge that they tried to impart .
After being at a real job for over a year , I think it is interesting to look back on what I was n’t taught .
Software testing ¶
In college , the concept of testing was basically ‘ compare your work against this expected output file ’ .
Sometimes that job was automated , other times it was n’t .
There was absolutely not concept of an automated test suite .
However , I think that this may be a limitation of the semester long class idea .
A lot of the value from testing comes from things that are real ( production , refactoring ) or looking back at code that you wrote a long time ago .
I have a lot more thoughts on this , and it deserves it ’s own post .
However , it was certainly a glaring part of what I do now that I had no experience with out of school .
Version Control ¶
In the classes that I took , we simply submitted the work to the teacher and that was that .
We did n’t check it into a repository , or even version the work we were doing locally .
At the time the whole DVCS movement was n’t quite as big , so I can imagine a lot more people doing local versioning now .
I think that the fact that viewing other students work is sometimes considered “ cheating ” ( which is silly ) , makes it difficult to have a shared repository for all students .
A big problem with universities is that knowledge the old mindset that sharing knowledge is cheating .
Luckily mine was a bit more enlightened , but I think having a shared repository of code would make this philosophy a bit too “ real ” .
Web development ¶
We had optional classes that offered PHP / MySQL based website making , but nothing in the curriculm about web development .
It seems that in this day and age , so much of what we do is centered around the internet that ignoring it in the classroom is silly .
That may be the fact that I now do web development , but I feel that someone coming out of a Computer Science degree not understanding the basics of Web Development is a bit silly .
The father scaled London 's High Court as part of his campaign A fathers ' rights activist who handcuffed himself to a government minister during an eight - year campaign has won equal access to his daughter .
Fathers 4 Justice campaigner Jonathan Stanesby , of south Devon , said he was " absolutely elated " now to have his daughter living with him half the time .
But he said " direct action " by fathers would continue if there was no " radical change " improving their rights .
He handcuffed himself to children 's minister Margaret Hodge in 2004 .
Mr Stanesby 's daughter now spends alternate weeks with her mother and him , with holiday periods also divided equally .
There seems to be a set pattern where a father sees their child alternate weekends - it 's almost like a break for the other parent
Jonathan Stanesby " I 'm absolutely elated , as you can probably imagine .
It just seems like a huge weight has just come off my shoulders , " he told BBC Radio 5 live 's Victoria Derbyshire show .
But he added that his eight - year fight had been a " devastating experience " .
Over the handcuffing stunt at a conference in Salford , Greater Manchester , he was cleared at trial of false imprisonment .
Jail term
But he was later found guilty of causing distress and alarm and jailed for two months , over a rooftop demonstration at the home of deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman .
His protests followed ministers ' refusal to discuss the issue of fathers ' rights with the campaign group , Mr Stanesby said .
" It 's quite clear that radical change is needed , " he said .
" In this country there seems to be a set pattern where a father sees their child alternate weekends - it 's almost like a break for the other parent .
" The non-resident parent in this country is set up to be the walking wallet . "
The government firmly believes that children should not be denied meaningful contact with their other parent , where this is safe
Ministry of Justice Mr Stanesby added : " Obviously I have got now a daughter to concentrate on .
" I want to see change - who knows what 's around the corner .
" Direct action obviously has to continue if no change is moving forward . "
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the well - being of children was " at the heart of the family justice system " .
" Where contact cases do come to court , the child 's welfare is always the paramount consideration , " he said .
" Clearly in some circumstances , such as where there is poor parenting or even abuse , contact can be very damaging .
" The government firmly believes that children should not be denied meaningful contact with their other parent , where this is safe . "

The call girl who says she spent the night with Italy 's prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , has claimed she became the target of a string of attacks and threats after releasing alleged recordings of their encounters .
In a book about her experiences to be published on Tuesday , Patrizia D'Addario adds a lesbian dimension to the allegations surrounding Italy 's billionaire leader .
The 42 - year - old said that after she made her allegations , a car tried to ram into hers on a road near her home town of Bari in the south of Italy .
She said that she had accelerated and lost control of her car .
" I found myself on the other side of the road , facing the wrong way .
It was only by a miracle that I survived , " she wrote in an extract from her book published today by a recently launched leftwing daily , Il Fatto Quotidiano .
D'Addario said she had also been the target of an attempted rape and received numerous menacing telephone calls .
In one the caller had threatened to abduct and rape her daughter .
Her mother had been punched in the face in the street .
In the latest incident , her flat had been broken into .
The thieves had taken much of her clothing , her diaries and her computer , but left behind a very expensive television set , she wrote .
The man who accompanied D'Addario to the prime minister 's home is under investigation in Bari on suspicion of drug trafficking and aiding and abetting prostitution .
Berlusconi is not a suspect in the inquiry and his lawyer has denied that the call - girl 's recordings are genuine .
The publication of D'Addario's book will divert public attention back to the affair after a period in which the focus had been on another sex scandal involving the former centre - left governor of the region around Rome .
Piero Marrazzo resigned after being filmed taking drugs and having sex with a transsexual .
Last week , a key figure in the affair , a transsexual Brazilian prostitute , was found dead in her flat in the capital .
Investigators are treating her death as murder .
D'Addario claims to have visited Berlusconi 's private residence in Rome twice last year .
On the first occasion , she said , the other guests at the dinner included two lesbians .
They " must be at home , " D'Addario writes .
" They kiss and stroke one another and address the prime minister in a very familiar way . "
This has political significance .
Many conservative Italians ready to forgive , if not endorse , heterosexual promiscuity will be disconcerted by a claim that their leader 's private life extends to lesbianism .
In her book , written with a leading Italian journalist , D'Addario says that the two women were among about 20 at the first party .
At one point , they were shown a political documentary including a sequence in which the anthem of the prime minister 's party ( " Meno male che Silvio c'e " , which translates roughly " Thank goodness for Silvio " ) was played .
" Everyone in the room began to sing and do the [ audience ] wave .
I looked on curiously and my first thought was that I was in a harem …
Being an escort , I reckon I have seen a good few things .
But I 'd missed out on this — 20 women for one man . "
Gradisca , Presidente .
By Patrizia D'Addario and Maddalena Tulanti .

We ’ve already seen one story today about athletes behaving badly being punished severely for their actions , with the Internet playing a starring role .
Here ’s another : Elizabeth Lambert , a soccer player for the University of New Mexico , has been suspended indefinitely for one of the more unsportsmanlike moves you ’ll ever see .
The video , which is nearing one million views on YouTube , features Lambert first punching an opponent in the back , and then later , pulling another down by her hair .
During the game , Lambert was only issued one yellow card .
The story is actually quite similar to that of Florida ’s Brandon Spikes eye gouging an opponent in a recent football game .
Although not a huge deal during the game itself , it was the reaction to the YouTube clip making its way around the Web afterwards that ultimately led to a harsher punishment .
Put simply : bad behavior on the playing field is going to get a lot harder to get away with when the eyes of YouTube are watching .

US President Barack Obama has said he will end the ban on gay people serving openly in the military .
He said he would repeal the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy that allows gay people to serve in the military if they do not reveal their sexual orientation .
Mr Obama was speaking to America 's largest gay group - the Human Rights Campaign - in Washington .
He had been criticised by some in the gay community for the lack of action on gay marriage and the military issue .
A big gay rights protest march is planned in Washington for Sunday .
Disquiet Mr Obama was addressing thousands of gay and lesbian people at a fundraising dinner in the US capital .
Do not doubt the direction we are heading and the destination we will reach
Barack Obama
Letting down gay supporters ?
He said the US had made progress on gay rights and would make more .
On the military issue he said the US could not afford to lose those people who had much needed skills for fighting .
" We should not be punishing patriotic Americans who have stepped forward to serve the country , " Mr Obama said .
" We should be celebrating their willingness to step forward and show such courage . "
Mr Obama did not give a timetable for repeal of the policy , passed by Congress in 1993 , under which thousands of service members have been discharged .
The US president has repeatedly pledged to tackle issues important to the gay community .
But he has faced criticism for what many in the gay community see as lack of action on his promises .
Mr Obama asked the audience to trust his administration .
" I appreciate that many of you do n't believe progress has come fast enough .
Do not doubt the direction we are heading and the destination we will reach , " he said .
One issue causing disquiet among the US gay community is the issue of gay marriage , the BBC's Rajesh Mirchandani in Los Angeles says .
Mr Obama has been criticised for not delivering on his promise to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act , which limits how local and federal bodies can recognise gay partnerships and determine benefits .
In his speech , Mr Obama did call on Congress to repeal the act and he also called for a law that would extend benefits to domestic partners .
In many places in America , gay people enjoy a high profile , economic and political clout , our correspondent says .

Unlike other spammers he was happy to talk to the media about his activities , but the ploy backfired in 2002 when his address was posted on the internet .
Hundreds of people signed him up for advertising mailing lists and free catalogues , prompting him to complain of harassment .

AP is reporting that President Barack Obama is declining to be rushed into committing to the Afghanistan War as an open - ended project , and wants a timetable for turning security duties over to the Afghanistan National Army .
AP says that the key intervention here came from US ambassador in Kabul , Lt. Gen .
Karl Eikenberry , who warned that the government of Hamid Karzai is not a reliable partner .
The BBC says that Eikenberry is against sending thousands of more troops , and he warned of corruption in the Karzai government .
Gen. Stanley McChrystal is said to be fuming over the intervention .
Eikenberry is a China specialist who can not only speak but interpret Chinese , who has a Stanford MA in international affairs , and who served two tours in Afghanistan under Bush .
His appointment as ambassador in Kabul had been a surprise , since the generals are not usually sent in as diplomats , and the US military was already well represented in US government counsels on Afghanistan .
But now it appears that Obama cleverly put Eikenberry in as chief diplomat precisely because he is worldly and experienced in the country , and in a position to second - guess the Washington war hawks who always think that a victory is around the corner with just a few more troops .
Obama is said to have rejected all the plans so far presented to him , insofar as none leads to a foreseeable end - game .
If AP is right , this development is encouraging .
All along , the things missing from Washington ’s plans for Afghanistan have been a firm , specific set of goals , a detailed means of attaining them , and a way to know when they have been attained .
How unlikely the big counter - insurgency dreams of some military analysts are to result in success is apparent in this recent Frontline report , in which the US military outpost in a village in Helmand never succeeds in getting the locals to open a single shop in the bazaar under US protection , and never succeeds in stopping the constant sniping at them by Taliban forces .
( The thing the program never brings up is kinship , and how likely it is that some of the villagers are just first cousins of the “ Taliban ” firing on US troops ) .
( Also at this site on Youtube in installments ; here is part 1 from that series :
Here is the beginning of an interview I did recently with Metro Times with a link to the full piece .
( Note there is a minor transcription error– I said 13 Federally Administered Tribal Areas , not 15 ) :
‘ Metro Times :
By most accounts , the debate in the White House right now is n’t over whether to escalate or de-escalate the war in Afghanistan , but rather over how many more troops to send there .
If you were talking to the president right now instead of us , what would you say to him ?
Juan Cole :
If you are going to accomplish anything in Afghanistan , you need a very light footprint .
MT : What would that footprint look like ?
Cole :
Let ’s back up and talk about what the goal is in Afghanistan .
Your strategy and your tactics are going to come out of your goal .
I ’m a little bit afraid that , in regard to the goal , you see a lot of mission creep .
The goal has become standing up an Afghan government and an Afghan military that ’s relatively stable and can control the country .
There ’s a lot of state - building involved in that .
I am a severe skeptic on this score .
I do n’t think that ’s a proper goal for the U.S. military .
I think we are dealing with a tribal society of people who , as a matter of course , are organized by clan and have feuds with each other , and feuds with other tribes , and feuds with their cousins .
I think that Washington misinterprets this feuding as Talibanism , and thinks that if you put a lot of troops in there , you can pacify the country and settle it down .
I just think it is a misreading of the character of the country .
Afghanistan is a country where localism is important , where people do n’t like the central government coming in and bothering them .
There ’s a sense in which the communist government of the 1980s , backed by the Soviet Union , wanted to drag Afghanistan kicking and screaming into the late 20th century , and to do that you had to impose central government policy on the countryside and on the villagers .
And the villagers rose up and kicked the Soviets and the communists out .
They were outraged , in part , against the centralizing tendency of Kabul .
So , I just think that Afghanistan is a country that needs a light touch .
You just have to accept that there ’s going to be a certain amount of disorder in the countryside as long as people are organized tribally .
And if you put 100,000 or 150,000 Western troops in there , that ’s just more people to feud with .
MT : Given all that , what do you think success in Afghanistan would entail ?
Cole :
If you are asking what I think is a plausible goal , I ’d say it is training an Afghan army and police force as best you can .
But you are just going to have to accept that it ’s going to be a weak government .
You can shore it up to some extent , but you need to shore it up behind the scenes .
It ca n’t be seen to be a puppet government , because that will undermine its legitimacy .
A government that can provide more services to people is good .
Road building is good .
Encouraging the markets to open is good .
But as far as fighting what the U.S. is calling Taliban , they are really just regional warlords .
They might have a tactical alliance with the old Taliban of Mullah Omar , but it ’s a mistake to sweep them all up into a single category . . . ‘

CLEVELAND , Ohio —
Extra troops have helped quiet the " war zone " that parents say surrounds the
.
Two 10th - grade boys suffered head injuries on Oct. 26 when a group of males attacked them two blocks from the former Harry E. Davis Junior High on Churchill Avenue .
Cleveland police have arrested a 17 - year - old boy and identified other suspects , said officer Nancy Dominik , a police spokeswoman .
Since then , by all accounts , added attention from school and city police , a " peace squad " from former pro football great Jim Brown 's Amer - I - Can group and parent volunteers have deterred further attacks .
The heightened security has left parents more at ease .
In fact , enrollment has risen slightly in recent weeks and now stands at 612 .
" Right now , everything is going smoothly , " said Michelle Rox , whose son , Cushon Crump is a 10th - grader at the school .
" A majority of parents are OK with the location as long as the kids are safe . "
Cushon , a visual - arts major , never gave a thought to transferring .
" I love CSA , CSA is still great , " he said .
" I do n't want to go to another school . "
The school , for the sixth through 12th grades , is to remain in the neighborhood around East 105th Street and Superior Avenue for three years while a new facility is built on its property in University Circle .
Parents have wondered why officials would plunk one of their few showcases -- it scored a top rating of excellent on its most recent state report card -- in such a perilous environment .
The district chose the closed junior high because it is big and only about 2 miles from University Circle .
Two school board members have suggested busing students until their new school , part of a systemwide building program , is finished .
Parents of students displaced from two neighborhood schools on the West Side made similar requests in August .
But administrators are sticking with state minimum standards for busing .
Children who attend their neighborhood elementary schools get service if they live more than 2 miles away ; for high school students , the distance has to be more than 3 miles .
Students who attend citywide draws like the Cleveland School of the Arts are on their own .
The two boys were attacked near East 105th Street and Superior Avenue , where arts students from across the city get on and off Greater Cleveland Regional Transportation buses .
Parents say RTA bus drivers used to add to the danger by driving past waiting students without stopping .
RTA could not corroborate the claim , said Flounsay Caver , the transit agency 's head of service quality .
But Principal Barbara Walton and Rox said drivers now stop faithfully .
Parents hope the extra police will stick around for the entire three years .
But district security chief Lester Fultz is promising to assign additional personnel only " until we are confident that we have removed the negative element . "
Fultz believes an adult presence will be enough to discourage most of the trouble .
He is hoping that parents and community volunteers will continue to fill that role .
" I just need them to be visible , to be willing to make a phone call if they see something , " Fultz said .
Members of the peace squad , dressed in black fatigues , have added the area around East 105th and Superior to a list of city hot spots they intermittently patrol .
Anti-violence activist James
Box was part of a contingent that kept watch on a recent Friday morning .
He was joined by two other men and a woman .
Box said the arts students , including his eighth - grade daughter , are naive and make easy prey for thugs who covet the kids ' iPods and other possessions .
The squad sees to it that students walk along East 105th and Churchill , avoiding secluded shortcuts .
" They do n't know where they are , " Box said .
" Our goal is to make these young people aware . "
The volunteer peace squad has asked neighborhood " shot callers " to allow the students safe passage , and the request seems to have been honored , Box said .
But he said the squad will patrol near the school when necessary over the next three years .
The attacks came just as Walton felt the staff and students were getting comfortable at Harry E. Davis .
The building is roomier and brighter than the facility in University Circle , and for the first time the school has a spacious auditorium where it can stage performances and assemblies .
Walton says she is grateful for the protection students are receiving outside the school .
" Hopefully , we can put this behind us and get on to educating Cleveland 's children , " she said .

An AT&T executive has asked employees to post opposition to net neutrality rules being considered by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on an FCC Web site using their personal e-mail addresses , prompting accusations of unfair advocacy by an opposing group .
The AT&T letter , sent this week by Jim Cicconi , senior executive vice president of external and legislative affairs , asks employees to go to OpenInternet.gov and use a personal e-mail address to join the discussion forum there .
The letter then gives five talking points that AT&T employees can use to argue against net neutrality in the days leading up to Thursday ’s FCC meeting , in which the agency is expected to take the first steps toward developing formal net neutrality rules .
The letter is a “ kind of astroturfing , ” the act of creating fake grassroots opposition to an issue , said Tim Karr , campaign director for Free Press , a media reform advocacy group and net neutrality supporter .
“ Coming from one of the company ’s most senior executives , it '’ hard to imagine AT&T employees thinking the memo was merely a suggestion , ” Karr said in a blog post .
The letter is asking AT&T workers to be “ sort of deceptive , ” Karr added in an interview .
“ He ’s asking them to regurgitate talking points that are at best debatable . ”
In particular , Karr pointed to a sentence in the memo saying that net neutrality rules would “ halt private investment in broadband infrastructure . ”
AT&T , as part of its conditions for merger with BellSouth in late 2006 , had to live with net neutrality rules for two years , and it continued to invest in broadband infrastructure , Karr said .
An AT&T spokesman dismissed Free Press ’ complaints , saying the organization and other net neutrality supporters carry on similar campaigns .
Free Press often asks its members to write letters of support or opposition on political issues , and in 2006 , eBay e-mailed its members asking them to contact their congressional representatives and voice support for net neutrality rules , noted Michael Balmoris , an AT&T spokesman .
There ’s “ no difference ” between those efforts and the AT&T letter , Balmoris added .
“ This was not a mandatory business request , ” he said .
“ We were providing important information to our employees , and it was up to them to respond personally .
If they use their company e-mail that is fine , too . ”
Karr disagreed , saying Free Press ’ campaigns come from voluntary members of the group .
“ One , we do n’t ask them to hide who they are , and two , they ’re not on our payroll , ” he said .
Despite the AT&T letter , many of the comments on OpenInternet.gov seem to support net neutrality rules .
In other net neutrality news , five pioneers involved in creating the Internet have joined the chorus expressing opinions on the issue to the FCC .
The letter is signed by Vint Cerf , Stephen Crocker , David Reed , Lauren Weinstein and Daniel Lynch , all of whom were involved in development of early Internet technologies , including ARPANET and TCP / IP .
“ As individuals who have worked on the Internet and its predecessors continuously beginning in the late 1960s , we are very concerned that access to the Internet be both open and robust , ” the letter said .
“ We believe that the existing Internet access landscape in the U.S. provides inadequate choices to discipline the market through facilities - based competition alone .
Your network neutrality proposals will help protect U.S. Internet users ' choices for and freedom to access all available Internet services , worldwide , while still providing for responsible network operation and management practices . ”
In recent days , 90 U.S. lawmakers , several minority groups and telecom - related companies including Cisco Systems and Nokia have expressed concern about new net neutrality regulations .
Every computer programmer has a copious pile of opinions about how their programming language of choice could be improved .
Who does n't want more syntactic sugar , better runtime performance , and faster compilation ?
That 's one of the reasons why there are so many programming languages .
Creating a compiler is practically a rite of passage for computer science students , and half of the top vendors in the software industry eventually make their own programming language or extend an existing one to the point where it 's marginally recognizable .
Despite the large amount of enthusiasm for language design , modern mainstream programming languages do n't fall far from the C tree .
The best that Microsoft , Sun , and Apple have to offer are just variations on that theme , with the addition of predictable object models and conveniences like garbage collection .
The slim minority of language geeks who have rebelled against bracist tyranny and stumbled over to innovative languages like Haskell and Erlang are doomed to toil in relative obscurity .
Are there any influential software vendors who have the vision and leverage to liberate the programming masses from the tiresome anachronisms of C's long legacy ?
When I learned that Google was going to announce a new programming language , I was hopeful that the search giant would bring something truly novel to the table .
They have n't , but the result is n't bad .
Although Google 's new
Go programming language is yet another take on object - oriented C , it 's got some nice features .
Go offers an expressive type system , fast compilation , good performance , and built - in language features that simplify threaded programming and concurrency .
The language has been under development for roughly two years .
It started out as a 20 percent project — time that Google 's engineers are given to use as they choose for undirected experimentation — and evolved into a serious full - time undertaking .
Google is releasing the source code under the BSD license with the hope that a community will emerge around the new programming language and participate in the effort to make it a compelling choice for software development .
We discussed the new programming language with Google engineer Rob Pike .
He says that the Go language itself and the current implementation are relatively mature , but it 's not quite ready for adoption in production environments .
The ecosystem around the programming language is still a work in progress .
There is no IDE integration , the standard libraries are a bit thin , and there are n't a whole lot of real - world code examples yet .
Opening up
Go to the broader programming community could help to vastly accelerate its advancement in all of those critical areas .
The native Go compilers , called 6g and 8g ( for 64 - bit and x86 ) , are designed to be extremely fast .
There is also an alternative compiler called Gccgo that is based on the GNU Compiler Collection ( GCC ) .
The GCC - based compiler is n't as fast but is said to generate more efficient code .
I was initially a bit surprised that Google chose not to use the Low - Level Virtual Machine ( LLVM ) compiler framework — it has a lot of LLVM expertise internally and is using it extensively for their awesome Python optimization effort .
Pike says that LLVM was considered during the early stages of the Go project , but its compile - time performance was judged to be inadequate .
The compiled executables are completely native binaries , so it 's not like a managed code language where the compiler generates bytecode for a virtual machine .
Go does , however , have some runtime components that get embedded in the executables .
Actual execution performance is said to be comparable to that of native C .
Some of Google 's sample
Go code reveals that the syntax is C - like and encourages a conventional imperative programming style .
There are functions , " for " loops , standard conditional expressions , and many other features that you 'd expect to find in a C - like language , but with a handful of nice twists .
For example , there is a shorthand syntax for variable assignment that supports simple type inference .
It also has anonymous function syntax that lets you use real closures .
There are some Python - like features too , including array slices and a map type with constructor syntax that looks like Python 's dictionary concept .
The following code snippet is an example from Google 's documentation :
func sum(a [ ] int ) int { // returns an int s := 0 ; for i := 0 ; i < len ( a ) ; i++ { s += a [ i ] } return s } s := sum ( & [ 3 ] int { 1,2,3} ) ; // a slice of the array is passed to sum
One of the distinguishing characteristics of Go is its unusual type system .
It eschews some typical object - oriented programming concepts such as inheritance .
You can define struct types and then create methods for operating on them .
You can also define interfaces , much like you can in Java .
In Go , however , you do n't manually specify which interface a class implements .
Pike explained to me that the interface mechanism gives developers some of the flexibility of duck - typing , but it goes further by providing the advantages of compile - time checking .
Parallelism is emphasized in Go 's design .
The language introduces the concept of " goroutines " which are executed concurrently .
Any function can be executed as a goroutine by prefixing the function call with the " go " keyword .
The language provides a " channel " mechanism that can be used to safely pass data in and out of goroutines .
Why create a new programming language from scratch ?
According to Pike , the developers behind the Go project felt that there was a need for a fresh start .
It was n't enough to just add features to existing programming languages , because sometimes you can get more in the long run by taking things away .
They wanted to start from scratch and rethink everything .
I 'm all for a clean break , but the C - like syntax seems to run counter to that goal .
He explained that Go is more radical than it looks , especially when you start to look closely at the power of its unusual type system .
Pike and his colleagues did n't want to deviate too much from what developers already knew because they wanted to avoid alienating Go 's target audience .
As a demonstration of the language , the developers have used it to build the Web server software that powers the project 's official website .
Aside from that ,
Go is n't used in production anywhere at Google yet .
It 's going to take time before it 's ready for more expansive use , but Google hopes that it will eventually provide a good alternative to the C++ the company uses extensively .

Im Sommer machte ein Brief Furore , den Hans - Dieter Wichter , der Pressesprecher der nordrhein - westfälischen Landesregierung , an „ Focus “ - Chefredakteur Helmut Markwort geschickt hatte .
Er beklagte sich darin , dass ein NRW - Sonderteil im „ Focus “ , den die Landesregierung durch Werbung unterstützt hatte , auch einen kritischen Bericht über die Zeitungsgruppe WAZ enthielt .
Der Brief [ pdf ] warf Fragen auf nach der Intelligenz des Regierungssprechers und seinem Verständnis von Pressefreiheit , aber auch , wie er überhaupt darauf kam , dass man sich beim „ Focus “ die gewünschte Berichterstattung durch Anzeigen erkaufen könne , was ja eine völlig aberwitzige Idee ist .
Und damit zu einem ganz anderen Thema .
Der aktuelle „ Focus “ enthält ein 28 - seitiges „ Focus - Spezial “ über digitale „ Innovationen , die unseren Alltag wirklich erleichtern “ :
Es handelt sich nicht um eine Werbebroschüre oder eine Anzeigensonderveröffentlichung : Das Impressum weist die „ Focus “ - Chefredakteure Helmut Markwort und Uli Baur als Chefredakteure auch dieses „ Spezials “ aus , verantwortlich für „ Konzept & Redaktion “ ist der langjährige „ Focus “ - Wirtschaftsredakteur Michael Franke , die Autoren sind „ Focus “ - Mitarbeiter .
Auf dem Titel steht allerdings der Hinweis :
Das ist eine grandiose Untertreibung .
Das gesamte
Heft ist eine einzige Werbeveranstaltung für Microsoft .
Mit einem Interview mit Microsoft - Deutschland - Chef Achim Berg , den die „ Focus “ - Redakteure als „ Marathon Mann “ und „ unermüdlichen Kämpfer “ preisen und ihm „ Freude an der Arbeit “ und „ Gute Ausdauer “ attestieren :
Mit einer ausführlichen Würdigung des tollen neuen Betriebssystems „ Windows 7 “ , die so verpackt ist :
Und einer doppelseitigen Vorstellung der tollen neuen Funktionen von Microsoft Office :
Die Aufmachergeschichte ist angeblich eine Reportage über eine „ total vernetzte Familie “ , die „ man “ „ plötzlich mit Super - Handys , Laptops und einem Großbild - Fernseher “ ausgestattet hat .
„ Man “ ?
Vor vier Wochen wurden sie von dem Software - Giganten Microsoft mit einer ganzen Ladung High Tech ausgerüstet : zwei Smartphones mit aktueller Software Windows Mobile 6.5 ( s. S. 7 ) , zwei Laptops mit dem neuen Betriebssystem Windows 7 sowie ein Flachbildschirm - TV , mit dem man nicht nur normal Fernsehen schauen kann , sondern sich abends beim Familientreff auch Fotosl , Filme oder Musik vom Laptop auf die MAttscheibe und Boxen bringen lässt ( … ) .
Marlon , 12 , ist indes sofort fasziniert .
Er sitzt gern am Computer und durchforstet die digitale Welt .
Gerade untersucht er Windows 7 ganz genau — an dem neuen großen Laptop mit dem drehbaren Bildschirm — und findet es gut , dass sich die Internet - Seiten viel schneller öffnen als früher : „ Ich kannte die Vorgänger - Software Vista , aber die war irgendwie langsamer “ , meint er ( www.windows7.de).
In der Rubrik „ Neue Ideen aus dem Web “ stellen die „ Focus “ - Leute ausschließlich Angebote des Microsoft - Portals MSN vor .
Unter der Überschrift „ Sicher surfen im Netz “ halten sich die „ Focus “ - Leute nur einen Satz lang mit den Virenscannern auf , die man verwenden sollte , ganz gleich , welchen Browser man benutzt ( „ ob Firefox , Safari oder den neuen Internet Explorer 8 “ ) — um sich dann den ganzen Rest des eineinhalb Seiten langen Artikels mit den tollen neuen Sicherheitseinstellungen des Internet Explorer und des Microsoft - eigenen tollen Viren - Scanners zu beschäftigen .
Und die Xbox 360 von Microsoft ist „ von einer Gamer - Box zur Multimedia - Zentrale für die ganze Familie “ geworden , weiß „ Focus “ , berichtet ausführlich und verlässt sich auf die zuverlässigen Einschätzungen von Microsoft - Leuten .
Produkte der Konkurrenz , seien es Google , Nintendo oder Apple , kommen in diesem Heft , das laut „ Focus “ „ Antworten “ auf die Frage nach der klugen Vernetzung von Handy , Laptop und PC geben soll , praktisch nur vor , um darauf zu verweisen , dass Microsoft jetzt mindestens genau so gut sei .
An keiner Stelle steht in dieser „ Focus - Spezial “ ein Wort wie „ Anzeige “ , „ Werbung “ oder „ Promotion “ .

Und Microsoft hat ’s getan .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York City health officials scrambled to explain themselves on Thursday in the wake of media reports about bankers who got scarce H1N1 flu vaccines through their employers .
Members of Congress fired off letters demanding immediate explanations and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminded state and city health officers of the need to make sure the most vulnerable people get shots first .
“ I am concerned that the distribution of the vaccine is resulting in favored treatment for the privileged , ” New Jersey Democratic Representative Frank Pallone said .
A shortage of H1N1 vaccines has frayed nerves , and public health departments across the country say they will not be able to meet the bulk of the demand until December or January .
The CDC estimates swine flu has infected more than five million people and it is documented as having killed 1,000 .
The federal government , which is buying the vaccines and distributing them for free to 62 state and city health departments , says 35.6 million doses have been made and packaged since production began .
Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd , a Democrat , released a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius saying he was “ stunned ” at the reports .
“ I implore you to use whatever authorities you have to ensure that H1N1 vaccines already distributed but not yet used are promptly redirected to hospitals , schools , community health clinics , school - based health clinics , and pediatricians so that they can be made immediately available to at - risk members of the public as identified by the Department , ” Dodd wrote .
CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden sent out a reminder to state and city health departments that distribute vaccine .
“ I ask each of you to review your plans immediately and work to ensure that the maximum number of doses is delivered to those at greatest risk as rapidly as possible , ” he wrote .
“ I especially appreciate the many innovative ways you ’ve found to reach them , including school - located vaccine clinics , special clinics for pregnant women , outreach to children with special needs , and making vaccine available to community - and faith - based organizations serving these high - risk populations . ”
Close to 160 million people are in the priority groups to get vaccine first -- healthcare workers , pregnant women , children and adults under 65 with medical conditions , caregivers for infants too young to be vaccinated and people 24 and younger .
“ When H1N1 vaccine first became available in the fall , we directed all available doses to pediatricians , OB - GYNs , community health centers , public and private hospitals , ” New York City health department spokeswoman Jessica Scaperotti said in a telephone interview .
“ As more vaccine became available we started to place small orders to providers that serve adults , including employee health centers . ”
She said the city had given 800,000 doses to about 1,100 providers , with Lenox Hill Hospital , for example , getting 1,200 doses and banking firm Goldman Sachs getting 200 of the 5,300 doses it asked for , Scaperotti said .
She said 16 of the city ’s 25 biggest employers had vaccine , including Columbia University , Citi Group and others , as well as the Federal Reserve Bank , which is not among the top 25 employers .
Morgan Stanley said it received 500 doses of the vaccine for its New York City locations and 500 doses for its Westchester location in suburban New York .
“ We never thought we would receive doses ahead of area hospitals and once this was brought to our attention , we promptly donated the doses we received to a few area hospitals , ” including Morgan Stanley Children ’s Hospital in New York , a company spokeswoman said .
When Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers set about adapting Where The Wild Things Are into a movie , Maurice Sendak encouraged them to take a free hand and change stuff .
But Eggers and Jonze tell us one change made Sendak nervous .

This feature definitely includes some spoilers for the movie version of Where The Wild Things Are , so if you wish to remain unspoiled for that film , you may want to stop reading here .
We were lucky enough to be among a few reporters who sat down with Jonze , who directed the film , and Eggers , who collaborated with Jonze on the screenplay adapation — plus Catherine Keener , who plays the mother of Max , the young boy who travels to a mysterious land of monsters and weird creatures , where everything is wild .
They talked about striving to be true to the book — and yet finding ways to transform a relatively short picture book into a full - length movie , with fully realized characters and a fleshed - out story .

Sendak 's one reservation
One major , significant change from the original book is the way Max enters the world of the Wild Things .
In the book , his bedroom transforms into a lush forest .
( " That very night in Max 's room a forest grew , and grew — and grew until his ceiling hung with vines and the walls became the world all around . " )
But in the movie , Max runs away from home , running down city streets and past dark parking lots , until he finds a waterfront with a boat , and then he sails to the world of the Wild Things .

Jonze and Eggers admitted that even though Sendak supported all their choices in the movie , this was the one choice Sendak kept coming back and questioning :
Jonze :
We thought that if we did this amazing sequence that Maurice had illustrated , of the bedroom turning into the forest , it would say that the whole thing was in his fantasy , and it did n't seem to be doing justice to what we were writing up to that point .
When I think about those four pages in the book , I vividly remember being captivated by them .
They seemed like magic to me .
Between the bedpost turning into the tree , and the wallpaper turning into leaves , the way the thing transformed was so captivating .
And Maurice was the one who said we need to make this our own , and that was something that it had to lose along the way .
Eggers :
And the funny anecdote was , Maurice was so supportive of every choice , and really understanding what it took to expand the book .
But this is the one thing he kept coming back and sort of saying , " Really ?
You really do n't want to [ do the original sequence ] ? "
Spike : [ Sendak kept saying ]
" You gotta make this your movie .
I totally understand .
But what about [ the bedroom scene ] ? "
And after we talked about it , he'd be like , " Oh good , you guys seem like you 're confident in what you 're doing with this . "
And then two weeks later , he'd be like , " I was thinking … "
But to his credit , he was n't coming at this thing as a protective artist , like " This is my thing .
Do n't fuck it up . "
It was sort of like he jumped off a cliff .
Once he decided he wanted us to do it , he gave it over to us entirely and said , " Make it your own .
The movie is not mine .
The book was mine 40 years ago .
But the movie is yours . "
He really lived by that .
And it made the movie what it was .
Without that , I do n't really think I would have been able to make the movie , go down the path .
I would have been too scared of making something that he did n't like .
But because of his sort of commitment to us making something personal , it let us do that .

What the Wild Things mean :
As in the book , the movie of Wild Things is sort of a dreamlike story where nothing feels quite real .
But because it 's a full - length movie and the monsters are much more fleshed out as characters , we get a much bigger story .
And to me , it felt like a parable about violence :
Max in the movie acts out more violently in the book ( he bites his mother ) , and when Max becomes king of the monsters , he incites them to start a play - war , which escalates until some of the monsters get seriously hurt .
The monsters are huge and powerful , but they never hurt each other until Max incites them to do so .
Advertisement
So I had to ask Jonze and Eggers if there was a message about violence here .
Jonze demurred : " I am loath to say what the movie is supposed to be about , or not supposed to be about , because it 's more interesting for it to have its own life . "
Just like the book means something different to everyone who reads it , the movie should likewise have its own personal significance to everyone who reads it .
Eggers agreed that he wants people to be able to take away their own interpretations from the movie : " That 's the beauty of a certain type of art , whether it 's poetry or picture books , or whatever : there 's a certain spareness that leaves some room for somebody to ... [ make their own meaning . ] "
Advertisement
But then Eggers added that there is a sense in which the violence in the movie is about fulfilling Max 's desires :
For a nine - year - old boy , a lot of this is wish - fulfillment , where you really get to act out .
There 's a little boy who might feel a little bit contained within the walls of his school or his home , but in a land without any boundaries or borders , he can act out his wildest fantasies .
And that includes a full - scale war with people at his beck and call .
And that 's why he says , " I know something that always cheers me up : A war . "
Which is the way boys think , or at least how I remember thinking .

In response to another question , Eggers said Jonze really resisted the idea that there would be any parallels between the Wild Things and the people in Max 's " real " life at home .
From " day one , " Jonze insisted , there should not be any direct correlation .
" It 's not going to be , ' This one 's the dad , this one 's the mom ... "
At the same time , you can definitely see that the different monsters correspond to different parts of Max 's personality , and because Max has an absent father at home ( more on that in a moment ) , he 's more drawn to Carol ( James Gandolfini ) , the big , fatherly monster .
" Spike did a great job of keeping it vague enough that it is n't tidy , " says Eggers .
" The book is n't tidy .
Childhood is n't tidy . "

And the land of the Wild Things in the movie shifts a lot depending on the scene — at times it 's almost a normal forest , and at others , it 's sort of surreal , with a giant dog wandering huge sand dunes , and weird owls that need to be hit with rocks to get their attention .
Jonze says this is meant to be " a place where everything is wild .
It 's emotionally wild , geographically wild , weather wise — anything can happen at any time .
It 's just trying to represent what it feels like to be nine .
That was sort of the goal of the movie ... to capture the feeling . "
The movie is definitely meant to be from the point of view of a nine - year - old , so the audience sees everything from that vantage point .
And Keener chimed in that the landscape is not unlike our myths of the Wild Wild West , where anything can happen .
" There are still places here that are dangerous to go . "

The Absent Father
Speaking of Keener , she plays Max 's mother , mostly in the sequences before he goes off to the land of the Wild Things .
And in the film , she 's clearly struggling to keep it together in the wake of a nasty divorce .
Advertisement
Keener said she was allowed to use her own imagination to come up with her character 's backstory —
" That 's kind of how Spike works " — and she imagined her ex-husband as being an absent guy , who does n't contribute as much as her character needs , financially and in other ways .
I thought he was wrong ... she 's just there with two kids , and working , and struggling with her job , and it's not going very well , and she 's probably way out of her depth on it , and wants to have sex and be loved and all that stuff , and it's hard with a couple of kids around who need you .
And it 's beyond her control to fullfill their needs as well , so everybody 's a little out of control in the movie .
Advertisement
Eggers says that when he first joined the project , Jonze had already decided that Max 's parents were divorced , even though the book does n't say one way or the other .
And the fact that world is out of control is key to Max 's experiences :
At home , there 's a man whom Max does n't approve of and does n't want there ( his mother 's new boyfriend . )
At school , we see the science teacher telling Max and the other kids that the sun will eventually die , but that the human race will probably be extinct by then .
Max 's sister , who used to be his friend , is no longer interested in him .
Max " ca n't control all these external factors , and can't control the turmoil inside of him , [ so ] all these external factors pop , and he runs away . "
Added Keener :
Everyone 's very fearful .
The mom is fearful that her boyfriend is going to be scared away , she 's fearful about paying for this house [ and ] raising her kids .
The daughetrer is fearful about her peers and being accepted .
And Max is fearful that everything is going , everything is falling apart .
And he just ends up going out and slaying that dragon , he goes off on his adventure and he becomes at peace with it and less afraid and [ more ] successful as a result of it .
When kids are fearful growing up , they are less successful in life .

The wonder of James Gandolfini
Advertisement
Everybody was full of praise for Gandolfini , who plays what Jonze calls the " most essential " of the monsters , the huge tusked Carol .
This character needed " his kind of presence and his kind of vulnerability , and his emotions are right under the surface , " adds Jonze .
Eggers described Gandolfini coming in for the first day of voice recording , wearing an enormous wide - striped shirt and looking way more imposing and intimidating than he does on The Sopranos .
" He was Carol from the first time walked in , and all the other creatures — the other actors — assumed a subservient role ...
He 's such a powerful actor . "

Crafting the storyline
Eggers and Jonze also talked about the difficult process of turning a short storybook into a full length movie .
Eggers had never worked on a screenplay before , and he did n't have any software .
He and Jonze wrote the first draft in Microsoft Word , adding tabs and capitals themselves .
Jonze kept getting easily distracted and wanting to go to the store or watch Youtube videos , so Eggers was more of a task - master , keeping him in focus .

The big thing was figuring out who the Wild Things really are and what they want .
" That 's how you grow a 12 - page picture book into a movie , " said Eggers .
" Not by applying a quest on top of it , like a Golden Chalice , but he gets there and has to learn about who they are . "
Pitting conservative purists against party pragmatists , a growing number of national Republican figures are bucking the party standard and backing a third - party candidate in November 's special election in upstate New York ’s 23rd congressional district .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version mischaracterized this contest as the only congressional election this fall .
There is another in California 's 10th congressional district . ]
Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , former Senator Rick Santorum , former House Majority Leader Dick Armey , current Minnesota Rep. Michelle Bachmann , former Tennessee Senator and presidential candidate Fred Thompson , and former presidential candidate Steve Forbes have all backed Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman over Republican Dede Scozzafava .
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty – a potential presidential candidate in 2012 – suggested Friday on ABC News that he ’s strongly considering backing Hoffman , as well .
“ Our nation is at a crossroads , and this is once again a time for choosing , ” Ms. Palin , author of the upcoming book , “ Going Rogue , ” wrote Thursday on her Facebook page .
“ This is the game - changer , ” added Dick Armey , whose Freedom Works organization has supported the Tea Party movement .
Palin , et al. represent what can only be called the Tea Party insurgency , whose adherents point to mainstream Republicans – including party philosopher Newt Gingrich – and their support of Ms. Scozzafava as another sign that the GOP has strayed from its core principles .
Taken together , it means that NY - 23 is one of the first real test of voter attitudes 10 months into the Obama presidency .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version overstated the sole importance of the contest in New York . ]
National Republican figures taking a stand against the Washington wing of the party means two things : Conservatives are now willing to take bold political chances in order to move the party toward purer party principles like small government and lower taxes .
But it could also backfire : A Ross Perot - like split of NY - 23 could mean the district going to a Democrat , Bill Owens , for the first time in over 100 years .
The White House could hardly have anticipated that fortuitous scenario when picking former NY - 23 Congressman John McHugh for a Pentagon post , the move that set up November ’s congressional election .
[ Editor 's note :
This sentence was amended to take note of another congressional race this fall . ]
“ This week ’s surge of leading conservatives to Hoffman ’s camp is a troubling sign for [ Scozzafava ’s ] campaign and the national GOP establishment since several of the recent Hoffman endorsers have significant followings and represent the most energetic part of the Republican base , ” writes Andy Barr at the Fredericksburg , Va. , Free Lance - Star .
Ms. Scozzafava is a moderate - to - liberal Republican , a long - time state legislator who supports gay marriage and abortion rights .
Her Democratic opponent , Mr. Owens , leads in the polls as Hoffman , a wealthy upstate businessman , has pulled about 23 percent of the vote , and is gaining fast .
Critics say the battle for Oswego is typical of the fringe politics that are driving the GOP right now .
Chris Kelly at the Huffington Post writes that Hoffman “ has n’t just been anointed by a political machine .
He ’s been kidnapped by drifters . ”
And the image of two GOP stalwarts – Armey and Gingrich – lining up on opposite sides of this election underscores the import of the fight .
“ The specter of two generals of the 1994 Republican revolution , Gingrich and Armey , taking opposing positions highlights the philosophical divide within the GOP between purists and pragmatists , ” writes the Wall Street Journal ’s Naftali Bendavid on Friday .
But while big - name GOP stars line up their support , the real story of NY - 23 is as a test for whether the much - discussed Tea Party movement from this summer and fall can translate into actual political power – i.e. , getting someone elected .
The blogosphere has lit up with “ anti- Dede ” sites , only exacerbating Ms. Scozzafava ’s political problems .
Her financial fortunes are also lagging as she ’s being outspent on the campaign trail while her own family business is in trouble .
Meanwhile , Tea Party volunteers are reportedly pouring into Hoffman ’s campaign office to help canvas the Oswego area .
“ They ’re making New York 23 a last stand , ” blogger Erick Erickson tells Politico .
“ New York should be a hill to die on for conservative activists . ”

GHC bug sweep
The last bugsweep was performed by thomie in the fall of 2014 .
In the tradition of the Ubuntu 5 - a - day , the GHC Bug Sweep is a scheme in a similar vein .
The main aim is simple : we want to make sure that no ticket is forgotten .
So , what we plan to do is to look at every ticket in the database in sequence , starting from the oldest , and try to make some progress on the ticket .
In this way we 'll ensure that we keep the amount of cruft in the ticket database down to a minimum , keep the database healthy , and keep everything moving .
The bug sweep is a way that virtually anyone can contribute to GHC , in as small or large a way as you like .
Whenever you have a spare minute or two , claim a ticket and look at it ( see below for how to claim a ticket ) .
You do n't necessarily have to fix the bug or implement the feature : all you have to do is make some progress on the ticket .
Here are some things to check :
All tickets :
Check for duplicates ( Google search with " site:gitlab.haskell.org " may be better than GitLab 's search )
Tidy up the description : add markup if necessary , link to related information and / or other tickets Check that the ticket is categorised correctly , including the title is a good summary of the bug platform / OS are correct component is correct it is on the correct milestone ( developers only ) the " difficulty " is a reasonable estimate ( developers only )
If the ticket has a patch ( developers only ) review the patch if it looks ready to go , add a comment to the ticket to say so .
Bugs :
Check that the bug has n't already been fixed .

He ought to be the undisputed patron saint of atheism .
I can write in letters which make even the blind see .
I call Christianity the one great curse , the one great intrinsic depravity , the one great instinct for revenge for which no expedient is sufficiently poisonous , secret , subterranean , petty .
I call it the one immortal blemish of mankind .
Yet for all this , Friedrich Nietzsche is woefully underappreciated by the fashionistas of contemporary media atheism .
Despite his huge philosophical reputation and widespread influence , Nietzsche makes an uncomfortable ally for the Dawkins brigade .
He will not stand in line behind received opinions .
He wo n't nod along with the reduction thinking to some narrow empiricism .
And , worst of all , he does Christianity the compliment of first seeking to understand it .
But if he makes no new friends amongst trendy unbelievers , he is ignored completely by the vast majority of the righteous .
For his is a challenge that few Christians are prepared for .
Nietzsche does not claim that the primary sin of religion is that it has an imaginary object at its centre .
His insults – and he is the great master of the insult – rise way above the flying spaghetti monster jibe .
Indeed , he is remarkably indifferent to the question of God 's existence .
Rather , Nietzsche thinks religion in general , and Christianity in particular , is a corruption of the human spirit .
Even if it were all true , he would be against it .
In essence he thinks Christianity is wickedness – though he would n't put it quite that way because he argues that it is precisely concepts like wickedness that are the source of the problem .
And here is one of the big ideas in his On the Genealogy of Morals ( OGM ) that I shall be exploring in the following weeks .
It ought to be said , Nietzsche would have hated almost everything about the project of blogging his great work .
He would have hated the democratising everybody - has - their - say power of the Internet .
He would have hated the left - leaning politics of the Guardian .
He would have hated the idea that I , as a Christian priest , was presuming to interpret his words .
As he warned :
The greatest haters in world history , and the most intelligent , have always been the priests : - nobody else 's intelligence stands a chance against the intelligence of priestly revenge .
( OGM I:7 )
And he did n't have too much time for the English either .
All of which should give the reader the highest degree of suspicion about my line on things – which is precisely the way Nietzsche would have wanted it .
After all , as the philosopher Paul Ricoeur famously put it , he was one of the three great " masters of suspicion " ( the others being Marx and Freud ) .
One other note .
Perhaps the most tiresome thing about Nietzsche is that he has groupies , those who hang on his every word as if he were re-writing holy writ .
" May your name be holy to future generations " said his friend Peter Gast at Nietzsche 's funeral .
This deification of Nietzsche often takes the form of obsessing about the details and minute nuances of interpretation – just like evangelical Bible study at its very worst .
In contrast , my interest is not in offering a definitive reading of the text , or in undertaking anything academic , but to use a more journalistic style as a springboard for some of the great questions that Nietzsche explores :
Where does morality come from ?
Is Christianity a religion of hatred ?
Is Christian morality the revenge of the weak against the strong ?
What is the purpose of asceticism ?
Are priests the great manipulators ?
So what , then , about Nietzsche himself ?
It 's no surprise he grew up a terribly pious little boy .
His father , a Lutheran clergyman , died when Friedrich was only five .
His mother wanted him to grow up just like his dad .
It was a role he played throughout his early years .
Kids at school teased him for being the " little pastor " .
At that time he was writing some of the most cringe making evangelical poetry one could ever imagine .
You have called ,
Lord , I rush
With circumspection
To the steps of your throne .
Glowing with love ,
Your glance shines into
My heart so dearly ,
So painfully :
Lord , I come .
All this piety continued to the first year at university , where he won the preaching prize , after which he lost his faith .
From then on in , Christianity was the enemy .
What is important to note about this childhood is that it orientates Nietzsche so very differently towards the whole question of God than , for example , the way that most modern atheists tend to approach things .
Contemporary popular atheism follows philosophers like David Hume in presuming that the most fundamental question to address is whether or not God exists .
It is the stark simplicity of this question that gives much of the debate between believers and non-believers is boo / hurrah quality .
It is this binary approach that makes religious culture wars so dull and so fractious .
The religion that Nietzsche was brought up with starts somewhere else entirely .
The first question is not so much " Does God exist ? " but rather , something like " How are we saved ? " .
Christianity is n't dodgy philosophy but , as it were , corrupt existentialism .
In short , Nietzsche sets out to save people from the idea that they stand in need of salvation .
And this means that he is not just against God , but against anything political , moral , environmental , etc that offers itself for the salvation of human beings .
The paradox of Nietzsche 's work is that he too is offering a narrative of salvation – salvation from salvation itself .
So much for the preliminaries and scene setting .
Next week we will dive into the text .
My aim in all of this is get Nietzsche to lead us into a rather different conversation about faith than the rather sterile one that we have been having for some years .
As a Christian , I have always found Nietzsche a very effective astringent against false or lazy faith .
I hope that unbelievers can use him in just the same way too .
For Nietzsche offers self critical vigilance for all .

Stocks For Cancer's Cure
Cancer kills over a half million Americans a year .
The disease has touched almost everyone , whether family , friend or someone else in our community who ’s been diagnosed .
But there are a number of companies on the frontlines of treatment , fighting to find a cure for or , in the very least , extend the lives of those who suffer from cancer .
As much as the work is noble , cancer drugs are big business .

Cancer kills over a half million Americans a year .
The disease has touched almost everyone , whether family , friend or someone else in our community who ’s been diagnosed .
But there are a number of companies on the frontlines of treatment , fighting to find a cure for or , in the very least , extend the lives of those who suffer from cancer .
As much as the work is noble , cancer drugs are big business .
And the stocks of these firms , Cramer says , can be very attractive investment opportunities .
Not only do they offer the potential for tremendous growth as new treatments are approved and multiple indications – industry jargon for a drug ’s ability to treat more than one kind of cancer – are found , they ’re also so - called safety stocks , meaning they work during the kinds of downturns we ’ve seen over the past two years .
So who are the best ?
Cramer did the research and found eight stocks that lead the pack .
Read on to get his top picks .
Bristol - Myers Squibb ( BMY )
A smart acquisition strategy has made Bristol - Meyers , which has bought seven companies since October 2007 , a big player in the cancer - treatment industry .
Its purchase of Medarex in July added a key drug for metastic melanoma that ’s in Phase III trials .
The drug has possible multiple indications – industry jargon for its ability to treat more than one condition – for lung and prostate cancer .
But BMY also sells Erbitux for colorectal , head and neck cancer , Ixempra for breast cancer , Taxol for brea

Its purchase of Medarex in July added a key drug for metastic melanoma that ’s in Phase III trials .
The drug has possible multiple indications – industry jargon for its ability to treat more than one condition – for lung and prostate cancer .
But BMY also sells Erbitux for colorectal , head and neck cancer , Ixempra for breast cancer , Taxol for breast , lung and ovarian cancer , and Sprycel for Leukemia .
Sprycel specifically represents a potentially great opportunity , Cramer said , as its sales jumped 40 % year - over - year and it ’s being tested for its viability in treating prostate and breast cancers .
Cramer also likes BMY ’s 5.6 % dividend yield .

Pfizer ( PFE )
Pfizer , too , used the M&A market to boost its stable of drugs .
The company ’s oncology division accounted for just 5 % of 2008 sales , but the acquisition of Wyeth will change that .
In fact , Cramer said , Pfizer is now “ one of the most diversified health - care players out there . ”
The stock offers a 3.8 % dividend yield as well .
What about treatments ?
Pfizer has 22 cancer drugs , the top performers being Aromasin for breast cancer , Camptoar for colorectal cancer and Sutent , a small molecule drug that inh

What about treatments ?
Pfizer has 22 cancer drugs , the top performers being Aromasin for breast cancer , Camptoar for colorectal cancer and Sutent , a small molecule drug that inhibits the flow of blood to tumors .
Cramer noted Sutent as Pfizer ’s biggest opportunity , saying that last quarter ’s sales came in above expectations and growth in the future could come from ongoing treatment of kidney , lung , liver and prostate cancer .
The drug has suffered a few setbacks , but there are still six Phase III trials in Sutent that have yet to report , meaning this could be a “ major blockbuster cancer drug ” with multiple indications .

Celgene ( CELG )
Celgene ’s biggest drug , Revlimid , which pulled in $ 1.3 billion in sales in 2008 , treats multiple myeloma , a cancer of the plasma cells in bone marrow , in patients who have already received one prior therapy and myelodysplastic syndromes , or MDS , another kind of blood cancer .
But the indications may not end there .
Revlimid is still being evaluated in a number of clinical trials as a treatment for other blood cancers as well .

But the indications may not end there .
Revlimid is still being evaluated in a number of clinical trials as a treatment for other blood cancers as well .
The company sells other drugs as well – Thalomid for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and Vidaza , a chemotherapy agent for treating MDS – and CELG is cheap .
But Cramer does n’t want investors buying yet .
Better to wait until just before the annual American Society of Hematology meeting on Dec. 5 , where Celgene is expected to present “ some terrific Revlimid data . ”
Get Cramer ’s full analysis of Celgene right here .
Immunogen ( IMGN )
Immunogen was a high - flying stock back in 2000 , when the rest of the Nasdaq was soaring , but some disappointing clinical trials brought the stack back down to earth .
Cramer thinks the IMGN might be ready again for takeoff , thanks to T - DM1 , a breast - cancer drug in Phase II trials that the company is developing in partnership with Roche / Genetech .
Cramer called T - DM1 “ a better version of Herceptin , ” the $ 4 billion drug from Genetech that ’s become the standard of care for treating breast cancer .

Cramer called T - DM1 “ a better version of Herceptin , ” the $ 4 billion drug from Genetech that ’s become the standard of care for treating breast cancer .
What ’s better , though , is that T - DM1 could work in cases where Herceptin does n’t , and the former could replace the latter entirely .
Phase II results for T - DM1 will be released on Dec. 12 .
If they ’re good , Cramer said , “ Immunogen will be up gigantically . ”

Allos Therapeutics ( ALTH )
Allos
Therepeutics plans to trade launch Folotyn , a drug for refractory peripheral T - cell lymphoma , to physicians at the American Society of Hematology on Dec. 5 , Cramer said , and the meeting could be “ a big catalyst ” for the stock .
The company also is developing Folotyn for multiple indications , “ the jackpot when it comes to cancer research , ” including CTCL , a rare form of non-Hodgkins lymphoma and lung cancer .
Additional data on the trials is due out later this year and in the first half of 201

Cramer called ALTH “ a very cheap stock , ” saying it “ should go higher ” once Fotolyn hits the commercial market in January .
Watch Cramer ’s interview with Allos Therapeutics CEO Paul Berns .
Dendreon ( DNDN )
Dendreon makes a great acquisition target for a company like Bristol - Myers Squibb or Merck , which is looking to build its oncology division .
If the FDA approves Provenge , Dendreon ’s prostate - cancer drug , which is in late - state development , the drug should reach the commercial market by mid-2010 .
Sales are expected to reach as reach as high as $ 730 million in 2011 and maybe more than $ 4 billion in 2020 .
Provenge is n’t Dendreon ’s only cancer franchise , but right now it ’s the most important .

So the stock almost lives and dies based on FDA ’s blessing .
DNDN is up 507 % year - to - date thanks to the positive clinical - trial data released so far , Cramer said , and “ it could go even higher ” if the feds give it a thumbs - up .

Onyx Pharmaceuticals ( ONXX )
Cramer said that Onyx Pharma is a potential takeover target as well , possibly by Bayer , its development partner for Nexavar .
The drug , which is used to fight kidney and liver cancer , brought in $ 678 million in sales for 2008 , and last quarter earned $ 229 million , which was up 27 % year - over - year .
Plus , Nexavar is being tested for other indications , namely in breast and thyroid cancer , so there ’s the potential for even bigger profits down the line .

Plus , Nexavar is being tested for other indications , namely in breast and thyroid cancer , so there ’s the potential for even bigger profits down the line .
When Nexavar was approved for liver cancer in November 2007 , Onyx ’s share price hit a high of $ 60.02 .
But now it ’s down to $ 26.57 , just $ 4 above the 52 - week low .
The stock ’s down 22 % year - to - date , Cramer said , making it “ pretty cheap . ”
He said ONXX works as a speculation play as well , though its recent better - than - expected quarter means it carries less risk than Dendreon .

Exelixis ( EXEL )
Continuing with the takeover theme , Cramer recommended Exelixis as his final play on the war against cancer .
Larger pharmaceutical companies often buy their smaller partners , and Exelixis is working with a number of the industry ’s biggest names : Bristol - Myers Squibb , GlaxoSmithKline , Roche / Genentech and Sanofi -Aventis .
The company ’s potentially big drug , XL184 , is a joint venture with Bristol - Myers .
XL184 is intended to help stop tumor growth , but Exelixis is shooting for multiple indications , su
Aggressive moves by China , South Korea and Gulf states to buy vast tracts of agricultural land in sub-Saharan Africa could soon be limited by a new global international protocol .
A scramble for African farmland has in recent years seen the equivalent of Italy 's entire arable land hoovered up by businesses from emerging economies .
The Food and Agriculture Organisation , the UN Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the World Bank are now discussing a new code of conduct for land buyers in Africa .
Amid increasing concerns over food security , it could include ensuring consent is given prior to selling land from local people as well as ensuring smallholders do not lose out .
A first draft is expected to be released next spring .
Alex Wijeratna , Action Aid 's food rights campaign officer , said : " There 's a new scramble for land in Africa .
It 's growing at an incredible rate .
There 's massive secrecy , poor communities can't get information and they 're not being consulted .
There 's an argument for a moratorium on sales until there 's a proper framework to assess them .
We are concerned that an agreement will not come fast enough . "
Earlier this year , legendary hedge fund speculator George Soros highlighted a new farmland buying frenzy caused by growing population , scarce water supplies and climate change .
South Korea bought huge areas of Madagasca recently while Chinese interests bought up large swathes of Senegal to supply it with sesame .
He said : " I 'm convinced that farmland is going to be one of the best investments of our time .
Eventually , of course , food prices will get high enough that the market probably will be flooded with supply through development of new land or technology or both , and the bull market will end .
But that 's a long ways away yet . "
However , Dr Kanayo Nwanze , president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development , said the issue of land deals had been " overexaggerated " .
As investors pile into African land , today saw further appetite for business opportunities in the continent with the launch of a new $ 400 m ( £ 245 m ) sub-Saharan private equity fund focusing on small to mid-market companies .
Aureos Capital 's Africa Fund has already raised $ 322.8 m , a quarter of which has come from financial institutions including European pension funds .
It is expected to close fundraising at the end of the year .
The fund is the largest private equity vehicle targeting smaller African businesses .
Investors , it claims , will receive returns in excess of 20 % .
Management fees are 0.25 % higher than the industry standard 2 % because of the large number of investment professionals it is deploying in Africa to identify suitable opportunities .
Sev Vettivetpillai , chief executive of Aureos Advisers , said : " It 's 18 months since we started the fund and it's not easy to raise over $ 300 m for Africa as most investors were pulling out of financial markets .
It posed a challenge to Aureos .
But Africa is the next frontier market that is going to benefit from emerging market flows . "
The fund has already spent $ 106 m on nine businesses in financial services , building products , real estate development and agriculture .
Only weeks after Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves came out last month , Naughty Dog announced that additional content would be provided before the end of the year .
The most surprising part of the announcement is that Naughty Dog ensured that some of the DLC would be provided for free .
Tens of thousands of competitive and casual Uncharted 2 online players have been giving feedback and judging by a new announcement today , it looks like Naughty Dog has listened .
Naughty
Dog have officially announced free additional content coming to Uncharted 2 ’s multiplayer within the next few days .
First , a new map titled “ The Fort ” is going to be released which will be available for both competitive playlists and arena playlists .
The Fort is a map that is based on the Fortress chapter of the first Uncharted title and features lots of tunnels and cover .
Secondly , Naughty Dog have announced that detailed leaderboards and a player card are coming to Uncharted 2 ’s multiplayer .
The leaderboards will feature all of the important stats including wins , kills , money and more .
The ability to compare with friends or look at the top players is all going to be available at launch .
The player card will detail all of a player ’s stats including money , level and booster setup .
These additions look to really improve the game on all fronts , and players who might have fallen out of the online will definitely have a reason to go back .
This additional content will become available within the next few days .

( CNN ) -- The Natural Edges Salon in Dallas , Texas , is a rowdy barbershop where black men gather to loudly talk smack , politics and sports .
But on one wintry November morning last year , the men suddenly stopped talking .
Someone turned the radio off , and the barbers ' clippers stopping humming .
A man had just challenged the customers ' manhood .
The man was President - elect Obama .
He was giving a televised speech challenging men to get involved in their communities .
The men had heard the message before , but this time they could relate to the messenger .
Obama had shared their struggles -- raised by a single mom , never really knowing his father -- but had never used his struggles as an excuse .
Nor could they anymore , some of the men decided .
Seven joined Big Brothers Big Sisters of America that morning , barber Michael Johnson says .
One of them was Johnson , who says he grew up without his father but was saved by the friendship of an older man .
iReporter : ' Obama has helped me as a father '
" I just said , ' You know what , I can do this today instead of tomorrow , ' " Johnson said . ''
' Tomorrow may be too late .
I can save a young man 's life today . ' "
As the nation approaches the first anniversary of Obama 's election , the glow of Obama 's ascendancy may be fading .
But it 's still burning bright for some black men .
Inspired by Obama , a growing number of black men across the nation have decided to become mentors and pledged to become better fathers , community leaders say .
iReporter : ' I 'm a good baby daddy '
" I 've never seen anything like it , " said David Miller , co-founder of the Urban Leadership Institute in Baltimore , Maryland , a group that works with other civic groups to mentor black and Latino boys .
" I have seen a renewed sense of hope and optimism that 's unprecedented , " Miller said .
" I was at the point where I was starting to give up . "
How black men are stepping up their game
It could be easy to overstate Obama 's impact on black men .
Some say they see no change in black men's conduct since Obama was elected .
And few would say that a black man sitting in the Oval Office is going to wipe out the challenges black men have faced for generations .
But black leaders say something across the nation seems to be stirring .
Three of the nation 's largest black fraternities have formed a partnership with Big Brothers Big Sisters of America .
The fraternities -- Omega Psi Phi , Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi -- are holding a summit in Atlanta , Georgia , in December to decide how to recruit more black men as mentors .
The number of black men volunteering at Big Brothers Big Sisters has increased .
About 800 more African - American men have become big brothers since Obama 's election , compared with the same time last year , a group spokeswoman says .
Although they did n't reach their goal , a record number of black men -- 650,000 -- participated this year in an annual Million Father March .
The nationwide march was organized by the Black Star Project , a nonprofit group based in Chicago , Illinois .
A foundation headed by billionaire George Soros , an Obama supporter , is investing $ 15 million in a three - year campaign to help black men .
Soros ' Open Society Institute designed the Campaign for Black Male Achievement to improve the lives of black men and boys by offering grants to groups across the country .
Numbers tell some of the story , but Obama 's biggest impact on black men might be psychological , Miller says .
" I use Obama as a sort of an unofficial national spokesman when I talk to men about responsible fatherhood , " Miller said .
" I show black men multiple images of Obama with his children and his wife .
Even with the criminals and the thugs , they get excited . "
Black men still need to step up , say some who work closer to the issue .
iReporter : ' Obama a testament to evolving white America '
At the Atlanta chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters , Rita Owens , the vice president of development , says she has n't seen any more black men volunteer since Obama was elected .
" We ca n't see any influx of black men volunteers , " she said .
" We do not have enough black men stepping up .
We have more Caucasian men stepping up . "
And Karen Mathis , president and CEO of Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America , says the need for black men is still urgent .
She says that about 40 percent of the boys waiting to be matched in the program are black .
But only 15 percent of the mentors are black men , she says .
A legacy of mentoring for three generations
Perhaps Obama 's effect on black men can't ultimately be measured by numbers but by mentoring relationships that often take years to nurture .
When Johnson , the Dallas barber , decided after hearing Obama 's speech that he wanted to be a big brother , someone was there to sign him up .
The Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity had dispatched volunteers to Johnson 's barbershop to sign up black men as big brothers that day .
But Johnson also had an example from his own life to inspire him .
He was mentored since he was 9 years old by one of the men responsible for forging the partnership between black fraternities and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America .
That man is Dale H. Long , national chairman for Alpha 's partnership with Big Brothers Big Sisters of America Partnership .
Johnson made
Long the best man at his wedding when his own father declined to attend .
" I wanted to give back just like Dale took time out of his life to give back , " Johnson said .
" [ Long ] had a family , but he chose to be a big brother to me . "
Long said , " Obama ca n't do it by himself . "
He decided to " step up my game " even more after Obama was elected .
" In order to be a man , our boys have to see men , " Long said .
And be encouraged by men as well .
When Long learned that his former little brother , Johnson , had decided to be a big brother , he drove to Dallas to make sure he was at Johnson 's side when he signed up .
" I was just thrilled beyond belief , " Long said .
" That let me know that I was of some kind of value to him . "
Now Johnson is passing it on .
He spends each week with Kedrick Howt , an 11 - year - old Dallas boy .
They go to movies , play basketball and talk about growing up without his father .
" I can almost picture myself when I was his age , going through what he 's going through , " Johnson said .
" It 's like , some days , I 'm looking in the mirror . "
Kedrick 's mother , Laura Howt , says her son felt abandoned by the men in his life .
Howt divorced Kedrick 's father .
" My son shut down , " she said .
" He stopped caring .
He did n't want to talk to anybody . "
Johnson says her son has changed .
He made all A's and one B on his latest report card .
He seems happy , and he no longer talks back .
" He 's made an incredible difference , " Howt says of her son 's big brother .
" I had given up all hope of him being a good black man .
He 's made my job easier . "
Kedrick sounds giddy when he talks about his big brother .
" He taught me how to be respectful .
He taught me how to be a man , " Kedrick said .
" I listen to him because he 's part of my family . "
When asked about Obama , Kedrick did n't have much to say .
Big issues like the Obama effect on black men are off of his adolescent radar for now .
So is the prospect of growing up without an older man to guide him into manhood .
When asked what his life would be like without his new big brother , Kedrick paused .
" I do n't even like to think about it , " he finally said .
" I like to think on the bright side . "
Alright , so “ crime fighter ” is a stretch .
After I posted my quasi - theory on what the Firefly Easter egg might be on the Castle set , a commenter noted that there was a rumor going around that Castle would be dressing up as the one and only Captain Mal Reynolds of the Firefly class ship , Serenity .
Some quick searching found the right - side image ( click to embiggen ) , which looks as though it was taken with a cellphone camera , but it certainly looks quite legitimate .
The Castle set is definitely in the background , and that ’s sure as hell Nathan Fillion dressed as Mal from Firefly .
But was it ‘ shopped ?
And , if not , is he wearing the get - up for an episode ?
I have a super secret source of mine who , without stating definitively yes or no on the subject , seems to be hinting very much that this rumor is indeed true .
While this is definitely very cool and fellow Browncoats will be giddy with joy upon seeing the episode , I ’m not sure I ’d call it an “ Easter egg ” to look out for .
Maybe Fillion is n’t clear on what that means and , well , this is what we ’re supposed to be looking out for .
I imagine we ’ll see this play out in the October 26 episode of the show ( close to Halloween , get it ? ) , which apparently does n’t have a title yet .

The flags displayed in State courts and courts of the United States have gold or yellow fringes .
That is your warning that you are entering into a foreign enclave , the same as if you are stepping into a foreign embassy and you will be under the jurisdiction of that flag .
The flag with the gold or yellow fringe has no constitution , no laws , and no rules of court , and is not recognized by any nation on the earth , and is foreign to you and the United States of America .

Martial Law Flag " Pursuant to 4 U.S.C. chapter 1 , §§1 , 2 , & 3 ; Executive Order 10834 , August 21 , 1959 ; 24 F.R.6865 ; a military flag is a flag that resembles the regular flag of the United States , except that it has a Yellow Fringe border on three sides .
The President of the United States designates this deviation from the regular flag , by Executive Order , and in his capacity as Commander - in - Chief of the military .
The placing of a fringe on the national flag , the dimensions of the flag and the arrangement of the stars in the union are matters of detail not controlled by statute , but are within the discretion of the President as Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy . "
34 Ops. Atty . Gen. 83 .
President , Dwight David Eisenhower , by Executive Order No.10834 , signed on August 21 , 1959 and printed in the Federal Register at 24 F.R. 6865 , pursuant to law , stated that : " A military flag is a flag that resembles the regular flag of the United States , except that it has a yellow fringe border on three sides . "
THE LAW OF THE FLAG
The Law of the Flag , an International Law , which is recognized by every nation of the planet , is defined as :
" ... a rule to the effect that a vessel is a part of the territory of the nation whose flag she flies .
The term is used to designate the RIGHTS under which a ship owner , who sends his vessel into a foreign port , gives notice by his flag to all who enter into contracts with the ship master that he intends the Law of that Flag to regulate those contracts , and that they must either submit to its operation or not contract with him or his agent at all . "
Ref. : Ruhstrat v. People , 57 N.E. 41
By the doctrine of " four cornering " the flag establishes the law of the country that it represents .
For example , the embassies of foreign countries , in Washington D.C. , are " four cornered " by walls or fencing , creating an " enclave . "
Within the boundaries of the " enclave " of the foreign embassy , the flag of that foreign country establishes the jurisdiction and law of that foreign country , which will be enforced by the Law of the Flag and international treaty .
If you enter an embassy , you will be subject to the laws of that country , just as if you board a ship flying a foreign flag , you will be subject to the laws of that flag , enforceable by the " master of the ship , " ( Captain ) , by the law of the flag .
When you enter a courtroom displaying a gold or yellow fringed flag , you have just entered into a foreign country , and you better have your passport with you , because you may not be coming back to the land of the free for a long time .
The judge sitting under a gold or yellow fringe flag becomes the " captain " or " master " of that ship or enclave and he has absolute power to make the rules as he goes .
The gold or yellow fringe flag is your warning that you are leaving your Constitutionally secured RIGHTS on the floor outside the door to that courtroom .
This is exactly why so many judges are appointed , and not elected by the people .
The Federal judges are appointed by the President , the national military commander in chief .
The State judges are appointed by the Governors , the state military commanders .
The judges are appointed because the courts are military courts and civilians do not " elect " military officers .
Under martial law , you are presumed guilty until proven innocent .
The gold - fringed flag only stands inside military courts that sit in summary court martial proceedings against civilians and such courts are governed in part by local rules , but more especially by " The Manual of Courts Martial " , U.S. , 1994 Ed. , at Art. 99 , ( c ) ( 1 ) ( b ) , pg. IV - 34 , PIN 030567-0000 , U.S. Government Printing Office , Wash .
D.C.
The details of the crimes that civilians can commit , that are classed as ' Acts of War , ' cover 125 pages in the Manual of Courts Martial .
Under Article IV , section 3 , of the Constitution for the united States of America , no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State .
So --
Why have the judges of the State and Federal courts been allowed to erect foreign enclaves within our public courthouses under a foreign flag with the yellow fringe upon the soil of your state ?
We just thought you would like to know , so that the next time you see this yellow fringed flag you will know what you are looking at and what it really means .
If you are in Spain and you see the National Flag of Spain , you would know that you are under the jurisdiction of Spain ; and their laws govern you at this time .
You are officially NOTICED when you see their flag .
This is an admiralty law that says that all who see this flag understand they are governed by the laws of the country that this flag represents .
You SHOULD understand that the gold or yellow fringed flag signifies the same thing .
It is a notice to you that you are under the rules and regulations of the military force that is flying that flag .
Are you familiar with martial law ?
Does your attorney understand what this flag means ?
" It is an elementary rule of pleading , that a plea to the jurisdiction is a tacit ( silent ) admission that the court has a right to judge the case and is a waiver to all exception to the jurisdiction . "
( Girty v. Logan , 6 Bush KY , 8 ) .
Patriots are subjected to much ridicule when they object to [ Admiralty flag ] the flag that appears in every government office and courtroom in the land .
What Does The Gold - Fringed Flag Signify ?
It is commonplace to see a gold - fringed United States flag standing in the present - day courtrooms .
Is the gold fringe there for decoration only , or does it signify a certain jurisdiction ?
Make no mistake about it -- the American People have been put on notice that the normal constitutional
functions of government have been suspended and that their Land has been placed under martial law .
The information below is not by any means exhaustive , but will at least point the reader in the right direction to do additional research on his own .
Pursuant to the " Law of the Flag , " a military flag does result in jurisdictional implications when flown ( Ruhstrat v. People , 57 N.E. 41 , 45 , 185 Ill.
133 , 49 LRA 181 , 76 Am ) .
Under the powers designated by these statutes , the President may : seize property , organize and control the means of production , seize commodities , assign military forces abroad , institute martial law , seize and control all transportation and communications , regulate the operation of private enterprise , restrict travel , and , in a plethora of particular ways , control the lives of all American citizens .... ( United States Senate Report 93-549 , 19 November 1973 ) .

Spa-Francorchamps back in business
Reddit Homepage Advertising Beta Test Results – What I Got For $ 40
It ’s every webmaster ’s dream to go popular on social bookmarking sites like Digg , Delicious , and Reddit .
A front page feature on any of these sites brings a flood of new traffic – thousands of visits in a single day .
Of course , that kind of reward attracts a lot of competition and the social sites are thus protected by tough voting algorithms .
You not only need good viral content and a large network of friends to help you , but also a lot of luck .
Hitting it big on social media does not come easy .
Enter the Reddit Self - Serve Advertising Program .
A few weeks back , Reddit announced that it will be opening up its homepage for anyone willing to pay .
How does it work ?
Advertisers bid for the space at the top of the Reddit homepage , where the adverts pretty much look the same as regular Reddit listings , only they ’re labeled as “ sponsored links ” and have a border and blue background .
The ads should get a ton of visibility .
Here ’s an example of what they look like :
The bidding process for the advertising space is actually quite interesting .
Advertisers bid a certain amount per day , anywhere between $ 20 and $ 9,999.99 .
All of the money is then placed into a big pool , and advertisers get a proportional amount of exposure based on how much they bid compared to everyone else .
For example , if you bid the daily minimum of $ 20 and there are 9 other advertisers , each bidding $ 20 as well , then your ad will show up 10 % of the time .
Of course it ’s be a lot more complicated than that .
While this bidding system is great for Reddit ’s income , it does add a bit of uncertainty for potential advertisers .
How much can you expect to get for your money ?
There ’s a lot of outside factors involved – including how many other advertisers there are and how much they ’re bidding .
So how do you know whether or not Reddit advertising is worth your while ?
You do n’t .
Like with any other advertising , you just have to try it and see if it sticks .
Getting in early while there are less advertisers will likely give you an advantage .
The Reddit self - serve advertising platform is not yet open to the public , but I did manage to get an invitation to the beta .
I decided to throw $ 40 into it for a day and analyze the results .
In the rest of this post , I ’ll describe the process and outline my findings .
My Results with Reddit Advertising
Setting up a promotion using the Reddit self serve system was very easy .
Just fill out a form with title , URL , duration , and bid amount and you ’re good to go .
Once you create your ad , the Reddit team will review and approve / reject it .
You do need to submit two days in advance of when you want to start .
I decided to promote a recent article I wrote here on Winning the Web called 3 Reasons Why Google Needs to Buy Twitter in Order to Survive .
After $ 40 and 24 hours , these were the results .
In 24 hours , my listing was shown 26,050 times ( to 3,187 unique visitors ) .
The link in my ad was clicked 419 times , resulting in a unique click through rate of 13.15 % .
Not bad – that ’s about $ 0.09 per click .
Let ’s take a look at the quality of that traffic by analyzing Google Analytics data for Reddit in the same time period .
As you can see , there does seem to be a discrepancy between the visits in GA and the clicks in Reddit .
It could be that the platforms are using different tracking methods and / or some of the clicks are not necessarily being interpreted as visits in GA .
Regardless , you can see that the quality of the traffic from Reddit is n’t particularly great – an average time on site of only 19 seconds , although the bounce rate is low and visitors load 2.11 pages per visit .
Furthermore , I did not gain any new RSS feed subscribers nor did anyone download my free Internet marketing e-book .
The lackluster results could be because I promoted a rather controversial Internet / tech article on the homepage of Reddit .
Something more general and interesting for Reddit ’s demographic would probably fare better .
Other Advertisers on Reddit
Since this new program involves a bidding war between different advertisers , the competition does affect prices .
See the breakdown of statistics for all advertisers in recent days .
When there were 28 advertisers on 11/19 , CPM was $ 0.92 and CPC was $ 0.13 .
However when the number of advertisers decreased to 13 on 11/23 , CPM went down to $ 0.43 and CPC to $ 0.04 .
It ’ll be interesting to see how these numbers change when even more advertisers come on board .
There does seem to be a diverse set of advertisers so far in the beta program .
Here are a few running on the Reddit homepage right now – including a promo for a giveaway , a social media article , an affiliate offer landing page for a free phone , reddit t- shirts , website software , and an ad for a DVD movie on Amazon .
Final Thoughts
Advertising on the Reddit homepage is a great way to get social traffic to your site fast without having to play the social voting game .
The program is still in beta but it ’s definitely worth a shot once it launches ( in a few weeks ) .
Since you get more for your money when there are less advertisers , it ’s best to get in early ( as an advertiser myself , I probably should n’t be telling you this ) .
Based on my very small experiment , the traffic does n’t seem very sticky or targeted , but test what works and scale up your campaigns once you find something that clicks with the audience .
What do you think about the Reddit self - serve advertising platform ?
A good model worth trying out ?

One issue we always face is the fact that we do n’t have enough memory .
Ever .
And even if we did , we like our data structures small and crunchy for performance reasons .
Sure , we pay attention to it all the time – and yet , occasionally , something slips through .
So it ’s nice that somebody wrote a tool – Cruncher # – to just load your PDB and examine all your structures for unnecessary padding .
And if you desire to look at ELF files ( i.e. you ’re under Linux , or working on a certain console ) , there ’s pahole .
Not only does it point out padding ( or ‘ holes in your structure ’ ) , it ’s also friendly enough to tell you how many cache lines your structure will consume .
Let ’s hope the two authors inspire each other !

A Japanese warship and a South Korean container ship have collided off southern Japan , injuring a navy sailor .
The destroyer Kurama and the Carina Star were both engulfed in flames after the incident in the Kanmon Strait , near the southern main island of Kyushu .
Public broadcaster NHK said none of the South Korean ship 's crew members had been injured .
It also said the Japanese ship 's bow was damaged .
Defence Minister Toshimi Kitazawa said the government had set up an inquiry .
AP news agency says the Kurama was on its way to its home port of Sasebo , on Kyushu , after serving as the flagship for the country 's triennial fleet review on Sunday in the port of Yokosuka .
Yes , scientists do much good .
But a country run by these arrogant gods of certainty would truly be hell on earth
The row between the Government and its scientific advisers blazes on like an out - of - control forest fire .
It began with that difficult customer Professor David Nutt , who was chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs .
He told the Home Office that alcohol and tobacco were more dangerous than the banned substance cannabis , and horse - riding was more of a risk to your health than ecstasy .
But he was not content simply to give advice , of course .
What he appeared to want to do was to dictate to the Government , and when it refused to acknowledge his infallibility , Professor Nutt started to break ranks and to denounce the country 's law on drugs .
Breaking ranks : David Nutt said alcohol and tobacco were more dangerous than cannabis
Now he has been sacked , the scientific establishment is in an uproar of self - pity and self - importance .
How dare mere politicians question their judgments ?
They are scientists , are n't they ?
And what scientists say must be taken as true .
The trouble with a ' scientific ' argument , of course , is that it is not made in the real world , but in a laboratory by an unimaginative academic relying solely on empirical facts .
It is one thing to argue Professor Nutt 's case in a university common room or over a Hampstead dining table , but another to translate his arguments to murkier parts of our society .
Try saying that ecstasy is safe in the sink estates of our big cities , where police , social workers and teachers work to improve the lives of young people at the bottom of the heap .
Try saying it to those who see , every single day , the devastation wrought not only on the youngsters themselves , but on whole communities by the casual abuse of drugs .
Bluster
If you add together all the winos and self - destructive alcoholics , then throw in the smokers who 've died of respiratory or cardiac disease , the total will far outstrip the number of young people who die after taking an ecstasy pill - and you could conclude from this that smoking and drinking are more dangerous than ecstasy .
That does not mean it is safe to take ecstasy nor that it is desirable to tolerate a druggy culture among the impressionable young .
This whole debate between David Nutt and the Government is about much more than the simple academic question over the relative dangers of cigarettes , drink and other drugs .
What is on trial is the reputation of science .
Of course , it would be folly to deny that we all owe a vast debt to scientific discoveries , made by patient , intellectually rigorous men and women over the past few centuries .
Just think what we owe to developments in medicine , let alone all those technologies we now depend upon , from cars to computers .
Contempt : Home Secretary Alan Johnson has been denounced by the scientific establishment for sacking Professor Nutt
Nor would I ever wish to suppress scientific inquiry or to undervalue the good which scientists have done for our world .
But there is an increasing presumption among many intelligent and good - hearted people that science is an absolute truth , that its methods of arriving at the truth are infallible and that scientists must be listened to at all times .
A Home Secretary who sacks a plucky little scientist for daring to speak his mind - correction , daring to speak ' the truth ' - is surely worthy of our contempt ?
That is how the scientific establishment has portrayed the story as they line up to denounce Alan Johnson .
Before we get carried away by their bluster , we should recognise the arrogance for what it is .
What the scientists are saying basically is that they will brook no contradiction .
Yet if we examine the history of scientific experts - and , in particular , scientists advising governments - they do not have a very happy record .
Do you remember the foot - and - mouth outbreak of 2001 ?
All reasonable farmers and vets believed that the epidemic could be contained by vaccine , or simply by isolating animals .
But the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government , David King , insisted upon a massive cull .
Millions of sheep and cows were destroyed , and every hill and valley , which once echoed to bleating or lowing was silenced and despoiled .
Did we ever hear a word of apology when events proved this government scientific adviser wrong ?
We hear a lot about the bovine brain disease BSE which was passed onto humans , and the possible cures which science might effect .
But how often do we hear that BSE was almost certainly passed on to other cattle because scientists had encouraged farmers to force their animals to eat concentrated foods which contained beef products ?
Going back in time , some people think that Hitler invented the revolting experiments performed by Dr Mengele on human beings and animals .
Irrationality
But the Nazis did not invent these things .
The only difference between Hitler and previous governments was that he believed , with babyish credulity , in science as the only truth .
He allowed scientists freedoms which a civilised government would have checked .
I am not suggesting that any British scientists are currently conducting experiments comparable to those which were allowed in Nazi Germany or in Soviet Russia .
But I see the same habit of mind at work in Professor Nutt and his colleagues as made those mad scientists of the 20th century think they were above the moral law which governs the rest of us mortals .
The worship of science is the great superstition of our age .
The scientific adviser speaks and we are all supposed to believe him , whether he is promoting crops genetically modified to withstand huge doses of poisonous weedkillers and pesticides , or tampering with the origin of human life itself in so - called stem cell research .
Those who dare question scientists are demonised for their irrationality .
Global warming may or may not be a certainty , but anyone who queries it has his sanity questioned .
Cast doubt on these gods of certainty and you are accused of wanting to suppress free expression - which is the argument now being used by Nutt and pals against the Home Secretary .
In fact , it is the arrogant scientific establishment which questions free expression .
Think of the hoo - ha which occurred when one hospital doctor dared to question the wisdom of using the MMR vaccine .
The point here is not whether he was right or wrong - it was the way in which the scientific establishment closed ranks in order to assassinate him .
There was a blanket denunciation of his heresy , just as there is if anyone dares to point out some of the mistakes made by that very fallible genius Charles Darwin .
Science rules - and it does so with just as much energy as the old Spanish Inquisition that refused to allow any creed other than Catholicism , and with the Inquisition 's need to distort arguments and control the brains of men and women who might otherwise think for themselves .
Naivety
In complex areas - medicine , agriculture , astronomy - the politicians who make our laws inevitably have to consult ' experts ' .
But this is not to guarantee that such experts are always right .
As Margaret Thatcher once said : ' Advisers advise and ministers decide . '
To be governed by politicians is a necessary evil .
To be governed by arrogant scientists would truly be hell on earth .
Listen to the way these scientists are describing one another as they huff and puff at the Home Secretary 's treatment of Professor Nutt .
' It will be hard to find a replacement of comparable expertise and stature , ' says one pompous ass in the letters column of a newspaper .
Stature ?
Nutt ?
Like so many scientific experts , his arrogance is matched by his naivety .
Like them , he can not bear to be contradicted .
And to every one who thinks otherwise , I would ask them to carry out a simple experiment .
Put a drug , bought casually on the street corner , and a glass of red wine on the table when your teenager comes home from school .
Which of them , in all honesty , would you prefer him to try ?
It 's not even Thanksgiving , but many around the Web may be excused for having that Christmas morning feeling – their Google Wave invite has arrived !
Google had promised this , of course .
The company sent out 100,000 of the golden tickets at the end of September .
Yet many , try as they might ( even on eBay ) , could n't get their hands on one .
But , as Google CEO Eric Schmidt confirmed in a chat with reporters in Cambridge , Mass .
earlier this month , more were on the way .
He said that Google was " getting ready for a broader distribution very soon – weeks , not months . "
We here at Horizons were the recipients of a few invitations this week , and , though they 're no " Red Ryder carbine - action , two hundred shot Range Model air rifle with a compass in the stock and a thing which tells time , " we were pretty excited .
After all the hype ( we contributed , too ) the whole Web was pretty stoked .
Who would n't want to use " what email would look like if it were designed today " ?
Now what ?
The thing is , what does one do with a Google Wave invite ?
The service feels like it should come with that classic Christmas - morning caveat : batteries not included .
Well , not batteries so much as other users .
Part ( or even all ) of Wave 's appeal is its ability to bring multiple users together in collaborative conversation – eschewing email , IMs , and other " that 's - so - 20th - century " forms of electronic communication .
When Google demonstrated Wave , it did so with a gaggle of Googlers .
The company 's demo guinea pigs understood what Wave could do , and thus did n't suffer the average user 's most common complaint : ' Who do I talk to ? '
The exclusivity of the invite process not only made access next to impossible for the mere mortal , it made it so the average anointed Wave invitee had no one to try out the product 's vaunted features with .
As Frank Sinatra sang :
It 's like singin ' to empty tables
Or a gallery full of ghosts
Or like givin ' a great big party
Where nobody shows but the host
Google , seeing the problem , has tried to demonstrate what its new toy can do .
It hosts a number of video tutorials on the Wave site , suggesting that users employ
Wave for meetings , brainstorming sessions , and the like .
And TechCrunch pointed to a wave posted by the Google team that shows what the writing of the Declaration of Independence might have looked like , had it been composed in Google Wave .
( Wave users can click here to see what we mean .
The rest of you ... Sorry ! )
Wave 's problem
We consider ourselves pretty tech savvy folk here at Horizons , but none of these demos really seemed to change the fact that , for now , Google Wave is pretty unusable .
Here 's the problem :
It 's not just a new email or IM client ; it 's a complete paradigm shift .
We can create test waves , exchanging " hey , I got Wave !
You too ? " messages .
We can drop in maps , mess around with playback , and make friends ' days by sending them Wave invites .
But , um , that 's about it .
One friend who was the recent recipient of a Wave invite asked a seemingly innocuous question ( on GChat , not Wave ) :
i do n't think i understand google wave
can i access my gmail from it ?
Now , some might laugh .
But this is n't some tech novice .
She is n't still trying to use rabbit ears to get analog TV stations .
For her and many who may have heard of it , Wave just does n't compute .
GMail computes .
For her and many others , email makes sense – it's where they live .
Work , school , friends – they all send email .
Who sends waves ?
What 's Google to do ?
A Twitter friend wrote this morning : " to be honest , google wave has that same hype about it atari operating system had ... So September 2009 people will say . "
Right now ,
Wave is riding the tail - end of a surge of buzz that began back in September .
If Wave is to catch on , it needs wide – make that wiiiiiide – distribution .
Asked why Google had been so protective of its
Wave invites , Schmidt stressed that the company wanted to make sure the product would scale gracefully before expanding it to a wider audience .
If , in fact , it has handled its ever - growing sandbox well , it 's time for Google to open Wave to everyone .
Wave requires a monumental shift in the way people think about online communication .
Even though it beats email , IM , and the chat rooms of old with its slick features , it 's of no use to anyone if people have to go out of their way – or worse , explain it to other people – to use it .

Intrigue over Iran ’s nuclear program deepened Wednesday when Tehran accused the U.S. of involvement in the disappearance of a nuclear scientist it claims vanished after leaving for a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia in late May .
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said Shahram Amiri has not been heard from since shortly after he entered the Saudi kingdom , a close U.S. ally agitated over Iran ’s nuclear program .
Iranian news media reported that Amiri researches nuclear technology uses for medicine , but other reports suggested he worked at a recently disclosed uranium enrichment plant near Qom .
“ We have found documents that prove U.S. interference in the disappearance of the Iranian pilgrim Shahram Amiri in Saudi Arabia , ” Mottaki told reporters after a Cabinet meeting , according to Iran ’s state - owned Press TV .
He did not release the documents .
The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Mottaki as saying , “ We hold Saudi Arabia responsible . ”

The accusations come as the U.S. and other world powers are threatening Iran with new sanctions if it does n’t cooperate with United Nations inspectors regarding its nuclear program .
The scientist ’s disappearance raises the possibilities of kidnapping ; an intellectual seeking asylum ; or a defection arranged by American and Saudi intelligence agencies .
Iranian officials said Saudi Arabia had not responded to inquiries on the scientist ’s whereabouts .
In Washington , State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said he had no information about the matter , according to the Associated Press .
“ The case is not familiar to us , ” he said .
The Saudi-owned Al Sharq al Awsat newspaper reported that Amiri sought protection in Saudi Arabia .
The story could not be independently confirmed , and it was not known whether the scientist provided information to the U.S. about the Fordu plant near Qom .

The Obama administration has said U.S. intelligence had known about the plant ’s construction near a military base for several years -- well before Amiri ’s pilgrimage in May .
“ If Saudi Arabia claims Shahram Amiri has sought asylum , the best way to prove it is to hold a press conference , ” said Ebrahim Yazdi , secretary - general of the Freedom Movement of Iran and a former foreign minister .
“ And if Iran claims there is evidence that he has been kidnapped with USA involvement , it is advisable to demonstrate the evidence to the public . ”
Relations between the Sunni Muslim kingdom and Shiite - dominated Iran have been strained in recent years .
Saudi Arabia has blamed Iran for creating instability in the region through its support of the militant groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip .
The kingdom and other Sunni nations in the Persian Gulf have been uneasy about Iran ’s nuclear program , which Washington claims is aimed at building nuclear weapons .
Tehran says its nuclear efforts are for civilian use .

The recent revelation of the Fordu plant -- which is expected to house 3,000 new centrifuges , which are used to enrich uranium -- spurred Washington and its European allies to pressure Iran to divulge more about its nuclear sites .
Iran agreed over the weekend to allow U.N. inspectors into the Fordu plant on Oct. 25 .

Based on simple production stats , Volkswagen is now the world 's largest automaker .
Over the first nine months of 2009 , VW produced 4.4 million units , while Toyota cranked out 4 million even .
( Ford came in third at 3.7 million . )
We 're not sure how long VW will remain at the top of the heap , since much of its production and sales have been driven by government - run incentive programs in Europe , and many those programs have now ended .
But even if the company 's victory is fleeting , VW can technically say that it achieved its goal of becoming the world 's largest automaker nearly ten years ahead of its stated 2018 deadline .

For decades the German philosopher Martin Heidegger has been the subject of passionate debate .
His critique of Western thought and technology has penetrated deeply into architecture , psychology and literary theory and inspired some of the most influential intellectual movements of the 20th century .
Yet he was also a fervent Nazi .
Now a soon - to - be published book in English has revived the long - running debate about whether the man can be separated from his philosophy .
Drawing on new evidence , the author , Emmanuel Faye , argues fascist and racist ideas are so woven into the fabric of Heidegger ’s theories that they no longer deserve to be called philosophy .
As a result Mr. Faye declares , Heidegger ’s works and the many fields built on them need to be re-examined lest they spread sinister ideas as dangerous to modern thought as “ the Nazi movement was to the physical existence of the exterminated peoples . ”
First published in France in 2005 , the book , “ Heidegger : The Introduction of Nazism Into Philosophy , ” calls on philosophy professors to treat Heidegger ’s writings like hate speech .
Libraries , too , should stop classifying Heidegger ’s collected works ( which have been sanitized and abridged by his family ) as philosophy and instead include them under the history of Nazism .
These measures would function as a warning label , like a skull - and - crossbones on a bottle of poison , to prevent the careless spread of his most odious ideas , which Mr. Faye lists as the exaltation of the state over the individual , the impossibility of morality , anti-humanism and racial purity .
The book is the most radical attack yet on Heidegger ( 1889 - 1976 ) and would upend the philosophical field ’s treatment of his work in the United States , and even more so in France , where Heidegger has frequently been required reading for an advanced degree .
Mr. Faye , an associate professor at the University of Paris , Nanterre , not only wants to drum Heidegger from the ranks of philosophers , he wants to challenge his colleagues to rethink the very purpose of philosophy and its relationship to ethics .
Rather than serving in the U.S. Senate for almost 20 years , or having so many other wonderful life experiences , I could have served a longer sentence in prison for some of the stupid , reckless things I did as a teenager .
I am grateful to have gotten a second chance — and I believe our society should make a sustained investment in offering second chances to our youth .
When I was a teen , we rode aimlessly around town , shot things up , started fires and generally raised hell .
It was only dumb luck that we never really hurt anyone .
At 17 , I was caught destroying federal property and was put on probation .
For two years , my probation officer visited me and my friends at home , in the pool hall , at school and on the basketball court .
He was a wonderful guy who listened and really cared .
I did pretty well on probation .
At 21 , though , I got into a fight in a tough part of town and ended up in jail for hitting a police officer .
I spent only one night in jail , but that was enough .
I remember thinking , “ I do n’t need too much more of this . ”
I had a chance to turn my life around , and I took it .
This term , the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether other young people get that same chance .
On Nov. 9 , the court will hold oral argument in Sullivan vs. Florida and Graham vs. Florida , two cases that will determine whether it is constitutional to sentence a teenager to life in prison without parole for a crime that did not involve the taking of a life .
There is a simple reason the criminal justice system should treat juveniles and adults differently : Kids are a helluva lot dumber than adults .
They do stupid things — as I did — and some even commit serious crimes , but youths do n’t really ever think through the consequences .
It ’s for this reason that every state restricts children from such consequential actions as voting , serving on juries , purchasing alcohol or marrying without parental consent .
The Supreme Court recognized the differences between teenagers and adults when it held a few years ago , in Roper vs. Simmons , that it was unconstitutional to impose the death penalty on defendants younger than 18 .
Locking up a youth for the rest of his life , with no hope for parole , is surely unconstitutional for the same reasons .
The person you are at 13 or 17 is not the person you are at 30 .
Everyone old enough to look back on his or her teenage years knows this .
Peer pressure is a huge part of youth behavior , whether one grows up in Washington , D.C. , or Cody , Wyo .
The guys will say , “ Go get the gun .
We ’ll pick up just enough money for tonight . ”
And almost unthinkingly , you ’ll do it .
There is simply no way to know at the time of sentencing whether a young person will turn out “ good ” or “ bad . ”
The only option is to bring him or her before a parole board — after some number of years — and give the person the chance to declare , “ I ’m a different person today ” — and then prove it .
Parole boards can examine how youth offenders spent their time in prison .
Did they read books or work in the library ?
Did they make furniture ?
Get a college degree ?
Those are critical questions for review .
We all know youths who have changed for the better .
When I was a lawyer in Cody , the court sometimes appointed me to represent juvenile offenders , and parents who knew of my history often asked for help with their children .
I once helped an 18 - year - old who stole a car and drove it to Seattle .
I later hired him as chief of staff for my Senate office .
I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store as a teenager and fired from my . 22 - caliber rifle never struck anyone .
I was fortunate that the fires I set never hurt anyone .
I heard my wake - up call and listened — and I went on to have many opportunities to serve my country and my community .
When a young person is sent “ up the river , ” we need to remember that all rivers can change course .

US : GDP figure masks deepening economic crisis
By Barry Grey
30 October 2009
The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that the US gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew 3.5 percent on an annualized basis in the third quarter ( July through September ) , breaking a string of four consecutive quarters of negative growth .
President Barack Obama hailed the report as “ welcome news ” and “ an affirmation that the recession is abating and the steps we ’ve taken have made a difference . ”
Wall Street rallied on the report .
The Dow gained 200 points , reversing a week of losses and nearing the 10,000 mark once again .
The reported increase in the growth rate topped most forecasts .
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast 3.2 percent GDP growth for the quarter .
Many media outlets and economists were quick to declare that the GDP rise meant the recession which officially began in December of 2007 was over .
However , as a number of analysts pointed out , the scale of the increase provided a distorted picture of the real state of the economy , which remains dominated by rising unemployment , falling wages and near - record low rates of factory usage .
Nearly 63 percent ( 2.2 percent ) of the 3.5 percent increase in GDP was due to temporary government tax credits to consumers that have either expired or are set to expire next month .
Federal outlays added another 0.6 percent to growth .
More generally , the GDP rise was the inevitable result of an unprecedented funneling of public funds into the financial system , totaling at least $ 11 trillion to date , according to most estimates .
This diversion of resources to the financial elite has resulted in vast and unsustainable budget deficits and precipitated a sharp decline of the dollar on world currency markets , undermining the status of the US currency as the world reserve and trading currency .
The outcome is a short - term boost in growth — one that is still insufficient to bring down the jobless rate — which paves the way for even greater financial and economic convulsions in the coming months .
The temporary spurt in economic growth has been carried out at the expense of the working class .
Corporate profits have rebounded , but almost entirely on the basis of deep and widespread job cuts and reductions in wages and hours of work for those able to hold onto their jobs .
Profits at some of the major Wall Street banks that received tens of billions of dollars in government cash as well as many billions more in cheap loans , debt guarantees and other subsidies have also surged .
The big banks are leveraging their government handouts to return to the speculative practices that precipitated last year ’s financial crash , while awarding their executives and traders record bonuses and pay packages .
A vast redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top , combined with intensified exploitation of the work force , has helped fuel an upsurge on the stock market .
The S&P 500 stock index has risen by 60 percent since its low point last March .
The GDP figure reflects , in short , a fragile recovery for the ruling elite based on growing economic distress and social misery for working people .
Fully 1.7 percentage points , or nearly half , of the 3.5 percent growth figure came from motor vehicle output — the result of last summer ’s “ cash for clunkers ” subsidy to car buyers , which expired at the end of August .
That spurt in auto production was reversed in September , which saw a 35 percent decline in vehicle sales .
The government ’s $ 8,000 credit for first - time home buyers produced a 23.4 percent jump in homebuilding , which boosted GDP for the quarter by another 0.5 percent .
This program is set to expire on November 30 , raising fears of another plunge in home sales and prices .
One measure of the ongoing crisis underlying the GDP figure is the fact that business spending reduced the growth rate by 0.24 percentage points .
Business outlays fell by 2.5 percent in the third quarter .
Another is the Labor Department report on initial jobless claims issued the same day as the Commerce Department ’s GDP estimate .
The number of US workers filing new claims fell by only 1,000 , less than the 6,000 predicted by economists .
The total for the week ended October 24 was 530,000 , far higher than the 325,000 figure considered to be in line with a healthy economy .
This followed the previous week ’s 11,000 increase in initial jobless claims .
The number of continuing claims — those drawn by workers for more than one week — remained at the extremely high level of 5,800,000 for the week ended October 17 .
These figures presage a further rise in the official jobless rate from the current 9.8 percent to 10 percent and beyond .
The real unemployment rate — taking in account those who have given up looking for work and those forced to work part - time — is at 17 percent , embracing 30 million Americans .
Mass unemployment is being used by the Obama administration as a weapon in its drive to “ reduce consumption ” and boost US exports on the basis of a falling dollar and low wages .
Average weekly earnings of production workers rose by only 0.7 percent in September , as the average number of weekly hours worked fell to a record low of 33 hours .
This represents the lowest annualized weekly earnings growth since such data began to be tracked in 1964 — nearly half a century ago .
Since hitting a recent peak in December 2008 , real average weekly earnings have fallen by 1.9 percent , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Factory use was at 67.5 percent in September , just above its all - time low and well off its 80 percent average .
This downward spiral in workers ’ wages and income is combined with a sharp increase in productivity , producing conditions for a sharp increase in the rate of corporate profit .
As USA Today gloated on Thursday :
“ Corporate earnings are blowing away analysts ’ estimates by the widest margin ever .…
Half of the companies in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index have reported , and a staggering 81 percent have topped expectations , says Thomson Reuters . ”
Noting that these profits have come despite a 10 percent decline in third quarter revenues , the newspaper wrote , “ Rampant layoffs and assaults on corporate expenses are showing real benefits . ”
Meanwhile , mortgage defaults and home foreclosures are continuing to rise , increasingly effecting middle - and upper - income households hit by long - term unemployment .
Failures of small and midsize banks are increasing , and state and local governments are dealing with budget shortfalls by slashing services , imposing unpaid furloughs and cutting jobs .
Just this week , major corporate layoffs were announced by Caterpillar , US Airways , American Airlines and Shell Oil .
Milwaukee County announced plans to shed up to 200 jobs .
The banks , rather than using their government handouts to expand lending to businesses and consumers , are doing the opposite .
The New York Times noted Thursday that consumer credit from commercial banks in August was some $ 45 billion less than at the end of last year .
As for business financing , banks ’ outstanding commercial and industrial loans fell to $ 1.411 trillion in September , $ 170 billion less than a year earlier .
The social crisis is reflected in a sharp drop in consumer confidence , according to a report released this week by the Conference Board , a private research group .
The Conference Board ’s latest index of consumer confidence fell from 53.4 in September to 47.7 in October , the biggest drop in eight months .
Even more dire was the fall in sentiment about “ current conditions , ” which fell to a 26 - year low .
In a further sign of deepening crisis , the Commerce Department on Wednesday released a report showing that sales of new homes in the US unexpectedly fell in September for the first time in half a year , as buyers opted for bargains on existing and foreclosed homes .
New home sales fell by 3.6 percent from August to September .
The drop in new home sales , combined with the expiration of the tax credit for first - time home buyers and an expected rise in foreclosures , paves the way for a renewed decline in home prices , which are already down 11.3 percent from a year ago .
Despite the Obama administration ’s touting of the new GDP figure , it has acknowledged that the official unemployment rate will breach 10 percent and still be at least 9.6 percent by the end of 2010 .
Last week , Christina Romer , the head of Obama ’s Council of Economic Advisers , told Congress that the main growth impact of last February ’s $ 787 billion stimulus package has already been spent .
Most economic forecasters are predicting GDP growth of 2.5 to 3 percent through most of next year .
Since it takes 2.5 percent just to keep employment steady , such a growth rate would do little to reduce shrink the unemployment numbers .
“ You need four to five percent GDP growth to get job growth , ” Romer said on Thursday .
Nevertheless , the Obama administration is opposing a new stimulus package , and preparing to introduce plans for austerity measures to reduce the deficit , including cuts in Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security .
MALALAK , Indonesia ( CNN ) -- Septiani Lenianingsih stands off to the side , away from the crowds that have gathered to watch the backhoe at work .
Septiani Lenianingsih watches as villagers and emergency workers dig for bodies .
The land the machine is plowing through was once the village of Malalak , but it 's now a mass grave .
Septiani , 18 , watches silently , speaking only in whispers to her uncle who is helping direct the search for bodies swallowed up in the massive landslide triggered by Sumatra 's earthquake last week .
She was at her boarding school when it all happened , she tells us .
She learned from the news that her village was damaged and tried frantically to get in touch with her family over the phone .
No one had the heart to tell her her family was dead .
When she arrived at the site where her home once stood in Malalak , there were no younger brothers and sister running out to greet her .
All that was left in place of her home was dirt .
She was left orphaned , alone .
Her young face reflects the intense sorrow she is still getting used to .
Watch more about her story »
" Shock , it was just pure shock , " she says .
Her eyes are dry , but her face is twisted with emotions .
" I just want to find my family .
My mother , she loved me so much . "
More than 30 villagers -- young and old -- lost their lives in Malalak .
Right after the earthquake , the side of the mountain exploded and came barreling down , swallowing everything in its path .

There used to be a mosque with a volleyball court out front .
Nearly a dozen children were playing there when the landslide came , and they were all swept away .
At least 608 people were killed in Indonesia following two devastating earthquakes last week .
Hundreds are still missing and authorities fear the death toll will climb as more bodies are found in the rubble .
We made the journey to Malalak with a small aid convoy , an initiative by Romeo Rissal Pandjialam , the regional director for Bank of Indonesia .
Along the winding mountain roads we could see the devastation .
Smaller landslides narrowed the road with debris , crushed homes lined the route .
It 's the small local volunteer groups , like the one we are with , that have rallied together to get much - needed food , water , medical supplies , and tents to the outlying areas .
Although aid is needed throughout the quake zone , and families are desperately trying to rebuild their homes , for some their losses cannot be replaced .
" I told myself this is God 's way of testing me .
I have to be strong , I have to finish school , " Septiani swears .
Her breath is labored and her voice soft as she fights her emotions and the overwhelming pain of losing her family and their love .

Washington -- Conservative Doug Hoffman conceded the race in the 23rd Congressional District last week after receiving two pieces of grim news for his campaign :
He was down 5,335 votes with 93 percent of the vote counted on election night , and he had barely won his stronghold in Oswego County .
As it turns out , neither was true .
But Hoffman ’s concession -- based on snafus in Oswego County and elsewhere that left his vote undercounted -- set off a chain of events that echoed all the way to Washington , D.C. , and helped secure passage of a historic health care reform bill .
Democratic Rep. Bill Owens was quickly sworn into office on Friday , a day before the rare weekend vote in the House of Representatives .
His support sealed his party 's narrow victory on the health care legislation .
Now a recanvassing in the 11 - county district shows that Owens ’ lead has narrowed to 3,026 votes over Hoffman , 66,698 to 63,672 , according to the latest unofficial results from the state Board of Elections .
In Oswego County , where Hoffman was reported to lead by only 500 votes with 93 percent of the vote counted election night , inspectors found Hoffman actually won by 1,748 votes -- 12,748 to 11,000 .
The new vote totals mean the race will be decided by absentee ballots , of which about 10,200 were distributed , said John Conklin , communications director for the state Board of Elections .
Under a new law in New York that extended deadlines , military and overseas ballots received by this coming Monday ( and postmarked by Nov. 2 ) will be counted .
Standard absentee ballots had to be returned this past Monday .
Conklin said the state sent a letter to the House Clerk last week explaining that no winner had been determined in the 23rd District , and therefore the state had not certified the election .
But the letter noted that Owens still led by about 3,000 votes , and that the special election was not contested -- two factors that legally allowed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to swear in Owens on Friday .
" We sent a letter to the clerk laying out the totals , " Conklin said .
" The key is that Hoffman conceded , which means the race is not contested .
However , all ballots will be counted , and if the result changes , Owens will have to be removed . "
Before Owens was sworn in Friday , Rep. John Garamendi , a Democrat who won a special election in California , was sworn in Thursday .
The two gave Pelosi the votes she needed to reach a majority of 218 and pass the historic health care reform legislation in the House .
The bill passed 220 - 215 late Saturday with the support of only one Republican .
The Republican , Rep . Anh " Joseph " Cao of Louisiana , said he voted for the legislation only after seeing that Democrats had the 218 votes needed for passage .
Now Hoffman , who campaigned against the health care reform bill , is carefully watching as the 23rd District race tightens and he is left to wonder if he conceded too soon .
" I do n’t know if we would have conceded on election night , " Rob Ryan , Hoffman ’s campaign spokesman , said Wednesday while discussing the latest results of the recanvassing .
" I ’m someone who does n’t like to look back .
But would we have taken longer to make a decision on election night ?
Probably , if we knew it was only 3,000 votes making the difference . "
Ryan , while acknowledging that Hoffman ’s chances of pulling off a come - from - behind victory are still remote , said the campaign is looking at its legal options .
" We ’re basically watching and waiting , " Ryan said .
" We ’ve been looking very closely at the recanvass .
We ’re going to see how this week shapes up , and then we ’re going to determine what to do . "
Ryan said an important factor in the decision to concede was the unexpected -- and erroneous -- close vote in Oswego County , where polls had Hoffman with a double digit percentage point lead heading into Election Day .
" That ’s the thing that threw us off , " Ryan said .
Oswego County elections officials blame the mistakes on " chaos " in their call - in center that included a phone system foul - up and inspectors who read numbers incorrectly when phoning in results .
Of 245 races in the county -- not including the congressional and court races -- 84 had incorrect totals reported election night .
In the congressional race , more votes were cast in Oswego County than any other in the 11 - county district .
The district ’s second biggest voter turnout was in Jefferson County , where Hoffman also has benefited from a turnaround since election night , gaining about 700 votes .
Owens led Hoffman by 300 votes on the final election night tally .
But after recanvassing , Hoffman now leads by 424 votes , 10,884 to 10,460 .
Jerry Eaton , the Republican elections commissioner for Jefferson County , said inspectors found a problem in four districts where Hoffman ’s vote total was mistakenly entered as zero .
" Hoffman definitely gained votes where he did n’t have them , " Eaton said .
Jefferson County , home of Fort Drum and the Army 's 10th Mountain Division , distributed 2,299 absentee ballots for the special election .
As of this week , 1,303 had been returned but not counted , Eaton said .
He said the county will begin counting the absentee ballots early next week .
Conklin , of the state Board of Elections , said officials did not have updated absentee ballot totals from the other counties .
When asked about the tightening race , Owens spokesman Jon Boughtin released a statement without directly addressing the election .
" Since being elected , Congressman Owens has remained focused on the issues at hand : working with local leaders to address the Champlain Bridge closure , meeting with commanders at Fort Drum and continuing the work to strengthen Upstate New York , " the statement said .
Ryan said the absentee ballots are likely to favor Hoffman because most were likely mailed before Republican Dede Scozzafava suspended her campaign three days before the election .
" For Doug to win , we needed a three - way race , " Ryan said , adding that the campaign ’s internal polls showed Hoffman would win with all three candidates .
" Given the majority of these ballots are from a three - way race , we think the ballots are going to break Doug ’s way , " Ryan said .
Ryan declined to say what percentage of the absentee vote the campaign believes Hoffman would need to win the race .
Nevertheless , Hoffman ’s campaign is optimistic .
" When people look back at this race , it was a remote possibility that Doug Hoffman would be a contender , " Ryan said .
" But miracles do happen .

JEDDAH , Saudi Arabia , Oct 26 ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia 's king has pardoned a woman journalist sentenced to 60 lashes for her role in a television programme in which a Saudi man spoke about his sexual exploits , a government official said on Monday .
Like many Muslim countries , Saudi Arabia prohibits sexual content on television , newspapers , magazines and books .
A court sentenced Rosana Alyami , 22 , on Saturday for helping produce a Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation ( LBC ) show in which Mazen Abdul - Jawad spoke about his sexual adventures in the conservative kingdom .
" The king has vindicated me .
I am satisfied with the king 's order and I accept the decisions of the sovereign , " Alyami told Reuters after being informed of the pardon .
Information Ministry spokesman Abdul - Rahman al - Hazzaa said the pardon meant that the issue would be in the hands of the ministry for possible disciplinary action .
" They will transfer the case to the ministry of information ...
In this case , the flogging has been dropped . "
Earlier this month , Abdul - Jawad was sentenced to five years in jail and 1,000 lashes .
Abdul - Jawad spoke openly of his sexual experiences on the talk show , " In Bold Red " in July .
Courts in Saudi Arabia , which implements a strict version of Islamic law , are controlled by clerics who have wide discretion in sentencing .
Someday we will be able to judge the organization by its actions ( including its public relations ) .
Today we can only try to anticipate what it will do , based on its statements and Microsoft 's statements .
The first thing we see is that the organization ducks the issue of users ' freedom ; it uses the term " open source " and does not speak of " free software " .
These two terms stand for different philosophies which are based on different values : free software 's values are freedom and social solidarity , whereas open source cites only practical convenience values such as powerful , reliable software .
See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html for more explanation .
Evidently Microsoft would rather confront the practical competition of open source than the free software movement 's ethical criticism .
Its long standing practice of criticizing only " open source " does double duty : attacking one opponent while distracting attention from the other .
CodePlex follows the same practice .
Its stated goal is to convince " commercial software companies " to contribute more to " open source " .
Since nearly all open source programs are also free software , these programs will probably be free , but the " open source " philosophy does n't teach developers to defend their freedom .
If they do n't understand the importance of this freedom , developers may succumb to Microsoft 's ploys encouraging them to use weaker licenses that are vulnerable to " embrace and extend " or patent co-optation , and to make free software dependent on proprietary platforms .
This foundation is not the first Microsoft project to bear the name " CodePlex " .
There is also codeplex.com , a project hosting site , whose list of allowed licenses excludes GNU GPL version 3 .
Perhaps this reflects the fact that GPL version 3 is designed to protect a program 's free software status from being subverted by Microsoft 's patents through deals like the Novell - Microsoft pact .
We do n't know that the CodePlex Foundation will try to discourage GPL version 3 , but it would fit Microsoft 's pattern .
The term " commercial software companies " embodies a peculiar confusion .
Every business is by definition commercial , so all software developed by a business — whether free or proprietary — is automatically commercial software .
But there is a widespread public confusion between " commercial software " and " proprietary software " .
( See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html.)
This confusion is a serious problem because it falsely claims free software business to be impossible .
Many software companies already contribute to free software , and these commercial contributions are quite useful .
Perhaps Microsoft would like people to assume these facts are impossible .
Based on these facts , we can see that CodePlex will encourage developers not to think about freedom .
It will subtly spread the idea that free software business is impossible without the support of a proprietary software company like Microsoft .
However , it may convince some proprietary software companies to release additional free software .
Will that be a contribution to computer users ' freedom ?
It will be , if the software thus contributed works well on free platforms , in free environments .
But that is just the opposite of what Microsoft has said it seeks to achieve .
Sam Ramji , now president of CodePlex , said a few months ago that Microsoft ( then his employer ) wanted to promote development of free applications that encourage use of Microsoft Windows ( http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3811941).
Perhaps the aim of CodePlex is to suborn free software application developers into making Windows their main platform .
Many of the projects hosted now on codeplex.com are add - ons for proprietary software .
These programs are caught in a trap similar to the former Java Trap ( see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html).
That would be harmful if it succeeds , because a program that does n't run ( or does n't run well ) in the Free World does not contribute to our freedom .
A non-free program takes away its users ' freedom .
To avoid being harmed in that way , we need to reject proprietary system platforms as well as proprietary applications .
CodePlex free add - ons to a proprietary base increase society 's dependence on that base — the opposite of what we need .
Will free software application developers resist this attempt to undermine our progress towards freedom ?
Here is where their values become crucial .
Developers that adhere to the " open source " philosophy , which does not value freedom , may not care whether their software 's users run it on a free operating system or a proprietary one .
But developers who demand freedom , for themselves and for others , can recognize the trap and keep out of it .
To remain free , we must make freedom our goal .
If the CodePlex Foundation wishes to be a real contributor to the free software community , it must not aim at free add - ons to non-free packages .
It needs to encourage development of portable software capable of running on free platforms based on GNU / Linux and other free operating systems .
If it tries to seduce us into going in the opposite direction , we must make sure to refuse .
However good or bad the CodePlex Foundation 's actions , we must not accept them as an excuse for Microsoft 's acts of aggression against our community .
From its recent attempt to sell patents to proxy trolls who could then do dirty work against GNU / Linux to its longstanding promotion of Digital Restrictions Management , Microsoft continues to act to harm us .
We would be fools indeed to let anything distract us from that .

With its moratorium on new medical marijuana dispensaries declared unlawful , the Los Angeles City Council is now poised to act quickly on a strict ordinance that it has struggled with fitfully for more than two years .
On Tuesday , the city attorney ’s office delivered a draft that some members want the council to take up within a week .
The sudden acceleration stems from a Superior Court ruling Monday that left the city unable to enforce its ban and derailed its four - month - old drive to shut down new dispensaries .
“ We painted ourselves into a very tough position and now we act , ” said Councilman Ed Reyes , who has overseen the drawn - out effort to write an ordinance .
“ If we can do this Tuesday , I think we ’ll be OK . ”
The city ’s failure to pass an ordinance or enforce its moratorium allowed the number of dispensaries to explode .
There are now hundreds in the city , by most estimates , and new ones continue to open almost weekly .
Neighborhood activists have angrily complained that the council has lost control .

The proposed ordinance contains provisions that could make it one of the most restrictive in the state .
Under the latest proposal , most dispensaries would be required to close immediately and could not apply to reopen for six months .
The 186 dispensaries that registered with the city when it passed its moratorium in 2007 would be allowed to remain open for six months , but then would have to meet the ordinance ’s requirements .
The ordinance could effectively outlaw most dispensaries in the city by prohibiting sales of medical marijuana .
Both City Atty .
Carmen Trutanich and Los Angeles County Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley maintain that state law does not allow over - the - counter sales , though they say collectives owned by the members are allowed to recoup their expenses .
Dispensary operators say the sales , usually in 1/8 - ounce increments , are meant to cover their operating costs .
Council members have become increasingly frustrated with dispensaries flagrantly violating the ban and the state ’s requirement that they operate as collectively - run nonprofits .

Some of the council members most involved in the issue have begun to press for the tough measure .
“ We are going to ban sales , ” said Councilman Dennis Zine , who said he has discussed the issue with colleagues .
“ The profit margin is what ’s gotten them going .
They ’re not in there to help people , they ’re in there to make money . ”
Councilman Jose Huizar , however , said he was studying all the relevant court cases to try to decide whether to ban sales , a complicated and contentious issue that has contributed to the council ’s extended deliberations .
No other city or county appears to have tried to directly restrict sales , although some require collectives to maintain detailed records to prove their nonprofit status .

Yamileth Bolanos , who runs Pure Life Alternative Wellness Center and is president of the Greater Los Angeles Collective Alliance , said dispensary operators were stunned at the sudden turn of events .
“ I understand that they are going to try to rush [ the ordinance ] through , but it does n’t work for us .
Essentially , it ’s just going to wipe us out , ” said Bolanos , whose group of 54 dispensaries has worked with the council for many months to try to reach a compromise .
“ This is a very unfair thing to us . ”
The ordinance requires collectives to keep records on members and suppliers and to make them available to police , which operators fear could leave them vulnerable to federal prosecution even though the Justice Department on Monday formally told its prosecutors not to pursue medical marijuana users and dispensaries that follow state law .
The draft ordinance also adds a provision that requires collectives to notify council members and neighborhood councils of their plans to open , and another that bars anyone who was convicted of a felony within the previous 10 years or who is on parole or probation from managing a collective .

In addition , the ordinance would limit the number of dispensaries by requiring them to be at least 1,000 feet from schools , parks , libraries , religious institutions , child care facilities , youth centers , hospitals , medical facilities , substance abuse rehabilitation centers and other collectives .
The ordinance also would restrict the dispensaries ’ operations .
They could be open only between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m .
They could have no more than 5 pounds of marijuana or 100 plants on hand , and marijuana could not be consumed on site .
They also would not be allowed to sell or manufacture edible marijuana products .

The departure of longtime chairman Dick Cook from Walt Disney Studios is having a ripple effect on the company 's planned film slate .
Beyond the potentially endangered " Pirates of the Caribbean " franchise given Johnny Depp 's recent loss of enthusiasm , it appears that Disney is turning around on another project -- namely , " The Diary of Anne Frank .
" According to The Wrap , Disney has ceased development on playwright , screenwriter and filmmaker David Mamet 's interpretation of " The Diary of Anne Frank , " the story of a young Jewish girl 's experiences throughout the Holocaust .
The report suggests that " Anne Frank " was rejected by Disney for being " too dark , " but also because Cook 's recent ousting has stalled movement on a vast majority of Disney 's projects .
" With the studio in a state of limbo after the ouster of chairman Dick Cook , it is unlikely that any projects will be getting the go - ahead at the moment , " insider
Tiny insects could be as intelligent as much bigger animals , despite only having a brain the size of a pinhead , say scientists at Queen Mary , University of London .
" Animals with bigger brains are not necessarily more intelligent , " according to Lars Chittka , Professor of Sensory and Behavioural Ecology at Queen Mary 's Research Centre for Psychology and University of Cambridge colleague , Jeremy Niven .
This begs the important question : what are they for ?
Research repeatedly shows how insects are capable of some intelligent behaviours scientists previously thought was unique to larger animals .
Honeybees , for example , can count , categorise similar objects like dogs or human faces , understand ' same ' and ' different ' , and differentiate between shapes that are symmetrical and asymmetrical .
" We know that body size is the single best way to predict an animal 's brain size , " explains Chittka , writing in the journal Current Biology .
" However , contrary to popular belief , we can't say that brain size predicts their capacity for intelligent behaviour . "
Differences in brain size between animals is extreme : a whale 's brain can weigh up to 9 kg ( with over 200 billion nerve cells ) , and human brains vary between 1.25 kg and 1.45 kg ( with an estimated 85 billion nerve cells ) .
A honeybee 's brain weighs only 1 milligram and contains fewer than a million nerve cells .
While some increases in brain size do affect an animal 's capability for intelligent behaviour , many size differences only exist in a specific brain region .
This is often seen in animals with highly developed senses ( like sight or hearing ) or an ability to make very precise movements .
The size increase allows the brain to function in greater detail , finer resolution , higher sensitivity or greater precision : in other words , more of the same .
Research suggests that bigger animals may need bigger brains simply because there is more to control -- for example they need to move bigger muscles and therefore need more and bigger nerves to move them .
Chittka says : " In bigger brains we often do n't find more complexity , just an endless repetition of the same neural circuits over and over .
This might add detail to remembered images or sounds , but not add any degree of complexity .
To use a computer analogy , bigger brains might in many cases be bigger hard drives , not necessarily better processors . "
This must mean that much ' advanced ' thinking can actually be done with very limited neuron numbers .
Computer modelling shows that even consciousness can be generated with very small neural circuits , which could in theory easily fit into an insect brain .
In fact , the models suggest that counting could be achieved with only a few hundred nerve cells and only a few thousand could be enough to generate consciousness .
Engineers hope that this kind of research will lead to smarter computing with the ability to recognise human facial expressions and emotions .
Healthcare overhaul bills working their way through Congress could jeopardize laws in California and other states that require insurers to pay for treatments such as AIDS testing , second surgical opinions and reconstructive surgery for breast cancer patients .
What ’s more , the federal legislation could make it virtually impossible for states to enforce other consumer protection laws , such as the right to appeal if an insurer denies coverage for a particular treatment .
Healthcare overhaul bills in both the Senate and the House would open the door to insurers selling policies across state lines -- which some lawmakers fear could allow health plans to take advantage of the lenient rules in some jurisdictions while avoiding tougher enforcement regimes in places like California .
“ It would be a huge problem for California consumers , ” said Rep. Jackie Speier ( D - Hillsborough ) , who helped craft insurance laws when she served in the state Senate .
“ California is leading the way in terms of consumer protection , and I do n’t want to see that lost . ”

The proposals are part of the broader federal healthcare legislation that has been passed in the House and is still under consideration by the Senate .
Before any of it can become law , both houses would have to agree on final language and President Obama would have to sign it .
Allowing insurers to sell across state lines is a key tenet of the Republican healthcare platform , and Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) made it a centerpiece of his presidential campaign .
Proponents argue that interstate sales would enable insurers to customize policies to individual customers ’ needs , ignoring state benefit mandates they view as overly burdensome .
Democrats , on the other hand , generally oppose interstate sales and have defeated earlier efforts in Congress to allow them .
Opponents fear that allowing insurers to sell across state lines would trigger a “ race to the bottom , ” in which insurers compete to sell bare - bones policies at the lowest price , lacking benefits such as maternity care .
Interstate sales “ is insurance code for picking their rules , ” said Jerry Flanagan , patient advocate for Santa Monica - based Consumer Watchdog .
“ The insurance companies will all run to Wyoming to issue policies , and Wyoming laws would rule in California . ”

Whereas some insurers want to be able to sell policies across state lines , the Blue Cross Blue Shield Assn. opposes the idea .
It argues that such permission would result in inexpensive , watered - down policies .
Establishing a minimum level of benefits at the federal level could mitigate that somewhat , said Kris Haltmeyer , Blue Cross Blue Shield policy director .
Still , he said , “ I do worry that there will be a race to the bottom , but the bottom wo n’t be as low as it used to be . ”
Bills ’ safeguards
Advertisement
The provisions allowing interstate insurance sales were included in the House and Senate legislation to win votes from conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans , according to legislative insiders .
But some close to those negotiations said the bills have safeguards that would ensure that the interstate policies provide the medical coverage consumers need .
For instance , the bill passed by the House on Nov. 7 and one approved earlier by the Senate Finance Committee call for the establishment of a federal benefits “ floor , ” an essential set of medical services that all policies would have to cover .
The Congressional Budget Office has found that mandates contribute a small fraction to overall premium costs .

Still , some in the health insurance industry contend that mandates are one reason health insurance premiums are rising .
These groups ask , for instance , why someone with no children must buy a health insurance policy that covers childhood immunizations .
The Council for Affordable Health Insurance says states have imposed more than 2,000 benefit mandates on insurers .
J.P. Wieske , the group ’s state affairs director , said fears that insurers , if allowed , will rush to sell the most minimal benefits packages are unfounded .
“ Companies design these policies knowing that people want certain benefits and certain benefits are popular , ” he said .
“ And if you do n’t include them , you may not be able to sell the policy .
So mandates are an issue , but they are not the issue for the insurance companies . ”
California laws

Currently , most health insurance is subject to the laws of the state where the purchaser lives .
Some states , including California , have greater consumer protections than others .
Patients ’ rights are among many areas where California has sought to provide protections beyond those of the federal government and other states .
In a similar way , the state ’s standards for air and water pollution and fair employment and housing exceed federal laws .
California mandates require insurers to cover home healthcare , bone density screening for osteoporosis , in vitro fertilization and mastectomy .
Mandates also cover certain providers , such as chiropractors , and conditions , such as autism .
If insurers are allowed to sell under the laws of other states , they might be able to offer policies that do not include those benefits .
The American Cancer Society ’s Cancer Action Network believes the federal benefits package will end up including many of the cancer screening and prevention services , such as mammograms and tobacco cessation classes , that the group has fought for in the states for years .
Advertisement
“ Healthcare reform could apply them nationwide with one fell swoop , ” said spokesman Steve Weiss .
But benefit mandates are not the only concern .
Some California lawmakers and policy analysts worry the federal legislation would gut a host of other consumer protections .
In California , for instance , insurers must comply with prompt claims payment laws .
And if an insurer refuses to pay for a particular treatment , such as chemotherapy or an organ transplant , the consumer has the right to appeal that decision to an independent medical review panel whose decisions are binding .
‘ Buyer beware ’
Advertisement
Bills in both the House and Senate include provisions that seek to preserve state authority over consumer protections .
But , consumer advocates say , practically speaking , that will be difficult if Californians can buy policies from other states where the laws are not so consumer - friendly .
“ California ca n’t interpret the laws of Washington ; it ca n’t interpret the laws of Oregon , ” said Sabrina Corlette , director of health policy for the National Partnership for Women & Families , a Washington , D.C. , advocacy organization .
“ This is just going to open up a huge , big loophole for scam artists to come in and market their products . ”
In another effort to safeguard consumers , the House bill would set up a federal oversight commission and calls for the development of an appeals and grievance process .
In addition , states would have to agree to allow outside insurers to sell to their residents .
But congresswoman Speier and others are skeptical .
Speier said the bill does n’t call for anything that protects consumers ’ rights as well as California ’s independent medical review process .
Advertisement
Karen Pollitz , a professor at Georgetown University ’s Health Policy Institute , said that , as written , the bills would make it easier for insurers to evade state regulation and enforcement .
“ That puts consumers at risk , ” she said .
“ It ’s a problem because there is no state that has the capacity to regulate insurance sold outside its borders .
They just do n’t .
They do n’t have enough people .
It ’s not practically possible . ”
In a clear signal of just how big a change is afoot , bills in both houses include a “ buyer beware ” notice .
The House version , for instance , says policies sold across state lines must “ provide for clear and conspicuous disclosure to consumers that the policy may not be subject to the laws and regulations of the state in which the purchaser resides . ”
Consumer advocates and California lawmakers fear that hard - fought insurance gains may be lost .
Advertisement
Rep. John Garamendi ( D - Walnut Creek ) is a strong proponent of the healthcare overhaul legislation .
But the former California insurance commissioner said he sees trouble in the interstate provision .
“ There is a real potential for problems here for consumers . ”
The office of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a supporter of the Obama health plan , is assessing the details of bills before Congress , spokeswoman Rachel Arrezola said .
But , she said , the governor “ strongly believes that any healthcare reform proposal should not erode California ’s landmark consumer protections . ”

It might sound strange , but many people are actually addicted to eating ice cubes .
They chew and eat ice cubes all day long because of this addiction .
And there are valid medical reasons for being addicted to eating ice .
I first heard of this on the news .
They were showing people crunching and eating ice cubes as if it was Captain Crunch cereal .
My teeth hurt just watching them .
During interviews , these people who are addicted to eating ice cubes admitted to eating as much as 2 gallons and more ice per day .
And they cannot stop this addiction to eating ice .
Constantly chewing and eating ice causes damage to your teeth , tongue , throat and stomach .
The damage to teeth can be chipping of teeth or developing cracks in the teeth that might not be detected for years .
Some people report that their voice has changed because of all the ice eating .
With some people , this can also include the compulsion to constantly drink ice cold drinks .
Many reported having extreme gas , stomach bloating and stomach pain because of their being addicted to eating ice .
Those who are addicted to eating ice even prefer certain types of ice and places that sell just the right ice .
Many prefer the ice that the Sonic drive - ins sell or a certain grocery store gourmet soft ice .
They have cravings for it all day long and will get into bad moods if they do n’t have it .
Those addicted to eating ice will warn others to stay away from their ice trays and going as far as having a bucket of ice even with every meal .
It is reported in women far more than men , but men are also addicted to eating ice .
Many women say that their first craving for eating ice was when they were pregnant and that sometimes it went away until they became pregnant again .
The more I read , the more children in their early teens I saw posting about their ice - eating addiction .
Pica is the medical term for being addicted to non-nutritive substances .
This could be dirt , clay , coal , chalk , paint chips , erasers and even more dangerous items like string , needles and glass .
Pagophagia is the actual term for being addicted to eating ice cubes .
There is an old saying , that if you crave a certain food , you are low in those nutrients .
Some doctors are now theorizing this could be the case with Pica and Pagophagia .
At least in the cases of some of the items like ice and dirt , since dirt does contain nutrients of some kind .
Burning Mouth Syndrome
The majority of the people having the addiction to eating ice , also say that their mouths and tongue burned and that eating ice made that feel better .
Other symptoms of burning mouth syndrome might also include :
· Your mouth is dry most of the time .
· Normal things taste differently some of the time .
· You have a tingling in your mouth and on your tongue .
These symptoms are usually absent during the night and upon waking .
The symptoms of burning mouth syndrome will increase as the day goes on , being worst in the evening before bed , causing some to have a hard time falling asleep .
Medical Reasons For Ice- Eating Addiction
The web sites where people discuss being addicted to eating ice reported going to a doctor and finding out they were n’t only anemic , but severely anemic .
Studies have shown that people with iron deficiency anemia , 88 % of them had an addiction to eating ice cubes [ 1 ] .
Anemia is a medical condition in which the hemoglobin or red blood cell count is lower than normal .
For men , anemia is usually defined as a hemoglobin count lower than 13.5 grams / 100 ml ( milliliters ) .
For women , anemia is typically defined as a hemoglobin count lower than 12 grams / 100 ml .
After reading the Internet posts from others who have an ice - eating addiction , many went to their doctors to have their hemoglobin checked for anemia .
They wrote that their blood tests came back with extreme anemia to the point where some even had to have a blood transfusion .
Most of the people with an ice - eating addiction had hemoglobin numbers as low as 5 or 6 , which is dangerously low .
After being put on multi-vitamins and iron pills , many reported that the craving for eating ice went away , though the habit remained for some time , like many addictions .
Another theory is people who are addicted to eating ice are also low in minerals that are found in hard water .
If the ice they are eating is made from hard water , they could be low in those minerals .
The most common minerals in hard water are calcium and magnesium .
Other nutrient deficiencies that can cause burning mouth syndrome are zinc , folate ( B9 ) , thiamin ( B1 ) , riboflavin ( B2 ) , pyridoxine ( vitamin B - 6 ) and Cobalamin ( vitamin B - 12 ) .
If you do n’t already take a multivitamin , you should consider taking one or also taking a B complex supplement .
If you do n't know if you need a multivitamin , here is a list of the daily nutrient values you should be taking .
Symptoms of Anemia
There is a reason why so many people with anemia are addicted to eating ice cubes .
Some of the symptoms of anemia include a burning mouth , burning tongue , sore tongue , swollen tongue and an overly dry mouth .
Other symptoms are fatigue or easily fatigued , brittle nails and restless leg syndrome .
If you are addicted to eating ice , you should have your blood and hemoglobin tested immediately .
There is always the chance you are just addicted to eating ice out of an addictive habit and there are no underlying medical reasons .
If you do eat ice because of the burning mouth syndrome and you do not have anemia , you should work with your doctor and or dentist to find the cause of this .
Doctors report numerous reasons for burning mouth syndrome including prescription medicine , dental work , vitamin deficiency and cranial nerve damage .

I never met the man , but I did n't need to .
He is what politics should be today , he is what the Democratic Party should be today , and he is what America should be today .
Instead of running away from his convictions for political gain , he stuck by them .
He supported welfare in his campaign commercials .
When was the last time you saw that ?
Despite being told it would cost him the election , he voted the way his convictions and heart told him to on the 2002 Iraq War authorization .
If only more of our senators had done just that .
America is so great because literally anyone can run for office , even the office of the president if they wish .
That 's all nice and great , but it takes a lot more than that to actually win an election .
Virtually all successful candidates plays politics , raise millions of dollars , and listen to their advisers ' every word .
Not Paul Wellstone .
Called " embarassingly liberal " by his 1990 opponent , he did n't care ; in fact , he was proud to be a liberal .
It 's hard to find Democratic politicians nowadays who can say that .
The political deck was stacked against him to say the least .
He did n't come from a well - known political family nor was he a wealthy lawyer or consultant .
Instead , he was the son of Jewish immigrants and was a community organizer and college professor .
He was outspent 7 - 1 .
But all that did n't matter .
Why ?
Because he was a regular guy ; he wore jeans and work shirts ; he never talked down to people .
He did n't ride around in a jet or a limo - he campaigned in a rickety green school bus .
Americans like regular people and that 's why Americans today hate politics .
Democrats , especially those running for President today , ought to take a lesson from Paul .
Be passionate .
Stick to your convictions .
Speak your mind .
Do what 's right for regular folk .
Minnesotans probably disagreed with Paul on a lot of issues , but they respected him , and for that , they voted for him .
If he were alive today , he'd be the first one to tell Democratic candidates and officials to stop mincing words and tell it like it is .
There 's a wonderful article in today 's Politico about Wellstone 's legacy .
Says Senator Klobuchar :
" It ’s not just Ted Kennedy telling stories about him , " Klobuchar said .
" You ’ve got police officers , secretaries , anybody .
...
They all want to talk about Paul and how he always treated people with such respect and dignity . "
Tom Harkin , a close friend of Paul 's echoes that sentiment :
" Paul ’s memory keeps coming back to us ... as a reminder to always think about what the end result of what we are doing up here is , " said Sen .
Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) , who delivered the eulogy at Wellstone ’s memorial service .
" Paul had a great line about the future belonging to those with passion , " Harkin said .
" And no one had more passion for justice and fairness and economic opportunity for those on the bottom . "
Rep. Keith Ellison also remembers him fondly :
" He played a pivotal role in my political [ career ] , " said Ellison , who keeps a framed photo of Wellstone in his office .
" Paul taught me that if you have a vision for an inclusive society , for peace and for environmental sustainability , you do n’t just run to make a point , you run to win elections , " Ellison said .
Here 's a sampling of the former senator 's campaign commercials .
Notice how well he 's able to connect to regular people like you and me :
Here 's a wonderful tribute I found in one of last year 's memorial diaries .
It really does bring tears to your eyes .
There 's so much else that can be said of this great man - I 'm sure many people will remember him fondly in the comments section .
It 's truly hard to imagine how much better a place this country and world would be if he were still alive today .
You are dearly missed Senator Wellstone .

This may seem churlish in the week when the Australian prime minister , Kevin Rudd , is doing a deal with the opposition to get climate change legislation through the Senate .
After all , that puts him one step ahead of Barack Obama .
But it has to be said : Australia has had a ridiculously easy ride on climate change so far .
And , whatever Rudd 's domestic green credentials , he seems intent on continuing as before .
For when Rudd shows up in Copenhagen in a couple of weeks , he will bring a negotiating position almost certain to ensure that , while others make cuts , Australia 's emissions remain above 1990 levels until at least 2020 .
Australia got lucky in Kyoto back in 1997 .
I wrote afterwards in New Scientist magazine :
" Australia , which threatened not to accept any limit on its emissions , was made an offer too good to refuse .
First came a licence to increase its emissions by 8 % .
Then , in the final hours , it won an amendment that allows it to benefit massively from past deforestation …
Up to 30 % of its CO2 emissions in 1990 , the baseline date for the targets , were from deforestation .
But far from being penalised for this , Australia won the right to count any improvement from this position as a carbon credit .
It just has to make sure it does n't cut down quite as many . "
And that is what has happened .
Aussies offset rising emissions from cars and power stations by reducing their deforestation , in Queensland and New South Wales in particular .
In fact , even before signing in Kyoto , Australia had cut back deforestation emissions from 131m tonnes in 1990 to 75 m tonnes .
It was , according to an analysis carried out by the Sustainability Council of New Zealand , " the equivalent of Australia starting with an 11 % discount on its Kyoto target . "
But the story of Australia 's emissions without forests – what carbon counters term its " gross emissions " – has been very different .
UN statistics today show that gross emissions rose by 30 % between 1990 and 2007 .
Among developed countries , that figure is exceeded only by Spain , Portugal and Iceland .
Some other countries besides Australia had a head 's start in meeting Kyoto targets .
In Britain , for instance , Margaret Thatcher spent the 1990s shutting down the coal industry for reasons that had little to do with climate change .
But many of those countries accepted tougher emissions targets in recognition of that head start .
Under a deal with the rest of the European Union , Britain agreed to national cuts of 12.5 % .
But Australia has simply milked its good luck , carrying on largely as if Kyoto never happened .
As a result , today it has the highest per capita emissions of greenhouse gases of any major developed nation .
In response , a spokesperson for the Australian government said : " Australia does not accept that our base year emissions [ 1990 ] are ' inflated ' …
Deforestation emissions from the Australian continent are a significant part of the national emissions profile .
The large reduction in [ Australian ] deforestation emissions that resulted [ from the Kyoto protocol ] provides a lesson on the value of international agreement on deforestation emissions . "
But since Australia is the world 's hottest and driest continent , it is potentially more vulnerable to climate change than any other .
That suggests another path would be prudent .
And , to be fair , Rudd is aware of that .
But he has a tough task persuading his industrialists and hugely powerful coal industry ( Australia is the world 's largest exporter of coal . )
So what is Australia bringing to Copenhagen ?
Rudd will be there in person .
His headline grabber is the offer of a 25 % cut in emissions .
Except that the " conditions " he sets the rest of the world for this are so stringent that he is unlikely to have to deliver .
For instance , as the government spokesperson said , it would only be " fair " for Australia to make cuts that deep if other " advanced " countries made cuts " in the middle of the range identified by the IPCC " – that is , between 25 - 40 % .
That 's an odd definition of fairness .
It is based , according to the spokesperson , on the fact that " Australia faces higher economic costs to achieve equivalent emissions reductions … than most other advanced countries . "
Funny , but I do n't remember Australia offering bigger cuts in Kyoto because it was cheap and easy to end deforestation .
Quite the contrary .
Otherwise , Rudd offers a range of reductions from 5 - 15 % .
That does n't sound too bad until you remember the deforestation discount that Australia won in Kyoto .
Along with other land - use changes since then , even a 15 % " cut " would still allow Australians to emit more from burning coal in power stations , running cars and industry than they did in 1990 .
About 1 % more , according to the analysis by the Sustainability Council of New Zealand .
A new beginning in Copenhagen ?
Rudd's Copenhagen plan looks like a greenwashed version of the old Kyoto plan .
This weekend I decided to take a trip to a couple of local stores to pick up some food that did n’t involve turkey so I would n’t be fatigued of eating the same thing for the entire week .
A chain grocery store had about five people on a Sunday when it typically would have many more .
Now this can be written off as a random case given Thanksgiving but this pattern has been hitting for a few weeks .
After that I decided to stop by a local dollar store to pick up a few items .
The place was so full that I had to wait for parking .
This is the reality of the recession .
Deferring higher end spending for more low cost goods .
Even with recent reports we are seeing that holiday shoppers are buying but not at the high end .
With unemployment still stubbornly at the peak it is expected that families will be cutting back on spending .
Comparing this crisis to the Great Depression may not be appropriate aside from the fact that we have high unemployment and an insolvent banking system .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have jumped in with all their ammunition to save the banking sector .
The only problem is they forgot about the average American and the economy that we live in .
As we go deeper into this crisis and already have a hint as to how policy will play out it is turning out to be very similar to the Japanese contraction and lost decade (s ) .
Global debt is growing at breakneck speed :
Source : Societe Generale
By 2011 global economies will have close to $ 45 trillion in debt .
Is this a far stretch ?
The U.S. already broke the $ 12 trillion mark .
In order to compare our current crisis with Japan it is important to understand the history of their boom and bust :
“ ( Baseline Scenario )
At a high level of generalization , the causes of the bubble were similar to those we have just seen .
Loose monetary policy ( in late 1980s Japan , and in the U.S. this decade ) and high savings levels ( by Japanese households in Japan ’s case , China and oil exporters in ours ) created a large pool of money looking for investments to buy .
Rising prices encouraged speculation in both real estate and stocks .
Poor underwriting standards – due to some combination of government direction of investment and self - dealing within industrial and financial conglomerates – and an unconditional willingness to lend against real estate as collateral meant that banks made hundreds of billions of dollars ’ worth of loans that were sustained solely by rising prices .
When prices fell , those loans lost most of their value , crippling banks ’ ability to lend to creditworthy borrowers and choking the economy .
The lack of credit , combined with the negative wealth effect of collapsing asset prices , dampened economic growth , which averaged 1 % per year for the 1990s . ”
It is important to note that Japan has been in a multi- decade malaise .
No “ V ” shaped recovery but a very long “ L ” situation .
Japan ’s government sat back initially but then decided to bail out the banks and infuse massive amounts of fiscal stimulus .
The Bank of Japan like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke slashed rates to their zero bound :
The above chart shows a similar path .
The big difference of course is the minor push up in the early part of this decade but this occurred in the back drop of a booming stock market and real estate bubble .
Japan has been in the doldrums since the late 1980s .
In fact , if you look at the chart above Japan has held onto record fiscal deficits for years and we are now following a very similar path .
Our current budget deficit of $ 1.4 trillion is enormous :
Japan contented with a busted stock market and crashing real estate sector with bailing out an insolvent banking industry and also , pushing rates to the zero bound .
The idea of letting banks keep overvalued assets at peak prices is something many of us are now getting familiar with .
With $ 3 trillion in commercial real estate , much of it overvalued , it will be interesting to see how banks move on this .
If current actions are any indication , banks are merely going to delay mark - to - market and value assets at inflated prices .
This did not work for Japan .
Why ?
The banking sector became a vampire leeching off the productive sectors of the economy .
They could n’t put their assets on the market because it would render them insolvent .
In the end , it stunted growth .
Keep in mind that Japan also managed to stay somewhat prosperous because it was able to export into a booming global economy .
Demand for goods such as Toyotas , Hondas , Sonys , and other high cost goods was strong .
But these are higher end products that typically ship to wealthier economies .
How will they do in the current global contraction ?
The stock market path of the Nikkei and S&P 500 seems similar :
Over 20 years and the Nikkei is no where close to the peak reached in the late 1980s .
It is possible to muddle through for a very long time .
In fact , the Nikkei has been moving sideways with a tendency to the negative for 20 years .
The current stock market rally does not reflect market fundamentals and is merely a reflection of all the liquidity injected into the system .
But like Japan , all this does is keeps an insolvent banking sector walking for a few more years while the overall economy stays in a frozen pattern :
“ One of the major barriers to expansionary policy was the weakness of Japan ’s banking system .
The asset price collapse and economic slowdown meant that increasing proportions of their loan portfolios became non-performing .
Because writing down these loans to their true market values would have caused banks to become insolvent , they kept them on their books , rolling them over ( extending bad loans indefinitely ) in order to avoid having to take writedowns .
As a result , the banks were severely undercapitalized and largely unable to engage in new lending .
It was only in 1998 or 2003 ( depending on whom you ask ) that the government got serious about cleaning up the banking sector , letting weak banks fail or forcing banks to accept new government capital . ”
This is all sounding very familiar .
Yet talking with friends about this , many dismiss this out right and say “ well in Japan , they are big savers so they can do this . ”
In reality , as Japan ’s population has aged the savings rate has reflected the U.S. :
Analysis expect this rate to go negative :
“ ( Forbes ) Japan has lived beyond its means since the 1990s thanks to massive domestic savings .
Households own 1,441 trillion yen ( $ 16.3 trillion ) in assets , mostly deposited in banks , which then buy JGBs .
Foreigners hold about 8 percent of outstanding JGBs .
An ageing population has eroded the savings rate to about 3 percent from more than 10 percent a decade ago and household assets have declined about 8 percent from a 2007 peak , mainly because share prices plunged after the global financial crisis .
Demographics suggest the savings rate could turn negative in a few years .
‘ Like the United States , we will need foreign investors at some point , ’ said Koji Ochiai , senior market analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities .
‘ I doubt they will be attracted to such low yields . ”
And this is n’t so different from the U.S. American household net worth has taken a major hit of $ 12 trillion in this crisis but it is still sizeable in terms of real estate , stocks , and savings .
And this ties in with our big group of baby boomers .
They will draw down on their savings and stocks in retirement .
That is after all what a 401k , 403b , or pension is for .
To become your income in retirement .
But many are realizing that with stocks lower and the economy uncertain , some will have to defer that American dream of retirement or at least taper it down .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are gambling with the U.S. dollar .
They believe that they can systematically devalue the dollar and slowly allow inflation to wash away our massive amounts of debt .
Japan tried this .
It has n’t worked .
Now , with savings dwindling and the global economy depending less on exports , they are in a deep mess .
The U.S. is in a tough spot .
What many people do n’t know is that in Japan , one - third of all workers are part - time workers .
The headline stats always show a low unemployment rate but these people are counted as fully employed .
One thing we have seen spike in our current recession is the rise in part - time employment :
Source : Calculated Risk
This is the highest percentage of part - time workers we have had on record .
And there is no sign of this trend reversing .
If Japan is any guide , this is going to be a permanent reality of our new economy .
No job security , minimal benefits , and multiple jobs throughout one lifetime .
If we stay on the current path doing everything Japan has done , why are we to expect a different outcome ?
Remember the big deficit we currently have ?
Where revenues do n’t even come close to matching spending ?
Take a look at Japan :
At a certain point , the two major carry trade currencies in the world are going to meet their maker .
No country can spend this much without higher interest rates .
The current low zero bound market is more a reflection of global fears that still remain .
But there is ample evidence to examine Japan and our similarities .
Major stock market bubbles followed by major real estate booms and bust .
And Japan has demonstrated that real estate can remain depressed for 20 years :
What Japan might have bet on was some sort of asset appreciation .
This way , at least some of the value would be regained but that did n’t come to pass .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve is betting the entire country on this and putting their entire faith in the banks .
But without jobs why are we to expect that home prices will go up ?
With less people buying goods , why are we to expect commercial real estate to boom ?
The American dream is being deferred .
Japan had their dream postponed for two decades and it looks like they are entering a different phase of their downturn .
With our lost decade on hand already , is it possible we have another decade of stagnant growth ?
Until we start seeing job and wage growth , Japan might be an outline of our future .
The American and Japanese dreams are looking very similar .

DeSean Jackson scored on a 67 - yard run and a 57 - yard reception , both in the first half .
His night might have been perfect if his tender right ankle had n't messed up his touchdown tap dance .
" I was out there having fun , man , honestly , " Jackson said .
" My ankle was kind of hurting .
I really did n't feel it , but it did kind of affect my dance a little bit .
I could put it to perfection a little bit better than that . "
The Philadelphia Eagles had reason to do the soft shoe Monday night as they rebounded from an embarrassing loss and dispatched the Washington Redskins 27 - 17 in Landover , Md . Three turnovers were converted into points as the Eagles raced to a 20 - point lead in a game that was as lopsided as expected .
Donovan McNabb completed 15 of 25 passes for 156 yards , getting his 200th touchdown pass and surpassing 30,000 yards passing for his career .
The defense sacked Jason Campbell six times , and newcomer Will Witherspoon ran back an interception for a touchdown and created another turnover .
Nearly all the scoring came in the first half as the Eagles ( 4 - 2 ) regained their stride after a loss to the Raiders on Oct. 18 .
The scariest moment for Philadelphia came when Brian Westbrook left in the first quarter with a concussion .
The Redskins ( 2 - 5 ) got no discernible boost from offensive consultant Sherm Lewis ' debut as a play caller and lost Pro Bowl tight end Chris Cooley to a broken right ankle .
Lewis has been with the Redskins for only three weeks after being lured out of a retirement consisting of bingo - calling and serving Meals on Wheels - and his first try at calling the plays proved as unsuccessful as when coach Jim Zorn was handling the task .
More gay slurs : Chiefs running back Larry Johnson used a gay slur for the second time in two days Monday , the Kansas City Star reported .
Johnson refused to speak with reporters , a day after the Chiefs ' 37 - 7 home loss to the Chargers .
Sitting in front of his locker , he turned away and muttered the slur in telling reporters to get " out of here , " according to the Star .
On Sunday , Johnson belittled rookie head coach Todd Haley on Twitter in a series of posts that also included the same gay slur .
Haley said the Chiefs were looking into " a couple of situations " involving Johnson , but declined further comment .
The Twitter remarks were posted after San Diego routed the Chiefs .
One tweet read : " My father played for the coach from " rememeber the titans " .
Our coach played golf .
My father played for redskins briefley .
Our coach .
Nuthn . "
Jets ' Edwards charged : Authorities say Jets receiver Braylon Edwards has been charged with misdemeanor assault for punching a man outside a Cleveland nightclub .

BBC religious affairs correspondent , Seoul
The Yoido Full Gospel Church was founded in 1958
There are few words to describe a visit to what is claimed to be the world 's largest church congregation .
In just over 50 years , the Yoido Full Gospel Church has grown from five people meeting in its founding pastor 's home in South Korea , to a membership of more than 750,000 people .
It means that the church , in Seoul , has more members than some entire denominations in Europe .
On a typical Sunday , more than 200,000 worshippers attend seven services in a building that feels more like a stadium than a traditional Christian structure .
Sooner or later Christianity will be the major religion in Korea .
All Christians are praying for that right now
Pastor Young - hoon Lee Visiting the church felt like attending a major sporting event - without the crowd control challenges .
Inside , the atmosphere was more like an oversized concert hall , with a full orchestra and massed choir being strangely dwarfed by their surroundings .
' Prosperity gospel '
Traditional hymns and contemporary songs were both sung , with words projected in Korean , English and Japanese onto ( again , enormous ) electronic display screens .
The services are recorded by TV cameras and broadcast on the internet
There were even 10 television cameras being directed from a control room , because services are broadcast to other churches and made available online .
So why is this church so successful ?
According to its senior pastor , Young - hoon Lee , the church has grown because it preaches about how becoming a Christian will have a positive , tangible impact on every believer 's life .
" Jesus will give us spiritual blessing , and prosperity , and physical health , " he says .
The idea that Christianity automatically brings with it material gain is hotly contested by some , who condemn the idea as " the prosperity gospel " .
I certainly could not help but notice that near the entrance of the church are two ATM - style machines , providing an easy way for members to deposit their weekly cash offering .
Pastor
Lee says that so long as Christians give generously to charitable causes , there is no reason why they should not prosper and receive " blessing " themselves .
Crowded clinic
But I asked him whether he really meant that members of the church have improved physical health as a result of their faith ?
" Many people still have problems , but many people overcome problems with faith , " he told me .
A Christian - run clinic provides free healthcare for migrant workers
It is a faith that the thousands who attend here believe profoundly changes their lives .
And Pastor Lee has a dramatic prediction about the long - term impact of Christianity in South Korea .
" Our church is still growing , so sooner or later Christianity will be the major religion in Korea .
All Christians are praying for that right now . "
A few miles away , I witnessed a rather different approach to Christian life and service .
In a run-down building in the south of Seoul , hundreds of migrant workers were jostling for attention in a crowded clinic .
For many of them , the clinic - run by a Christian organisation - is the only place where they can obtain free healthcare .
On the top floor , those being treated are encouraged to attend a worship service - complete with upbeat songs and a rousing sermon .
Love Village
There is a clear commitment from the staff at the centre to introduce those they are helping to the Christian faith .
Lee Sun
Hee , the senior vice - president of the Love Village centre , tells me that the vast majority of patients accepts its Christian principles .
Traditional Confucian dancers - but for how much longer ?
" At our clinic , we spread the gospel .
I 'm not sure whether it's because of their desperation - but when we talk about Christianity , about 95 % accept it .
" We do n't refuse to give treatment because of their religion .
We think God has given us a chance to provide help and serve people . "
This sort of determined Christian commitment is not unusual in South Korea .
Another example is the huge number of Christian missionaries being sent to other countries - with some estimates putting the number at almost 20,000 .
Some reports suggest that only the United States sends more Christian missionaries abroad than South Korea .
In 2007 , a group of Korean Christians was kidnapped in Afghanistan - and two people were killed .
But stories such as these do not seem to be deterring South Korean Christians from signing up for missionary work .
I met Kim Pong Sik , who was preparing to leave South Korea .
I asked him if he had concerns for his future security .
" I am very worried about it , actually .
And every time I had any troubles in my mind , God has given me messages , that I should be bold and brave . "
Neon crosses
He also told me that it was " basic and natural " for him to be prepared to risk his life as a Christian missionary .
So what reasons are given for the rapid expansion of Christianity in South Korea ?
Myoung - kyu Park , a sociology professor at Seoul National University , says Christianity is intrinsically associated with Western prosperity in the minds of many Koreans .
" Unlike Buddhism or Confucianism - traditional religious ways of thinking - Christianity could give Korean people very positive motivation , " he says .
There is certainly little doubt that Christianity is having a significant impact on South Korean society - whether it is the red neon crosses that illuminate the Seoul skyline each evening , or the presence of church bands playing Christian music in the street .
South Korea is modernising rapidly , and embracing Christianity seems to be part of that process .
But at a time of such rapid social change , few can confidently predict the long - term place of Christian faith in the country 's future .

The rivals in the New Jersey governor ’s race met Thursday night in a rambunctious first of three debates , with the Republican Christopher J. Christie assailing Gov. Jon S. Corzine over what he called “ suffocating ” taxes and job losses , and the Democratic incumbent dismissing Mr. Christie ’s fiscal ideas as “ fantasy ” and his criticisms as dishonest .
But it was the little - known independent , Christopher Daggett , a former Environmental Protection Agency official , who all but stole the show , promoting a plan to cut the state ’s skyrocketing property taxes by up to 25 percent and haranguing Mr. Christie in particular for lacking a specific plan of his own .
Over 90 tense minutes , Mr. Daggett , 59 , seemed to metamorphose from a halting speaker in the early going into a sure - footed vaudevillian , puncturing the arguments of his opponents even as they both seemed to go out of their way to agree with him as often as possible .
“ It sounds like both these two guys might vote for me , ” he said .
Mr. Christie , the former United States attorney for New Jersey , has seen his lead over the embattled governor dwindle to just a few percentage points in the polls , after a four - month barrage of attack ads by Mr. Corzine that Mr. Christie called “ shameful . ”
But he focused almost exclusively on Mr. Corzine ’s record , repeatedly ripping into the governor , a former Goldman Sachs chairman , calling him out of touch with the realities on the ground for ordinary residents .
According to an internal memo , EA has closed down Pandemic Studios , which was acquired together with BioWare in 2007 .
Pandemic Studios created games in the Star Wars : Battlefront and Mercenaries series and released Lord of the Rings : Conquest earlier this year .
The Saboteur , the only confirmed project the studio was working on , will be finalized by the EA Montreal studio .
Whether or not the game will still be released on December 8th as is currently planned remains uncertain .
The fate of unannounced projects Pandemic was working on , is uncertain at this time .
For more information , hit the jump .
The senior management team of Pandemic , along with roughly 200 other employees of Pandemic Studios were confirmed to have been let go as part of the closure , with most of the remaining team being allocated to EA Los Angeles , which is currently working on the PC - exclusive RTS Command & Conquer 4 : Tiberian Twilight .
Over the past few months , EA has reduced the number of staff at various studios by roughly 1500 .
Work is getting harder and harder to find these days .
No matter what your area of expertise , the recession is sucking us all dry .
With the abundance of jobs and skilled workers for those jobs , the situation is exacerbated .
This was not the case in ancient times where some jobs were so repulsive that no one would want them – except the scum of society or those who had nothing to lose .
This list looks at ten of them .
10 Nomenclator
The nomenclator held a vitally important job .
He was , effectively , a living - human - calendar cum address book .
Now these days we have our iPhones , our Blackberrys , and all manner of digital devices to remember the people we are introduced to at meetings or ( more embarrassingly ) those we meet when we drink a little too much at a work party .
We have all , no doubt , had that experience where we meet a person , take down their number and name , promise to contact them soon , and , in the sober light of day , wonder who the hell they are .
The ancients had a much better way of dealing with this .
They dragged a slave to their parties and forced him to remember the names and numbers .
Now the most important difference between the iPhone and the nomenclator is that the nomenclator could tell you who the guy was , what you talked about , and whether he is worth contacting .
He can also clarify whether that gorgeous lady you met was made gorgeous by beer googles or not .
Frankly , if it were n’t for an exorbitantly high minimum wage , we would all be better off tossing the iPhone and taking on a modern nomenclator .
But alas , who would want the job ?
Who would want to be paid two bucks an hour to remain sober while everyone else was partying on down ?
Not me that ’s for sure !
Having said that , just in case I am wrong and this job does appeal to some , if there is anyone living in the Wellington region who is looking for low - paid under - the - table work and wants to go to some great parties ( whilst remaining sober ) , check out the Listverse About page and contact me .
9 Slaver
Okay – be prepared for a sensitive topic .
Recently we have had a rather unfortunate event wherein abortion was discussed on a list that caused quite the kerfuffle ( it ’s an English word – find the definition here ) .
You may wonder why I mention it but if you read on you will understand .
A slaver was a gentleman ( used in the most liberal sense of the word possible ) who sold slaves – for work or pleasure .
He would either travel behind armies ( who were off fighting in battle ) so he could capture the losers and sell them to rich Greeks as slaves , or ( and this is where we connect up with the awkward list of the last few days ) , he would buy “ unwanted ” boys ( but only the handsome ones ) from parents so he could castrate them and sell them as lovers to wealthy Greek men who had a taste for young flesh .
They provided ( in rather a repulsive way ) an alternative to adoption to those parents who did n’t want their children .
The downside to this ( somewhat repellant ) career choice , was that despite the demand for handsome young boys , the slavers were often murdered by those who did n’t approve of their trade .
8 Ornatrix
The job of a hairdresser ( ornatrix ) is so often looked down upon these days .
And it was no less so in the ancient times .
But honestly , a modern hairdresser really ought to appreciate her job – because she has it so much better now than ever in the past .
Picture this : your imperial queen is balding and blonde , but the fashion this week is dark lustrous locks .
If it were today , you would either shove a wig on the lady or glue in some extensions .
This was , sadly , not an option for the work - weary ornatrix of days gone by .
In order to provide your mistress with her coal - colored mane , you had to work with a mixture of bile , rotten leeches , and squid ink ( the rotten leeches made for an especially rich black ) .
But it gets worse .
Occasionally fashion would demand blonde hair and your mistress is a natural brunette .
There was no peroxide in those days .
To give her a lovely golden hue you had to mix pigeon poop , and ashes together in the hopes that the chemical combination would strip out the healthy color of her hair .
Oh – and to set the color – you had to pee on her hair .
Worse still was being a slave with beautiful hair – this would often be cut from your head and fashioned into a wig for a rich harridan .
7 Vestal Virgin
Let us start with the job description : “ Teen female virgin wanted for thirty year service .
Must be Roman , having all limbs , and not the child of a slave ” .
This was the job description of the vestal virgin .
These attractive and fully - limbed girls were to spend thirty years giving service to Vesta – goddess of the family .
They had to keep the vestal flame burning and were in a position of great honor – the only female priests in Ancient Rome .
Now if one of these pretty young girls absent - mindedly forget to keep the fire going , she would be flogged till she bled .
If , the heavens forbid , she slipped up in the area of virginity , she was buried alive .
Oh – and to make matters worse , the lazy vestal virgin who slept in and let the fire go out was not just likely to get a flogging : letting the fire go out was a sign of loss of virginity .
In other words , she got flogged , then buried alive – just for sleeping in !
6 Dentist
We have all seen the ridiculous Book of British Smiles ( see item 8 ) on the Simpson ’s and while that may be something of a myth , socialized dental care does n’t seem to be particularly efficient .
But imagine the mouths of the Romans who did n’t brush their teeth , ate craploads of rotten fish sauce ( see item 2 ) , and spent a huge amount of time feasting and vomiting .
Now imagine one with an abscess or a toothache and being the dentist who had to deal with that .
Now those of us who are very fond of wine are okay – as it was commonly used as an anesthetic , but when things got really bad , the poor dentist had to take drastic measures .
This ( sadly ) involved taking a red hot poker to the gums after the tooth was ripped out , and stuffing more rotten fish into the resulting charred hole .
One ca n’t help but wonder who had it worse – the dentist or the patient !
5 Wine Maker
Speaking of my favorite subject wine ,
What job could be better than that of the wine maker – harvesting the grapes in the early hours while the dew still drips from the vines , pressing the fat grapes with one ’s feet whilst singing bawdy epic songs , and finally , after fermentation , drinking the delicious nepenthe on the terrace of an evening ?
Hmm – perhaps drinking wine that was n’t laced with lead !
That ’s right , unfortunately the Romans did n’t understand the dangers of lead and they regularly sweetened their wine with sugar of lead ( much in the same way as we fill our drinks with a variety of cancer - causing sugar replacements these days ) .
To make matters worse , they often served their “ lead - wine ” in lead cups !
The average Roman who enjoyed a quaff or two , consumed up to one gram of lead per day !
4 Praegustator
Praegustator : in other words , a taster .
Following on from wine we have food .
Now who would n’t want to be paid a handsome sum every day for doing nothing but chowing down on the emperor ’s dinner ?
Daily tastes of peacock , swamp hen , wild boar , the list is virtually endless .
But , as is to be expected on this list , there is a caveat .
Most of the emperors were dicks and a lot of people wanted them dead .
And in those days before guns ( or the possibility of getting close enough to fire a bow and arrow ) the easiest way to kill someone was to poison them .
So , forgetting the lead - laced wine which would have eventually taken its toll anyway , the emperors were certain to be dished up a plate of some rancid poisonous delicacies at least once or twice in their career .
Herein steps the praegustator ( the pre-taster ) .
This poor schmuck was the guy who had to have a mouthful of everything the Emperor planned to eat .
Needless to say , history has shown us that more pre-tasters died than emperors .
3 Rower
Most of us are aware of the experience of going to the gym to lose a few pounds .
The burning ache in the shoulders and arms when our personal trainer forces us onto the satanic rowing machine with no desire other than to make us feel bad because we dragged them out of bed at 6 am .
Now fortunately for us we are paying the bills so we can tell the trainer to shove off and stop after three minutes .
And that brings us to the poor unfortunate souls who had to row the Greek war boats during the good old ancient days .
First of all , most were slaves and were paid nothing more than a daily meal .
Secondly , when that nasty burn set in they could n’t just stop and demand a latte break .
They would get flogged .
Imagine your innocuous personal trainer pulling out a cat ’o ’ nine - tails when your arms started to ache .
Imagine being flayed because the chubby guy on the machine next to you is going half a mile faster than you .
That was the life of the rower .
2 Armpit Plucker
I was tempted to say nothing about this item as the title is disgusting enough !
But , alas , I would feel like I were cheating were I to stop there .
Some years ago I was a student of pugilism .
We were a small class of teenaged boys being taught by an ex-Soviet Nuclear submarine commander who had emigrated to New Zealand ( he had some amazing stories to tell which I may one day share here ) .
He worked us hard .
Now I was a teen who was very concerned about personal hygiene .
Sadly the same was not true for the majority of my class .
The gym smelt like someone had sprayed body odor especially to “ man ” us up .
This is not a new thing .
The ancients were incredibly fond of their sports ( often naked or with nothing on but the foreskin gripper – the kynodesme – see item 9 ) .
Because these athletes were working out all day in the hot sun and were aware of the natural ability of hair to retain unpleasant odors , the men ( young and old ) went through a daily routine of having their underarm hairs plucked out by the armpit plucker – after all , they were most likely to spend the evening in very close company with others at the public baths .
Now the armpit plucker was not the same as a modern beautician who plucks eyebrows – these were professionals who were dealing with incredibly hairy armpits full of smells that one does n’t want to think about at all .
No amount of grappa could prepare you for this job .
1 Delator
Latin is an amazing language – it manages to make everything sound lovely .
For example : pedacabo – pronounced “ ped - a - cah - bo ” – it just rolls right off the tongue .
Unfortunately it means “ one who is anally penetrated . ”
Delator is similar .
In modern English , the delator might be called a snitch , a rat , a fink , an informant , a stoolie , and a huge variety of other unpleasant names for a person who is , basically , a nark .
These were men whose sole job in life was to tell on their neighbors .
For every little misdemeanor .
They make the Nazi Youth look good !
These bastards even reported people for failure to pay their taxes !
Unfortunately power often goes to our heads and these sneaky scumbags started making stuff up because they were paid regardless of the truth behind their accusations .
If there was ever going to be a social pariah , these were the guys who were it .
The most famous delator ( though not Roman ) was , of course , Judas .

CANADA Dear Mike ,
Well , tell your dead grandpa the old German ( Goethe ) saying : “ The longer you look , the more stars you see … ” I prefer that to going crazy .
It ’s the same with meditation , how you can find the entire world in a single object or activity .
Once you commit your life to a passion , you find that things open up .
Still , it seems like a paradox .
Most people never fully commit to their art , out of fear of losing options .
But commitment brings more options than you ’d ever lose .
This past summer , I recorded the collection of stories enclosed in this box .
These are the best I ’ve read on book tours since “ Fight Club ” in 1996 – the tour where no more than two people attended each of my book events , a very - humbling tour .
Listen with care because the dreaded “ Guts ” story is here , but so is a bonus : a new , unpublished story , “ Cold Calling . ”
Even for a writer , words get … boring .
Instead , I wanted to send you smells and sounds and flavors .
If we never meet in person , please consider this box as your own private book event .
Something nicer than a quick “ hello ” and handshake in Berkeley .
I wonder at what point your grandfather stopped writing or discussing his writing .
What happened .
How did it stop serving him ?
Please , make sure your art is always serving you , that way you ’ll never stop .
And thanks for the “ Spy Guy ” panels !

Viewpoints Usable Security : How to Get It
Photograph by Ian Lloyd
Computer security today is in bad shape : people worry about it a lot and spend a good deal of money on it , but most systems are insecure .
Security is not about perfection .
In principle we can make secure software and set it up correctly , but in practice we can't , for two reasons :
Bugs : Secure systems are complicated , hence imperfect .
Of course software always has bugs , but even worse , security must be set up : user accounts and passwords , access control on resources , and trust relationships between organizations .
In a world of legacy systems , networked computers , mobile code , and changing relationships between organizations , setup is error - prone .
Conflicts :
Even more important , security gets in the way of other things you want .
In the words of General B.W. Chidlaw , " If you want security , you must be prepared for inconvenience . " a
For users and administrators , security adds hassle and blocks progress .
For software developers , it interferes with features and with time to market .
To make things worse , security is fractal : Each part is as complex as the whole , and there are always more things to worry about .
Security experts always have a plausible scenario that demands a new option , and a plausible threat that demands a new defense .
There 's no resting place on the road to perfection .
Security is really about risk management : balancing the loss from breaches against the costs of security .
Unfortunately , both are difficult to measure .
Loss is the chance of security breaches times the expense of dealing with them .
Cost is partly in dollars budgeted for firewalls , software , and help desks but mostly in the time users spend typing and resetting passwords , responding to warnings , finding workarounds so they can do their jobs , and so forth .
Usually all of these factors are unknown , and people seldom even try to estimate them .
More broadly , security is about economics .
2
Users , administrators , organizations , and vendors respond to the incentives they perceive .
Users just want to get their work done ; they do n't have good reasons to value security , and view it as a burden .
If it 's hard or opaque , they will ignore it or work around it ; given today 's poor usability they are probably doing the right thing .
If you force them , less useful work will get done .
1
Tight security usually leads first to paralysis and then to weak security , which no one complains about until there is a crisis .
Administrators want to prevent obvious security breaches , and avoid blame if something does go wrong .
Organizations want to manage their risk sensibly , but because they do n't know the important parameters they can't make good decisions or explain their policies to users , and tend to oscillate between too much security and too little .
They do n't measure the cost of the time users spend on security and therefore do n't demand usable security .
Vendors thus have no incentive to supply it ; a vendor 's main goal is to avoid bad publicity .
Operationally , security is about policy and isolation .
Policy is the statement of what behavior is allowed : for example , only particular users can approve expense reports for their direct reports or only certain programs should run .
Isolation ensures the policy is always applied .
Usability is pretty bad for both .
Back to Top
Policy
Policy is what users and administrators see and set .
The main reason we do n't have usable security is that users do n't have a model of security they can understand .
Without such a model , the users ' view of security is just a matter of learning which buttons to push in some annoying dialog boxes , and it's not surprising they do n't take it seriously and can't remember what to do .
The most common user model today is " Say OK to any question about security . "
What do we want from a user model ?
It has to be simple ( with room for elaboration on demand ) .
It has to minimize hassle for the user , at least most of the time .
It has to be true ( given some assumptions ) .
It is just as real as the system 's code ; terms like " user illusion " make as much sense as saying that bytes in RAM are an illusion over the reality of electrons in silicon .
It does not have to reflect the implementation directly , although it does have to map to things the code can deal with .
An example of a successful user model is the desktop , folders , and files of today 's client operating systems .
Although there is no formal standard for this model , it is clear enough that users can easily move among PC , Macintosh , and Unix systems .
The standard technical model for security is the access control model shown in the figure , in which isolation ensures there is no way to get to objects except through channels guarded by policy , which decides what things agents ( principals ) are allowed to do with objects ( resources ) .
Authentication identifies the principal , authorization protects the resource , and auditing records what happens ; these are the gold standard for security .
3
Recovery is not shown ; it fixes damaged data by some kind of undo , such as restoring an old version .
In most systems the implementation follows this model closely , but it is not very useful for ordinary people : they take isolation for granted , and they do n't think in terms of objects or resources .
We need models that are good for users , and that can be compiled into access control policy on the underlying objects .
A user model for security deals with policy and history .
It has a vocabulary of objects and actions ( nouns and verbs ) for talking about what happens .
History is what did happen ; it 's needed for recovering from past problems and learning how to prevent future ones .
Policy is what should happen , in the form of some general rules plus a few exceptions .
The policy must be small enough that you can easily look at all of it .
Today , we have no adequate user models for security and no clear idea of how to get them .
There 's not even agreement on whether we can elicit models from what users already know , or need to invent and promote new ones .
It will take the combined efforts of security experts , economists , and cognitive scientists to make progress .
Here are a few tentative examples of what might work .
You need to know who can do what to which things .
" Who " is a particular person , a group of people like your Facebook friends , anyone with some attribute like " over 13 , " or any program with some attribute like " approved by Microsoft IT . "
" What " is an action like read or write .
" Which " is everything in a particular place like your public folder , or everything labeled medical stuff ( implying that data can be labeled ) .
An administrator also needs declarative policy like , " Any account 's owner can transfer cash out . "
A time machine lets you recover from damage to your data : you can see what the state was at midnight on any previous day .
You can't change the past , but you can copy things from there to the current state just as you can copy things from a backup disk .

Isolation
Perfect isolation ensures that the only way for an input to reach an object is through a channel controlled by policy .
Isolation fails when an input has an effect that is not controlled by policy ; this is a bug .
Some common bugs today are buffer overruns , cross -site scripting , and SQL code injection .
Executable inputs like machine instructions or JavaScript are obviously dangerous , but modern HTML is so complex and expressive that there are many ways to trick a browser into running code , and widely used programs with simple inputs like JPEG have had buffer overruns .
A modern client OS , together with the many applications that run on it , is bound to have security bugs .
Users can't evaluate these dangers .
The only sure way to avoid the effects of dangerous inputs is to reject them .
A computer that is not connected to any network rejects all inputs , and is probably secure enough for most purposes .
Unfortunately , it is n't very useful .
A more plausible approach has two components :
Divide inputs into safe ones , handled by software that you trust to be bug - free ( that is , to enforce security policy ) , and dangerous ones , for which you lack such confidence .
Vanilla ANSI text files are probably safe and unfiltered HTML is dangerous ; cases in between require judgments that balance risk against inconvenience .
Accept dangerous inputs only from sources that are accountable enough , that is , that can be punished if they misbehave .
Then if the input turns out to be harmful , you can take appropriate revenge on its source .

Accountability
People think that security in the real world is based on locks .
In fact , real - world security depends mainly on deterrence , and hence on the possibility of punishment .
The reason your house is not burgled is not that the burglar can't get through the lock on the front door ; rather , it 's that the chance of getting caught and sent to jail , while small , is large enough to make burglary uneconomic .
It is difficult to deter attacks on a computer connected to the Internet because it is difficult to find the bad guys .
The way to fix this is to communicate only with parties that are accountable , that you can punish .
There are many different punishments : money fines , ostracism from some community , firing , jail , and other options .
Often it is enough if you can undo an action ; this is the financial system 's main tool for security .
Some punishments require identifying the responsible party in the physical world , but others do not .
For example , to deter spam , reject email unless it is signed by someone you know or comes with " optional postage " in the form of a link certified by a third party you trust , such as Amazon or the U.S. Postal Service ; if you click the link , the sender contributes a dollar to a charity .
The most common user model today is " Say OK to any question about security . "
The choice of safe inputs and the choice of accountable sources are both made by your system , not by any centralized authority .
These choices will often depend on information from third parties about identity , reputation , and so forth , but which parties to trust is also your choice .
All trust is local .
To be practical , accountability needs an ecosystem that makes it easy for senders to become accountable and for receivers to demand it .
If there are just two parties they can get to know each other in person and exchange signing keys .
Because this does n't scale , we also need third parties that can certify identities or attributes , as they do to - day for cryptographic keys .
This need not hurt anonymity unduly , since the third parties can preserve it except when there is trouble , or accept bonds posted in anonymous cash .
This scheme is a form of access control : you accept input from me only if I am accountable .
There is a big practical difference , though , because accountability is for punishment or undo .
Auditing is crucial , to establish a chain of evidence , but very permissive access control is OK because you can deal with misbehavior after the fact rather than preventing it up front .

Freedom
The obvious problem with accountability is that you often want to communicate with parties you do n't know much about , such as unknown vendors or gambling sites .
To reconcile accountability with the freedom to go anywhere on the Internet , you need two ( or more ) separate machines : a green machine that demands accountability , and a red one that does not .
On the green machine you keep important things , such as personal , family and work data , backup files , and so forth .
It needs automated management to handle the details of accountability for software and Web sites , but you choose the manager and decide how high to set the bar : like your house , or like a bank vault .
Of course the green machine is not perfectly secureno practical machine can bebut it is far more secure than what you have today .
On the red machine you live wild and free .
You do n't put anything there that you really care about keeping secret or really do n't want to lose .
If anything goes wrong , you reset the red machine to some known state .
This scheme has significant unsolved problems .
Virtual machines can keep green isolated from red , though there are details to work out .
However , we do n't know how to give the user some control over the flow of information between green and red without losing too much security .
Back to Top
Conclusion
Things are so bad for usable security that we need to give up on perfection and focus on essentials .
The root cause of the problem is economics : we do n't know the costs either of getting security or of not having it , so users quite rationally do n't care much about it .
Therefore , vendors have no incentive to make security usable .
To fix this we need to measure the cost of security , and especially the time users spend on it .
We need simple models of security that users can understand .
To make systems trustworthy we need accountability , and to preserve freedom we need separate green and red machines that protect things you really care about from the wild Internet .

UPDATED STORY : Steven Tyler : Aerosmith not breaking up ; Perry : New singer needed
Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry said today that singer Steven Tyler quit the band following a recent concert in Abu Dhabi .
Bassist Tom Hamilton told the Boston Herald ’s Inside Track that there is dissension among the “ Bad Boys From Boston , ” but that he hopes things can be worked out .
He dismissed a report that guitarist Brad Whitford discussed the possiblity of Aerosmith finding a new frontman .
However , Perry told the Las Vegas Sun today that he believes Tyler is history .
“ Steven quit as far as I can tell , ” Perry said from his Boston home .
“ I do n’t know anymore than you do about it .
I got off the plane two nights ago .
I saw online that Steven said that he was going to leave the band .
I do n’t know for how long , indefinitely or whatever .
Other than that , I do n’t know . ”
Part of the problem , he says , is that Tyler does n’t return his phone calls .
“ He ’s notorious for that , ” Perry said .
“ That ’s one thing I ’ve learned to live with .
I try to overlook it .
I like to pick my battles .
Frankly , the last few months I ’ve been wanting not to rock the boat .
I do n’t want him canceling any more gigs .
We really wanted to do these last four .
We just kind of did n’t want to call him out or anything and get him anymore pissed off , for whatever reason .
So we just let things lie .
So we did the gigs and , like I said , I got off the plane and saw this online .
That ’s how I know about it . ”
Perry will perform his Joe Perry Project Nov. 28 at the Las Vegas House of Blues , performing from his latest release “ Have Guitar , Will Travel . ”
Most of Aerosmith ’s recent world tour was canceled in August after Tyler fell from the stage at a Sturgis , S.D. , concert and broke his shoulder .
The band members were unhappy with Tyler over the incident .
However , Aerosmith salvaged the final leg of the tour , including two shows in Hawaii and one Sunday at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix before more than 50,000 fans .
After the Middle Eastern concert the band parted ways with Perry going to London to attend the Classic Rock & Roll of Honour awards ceremony on Monday .
Perry said he arrived home in Boston on Wednesday and read on the Internet that Tyler planned to leave the band .
“ He has had no contact with me or the other band members , ” Perry said .
He says he hopes to keep Aerosmith together , with or without Tyler , but he was so stunned by recent developments he does n’t know what ’s going to happen .
“ Right now I ’m adjusting to how we ’re going to go on , ” Perry says .
“ Aerosmith is such a powerful band , I mean it ’s like a steam locomotive .
You just ca n’t disregard 40 years of four guys who play together as well as they do .
We ’re just trying to – at least I am – trying to figure out what direction the band should take .
“ As far as replacing Steve , it ’s not just about that , it ’s also four guys that play extremely well together , and I ’m not going to see that go to waste .
I really do n’t know what path it ’s going to take at this point , but we ’ll probably find somebody else that will sing in those spots where we need a singer and then we ’ll be able to move the Aerosmith up a notch , move the vibe up a notch . ”
Perry believes
Tyler has been planning on leaving for a while .
“ Obviously he has n’t been giving 100 percent to this thing for a long time , ” Perry said .
“ He ’s obviously had this planned for a long time .
To disregard his brothers to the point where we have to find out about it on the Internet – it ’s like , ' See you later , Bud . ’
I still care for him as a person , or at least the person I used to know .
But things change . ”
Aerosmith rose to popularity in the ’70s with a combination of hard rock and power ballads only to be derailed by drug and alcohol abuse .
After Tyler completed rehab in 1986 , the band rose to prominence again .
There were rumors last year that Tyler had checked back into rehab after more than 20 years of sobriety .
Perry himself left the band for two years in 1979 .
While he was away he created the solo Joe Perry Project , which has now released five albums .
“ The circumstances were different then , ” Perry said .
“ We ’d been touring pretty much nonstop for eight years and the band was just pretty much burned out on each other .
We needed a break .
We needed to take a vacation but blood was running so hot I just had to leave , had to get out of there .
But I certainly was n’t going to stop playing so I put out a solo project . ”
WASHINGTON  Tired of the government bailing out banks ?
Get ready for this : officials may soon ask banks to bail out the government .
Senior regulators say they are seriously considering a plan to have the nation ’s healthy banks lend billions of dollars to rescue the insurance fund that protects bank depositors .
That would enable the fund , which is rapidly running out of money because of a wave of bank failures , to continue to rescue the sickest banks .
The plan , strongly supported by bankers and their lobbyists , would be a major reversal of fortune .
A hallmark of the financial crisis has been the decision by successive administrations over the last year to lend hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to large and small banks .
“ It ’s a nice irony , ” said Karen Shaw Petrou , managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics , a consulting company .
“ Like so much of this crisis , this is an issue that involves the least worst options . ”
Breakthrough that could help cancer victims grow new breasts
A patient has a breast scan to check for tumours .
Cancer survivors could one day be able to regrow their own breasts after a technique used on pigs
A revolutionary operation could soon allow women to regrow their breasts after cancer surgery .
The technique offers fresh hope to the thousands of women every year whose breasts are removed in a mastectomy .
Current reconstructive techniques produce far from perfect results and can leave scars .
The new method would create breasts that look and feel more natural , while reducing the amount of scarring .
It would also give women who have endured months of gruelling treatment a huge boost to their confidence .
Breast cancer affects more than 45,000 British women a year and kills more than 1,000 a month .
Around 12,000 women , including some whose genes put them at high risk of the disease , have a mastectomy each year .
The latest reconstructive technique , which could be in widespread use in three years , involves growing breast tissue from a teaspoonful of cells .
The Australian doctors behind the surgery have already successfully tested it on pigs and plan to carry out operations on women within months .
Phillip Marzella , of Melbourne 's Bernard O'Brien Institute , said : ' We hope it will have a significant impact on the world .
' We also like to think that it would alleviate the shock that a woman feels when she is diagnosed with breast cancer , to know she could possibly grow her breasts back . '
The technique involves inserting a bra-cup - shaped chamber under a woman 's chest skin containing 5 ml of stem cells , drawn from her fat .
A blood vessel from under the woman's arm is redirected through the chamber where it supplies the area with oxygen and nutrients .
The stem cells , ' master cells ' widely seen as a repair kit for the body , turn into fat cells over several months , eventually multiplying enough to fill the chamber .
The woman would then have a second operation to remove the chamber , although the researchers are hopeful of creating biodegradable devices that dissolve instead .
In pigs , the entire process took six weeks .
But it is expected it will take six to eight months for women to regrow breast tissue .
The Australian trial will involve five or six women who have had a full or partial mastectomy .
The doctors will not attempt to regenerate entire breasts but simply check that it is possible to regrow fat tissue in the breast area .
If larger trials show the technique to be safe and effective , it could quickly be in widespread use .
Dr Sarah Cant , of the British charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer , described it as ' extraordinary ' .
' The next stage is to see if this technique will be safe and effective in people and only then can we assess its true potential , ' she added .
The pig that scientists successfully grew breasts on .
The procedure could one day be used to help restore other damaged body parts
' We know that losing a breast can impact a woman 's self - esteem and so any new , potentially improved , breast reconstruction techniques will be very welcome . '
But Anthony Hollander , professor of tissue engineering at Bristol University , warned : ' They 'll have to be able to demonstrate a technique that guarantees that all the cancerous cells are removed and none are grown up in the process , so there is still some way to go . '
Wonder what makes your favorite SF authors green with envy when it comes to creating strange new worlds ?
Now 's your chance to find out , as the site SF Signal asks twelve prominent writers - including our very own Jeff VanderMeer - just what kind of world - building sets their mind - a - tingle .
Amongst the more expected selections - Ursula LeGuin's The Dispossessed , Larry Niven 's Ringworld and Frank Herbert 's Dune all get shout - outs - Orson Scott Card manages to bring up a name that you probably did n't see coming :
For years , I have told my writing students that the best example of world - building in fiction is James Clavell 's " Shogun . "
When you read this book , the world - creation is so thorough that you think you can speak Japanese .
You can't - but it feels as if you can .

L. E. Modesitt , Jr. , on the other hand , plays the role of the buzzkill :
I 'm not going to be terribly enthusiastic about most world - building that I read , because my non-authorial background is rooted in analyzing the building blocks of societies , especially from environmental , political , economic , historic , and technical points of view .
In this regard , few authors deal well with economics , fewer still with environmental or technical / engineering issues , and almost none with any sort of politics except copying feudalism , corrupted democratic systems , or monarchies .
That does n't even take into account trade , climate , social history , disease , and a few dozen other items .
In the end , most so - called world building is the verbal equivalent of " Houdini-ism , " where the reader tends to think more is there than is because of the distractions of a few well - placed details and props ... and , for most readers , that 's exactly what they want .

Sen. Baucus ( D - Mont. ) has been quietly staking his claim on major aspects , including financing for cap and trade .
Baucus makes a grab for climate bill
For liberal Democrats unhappy with the way Max Baucus is handling health care reform , here ’s another dose of bad news :
He ’s got his hands on climate and energy , too .
Behind closed doors , Sen .
Baucus has been staking his claim on major aspects of the climate bill , including financing for a cap - and - trade system .
Advertisement
His power play could put Baucus at the helm of the Obama administration ’s domestic agenda , giving an unpredictable Montana Democrat control over legislative proposals that could define the Democratic Party for years to come .
“ He ’s swung from liberal to conservative , ” said Montana pollster Craig Wilson , noting Baucus ’s support of the 2001 Bush tax cuts and the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill .
“ He ’s been a bit of an unpredictable vote for the Democrats . ”
Yet Baucus remains a signpost for moderates and could draw more conservative members of his party to support the Obama administration ’s key initiatives .
“ The old saying used to be ‘ as Maine goes , so goes the nation , ’ ” says Frank O’Donnell , head of Clean Air Watch , an environmental advocacy group .
“ On climate , it ’s ‘ as Baucus goes , so goes the Senate . ’ ”
But liberals have complained that Baucus ’s obsession with getting Republican support for the health care bill has slowed progress on the issue , and they worry the same thing will happen on climate change .
In public , Baucus has kept a laserlike focus on the health care negotiations — honoring the administration ’s wishes to put cap and trade on the back burner until Congress completes its work on health care .
“ We ’ve got health care .
It ’s going to take up most of the month .
It ’s going to be difficult to also do [ climate ] , ” he told Environment & Energy Daily this week .
But while Baucus has been the public face of health care negotiations , a dedicated team of his aides has been working on the climate bill .
As the Finance Committee chairman and the second - most - senior Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee , Baucus is in a uniquely powerful position on climate issues .
The Finance Committee is charged with overseeing the flow of money in and out of government , a jurisdiction that Baucus believes gives his committee control over how hundreds of billions of dollars in pollution allocations would be distributed to industry and consumers under a cap - and - trade system .
That turf puts Baucus in direct conflict with Sen. Barbara Boxer , chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee , who believes her committee has control over cap - and - trade allocations .
Boxer would fold the provisions into her broader climate and energy bill , which would establish caps on greenhouse gas emissions for the next several decades , according to Senate Democratic aides .
Massachusetts Democratic Sen. John Kerry , who ’s working with Boxer to draft the climate and energy bill , says they are still working out the jurisdictional dispute with Baucus .
And Boxer said that she welcomes input from all six committees with jurisdiction over the complex bill .
“ The committees are all going to do what they perceive is in their jurisdiction , ” she said .
“ There may well be overlap — just like in the health bill . ”
It would be up to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to iron out any differences and craft all the committees ’ provisions into one omnibus bill .
But Boxer and Baucus bring dramatically different approaches to the climate issue , so combining their ideas wo n’t be easy .
Boxer , a decades - long champion of environmental causes , is trusted by many advocates who fear the legislation will be weakened in the Senate .
Baucus , by contrast , has been a much less reliable vote on environmental issues .
The League of Conservation Voters gave him a lifetime ranking of 67 percent , even though Baucus supported the cap - and - trade bill sponsored last year by Connecticut independent Sen. Joe Lieberman and former Virginia Republican Sen. John Warner .
The issue could also be a difficult one for Baucus back home .
Montana gets 65 percent of its electricity from coal - fired power plants and is also home to several oil refineries .
But Montana ’s energy mix , some argue , could help Baucus persuade moderate Democrats to support the legislation .
Coal - and manufacturing - state Democrats may trust a version of the bill drafted by Baucus instead of Boxer .
And the Finance Committee , stacked with moderate Democrats , may be a better place for dealing with a climate bill as Democrats try to find the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster .
“ His committee is much more representative of the views of the Senate as a whole , ” said Dan Weiss , director of climate strategy at the liberal Center for American Progress .
“ Plus , to put together 60 votes , you ’re going to need the votes of moderates like Baucus , so having him in on part of the ground floor is a plus . ”
Baucus ’s work on health care could also have a significant impact on the climate bill .
If Baucus can broker a bipartisan health care bill out of his committee , it would lay the groundwork for a similar compromise on climate .
And if he can’t , it could kill the Senate ’s momentum to tackle another controversial issue .
“ Everything ’s related to everything here in Congress , ” said Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) , chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee .
“ People work together on one set of issues , [ then ] they feel more comfortable on another set . ”

Natural Rights and Living Law : Toward an Integration of Rothbard and Leoni
If libertarianism wishes to give up modern political categories , it has to think about law in a different way .
Murray N. Rothbard , the most important exponent of the radical libertarian school , is right when he rejects the historicism and relativism of legal realism and when — for the same reasons — he criticizes Hayek and Leoni .
But unfortunately , he does not really grasp the function of the evolution into classic natural law .
Furthermore , his idea of building a libertarian code is completely inconsistent with his frequent references to the Greek and Christian legal heritage .
In For a New Liberty , Rothbard points out that the history of a changing and evolving law can be useful in order to find just rules : " since we have a body of common law principles to draw on , however , the task of reason in correcting and amending the common law would be far easier than trying to construct a body of systematic legal principles de novo out of the thin air . "
But the relationship between common law and natural law must be seen differently .
Common law is not only an interesting tool for discovering natural law : it has its specific role .
Positive law needs to interact with natural law principles , but even the latter cannot be considered as self - sufficient .
Moreover , in his defense of rationality , Rothbard does not realize that law cannot be entirely read into the praxeological framework , which is axiomatic and deductive .
The division of theory and history puts some disciplines into opposition with others , but above all it makes a distinction within any single field of study .
Economics , for instance , is a theoretical science if considered as political economics , but a historical and empiric activity if it analyzes what happened in the past .
This is also true for legal studies , because they have a theoretical part but , at the same time , include many other aspects which , on the contrary , are historical and cannot be examined using logical and a priori methods .
In his methodological writings , Rothbard distinguishes between empiricism and experience , and remarks that the refusal of the first does not imply a devaluation of the second .
When he criticizes Mises for his Kantian approach , he finds in human experience exactly the main source of the axioms , the fundamental truths that are the starting point of a theory based on deductive logic .
​ But before the law , Rothbard seems to minimize the contextual and nontheoretical dimension of a large part of legal controversies and especially of positive law .
Using the Thomist framework , in this essay I will emphasize the importance of the lex naturalis , at the same time highlighting a lex humana deeply rooted in the complexity of different ages and societies , related to the subjectivity and specificity of opinions which cannot be fruitfully examined by a praxeological approach .
Many problems , and even some inconsistencies of Rothbardian theory , are a consequence of it .
Moreover , the way Rothbard deals with the arguments of causality and liability shows an inadequate understanding of the anthropology of the Austrian School , which moves from a study of human action ( intentional and rational ) and not by a simple behaviorist analysis .
In integrating Rothbardian libertarianism with positive law , an important contribution comes from Bruno Leoni , who in Freedom and the Law and other writings developed an original contribution to classical liberalism .
The Italian scholar can help to improve some parts of Rothbard 's libertarian theory of law .
If the author of The Ethics of Libertyis much more grounded in natural law and even less naïve before Wertfreiheit , Leoni can correct some limits of the Rothbardian approach and its incapacity to perceive the specificity of law : a practical and largely empirical science , historically situated and essentially oriented to finding reasonable solutions for very specific cases .
If philosophy of law has to investigate the eternal and immutable principles of justice , juridical scholarship must find the best translation of these for the specific problems of a society .
For this reason , taking Leoni seriously means imagining a meeting point of natural law doctrine and the requirements of a positive law as a reality in evolution .
And it implies an effort to transfer into the legal context the Misesian methodology and its radical separation of theory and history : the sphere of axiomatic and deductive studies ( praxeology ) and the sphere of research based on experience ( history ) .
We have to remember that specific attention to the historical and evolving features of legal orders has been a crucial element of the Austrian School since its origins .
In his Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences , Carl Menger praises the Historical School of Jurisprudence ( Gustav Hugo , Friedrich Carl von Savigny , Barthold Georg Niebuhr ) , whose origins he dated back to Edmund Burke .
Menger also highlights the individualistic content of evolutionary law with the goal of helping the classical liberal tradition to rediscover its lost roots :
law , like language , is ( at least originally ) not the product in general of an activity of public authorities aimed at producing it , nor in particular is it the product of positive legislation .
It is , instead , the unintended result of a higher wisdom , of the historical development of the nations .
It is exactly in this sense that we can understand Leoni 's preference for evolutionary law ( Anglo - Saxon law and Roman jus civile ) : a law not oriented to preserve tradition or spontaneous order per se .
On the contrary , Leoni thinks that a polycentric and evolutionary order is in a better position to safeguard individual rights .
Rules that emerge from the interpersonal exchange of claims are tools that can effectively protect society from the rulers .
As a student of English legal history , Leoni shows a strong interest in the common law of nature that was at the heart of Edward Coke 's perspective .
In fact , in that theory law does not express an antirationalist attitude , but , on the contrary , embodies natural reason emerging in an evolutionary way .
This legal culture is improved by various contributions ( practical , pragmatic , professional ) of many people .
In this way , law is the consequence of a human activity oriented towards bettering reality using intelligence and experience .
Criticizing modern legal systems , Leoni remarks that
there is far more legislation , there are far more group decisions , far more rigid choices , and far fewer " laws written in living tables , " far fewer individual decisions , far fewer free choices in all contemporary political systems that would be necessary in order to preserve individual freedom of choice .
Even if he never adhered to a consistent natural law theory , Leoni tried a sort of reconciliation of natural law and legal realism ( positive law rightly understood ) , exploring the possibility of conjugating the flexibility of ancient common law and the just principles of a universal moral theory .
Leoni had a strong interest in the exploration of the libertarian potentialities of a similar perspective .
In his writings , there are many elements of a radical libertarianism refusing any coercion .
When some participants of the Claremont seminar about Freedom and the Law asked him who should choose the judges in a free society , he answered : " it is rather immaterial to establish in advance who will appoint the judges , for , in a sense , everybody could do so , as happens to a certain extent when people resort to private arbiters to settle their own quarrels . "
In his opinion , the contemporary , statist system should disappear , leaving room for a competitive order of private courts .
The convergence of Leoni and Rothbard is evident on many levels , because both imagine the end of the state monopoly on justice and security , with the purpose of opening the road to an institutional competition between people in charge to avoid criminal behaviors .
It is also for this reason that Rothbardian libertarian theory can find in Leoni and , above all , in his understanding of law the way to overcome its theoretical and practical difficulties .
From Praxeology to Thymology : The Role of Positive Law
In its daily development , law refers back to principles , but at the same time it concerns modest but not negligible disputes .
Legal reasoning lives essentially in this pragmatic context and it leaves the specific topics of natural law in the background .
In Mises 's thought , there is a notion that is extremely useful in helping us grasp the relationship between theory and practice in the law .
In fact , in Theory and History , he opposes praxeology to thymology , which is in close relationship with history .
Thymology is a branch of history and " derives its knowledge from historical experience . "
It stands for that set of empirical knowledge of psychological , sociological and even factual character that we use to find our way in relationships with other people .
This " literary psychology " is the condition of a rational behavior : " for lack of any better tool , we must take recourse to thymology if we want to anticipate other people 's future attitudes and actions . "
When Leoni returns to the legal realism tradition ( to the law in action that Roscoe Pound opposes to the law in books ) and remarks on a correspondence between positive law and what is foreseeable ( often using the formula id quod plerumque accidit ) , the highlights that the positive law is always intelligible in a thymologic perspective .
In his explicit purpose of applying Misesian methodology to law , Leoni discovers a praxeological dimension ( the most theoretical part , coinciding with the analysis of the individual claims and their interaction ) , but also another thymological dimension ( entirely depending on experience , common opinions and traditions ) .
His idea is that positive law has a strong relationship with customs .
As practical activity , law must reduce uncertainty : it is for this reason that a creditor 's claim is legal , because generally a debtor pays back what he has received , while the thief 's claim is illegal , because generally people do not steal .
The probabilistic analysis is purely empirical , but it is not unreasonable .
Our behavior is led very often by the rationality of our past experiences and by our prejudices .
In this sense , Leonian theory of the individual claim is at the same time praxeological and thymological .
It is praxeological because it draws in a deductive way the theoretical conditions of the exchange and the meeting of different individual claims .
When , in his writings , he opposes the point of view of the legal professionals ( moving from the norms ) and the perspective of the philosophers ( interested in the origin of the rules ) , his aim is to reject the positivism prevalent in legal theory .
He has the project of grasping the a priori categories — à la Reinach — subtending all legal orders .
When he finds in the individual claim the starting point of a juridical relation , Leoni thinks he has understood a universal datum : his " demand and supply law . "
If prices emerge from the meeting of the actions of people supplying and demanding , the norms are the effect of the interaction of different claims .
This is a universal regularity and , on this ground , he also develops his theoretical ( praxeological ) remarks about the relationship between legislation and living law , certainty and law , and so on .
But — as in Mises — this positive evaluation of praxeology does not imply a negative opinion of history or of the competence of lawyers .
On the contrary , Leoni has the ambition of describing the distinct but connected roles of every sphere .
For this reason , his theory is largely thymological when he remarks that , if it is true — as Mises says — that " thymology tells no more than that man is driven by various innate instincts , various passions , and various ideas , " then it is evident that norms are accepted when they satisfy the claims , the principles and the desires largely shared in a specific society ; and the law professionals are exactly well - informed about this peculiar and " local " environment .
When Leoni emphasizes the qualities of the jus civile and the ancient common law , he aims to highlight the role of the lawyers and of all the people engaged in the solution to specific and concrete disputes .
Positive Law and History
This is a very important point in a large part of the philosophical tradition .
The main Greek and medieval thinkers were clear about the link between natural law ( universal ) and the contingent ( historically defined and , lato sensu , subjective ) dimension of situations that we can understand only in specific contexts , as result of the cross of individual preferences .
In Aristotle , for instance , it is clear that there are some universal principles judging every positive law .
This passage is very outspoken in this regard :
Universal law is the law of nature .
For there really is , as every one to some extent divines , a natural justice and injustice that is binding on all men , even on those who have no association or covenant with each other .
It is this that Sophocles 's Antigone clearly means when she says that the burial of Polyneices was a just act in spite of the prohibition : she says that it was just by nature .
Not of to - day or yesterday it is ,
But lives eternal : none can date its birth .
At the same time , Aristotle holds the opinion that " there are two kinds of right and wrong conduct towards others , one provided for by written ordinances , the other by unwritten . "
In the second group , a class " springs from exceptional goodness or badness " and it is related to honor , gratitude , friendship , and so on .
But the other " makes up for the defects of a community 's written code of law .
This is what we call equity . "
This Aristotelian notion of equity is very important .
And , at the same time , we have to perceive the relationship between this idea of equity ( " the sort of justice which goes beyond the written law " ) and the idea of phronesis , as prudence and practical wisdom .
Equity and phronesis do not destroy the universal natural law , but they give us a way to understand how it can be possible to arrange some ( difficult ) situations .
We can build a bridge from the natural law and the positive law of our — imperfect — relationship with the others .
The perception of the human limits and the complexity of the world push us to appreciate the knowledge preserved by a complex system of legal notions , as developed through centuries of legal history .
For Aristotle , it was clear that a purely deductive method would not suffice to satisfy our exigencies .
Aquinas 's lesson moves in the same direction , as is clear in his distinguishing between Natural Law ( Lex naturalis ) and Human Law ( Lex humana ) .
If the moral principles of natural law are unchangeable and can be rationally investigated by moving from some solid axioms , human law is the consequence of cultural and historic contingencies .
As Summa Theologiae says , " the natural law contains certain universal precepts which are everlasting , whereas human law contains certain particular precepts according to various emergencies . "
At the same time , " nothing can be absolutely unchangeable in things that are subject to change .
And , therefore , human law cannot be altogether unchangeable . "
Aquinas adds that " custom has the force of law , abolishes law , and is the interpreter of law . "
He accepts customary law because it has the approval of individuals : " because , by the very fact that they tolerate it , they seem to approve of that which is introduced by custom . "
This law that is dissolved in custom is not natural law , because Aquinas does not believe we can accept a legal order that has historically emerged if it is against justice ; but historical evolution modifies positive law and even opens room for different interpretations .
Law and Interpretation
In positive law , there is an essential function of interpretation , because there is always a distance between the norm and the cases in point .
As Giorgio Agamben explains , " in the case of law , the application of a norm is no way contained within the norm and cannot be derived from it ; otherwise , there would have been the need to create the grand edifice of trial law .
Just as between language and world , so between the norm and its application there is no external nexus that allows one to be derived immediately from the other . "
What 's the meaning of this ?
Using general rules in concrete and specific situations always implies a decision , and ( at least hypothetically ) an arbitrary power .
The difference between the law in the books and the law in action is largely a consequence of this .
In many writings , Chaïm Perelmen remarks that legal logic is :
a very elaborated , individual case of practical reasoning , which is not a formal demonstration , but an argumentation aiming to persuade and convince those whom it addresses that such a choice , decision or attitude is preferable to concurrent choices , decisions and attitudes .
Perelman adds : " what characterizes an argumentation is its non-constraining character . "
​ So , legal reasoning " is not presented as a formally valid deduction from non-temporal truths , " because " reasons considered good at one period of time or in one milieu are not in another ; they are socially and culturally conditioned as are the convictions and the aspirations of the audience they must convince . "
In spite of his disputable skepticism , Perelman is right when he points out that positive law is a " practical " activity , because it is a case - solving operation and often emerges from a transaction of different interests .
To a large extent , law is not a science : it is a technique oriented to solving specific problems , because lawyers and judges do not search for the truth , but only the legal truth .
Law and Intentionality
If we analyze liability and causality in Rothbard , we have to recall the fundamental principles of the Austrian tradition .
In a recent article , Hans - Hermann Hoppe criticized his mentor and highlighted how it is contradictory to focus attention on the birth of property ( with the homesteading of land ) and then to exclude it , accepting a strict liability theory whose positivist and behaviorist origins are evident .
Hoppe remarks that " homesteading implies intent , " a subjective element ; on the contrary , Rothbard 's theory of causation and liability ignores this aspect .
Austrian School scholars emphasize the role of intentionality as a crucial element at the moment of the origin of private property and of its negation ( theft , aggression , etc. ) .
Not all physical invasions imply liability and , to the contrary , some actions are liable even if there is no physical invasion .
In economics , Rothbard was perfectly aware of this and was always very critical of economic schools with positivistic leanings .
In 1985 , in the preface to Theory and History by Mises , he attacks mainstream positivism , remarking that " to become truly scientific like physics and the other natural sciences , then , economics must shun such concepts as purposes , goals and learning : it must abandon man 's mind and write only of mere events . "
But the main mistake of the American scholar is in analyzing only simple events , avoiding the problem of intentionality and subjective liability , and the consequent need to understand a specific action — made by a particular person , in that one moment and context .
Hoppe is right when he notes a contradiction in Rothbard between this theory of strict liability and the defense of homesteading , which implies another vision of ethics and a different anthropology .
When Rothbard condemns as aggression the act of a man claiming and occupying a land previously " homesteaded " by other people , his arguments call for a well - defined idea of morality that it is not consistent with that oversimplified and behaviorist theory of causality and liability .
An Aristotelian - Thomist Libertarianism
For all these reasons , the Thomist distinction between natural law and human law is fundamental , especially if by lex humana we do not conceive of the state law , but our ever - imperfect translation , into norms , of our aspiration to live in a just society .
As Paul Sigmund correctly remarked , " human law is the application to specific circumstances of the precepts of reason contained in the natural law . "
​ This mediation is always unsatisfying , but at the same time necessary .
Rothbard and Perelman make the symmetrically opposite mistake , because neither admits the autonomy of natural law and positive law .
If Perelman reduces natural law to positive law ( and reason to reasonableness ) , Rothbard reduces positive law to natural law ( and reasonableness to reason ) .
However , we have to admit the existence of a higher and objective dimension of law ( where the rational method of Rothbard is justified ) and of a much more prosaic and lower level , which can obtain many advantages from the dialogical and rhetorical approach used by Perelman .
The awareness of the need to mediate between the a priori principles of natural law and a largely inductive knowledge of the legal experience is not always present in Rothbard .
But that 's why the intellectual heritage of Leoni can be useful in the attempt to develop a libertarian legal theory aiming to protect the dignity and freedom of the individual .
If , in Rothbard , there is the risk of ignoring the specificity of legal reasoning , Leoni remarks on the empirical features of the law and adopts a Misesian standpoint in putting into the right perspective human experience and the role it plays in the practical unfolding of our existence .
Leoni perceives the importance of the positive law , also in a libertarian and antistatist perspective .
The vision of what is just by nature has to be rooted in a particular time , embodied in specific institutions and recognizable in many different situations .
But the Italian thinker was quite aware that this proposal was a return to the old tradition of natural law .
In a very interesting passage , he criticizes Kelsen , saying that sociology of law is " the modern heir of the natural law . "
And he specifies his idea in this way :
contemporary sociology of law schools can be considered , in a limited sense , and without the derogatory features used by Kelsen , the " modern heirs of natural law , " exactly because they are inclined to re-evaluate in " law " the element of the " persuasions " leading the action of people , instead of the " legal order " conceived as dogmatics did .
Conclusion
In spite of his positivism , Leoni can help us grasp the true nature of classical natural law , because he does not prospect for a " libertarian code " like the one envisioned by Rothbard , somewhat conceived on the model of the state legal systems .
On the contrary , Freedom and the Law can be the starting - point for a more " classical " understanding of libertarian natural law actually rooted in the Aristotelian - Thomistic tradition .
In other words , in Leoni there is a wide scope for juridical research and for historical evolution , because of his belief in a living law in continuous and close interaction with reality .
The legal order has some " essential " elements , but it changes through time , and for this reason it requires constant and challenging work to adjust rules and behavior .
If we return to the classics , we can better understand the main problems .
Thomist rationalism moves from the awareness of reason 's limits .
Sigmund highlights exactly this when he says that " Aquinas 's system of natural law is and must be incomplete .
He could not admit the Aristotelian possibility that nature could provide fully for man 's fulfillment . "
Rothbard himself is not far from this when he points out that a rational approach needs an understanding of the structural imperfection of our minds :
" No man is omniscient or infallible — a law , by the way , of man 's nature . "
But this observation has to have significant consequences for legal theory
With 8 million jobs lost in this great recession , it is rather surprising to see so many people enter into a deep capture mode of believing in a quick and efficient recovery .
If we look at data in the misery index , the average American has a hard time swallowing the jagged economic recovery pill .
They look at their paychecks and see no recovery .
They look at rising healthcare costs and see no recovery .
They send their kids to colleges where costs are going up 8,9 , or even 10 percent per year .
The data simply does not reflect this actual reality .
Are things better than say in March ?
Depends on what we look at .
Sure , the stock market is up a record 60 percent but does your life feel 60 percent better ?
Is your pay up by 60 percent ?
What about your bottom line ?
If we look at disposable income for the average American , it has actually fallen .
If it follows that two - thirds of our economy is based on spending , then where is this money coming from ?
Let us first look at disposable income :
With over 70 years of data , disposable income has only gone negative on a year over year basis one other time and this was in the late 1940s .
This is really not a typical occurrence .
Yet when we deconstruct the GDP report and 3.5 percent growth , we realize that this equation :
GDP = private consumption + gross investment + government spending + ( exports – imports )
A large part of that growth came from government spending .
The other growth came largely because of cash for clunkers with the auto sector contributing 1.6 percent of the 3.5 percent growth ( typically about 0.1. or 0.2 percent ) .
In other words , there should be little shock that GDP was up .
Why not spend $ 2 trillion and make it go up by 7 percent ?
Of course , any thoughtful analysis shows the error in this reasoning .
It is an adrenaline shot to the chest administered by the bailout syringe .
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve are juicing the markets and hoping this recovery sticks .
The latest data relies on purely government back stops .
If we look at industrial production , things are still looking like a recession :
And much of the bounce is coming from restocking and refilling inventories to meet the current demand .
The real question is whether the demand will still be there without government spending .
That is yet to be seen .
In fact , there is already talks of a second stimulus and the government is still pumping money into the fragile housing sector trying to get Americans to buy homes yet again even though we just went through a decade long housing bubble .
Yet the average American is working less hours and earning less money :
This is a fundamental question here .
Most Americans do n’t realize this but they are being taxed in numerous ways .
For one , the current bailouts and government spending is coming at the cost of a weaker and flailing dollar – you are being paid in a weaker currency :
Source : Jesse ’s Cafe
There is a cost for all this additional spending .
The only reason we have yet to see the higher cost hit the typical balance sheet is because there has been $ 12 trillion in household net worth balance sheet destruction .
This has occurred through the loss in real estate value and stock market value .
This is real wealth destruction .
Also , each bankruptcy and foreclosure in essence destroys the face value note and brings to reality a new cost .
In other words , a $ 500,000 mortgage that is now linked to a home that is worth $ 200,000 and is foreclosed and sold , will only produce a $ 200,000 mortgage ( depending on down the payment ) .
So the system loses that $ 300,000 even if it was inflated values .
There is still unrealistic prices in the system especially in the $ 3 trillion commercial real estate sector .
That is why the Fed is reluctant to allow an audit of their books .
Americans have n’t yet felt the brunt of this but we are in a full - fledged disinflation period .
Rents are going down and this is the largest component of the CPI .
So those on fixed incomes are going to have to get by with less .
Just look at Social Security that suspended the COLA for the time being .
Have you looked at saving account interest rates ?
Close to zero .
So the only game in town is basically the stock market ( and commodities ) if you want anything above 5 percent .
The risk - free days are over .
Even holding the U.S. dollar is now risky because of the massive spending .
If we look at the balance of trade , things have improved simply because Americans are spending more and our lower dollar has made our products a bit more competitive :
Make no mistake , the improvement above is largely due to less consumption .
So what will happen ?
The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve want a systematic devaluation of the US dollar .
As the above chart points out , this is their current path .
They are satisfied that Wall Street is back to the good old days and the taxpayer is subsidizing their casino at the cost of the US dollar .
In their mind ’s eye , they are looking for a decade long decline in the dollar followed by moderate to strong inflation .
When was the last time that you saw on the mainstream media the U.S. dollar debated ?
In that way , we essentially inflate ourselves out of this bubble without the masses getting into a frenzy .
Even the banks are betting on this .
Wells Fargo is now talking about converting their option ARM loans into interest only loans :
“ NEW YORK ( Dow Jones ) –Wells Fargo & Co. ’s ( WFC ) strategy for modifying its billions in troubled Pick - A - Pay mortgages looks a lot like a game of kick - the - can - down - the - road .
Wells Fargo , the fourth - largest U.S. bank by assets , holds more than $ 107 billion in debt tied to option - adjustable rate mortgages , a quintessential loan product from the housing boom that allowed borrowers to make small monthly payments in return for increasing their mortgage balance .
Now , many Pick - A - Pay borrowers own homes worth far less than they owe in mortgage debt , even as many of them can afford a full monthly payment that pays down principal .
To solve that conundrum , Wells Fargo is taking a gamble :
The bank is issuing thousands of interest - only loans that will defer borrowers ’ balances for as long as six to 10 years .
Wells Fargo is wagering that an eventual rise in housing prices in the country ’s worst - hit regions , along with a rise in consumers ’ income , will eventually combine to cover the bank ’s billions in underwater Pick - A - Pay debt .
“ We ’re banking on the fact the economy will improve and recover over time , ” Michael Heid , co-president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage , said in an interview . ”
Wells Fargo is essentially betting on another housing bubble .
Think of an option ARM loan that is at $ 500,000 on a $ 250,000 home ( 58 % of these loans are in California ) .
Wells Fargo is betting that the current borrower by 2019 or whatever date will then be in a home valued at $ 500,000 or more .
They are simply betting on another bubble spurred by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve .
In Japan , real estate values remain depressed after 20 years .
This after trillions into their banking sector and trillions in fiscal stimulus ( sound familiar ? ) .
So going back to our initial question , if income is down where is the money coming from ?
It is n’t coming from credit card companies because they are slashing limits and credit .
Right now it is coming from the government .
But it comes at the cost of breaking the dollar down .
Why else is gold now trading near $ 1,100 ?
The world wo n’t finance our spending spree forever .
Buying more cars and more homes is not a long lasting solution .
I doubt that has any long - term sustainability .
But the real question will come in 2010 with the stimulus running low .
Will the real economy make up for lost incomes ?
Of course we need to create jobs and good paying positions for that but that has yet to be seen .
Until then , we are spending money we do n’t have to buoy the economy .
Is that really good news ?

Stacks is a piece of software for the iPhone which adds spring loaded “ stacks ” of applications to any or all of the four coveted dock positions on your home screen .
We first mentioned it back in the summer but now , despite still being in an alpha state , it is available ( sort of ) and ready to use .
If you have a jailbroken iPhone .
There are a few advantages to cracking your iPhone open with a jailbreaking tool .
You can install all sorts of applications that would never make through the Apple approval process , you can run those applications in the background ( although your battery life may suffer ) and you can install things that tweak the user interface quite drastically .
Stacks is the latter .
The picture above shows Stacks in action .
Once installed , you get four new icons somewhere amongst your applications .
Drag one to the dock and you can rename it .
For my first one I chose “ News ” .
From there , press and hold any icon , just as if you were about to rearrange the apps like you normally do .
Then drag any icon to the stack and it will pop open , just like a folder in the dock of a Mac .
Drop the icon in there and you ’re done .
To use the stacks , you just touch one and it will pop open , allowing you to touch one of the icons and launch the app .
If you have too many icons in there to make a pop - up stack that will fit on the screen , Stacks switches to a window view which shows the icons arranged in a grid , again like the OS X dock .
This is automatic , but you can lock it in as a default view in the preferences .
There are a few alpha giveaways : you ca n’t add icons for web - apps to a stack .
I have a shortcut icon to Gmail on my iPod Touch and wanted to put it alongside the Mail application in a stack .
It just wo n’t go .
Second , there is little visual feedback .
You do n’t know if you have dragged the application onto the stack until you have let go and then popped open the stack to check .
Third , there seems to be no way to rearrange the icons to choose which appears atop the stack .
And lastly , icon badges are not displayed :
If having a notification of unread mails is important to you , do n’t put Mail in a stack .
To get the application you need to make a donation of over $ 1 to the developer via PayPal .
You ’ll also , of course , need to jailbreak your iPhone or iPod Touch .
And you ’ll have to be somewhat confident using the command line , as there is no one - click installer yet .
Otherwise , this is a fantastic add - on .
It is sleek and feels as if it is actually part of the iPhone OS when you use it .
Even if I use no other unofficial add - ons , this one is staying on my iPod .

Chapter 1 — Introduction , San Juan Islands
" Selene " underway
The novice sets out
At anchor , Echo Bay , Sucia Island
What would you have done ?
I did n't expect to be on the bow of my little boat , changing sails , when the big wave came and tried to wash me into the sea .
I was several days ' sail west of Fiji in the South Pacific , at a time of year when the sea is supposed to be calm and predictable .
Several hours before , my two - way radio had come to life — " Sailing vessel Selene , this is Take Two , how do you copy ? "
I recognized my friend Ursula 's voice — I talked to her on the radio each day since we met in French Polynesia several months before .
Ursula and her mate Bob were sailing around the world on Take Two , a fast German boat .
But this was n't our normal time to chat , and Ursula sounded worried , so I picked up the microphone .
" Take Two , this is Selene , you are loud and clear , what 's up ? "
She responded , " We 've just picked up a weather warning from New Zealand — there 's a storm coming with 50 knot winds !
" I did n't believe it at first , and wasted time looking at weather charts that said storms never happened at this time of year , and tuning my radio to hear that , sure enough , a bad storm was coming our way .
The timing could n't have been worse — I was only twenty miles from an island I had just sailed past on the gentle trade winds , and the storm 's reversed wind would try to blow me back onto the island 's rocks .
I realized that to escape the island , I would have to sail upwind against 50 knots — I would have to change all my sails , .
As the sea began to pound my little boat , I pulled on my foul - weather gear and strapped on a safety harness , went out on deck and watched a dead bird float by .
I clicked my harness onto the deck safety line , and as I pulled the storm sails out of storage , I posed the question I had been asking myself since I began sailing two years before —
" What am I doing out here ? "
Could a computer programmer really sail around the world in a 31 - foot boat ?
I thought I had seen every cold , wet , out - of - control , salt - water - in - the - face adventure while sailing from Oregon to Hawaii and French Polynesia , but I was still a beginner — in fact , in five more minutes , the safety harness would save my life .
But I should explain a little about myself .
Please do n't picture a world explorer , born to adventure , native to sun and wind — no way .
I sunburn so easily that if I lose my hat I begin to cower like Dracula .
I have spent most of my life working indoors , fixing TV sets as a teenager , then designing electronic gadgets , eventually working on the NASA Space Shuttle , finally learning to write computer programs .
Yes : a nerd .
But I have a working brain , and that has saved me .
When I was young I read a lot of books , observed people around me , and came to the conclusion that most people 's lives are completely boring .
So I made a rule for myself — find out what most people are doing , and .
I know that sounds almost too simple to be useful , but it works for me .
So , while I was designing part of the Space Shuttle , as successful as I had any right to expect , I remembered my rule and bought some country land .
When my Shuttle work was done I moved to Oregon and built a cabin on the edge of the wilderness .
I grew vegetables and hiked around in the woods for a year .
It was pleasant but eventually I got a little bored .
One evening I was sitting by my wood stove , reading a magazine by a kerosene lamp , when I spotted an advertisement for something called an " Apple II personal computer . "
It was 1977 , Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were living in a garage , " Personal Computer " was almost a contradiction in terms , but it came to me that I could own a computer .
Now I realize you may have a hard time believing someone can get all tingly about owning a computer , so I ask that you stretch your mind a little bit .
Picture the thing you care about the most — a Lamborghini , or the perfectly written real estate contract , or an exquisite watercolor , or a woman on whom nature has smiled , or whatever .
Now take that feeling and multiply it ten times — yes !
Cover your face and make a sound only dogs can hear !
I could own a computer !
Equations quickly executed , magical worlds of computer images , the perfect cold wind of logic , a computer !
Well , you 've always wanted to know what nerds think , have n't you ?
So I bought an Apple II and it was just as exciting as I expected .
I started writing programs for it , because there were n't any , and I got pretty good .
Then , one day , a magazine asked me to write an article about Einstein 's Theory of Relativity .
Since they offered to pay me and I had almost no money left , I began writing the article .
The basics of Relativity are not hard to grasp , but there are a lot of ways to explain it , and I soon had filled several scratchpads with ideas .
Then I realized I might be able to program my Apple II to be a big electronic scratchpad .
Maybe I could write a program to let me experiment , put words in different ways quickly and efficiently .
So I wrote a scratchpad program and used it to write the article .
The Apple Computer company , no longer in a garage , heard about my program and asked to see it .
I added some things to it , made it presentable and stuffed it into a big manila envelope .
As I rode my bike to the post office I thought , Who knows , maybe they 'll like my program .
It might be worth hundreds of dollars .
Even I did n't see what was coming .
I had written what is now called a word processing program — Apple Computer named it Apple Writer , it became an international best seller , and it is why I sailed around the world .
For the next eight years I wrote new versions of Apple Writer , translated it into foreign languages , and learned a lot about computers , people , and money .
Finally it seemed as if everybody was writing a word processing program , so it was time for my rule again — I had been sitting in dark rooms , punching computer keys , for years .
I had always wanted to learn SCUBA diving , hike around in the tropics , so I booked a flight to Hawaii .
But a month later I was in — are you ready ? — a traffic jam on Maui .
I wanted to climb Mount Haleakala , the island 's biggest mountain , but first I had to get to it .
I gazed along the row of cars stretching away in the distance .
Occasionally I moved about a car length .
Then another tourist banged his car into mine .
I gave up and went back to Lahaina , the tourist ghetto on the West side of the island .
I spent the day walking around Lahaina , and eventually made my way down to the marina .
As I walked along the row of boats , I saw a sailboat was about to depart , and the skipper asked if I would kindly cast off for him .
I figured out he wanted me to untie his ropes from shore .
The skipper motored away from the dock , then turned and began gliding out of the marina .
He waved to someone on another boat , then , outside the breakwater , he turned off his engine and put up a sail .
The boat heeled over and began to move , and in a few minutes all I could see was a pretty sail surrounded by blue water .
I understand now , from the moment I touched that sailboat 's dock lines , I was doomed to sail .
First I realized to actually see the Hawaiian islands I needed a boat .
Then , slowly , the idea of sailing away from everything began to play itself over and over in my mind .
I started meeting sailors , visiting boats , asking questions .
Can you live on a boat ?
How long can you be away from shore ?
Are there pirates ?
How much does ( ahem ) a boat like this cost ?
And why does n't the boat just fall over when the wind fills the sail ?
I read books about sailing .
Most of the respected ocean sailors think you should buy an old - fashioned heavy boat , with a keel that extends from the front to the back , and a rudder attached to the aft end .
And , after wandering San Francisco 's marinas , that 's what I bought — a heavy , clunky , old - fashioned boat that looked as though it would stand the sea 's abuse .
It was n't very expensive , because that kind of boat is n't popular any more ( most sailboat owners do n't sail across the ocean ) .
I started adding equipment I thought I would need — a radar , two - way radios , a satellite navigation receiver .
Soon I had the most high - tech old - fashioned boat around .
I knew I had to do something about the boat 's name .
The former owner had named it " Pagan Princess . "
Since then I have seen about a thousand boat names , and " Pagan Princess " is still near the top of the dreadful list .
I renamed it " Selene , " which is the Greek goddess of the moon .
The former owner heard about the name change and said , " It 's bad luck to change a boat 's name . "
I said " It 's bad luck to have a boat named ' Pagan Princess .
'
" A little digression .
You only get to name your boat once , so you should give it some thought .
A lot of men name their boat after the woman who tolerates the boat 's existence — this is dangerous , because the boat may outlast the relationship , then you have to start over .
But most people try to show some personal cleverness or make a statement .
While I sailed I kept lists of boat names — most pretentious ( example : " Born Free , " a boat probably owned by a bank ) , banal ( please , no more " Sea Breeze " ) , hard to spell out on the radio ( " Thalassa Experience III " ) , and just clever ( a tie between " MicroShip " and " AllSummer 's Disease " ) .
Selene is a " double - ender , " meaning it resembles a big canoe — the hull comes to a point at the back as well as the front .
It 's an old - fashioned design and itold - fashioned .
The keel is long and not very deep .
The rudder is attached to the aft end of the boat , with a post rising up outside the hull .
A big stick called a tiller attaches to the post .
At first I wondered whether I was being too conservative in my choice of boat .
But in the years since then I 've banged a lot of coral reefs and rocks near shore , and out at sea I 've collided with big things that went bump in the night .
If I had bought a modern , lightweight racing boat I would have sunk somewhere by now .
Also ,
Selene is the heaviest , therefore the slowest , boat in the fleet — it always arrives last .
On the other hand , when the weather gets terrible I just take down the sails , go inside and read a book until it 's over .
It 's not easy to get seasick on a heavy boat .
But that might just be me — I do n't get seasick very easily .
I did get seasick once , before I started sailing on my own — Apple Computer had chartered a fishing boat for a day , and I was in town so I went along .
The boat made its way under the Golden Gate Bridge , and then things got bumpy .
At first I was afraid I was going to die .
Then I was afraid I was n't going to die .
They say motorboats are the worst , because of the exhaust fumes .
Also they do n't weigh very much , so they bounce like corks .
But I never got seasick again .
After I equipped Selene the way I wanted , I decided to sail to the San Juan Islands in Washington State — this was to be my shakedown cruise before sailing to Hawaii .
First I sailed from San Francisco and tied up in Brookings , Oregon , a short ride from my house .
Then I worked on the boat for several months , installing more equipment and making overnight test sails off the coast .
I waited until June to sail up to Washington , because the weather is supposedly better then .
A word about weather along the Oregon coast .
At the time I am writing this I have seen weather all over the world , and the weather in Oregon is consistently the worst .
One day , in the Red Sea , the weather was almost as bad as an average day in Oregon .
For two days in the Caribbean , between the Virgin Islands and Panama , it was just as bad .
But on the Oregon Coast it goes on for weeks .
Most of the shelters along the coast are river outlets .
Over time these outlets develop piles of debris called " bars " at their entrances , and they must be dredged regularly to keep them passable .
When the wind comes from the West and the waves are high ( as they usually are ) , the waves break on the river bars .
This makes these entrances deadly .
On the first of June I sailed for Cape Flattery , the point between Washington State and Canada that leads to the San Juan Islands .
But I should have sailed earlier , no matter what the monthly weather summaries said — the wind blew at 40 miles per hour , directly from the North , all day , every day , and the waves were huge .
I had to motor all the way between Brookings and Cape Flattery , a distance of 370 miles .
It took 15 days , an average speed of one knot .
A person walking on a beach of hard sand can make four knots , a thought that crossed my mind more than once as I bashed and banged through the water .
I tried to stop as often as possible , usually to refuel as well as sleep .
I ran low on fuel near one small town , and ducked in just before dark .
I got a good night 's sleep , and the next morning I got my fuel and was all ready to go — I asked the Coast Guard station about the bar conditions .
They told me the bar was dangerous , so dangerous that they would be obliged to physically prevent me from leaving if necessary .
And why ?
Because the wind had shifted around to the West during the night .
I realized if I was outside the bar with a West wind I would be sailing happily along on a beam reach ( meaning a nice sail , with the wind blowing from the side ) .
But I had to wait three days .
Finally the bar was safe again .
Why ?
Because the wind had shifted back to North .
I motored the rest of the way .
The San Juan islands were beautiful .
I learned a lot about sailing in a relatively safe and sheltered area .
I sailed up to Canada and saw snowcapped peaks in August .
And I discovered that a certain number of sailors are complete morons .
One day I anchored in a big , big bay ( this is a form of literature called an " anchor story . "
This anchor story is simple .
Later on they get as complicated as relativity ) .
I dropped my anchor out in the middle of the bay , well away from everything , and took a nap .
After a while I woke to the sound of country & western music .
I came out of my cabin to discover another boat had anchored directly in front of me , about two boat lengths away , over my anchor .
I could n't leave , because my anchor was beneath the other boat .
I had to listen to country & western music all day and half the night .
It was two miles to shore in any direction , all perfect anchoring .
Why were they here ?
The next place I anchored was called " Echo Bay , " on a beautiful outlying island .
This time I decided to make it impossible for another boat to anchor near me .
I used my navigation chart to locate a pass , between two rocks , that led to a small anchorage off to one side of the bay .
Anyone that followed me in there would have to be very experienced or a complete idiot .
During the afternoon the tide came up and covered the rocks I had passed between .
About 3 PM I was working in the cabin when I heard someone motoring nearby — very nearby .
I came out of the cabin and saw a boat headed directly for one of the submerged rocks !
I waved my arms and yelled " Submerged rock !
Turn to port ! "
The skipper yelled back " Okay — which way is port ? "
But he managed to miss the rock .
Later he told me he thought he was in the clear since I had anchored so far off to the side .
He had no chart .
Most of the time people left me alone , which was just as well , since I was making plenty of my own mistakes , learning how to sail and anchor a 16 thousand pound boat alone .
I was willing to do completely embarrassing things , but not while drifting sideways into someone 's expensive yacht .
If I had to tell the truth about my summer in Washington , I would say I began to depend on Selene — for a sense of purpose and for consistency as well .
If I was lazy about anchoring on a certain day , the wind would blow , something would break , I would pay for laziness right away .
Another day , if I stayed alert to the details , things would go well , I would have a nice time and begin to think myself embedded in nature , in the wind .
At the time I thought how charming those lessons were , even though they were really just coincidences .
Yes : I had a lot to learn .
Soon it was September , time to sail the boat back to Oregon and prepare for the Hawaii passage .
I was looking forward to sailing down the coast — I had fought those fierce winds all the way up , burning an ocean of diesel fuel .
Now I would sail back on wind power , downwind , really fast .
I rounded Cape Flattery on a sunny afternoon with brisk winds , I put out my largest sails and began to move .
Within twelve hours the wind died and fog rolled in .
I had to motor back to Brookings .
During the winter I installed more equipment and filled the lockers with things I thought would be useful .
I installed a wind generator and solar panels , so I could charge the boat 's batteries without having to run the engine .
I went out for more test sails .
One day I decided to visit a bay a short distance up the coast called " Hunter 's Cove . "
It was supposed to be okay for anchoring .
How did I know this ?
There was a little anchor drawn on the chart .
There was no wind so I had to motor , and by the time I got there it was after dark , not a good time to enter an unfamiliar bay .
But this was n't a reason to change my plan , after all , I had just come back from a long journey to Washington State and Canada .
I was a hotshot sailor .
But , just to be safe , I turned off the engine so I could listen for breaking waves , and scanned the bay with binoculars , looking for rocks and white water .
Things seemed calm in the bay , there was no wind , so I got the boat ready — I untied the anchor so I could go forward later and just drop it off the bow .
I motored into the bay , using the radar to find my way among the rocks .
I watched the depth sounder too —
I wanted to stay in water depths of 20 feet or more , because waves might break in shallower water .
I saw the depth I wanted and began turning the boat around to face the waves .
Just then a huge wave entered the bay , broke , and came careening down on my boat !
It sounded like a freight train — as it collided with my boat it almost drowned out my plea " But I 'm in !
" Because I was turning around , the wave hit the boat beam - on , the worst orientation .
The boat rolled down so the spreaders on the mast nearly touched the water , the anchor fell off the bow , and everything movable flew across the cabin .
Water poured through the hatch .
The wave pushed the boat a considerable distance toward shore , which meant shallower water and more breaking waves .
I hit the throttle , hoping to round up into the breaking seas and get out of there .
But the engine speed would n't rise above an idle — something was wrong with my engine !
I dove into the cabin and pulled the engine covers off .
As I examined the engine two more waves hit the boat , pushing it closer to shore .
The water depth was now 12 feet .
I finally realized the electric fuel pump had quit and was n't delivering any fuel .
I started hitting it with a wrench as another wave broke aboard .
My engine came to life !
I jumped back into the cockpit and tried to point up into the waves again .
The boat turned and took the next wave on the nose , a much less violent experience .
But then the boat just stopped !
It was then I realized the anchor had fallen off the bow .
That was why I had n't been thrown onto the rocks , but it also meant I could n't just motor away — I would have to raise the anchor first .
I put on my safety harness and went to the bow .
Between each of the breaking waves — which completely covered me — I was able to reel in the anchor chain a bit .
Finally the anchor cleared the bottom — I ran aft and started motoring .
When I reached safety , clear of the bay , I stopped and listened .
Icould n't hear the breaking waves , and the sea seemed calm in the deeper water outside the bay .
I learned my lesson — after that night I did n't try to anchor along the coast any more .
Instead I would get well away from land , make my tests , take sextant sights in the evening , let the boat drift around while I slept until daylight , then sail some more .
It was safer than going near the shore .
Sometimes when I was at home I would jump out of bed and try to figure out where I was — I would look out the windows , see houses and trees and begin to panic .
I would try to find the tiller , turn away from the land .
Then I would wake up , standing there , and it would come to me that I was n't on the boat .
This made me realize I was a lot more afraid of sailing than I admitted , and the fears I was hiding came to the surface after dark .
I would sit in the dark and ask myself what I thought I was doing .
Could I turn myself into a sailor ?
What did I want to do with my boat ?
But I knew , I knew .
If I sailed far enough , if I did n't crash my boat against some rocks , I would put my anchor out in some foreign land .
I would climb a hill and meet a goatherd .
We would sit under a tree , drink wine and eat goat 's cheese .
He would n't have heard about Chernobyl or disposable diapers , and I would n't tell him .
He would tell me his story and I would tell him mine .
We would look at the hills , the sky .
And I would walk down the hill with the fine touch of a natural person , someone who belongs to the earth , to the sea .
Someone beyond the reach of the evening news .
And that would be enough , the fear would go away .
I could lie down again and sleep .
Finally it was May — time to leave for Hawaii .
I had conducted every test I could think of , and packed lots of interesting treats for the passage .

Spanish citizens will have a legal right from 2011 to be able to buy broadband internet of at least one megabyte per second at a regulated price wherever they live , the country 's industry minister said on Tuesday .
MADRID , Nov 17 ( Reuters ) - Spanish citizens will have a legal right from 2011 to be able to buy broadband internet of at least one megabyte per second at a regulated price wherever they live , the country 's industry minister said on Tuesday .
The telecoms operator holding the so - called " universal service " contract would have to guarantee it could offer " reasonably " priced broadband throughout Spain , said Miguel Sebastian in a statement sent to media .
Former state monopoly Telefonica has always held the universal contract aimed at protecting consumers in poorly populated areas from being cut off in cases where operators would otherwise consider providing the service unprofitable .
The service also subsidises telecoms to disabled users .
Until now , the " universal service " has only guaranteed internet via telephone line , fixed telephone , directory service and telephone booths .
Earlier this month , Spain 's telecoms regulator , the CMT , proposed that Telefonica , Vodafone and Orange foot the cost of providing the universal service for 2006 , which it judged had cost 75.34 million euros , with Telefonica paying 71 percent of the costs .
Adding internet to the universal service would increase the future cost of the universal service .
The yearly calculations of the cost of the service take about two years to complete .
Consumer group FACUA said it welcomed that broadband internet would finally be a right but said the speed was insufficient and the measure should be introduced before 2011 .
" FACUA calls on the minister to speed up the measure , increase the speed and to set a reasonable price , " the organisation said in a statement .

Washington ( CNN ) --
The Pentagon is blocking public release of photos apparently depicting abuse of suspected terrorists and foreign troops in U.S. custody , and urging the Supreme Court to dismiss a lower court ruling ordering the photos to be publicly disclosed , according to court documents .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates notified the high court late Friday that he was issuing an order to block the release .
The photos have been at the center of a years - long lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union .
Congress last month gave the Obama administration specific authority to prevent any release of the 44 photos .
Afterward , Gates signed a certificate of authorization , or order , to prevent the photos ' release , saying their disclosure would endanger U.S. troops serving abroad .
The order covers all photographs taken of people captured or detained in overseas military operations between September 11 , 2001 , the day of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington , and January 22 , 2009 , shortly after President Obama took office .
The Pentagon initially was set to release the images of Iraqi and Afghan prisoners in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the ACLU .
But Obama and the Justice Department objected to the court - ordered release , reversing an earlier executive decision .
Obama had initially agreed to the release , but changed his mind after military leaders privately and intensely urged him to block it .
The ACLU criticized the administration 's about - face , saying it " makes a mockery " of Obama 's campaign promise of greater transparency and accountability , and damages efforts to hold accountable those responsible for abusing prisoners .
A homeland security appropriations bill passed October 29 by Congress and signed by the president grants the Department of Defense authority to withhold the photographs .
The images were gathered as part of a military investigation into allegations that detainees held in Afghanistan and Iraq were tortured and physically abused .
According to the government legal brief filed with the high court , several of the photos show " soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees . "
Other images described by military reports show prisoners in restrained and humiliating positions .
Military investigations led to criminal charges against some of the soldiers shown in the images .
The photos currently at issue are separate from those first publicly released in 2006 showing abuse of Muslim men held at Baghdad 's Abu Ghraib prison .
The New York - based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in September 2008 that the photos must be released .
The president later said that doing so " would pose an unacceptable risk of danger to U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq . "
Newest Justice Sonia Sotomayor had served on that appeals court until August , but was not involved in that particular case .
The high court has delayed for weeks a decision on whether it would accept the ACLU appeal on the broader issues associated with government authority to block release of potentially embarrassing and inflammatory material by the military .
The justices will now probably wait to hear from the ACLU over Gates ' order before deciding whether to take the case .
The Senate in May voted for the Detainee Photographic Records Protection Act , which would limit the reach of the Freedom of Information Act request in this instance .
The House adopted a similar provision in October .
Other photos could be released under the earlier appeals court ruling .
The case is Department of Defense v. ACLU ( 09 - 160 ) .
Separately , the administration also urged the high court to dismiss a pending lawsuit by several Guantanamo Bay detainees , over their claims of torture and religious discrimination .
A brief was filed by the Justice Department late Friday , the same time as the separate photograph disclosure case .
Four British men , all Muslims and former detainees at the military prison at the Navy base in Cuba , had sued onetime Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top Pentagon officials , saying they knew of and condoned physical abuse and denial of rights guaranteed under international law .
A federal appeals court had dismissed the lawsuit -- the second one filed by the men -- saying the officials had immunity from such claims .
But in June 2008 , the Supreme Court allowed Guantanamo prisoners to challenge their captivity in federal court , and the justices in December urged the lower court to reconsider its decision against the British detainees .
In the government filing , Solicitor General Elena Kagan told the high court to exercise caution in granting what she called " new rights " to detained foreign fighters suing for damages in a military setting .
The high court , she noted , had previously told lower courts " to pay particular heed to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation . "
The case is Rasul v. Myers ( 09 -227 ) .

“ Seven come 9/11 , baby needs a new pair of feet ! ” “ Yeah roll dem bones .
Sift me out some bone flour and bake me some 9/11 Victory Bread . ”
“ Oh Yeah , I got to make eleven the hard way . ”
That ’s when you roll snake eyes and convince everyone it was an eleven .
“ Check it out people .
One and one is eleven .
Take this here paper and write down a one and then another one next to it .
See ?
That ’s eleven . ”
Next ...
I see where Rupert Murdoch ’s Fox - Scat news service is going to be having a homage to the heroes of 9/11 on their virtual upchuck site .
No sooner had they printed “ never forget ” than AIPAC sent a lawyer around with a ‘ cease and desist ’ for copyright infringement .
Certainly there were heroes around the WTC game - board on that fateful day .
There were people like William Rodriguez and various emergency personnel who heard the various explosions and saw the controlled demolition of the towers and told their tale .
There were others who just did their job and had no idea of what was going on but whose memories lit up afterwards like a K - Mart Blue Light Special with flashbacks and various incongruities that all said ...
“ That ai n’t the way that it was . ”
Oh , there will be those audio / visual presentations that will fill us with the remembered shock and awe of that day and silverfish from the sewers will crawl up into the news casting booths in suits and ties with blow - dried hair and a Halcyon glare and talk about what happened .
They ’ll have their little cameos and vignettes as the dutiful graduates of MKUltra and Tavistock share their recovered memories .
So … they ’ll be doing that and I thought I would do a little something too and that would be to remember the villains of 9/11 , the people who planned and carried out the attacks and give them a little face time .
Therefore , in no special order and with a few facts and figures missing here and there , we will name some of the major players .
There ’s ‘ Lucky ’ Larry Silverstein who purchased the lease on the WTC a few months before 9/11 and promptly took out big time terror insurance and who knew all about the asbestos problems in the towers .
Here ’s a humorous puff piece from Haaretz mourning the loss of all of Lucky Larry ’s good work .
They make mention of how he ’s a good friend of Netanyahu , Sharon and Barak .
That ’s no surprise since 9/11 was planned and carried out by Mossad with the help of American intelligence services which means that Nettie , the Pillsbury Coma Boy and Parrot Squawk were manning the phones at their home base , that ‘ just add blood and larceny ’ Instant Levittown , Medellin of the Middle East .
There ’s Little Georgie Bush who was reading “ My Pet Goat of Mendes ” to a group of his intellectual peers on the day he lied about seeing a plane crash into the towers .
He was attended by one of his handlers , ‘ Slippery ’ Andy Card who , coincidentally will be on Fox - Scat News today .
Another villain of 9/11 , one of the big villains would be ‘ Dick ’em ’
Cheney who made sure that all the fighter jets stayed on the ground as he assisted in his role in the treasonous attack on his own country .
There ’s the neo -con fun bunch over at PNAC who drafted the charter and floated in the think tanks and fast - tracked and vetted many of the principal players who had to be in place for the festivities of 9/11 .
There ’s ‘ Money Honey ’ Dov Zakheim who misplaced 2.3 trillion dollars and worked with remote plane technology and who hot - tubs with many of the names already listed .
There ’s Donald Rumsfield who announced the missing 2.3 trillion dollars on September 10th and who was wearing headphones and laying in a leather sling being procto - scoped by Condoleezza Rice on the 11th .
There ’s the Five Dancing Israeli ’s who got shipped back to Israel so that they could appear on television to say that they had been shopping for their moms .
There ’s the cop who found Mohammed Atta ’s passport .
There ’s Rudolph Giuliani who mysteriously got called away from where he was so that he would n’t be where the action was .
There are all sorts of sidemen like the people who snatched all the video tapes and destroyed the air traffic control CDs and a host of players that you can read about here .
And if that was n’t enough you can go here .
I ’d skip the video which I find annoying .
There ’s “ I ca n’t keep it in my pants ’
Paul Wolfowitz who along with Richard Pearle and Douglas Feith were Jonathan Pollard ’s spy caper buddies and who left a trail of hissing , radioactive green slime everywhere he went and who chowed down over at the World Bank and leveraged his girlfriend with a forklift into cush city before he got canned and is probably now working in the illegal organ trade .
On this memorial day that serves to remind us about how bad things can get when you let vicious , murdering psychopaths ascend into the realms of government policy , so as to have the opportunity to blame their actions on a particular religious group which they set up as the fall guys , let us remember the people who actually did the deed .
Yes , I ’ve left people out and it ’s your job to add them to the comments section .
There are two groups of people I would like to mention before I head into epilogue country .
One group is that large body of the public who actually believes it was a rag tag band of Stone Age Arabs that pulled all of this off .
One of my favorite lines that I have heard is , “ I was in New York City on 9/11 , I know what happened ( snicker ) " .
This group has lowered the bar for stupid so that not even light can pass under it now .
The other group is those who know that the official story is bullshit but who are restrained from action and comment out of cowardice and fear .
The two of you have helped immensely and you need to be recognized for your contribution to the enduring lie that is 9/11 .
On this day of remembrance , let ’s showcase the actual parties who were instrumental in making your world the place it is today .
Let ’s not forget who was in charge of security at the WTC in the time leading up to the attacks and let us not forget who was in charge of security at all the 9/11 airports as well as the London Tube on 7/7 AND the Madrid Train Station .
( Whistling past the graveyard ) Yes , it ’s all a series of impossible coincidences .
“ Seven come 9/11 baby . ”
We know who did it .
We do n’t need the videotape from the crime scene and what thoughts were passing through their heads or what they said to each other .
We have the smoking gun and the fingerprints .
We have more than enough evidence to prove the conspiracy , after that it is just connecting the dots .
It ’s time for the Ceausescu solution to be applied across the board .
Take a moment on this day to reflect upon the villains .
Across the polluted airways of the captive and lying western media you will be allowed to wallow in the tacky send - ups and reminiscences of pointy headed mynah birds as they trot out the tattered bunting and rain damaged backdrops for yet one more gigantic disinfo extravaganza .
Observe these mindless robots as the message flashes over their heads with the words , “ sold out whores . ”
Finally , take a moment to feel the gratitude that you are none of these people and groups that have been mentioned here .
Let your heart swell with thanks that you can see what really happened and that you are not a mesmerized farm animal awaiting your pending date with realities axe .
Be mindful of how lucky you are that you can see and think and reason for yourselves .
You have retained your humanity and you have not sold out your integrity and conviction for the comforting , crowded darkness of those who have embraced the impossible lies .
Let us remember the villains and the accessories during and after the fact .
The unveiling continues , day by day .
Critical mass approaches .
The collective mind is awakening .
Whatever these villains have planned for the future will not be enough to conceal what they have done in past .
They are marching to their doom as they imagine triumph within their reach .
Nothing can shield or save them from the judgment within .
Their judge and executioner has marched with them every step of the way and recorded their words and deeds with their own eyes and ears .
The dice are loaded and will perform accordingly at the appointed time .
Note ,
The Truthseeker has been offline for some days now and not even emails are being delivered .
Does anyone know anything ?
End Transmission .......
To what extent the second Hubbert cycle will describe the decline in oil and gas production is highly pertinent but also uncertain .
There are signs that the decline trajectory has already been influenced by a third cycle of giant field development with the Buzzard oil field and Ormen Lange gas field both coming on stream in 2007 .
The impact of this third cycle is shown below the fold .
North Sea petroleum ( oil+natural gas ) production from 1970 to 2008 can be modeled to fit two Hubbert cycles .
The first cycle represents surge production from the giant UK oil fields , Forties , Brent , Piper and Ninian .
Actual cumulative production was 9937 million tonnes oil equivalent ( mmtoe ) 1970 - 2008 whilst the area beneath the two Hubbert curves is 9665 mmtoe - a difference of 2.7 % .
In a February 2000 paper , The Hubbert Curve : its strengths and weaknesses , Jean Laherrere advises that the Hubbert curve works best where :
There are a large number of fields
Where exploration follows a natural pattern unimpeded by political events or significant economic factors
Data from a single petroleum province can be amalgamated across international boundaries
Not many data sets meet these criteria , including those for the North Sea and it is clear from the production data that they do not follow a single Hubbert curve .
The overall structure is heavily influenced by the double top in UK oil production brought about by the oil price collapse of 1986 , that delayed on - going field development plans , and the Piper Alpha oil rig explosion of 1988 .
The BP statistical review allows data to be combined from the four countries with significant North Sea oil and gas production - UK , Norway , Denmark and The Netherlands - but combining these data masks the fact that some production comes form outside of the North Sea .
The UK has significant production on the Atlantic margin and in the Irish Sea , while Norway has significant production from the Haltenbanken area off mid-Norway .
Strictly speaking these are separate petroleum basins .
Dutch production from the giant Groningen gas field is excluded from this analysis for two reasons , 1 ) it comprises an earlier discovery cycle to the rest of the North Sea and 2 ) production is capped by the Dutch government , hence it is not exempt from political influence .
Notwithstanding these known limitations , I wanted to see if production data could be fitted to two Hubbert curves in order to see what remaining reserves and future decline might look like .
The chart up top is produced by trial and error on a spread sheet , where 4 variables may be changed : 1 ) start and end date , 2 ) peak date , 3 ) peak flow , and 4 ) gradient [ notes 1 , 2 & 3 ] .
The chart up top shows what I consider to be a good fit , with the noted exception that 2007 and 2008 data are deviating from the expected decline .
Knowing that two giant fields , belonging to a late discovery cycle for the province had just come on stream , it seemed pertinent to model these as a third cycle .
The dark blue curve equals the sum of the three Hubbert cycles .
1 ) is best viewed as surge production from the Forties , Brent , Piper and Ninian Fields when they came on stream in the early 1980s , 2 ) represents the main discovery and field development cycle of the North Sea , 3 ) represents a late discovery cycle , Ormen Lange in 1997 and Buzzard in 2001 .
Both fields came on stream in 2007 .
Ormen Lange is reported to have reserves ( gas and condensate ) of 381 mmtoe and Buzzard 75 tonnes oil .
Peak production at Ormen Lange is constrained by the capacity of the Langeled pipeline ( 25.5 bcm / annum , translating to 23 mmtoe / annum ) and peak production at Buzzard is assumed to be 180,000 bpd , translating to 9 mmtoe / annum .
Cycle 3 reflects all of these parameters but is modeled asymmetrical since production peaks will be reached early on in both fields .
The chart above shows the impact of this cycle 3 model upon the eventual decline and reserves .
The remaining oil and gas reserves following this analysis are 2450 mmtoe .
This is somewhat lower than official reserves for the three countries that amount to 4575 mmtoe , according to BP 2009 . [ note 4 ]
Over 2 billion tonnes of oil difference is quite a substantial amount .
One fly in the ointment is that the giant Troll gas field in Norway has production capped by the capacity of the platform and pipeline .
This is in effect a political cap , and this gigantic resource will distort the decline phase of the Hubbert curve , extending it further to the right .
I have not had time to look into adjusting the analysis for this .
One feature of the logistic curve is that decline accelerates with time .
The blue line has a decline rate of 9 % in 2010 , accelerating to 15 % in 2020 and 17 % in 2030 .
In contrast , the decline on an exponential curve is constant .
The decline rate in oil fields in known to increase with time from phase 1 , to phase 2 and 3 .
But rates of 15 to 17 % are well above the average current decline rate for the North Sea .
So what is going on here ?
I need to stress that I do not consider this analysis to be a forecast .
It is an exercise to see how combining Hubbert logistic curve derivatives would fit the existing production data .
One scenario that may bring about an acceleration in decline is field decommissioning .
High oil prices in 2002 to 2008 have delayed decommissioning of many platforms ; it remains to be seen if this is reversed in the lower oil price environment .
One further consideration : the word on the street here in Aberdeen is that the major drilling contractors are very short of work .
This will result in accelerated decline in the years ahead .
Notes
1. Long term readers of The Oil Drum will know that math is not my strong point .
This appears not to be a genetic disorder since my younger son Duncan ( age 16 ) excels at Maths .
I gave him Laherrere 's paper and asked if he could prepare the Hubbert equations and spread sheet for me to use .
2 . There are a number of excellent mathematicians who contribute to The Oil Drum : Sam Foucher , Luis de Sousa , Jean Laherrere and Webhubbletelescope to name but a few .

I 'd be interested to know how this model is standing up to the rigors of time .

WASHINGTON -- Consider nature .
Not the placid nature that Constable painted , but nature as Tennyson saw it , " red in tooth and claw . "
To glimpse a state of nature as Hobbes imagined it , where human life is " nasty , brutish and short , " visit the Whole Foods store on River Road in Bethesda , Md. There , and -- let the political profiling begin -- probably at many Whole Food stores and other magnets for liberals , nationwide , you will see proof of this social equation : Four Priuses + three parking spaces = angry anarchy .
Anger is one of the seven deadly sins .
Therefore advanced thinkers are agreed that conservatives are especially susceptible to it .
As everyone knows , all liberals are advanced thinkers and all advanced thinkers are liberals .
And yet ...
If you think the health care town halls in August cornered the market on anger , come to Bethesda and watch the private security force -- normal men in an abnormal situation -- wage a losing struggle to keep the lid on liberal anger .
When parking lot congestion impedes the advance of responsible eaters toward the bin of heirloom tomatoes , you see that anger comes in many flavors .
You also see the problem with founding a nation , as America is founded , on the principle that human beings are rights - bearing creatures .
That they are .
But if that is all they are , batten down the hatches .
If our vocabulary is composed exclusively of references to rights , aka entitlements , we are condemned to endless jostling among elbow - throwing individuals irritably determined to protect , or enlarge , the boundaries of their rights .
Among such people , all political discourse tends to be distilled to what Mary Ann Glendon of Harvard Law School calls " rights talk . "
Witness the inability of people nowadays to recommend this or that health care policy as merely wise or just .
Each proposal must be invested with the dignity of a right .
And since not all proposals are compatible , you have not merely differences of opinion but apocalyptic clashes of rights .
Rights talk is inherently aggressive , even imperial ; it tends toward moral inflation and militates against accommodation .
Rights talkers , with their inner monologues of pre-emptive resentments , work themselves into a simmering state of annoyed vigilance against any limits on their willfulness .
To rights talkers , life -- always and everywhere -- is unbearably congested with insufferable people impertinently rights talking , and behaving , the way you and I of course have a real right to .
Recently Paul Schwartzman , a war correspondent for the Metro section of The Washington Post , ventured into the combat zone that is the Chevy Chase neighborhood in the District of Columbia .
It is not a neighborly place nowadays .
Residents are at daggers drawn over ... speed humps .
Chevy Chase , D.C. , is , Schwartzman says , " a community that views itself as the essence of worldly sophistication . "
Some cars there express their owner 's unassuageable anger by displaying faded " Kerry / Edwards " and even " Gore / Lieberman " bumper stickers .
Neighborhood zoning probably excludes Republicans , other than the few who are bused in for " diversity . "
Speed humps -- the lumps on the pavement that force traffic to go slow -- have , Schwartzman reports , precipitated " a not - so - civil war ... among the lawyers , journalists , policymakers and wonks " of Chevy Chase -- and Cleveland Park , another D.C. habitat for liberals .
The problem is that a goal of liberal urbanists has been achieved : Families with young children are moving into such neighborhoods .
They worry about fast - flowing traffic .
Hence speed humps .
And street rage .
Some people who think speed humps infringe their rights protest by honking when they drive over one .
The purpose is to make life unpleasant for the people who live on the street and think they have a right to have the humps .
One resident , who Schwartzman identifies as the husband of a former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton , recently sat on his porch and videotaped an angry driver who honked 30 times .
Other honkers " gave residents the finger as they drove by . "
Ca n't liberals play nicely together ?
Not , evidently , when they are bristling , like furious porcupines , with spiky rights that demand respect because the rights - bearers ' dignity is implicated in them .
Fortunately , it is a short drive from Chevy Chase to the mellow oasis of the River Road Whole Foods store , where comity can be rebuilt on the firm foundation of a shared reverence for heirloom tomatoes .
And if you , you seething liberal , will put the pedal to the metal you can seize the store 's last parking place .
So damn the humps , full speed ahead .
* Mozilo sought to dismiss fraud , insider trading case
* Case also continues against ex-Countrywide COO , CFO
* Judge : Countrywide ’s poor underwriting could be material
NEW YORK / LOS ANGELES , Nov 4 ( Reuters ) - A federal judge rejected a request by Angelo Mozilo , the former chief executive of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp , to dismiss a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit accusing him of securities fraud and insider trading .
In a Tuesday court filing , U.S. District Judge John Walter in Los Angeles also rejected requests by David Sambol and Eric Sieracki , respectively Countrywide ’s former chief operating officer and former chief financial officer , to dismiss related SEC fraud charges .
Countrywide had been the largest U.S. mortgage lender before liquidity dried up in summer of 2007 , leading to its acquisition the following year by Bank of America Corp BAC.N for $ 2.5 billion .
Mozilo ’s lawyer David Siegel did not immediately return a call for comment .
Walter Brown , who represents Sambol , declined to comment .
Nicolas Morgan , who represents Sieracki , also did not immediately return a call .
The SEC sued the defendants in June , accusing them of misleading investors about the quality of Countrywide ’s loans , including tens of billions of dollars of risky subprime and adjustable - rate mortgages .
“ The specific allegations of the complaint relied on by the SEC describe in great detail the virtual abandonment of prudent underwriting guidelines and the resulting proliferation of poor quality loans , during the same period Countrywide was touting the superior quality of its underwriting guidelines and its loan portfolio , ” the judge wrote .
“ Moreover , given that Countrywide ’s core business , i.e. , selling mortgages into the secondary market , admittedly depended upon the quality of its loan production , it is certainly not difficult for the court to conclude that the poor quality of Countrywide ’s underwriting practices and loan portfolio would be material to investors , ” he added .
The insider trading charge concerned Mozilo ’s alleged exercise in 2006 and 2007 of more than 5.1 million stock options and sale of the resulting shares , leading to more than $ 139 million of profit .
According to the complaint , Mozilo set up the plan shortly after admitting in an email to colleagues that Countrywide was “ flying blind ” as to the quality of its loans .
Mozilo , 70 , is perhaps the most prominent executive charged by U.S. regulators with wrongdoing in connection with the housing market collapse .
The case is SEC v. Mozilo , U.S. District Court , Central District of California , No. 09-3994 .

German - built robots are to be sent into Earth 's orbit to repair ' dead satellites ' or push them into outer space
Robots that rescue failing satellites and push " dead " ones into outer space should be ready in four years , it has emerged .
Experts described the development by German scientists as a crucial step in preventing a disaster in the Earth 's crowded orbit .
Last year it was reported that critical levels of debris circling the Earth were threatening astronauts ' lives and the future of the multibillion - pound satellite communications industry .
But senior figures at the German Aerospace Centre ( DLR ) told the Observer they have been given the go - ahead to tackle a crisis that will come to a head in the next five to 10 years as more orbiting objects run out of fuel .
Their robots will dock with failing satellites to carry out repairs or push them into " graveyard orbits " , freeing vital space in geostationary orbit .
This is the narrow band 22,000 miles above the Earth in which orbiting objects appear fixed at the same point .
More than 200 dead satellites litter this orbit .
Within 10 years that number could increase fivefold , the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety has warned .
Klaus Landzettel , head of space robotics at DLR , said engineering advances , including the development of machines that can withstand temperatures ranging from - 170C ( - 274 F ) to 200C ( 392 F ) , meant that the German robots will be " ready to be used on any satellite , whether it 's designed to be docked or not " .
In 2007 , the US Orbital Express project succeeded in refuelling an orbiting satellite .
However , that satellite had been specifically designed to dock with the device .
10 Ways to be Annoying at Work and Ruin your Career
After spending some time in corporate America in roles ranging from the trenches in manufacturing to the cube farms in corporate to running international teams for projects , there are probably hundreds of annoying behaviors I ’ve witnessed ( and admittedly , a few that I ’ve exhibited and learned from as well ) that are worth mentioning .
Here are ten behaviors and tactics that are commonplace in the American workplace and are annoying at the most basic level and could actually end up hurting your career for more egregious or unchecked behavior .
In no particular order , here are some of my pet peeves :
Blatantly Ignore Calls , Emails and Meetings – Look , we ’re all busy – I get that .
If you get bombarded with a few calls in a day or your inbox is overflowing , for the queries that actually require a response , at least have the decency to say , “ I got your note ; I ’m really tied up for the next day or two , but I ’ll get back to you by the end of the week ” .
It ’s incredibly annoying to send a request to someone that you ’re relying on and be blatantly ignored on a routine basis .
It puts you in an awkward position of either looking like a stalker by continuously harassing your counterpart or you end up missing deadlines or burdening other people with your responsibilities .
What I like to do , especially when someone sits in a rather remote area like a different building ( so it ’s totally unexpected ) , is just drop in on them and say , “ Hey there , I did n’t hear back from you the other day , I need your input on … ” .
This is especially effective when they have their feet kicked up and they ’re surfing the internet or something ( real busy ! ) .
I ’ve done this twice and it ’s worked like a charm .
Gossip about your co-workers or the boss –
This is one of the inevitable laws of human nature and Murphy ’s law jumbled together .
Always , Always , Always – what you say about someone will get back to them .
It may take days , weeks or years , but let ’s face it , alliances change .
People drink together and spout off about something someone told them in confidence .
And the worst – the person you ’re talking about has a tendency to quietly sneak up and walk in just as you ’re delivering a punchline about them !
You may think that the person you ’re confiding in or venting to is on your side and they ’ve dished even more dirt than you have , but the reality is they will likely tell someone else what you said .
Another side - effect is that you earn yourself a reputation of being someone who ca n’t be trusted , a backstabber , two - faced , whatever .
If you ’ve evolved to be “ above it all ” , you not only exhibit the leadership and maturity that your company is probably seeking , but you ’ll earn the trust and respect of like - minded colleagues as well .
Be an eternal Pessimist – Sure , the eternal cheerleader can be a bit annoying , and these days , they ’re a bit muted , but a downer is even worse .
You know , that guy who seems eternally annoyed , bummed out , hates his job , hates the company , feels entitled , etc .
They keep him around for whatever reason , but when you ask , “ How ’s it going ? ” , the reply is inevitably something like , “ To Hell ” or “ It ’s going … ” .
You ’d be surprised at the reactions you get , when you ’ve just been slammed with some sort of major challenge or setback and someone sheepishly asks how you ’re doing and you say , “ Great !
How ’ bout you ? ” .
Even if it ’s sarcastic with a laugh and you say , “ Livin ’ the dream baby ! ” , it beats the loser approach .
Attitudes are contagious and if you exude confidence and a positive outlook , good things happen .
I ’m not a strong believer in fate , karma , “ The Secret ” ( what a joke , even at 5 bucks ) , but I do believe motivated , enthusiastic , happy people end up being much more successful in life than their opposites – probably due to human interactions , behaviors and outcomes that can not be quantified .
But , it ’s been my experience and the experience of practically everyone I ’ve ever known which is enough for me .
Punt !
Play dumb and divert responsibilities elsewhere – This one drives me nuts .
There are people who are clearly responsible for a particular activity , workstream , whatever …and every time an obvious assignment heads their way there is an excuse as to why they ca n’t or wo n’t do it .
The efforts these people go to in order to avoid work astounds me .
Some common tactics include citing department / bureaucratic procedures that conflict with or disallow the request ( inconsistently of course , depending on which interpretation benefits them for each situation ) , citing workload constraints , citing competing priorities , challenging the value / support / sponsorship for the request , asking “ for more information on this because I need to understand this better ” over and over without actually doing anything , and more .
Often , the end result is that the requester just finds someone else to do it or does it themselves , while the punter has just reinforced their behavior as effective .
Fortunately , I do n’t interact with anyone like this in my current role , but they ’re out there !
Play Office Politics –
As coy and sophisticated as one thinks they are when they ’re cozying up to the boss ’s boss ’s boss 3 levels higher or trying to form social contacts with “ the powers that be ” , the brown - noser often underestimates the ability of coworkers and bosses alike to spot what ’s going on and it ’s usually recognized early on and results in , well , # 2 .
People will talk about you behind your back and be annoyed by your disingenuous corner - cutting behavior .
Gloat about your latest Achievement ( or Bonus ! ) – Nothing fosters dissension amongst the ranks better than a department full of co-workers questioning why Johnny got a special award bonus or a huge raise last year when he was a total slacker and took credit for an idea or efforts that really belong to someone else .
If you had a great year or were just recognized , that ’s great for you ; perhaps not great for the morale of everyone else who either a ) is in no position to judge or fully grasp what you did since they ’re not you or your boss or b ) thinks they are much more deserving of such accolades .
When you gloat , it just makes people want to see you fail – and that ’s not where you want to be .
Root for your colleagues to Fail – or worse , sabotage – We ’ve all seen the show with the evil jealous friend or co-worker who ’s constantly seeking to sabotage the success of the protagonist with mild success while never really being called out .
It ’s so annoying to watch , it makes you just want to choke the character .
Well , in the workplace , it exists as well .
And while choking is usually frowned upon , there is n’t much you can do other than educate yourself , exert situational awareness and in some cases , confront the saboteur head on ( in private is my recommendation ) .
They ’ll likely deny any overt intent and come up with excuses for their conniving behavior , but they ’ll know you ’re on to them and back off .
Some people think that they ’ll rank higher at the end of the year because their peers did poorly .
Examples include subtly “ calling out ” a mistake in a staff meeting that anyone with a 3rd grade eduction can figure out who you ’re talking about , finding an error or knowing someone ’s headed in the wrong direction and just watching it happen instead of helping them out , or , partaking in # 2 .
Never get your hands dirty and learn the process – Now , this is n’t necessarily a career killer , and in fact , plenty of people get ahead by actually NOT knowing what the heck is going on by just checking boxes , jumping job to job and delegating .
However , if you plan on being in a role for any reasonable period of time and want to earn the respect of your peers , subordinates and managers , LEARN THE PROCESS !
I do n’t care if it ’s construction , programming , sales , high tech , whatever – there are small nuances in the way the business runs , the way procedures are performed , common mistakes , opportunities for improvement , etc .
By showing the tactical day to day employees that you ’re in it with them and willing to learn the landscape , you ’ll garner immediate respect and they ’ll go out of their way to help you when you need them .
Obnoxious office behavior like leaving conference calls on speaker for the whole office to hear and arguing with your wife – There ’s no need for your co-workers to have to listen to some customer meeting for 2 hours straight on speaker phone because a co-worker ’s too lazy to pick up the earpiece or just wear a headset .
There are offices and conference room options , but please , no more meetings while we ’re trying to work !
This should be common sense , but evidently , it ’s not .
Be a Slacker – with an aire of entitlement about oneself , just kick the feet back and watch everyone else do the work .
When the tough decisions are required , shift the tough call to someone else .
When a volunteer is needed , look away and get up and go to the restroom .
When a teammate needs a helping hand , find an excuse not to help .
You know who I ’m talking about .
And if you take offense to this notion , perhaps it ’s you !
So , What Are Your Annoying Office Behavior Stories ?
I ’d Love to Hear .

Health insurers ’ profits 35th of 53
By Calvin Woodward
The Washington Post
October 26 , 2009
Health insurance profit margins typically run about 6 percent , give or take a point or two .
Health insurers posted a 2.2 percent profit margin last year , placing them 35th of 53 industries on the Fortune 500 list .
As is typical , other health sectors did much better – drugs and medical products and services were both in the top 10 .
Leading the list : network and other communications equipment , at 20.4 percent .

Health care plans – net profit margin : 3.3 %

Medical loss ratios of largest publicly traded health plans :
Average 85.2 % ( non-weighted , range 82.9 % – 86.8 % )

Comment :
By Don McCanne , MD
In simple accounting terms , profit represents the difference between gross revenues and the cost of producing and marketing the products or services sold .
So what is the product that the private insurers are selling us ?
Administrative services .
Unlike most other businesses , the revenues of the private insurers include our own funds that essentially are held in trust for the eventual payment of medical claims – currently 85.2 % as represented by their medical loss ratios .
Their business costs relate strictly to their product – the administrative services – currently 14.8 % of their revenues .
Thus their profit margin , to make sense , should be calculated based on their business model of providing us administrative services , but not on the funds held in trust which involve negligible expenses but which provide them with long term investment income .
( Profit statements for the notorious financial services industry should also be adjusted accordingly since that is also our money that they are jerking around . )
The 3.3 % profit margin reported by Morningstar includes the funds held in trust , but if adjusted to include only all costs of their legitimate business operations of producing and marketing their administrative services then their profit margin is actually 22.3 % .
That moves them into first place on the Fortune 500 list of profitable firms , in front of the network and communications equipment industry ( 20.4 % profit ) .
To be realistic , playing with these numbers does not change the fact that eliminating these profits would have only a very small direct impact on our total national health expenditures – saving less than 1 % of our health care dollars .
What would have a tremendous impact would be to eliminate an industry that has the incentive of a 22 % profit margin on a product that is designed to reduce our access to the health care that we need , not to mention a product that places a costly administrative burden on our health care delivery system .
Eliminating the private insurance industry could have a hugh direct impact on our health care spending – diverting perhaps $ 4 trillion over the next ten years from administrative waste , and redirecting it to patient care .
We need to take heed of this comment in today ’s Los Angeles Times :
“ As President Obama ’s push for a healthcare overhaul moves toward its final act , the oft - vilified health insurance industry is on the verge of seeing a plan enacted that largely protects its financial interests . ”

Apps for the new Zune HD ( read our review ) are now available ... with an unexpected " bonus " : static and video ads that play during launch .
Nine apps are available : calculator , weather , Texas hold 'em , Sudoku , Space Battle 3 , Shell Game ...
Of the Future , Hexic , Goo Splat , and Chess .
They can be downloaded freely from the " Marketplace " menu on the device , and a new " Apps " menu item then appears on the main screen ( you 'll need to scroll down the main menu to see it , as it's pushed off the bottom of the first screen ) .
Apps function just as you 'd expect — they 're small programs that look great and really take advantage of the nice screen .
They are all professionally designed by Microsoft , though a couple are really worthless ( ahem , Shell Game ...
Of the Future ) , but hey , they 're free !
Or , rather , they 're " free , " since Microsoft has apparently decided to sell ads against them .
The ads show up during app launch , which takes an astonishingly long time .
Booting Chess took 30 seconds , though I suppose one could be grateful for the Kia Soul video that gives the eyes something to do .
The Zune HD has Soul
Launching the weather app takes about 8 seconds , the calculator about 9 .
Goo Splat , which has been showing a static ad this morning for the Soul , launches in about 17 seconds .
Launching the Sudoku game
Ads do n't show up ( or at least they have n't yet ) when launching the utility apps , calc and weather ; instead , they are limited to the games .
The games themselves are bright , colorful , and work much better with the touchscreen than they ever did with the touch pad in the last Zune models .
Chess and Sudoku , especially , look like an excellent diversion when you have a few minutes to kill .
The apps are all touch - enabled , though it looks as though only the calculator takes advantage of the accelerometer ; twisting the screen into landscape mode switches the calculator to a scientific model .
Like the Web browser , the apps feel like a decent " bonus " on a generally excellent media player , though none are exceptionally compelling .
Reactions to the ads may differ , though it is possible to avoid them by keeping games off the Zune HD .
Some pictures of the apps in action below :
MTV Ken Ober , right , and the rest of the cast of “ Remote Control ” in 1987 .
Ken Ober , a brassy comedian best known as the host of the 1980s - era MTV game show “ Remote Control , ” died this weekend , Mark Measures , an agent at Abrams Artists who worked with him , said on Monday .
Mr. Ober , who lived in Santa Monica , Calif. , was 52 .
The cause of death was not immediately known .
Lee Kernis , a manager at Brillstein Entertainment Partners who represented Mr. Ober for more than 20 years , said that Mr. Ober was found dead on Sunday .
He said that Mr. Ober was last heard from on Saturday night , when he spoke to a friend and complained of a headache and flu - like symptoms .
Mr. Ober told the friend that he was going to take something and would see a doctor as soon as possible .
Mr. Ober , who was born in Brookline , Mass . and raised in Hartford , Conn. , grew up idolizing game show hosts like Bob Barker and Bob Eubanks , and went on to host four game shows of his own , including a revived version of “ Make Me Laugh ” in 1997 .
But his breakthrough came a decade earlier when Mr. Ober , a contestant on the televised talent show “ Star Search , ” became the host of the MTV series “ Remote Control ” in 1987 .
That show , which was the network ’s first original series to focus on non-musical content , tested participants on their knowledge of television , music - video and pop-culture trivia .
The show , which also provided a launching pad for the careers of comedians like Adam Sandler and Colin Quinn , drew much of its sarcastic , self - mocking spirit from the culturally obsessive Mr. Ober , who ran the program like a late - night talk show ( or frat party ) and gleefully teased players who gave wrong answers .
Van Toffler , the president of MTV Networks , said on Monday , “ Ken was a great guy .
His personality really brought ‘ Remote Control ’ to life , as well as a new style of programming for MTV .
We were really flying by the seat of of our pants then , and Ken was the reason it worked . ”
In recent years Mr. Ober also worked as a producer on comedy series like “ Mind of Mencia ” and “ The New Adventures of Old Christine . ”
Mr. Kernis said , “ He was a terrific friend .
I ’m still shocked . ”
Watch Ken Ober in a clip from “ Remote Control ” from 1989 :
Life , the BBC 's latest totally unbelievable nature documentary , is airing in 10 episodes between now and Christmas .
Not only is the footage as incredible as you 'd expect ; the studio sent some production notes our way explaining how scenes were shot .
" Filming the bouncing toad was very challenging ; the remote mountain plateau is one mile high and 26 square miles in area , whilst the toad is one inch long and very elusive .
The tarantulas which prey on them are also very hard to find .
To give the crew the best chance of finding and filming them , the expert on these creatures came on the shoot .
He searched for a week before the crew 's arrival to find both species and a location where they could come together and where the toad would demonstrate its bouncing - ball method of escape .
This allowed the cameraman to set up his slow - motion camera in the right place .
The scientist was able to ensure that the toad was never in danger of being harmed by the tarantula as a result of us filming them .
The technique was a total success - the toad tucked its legs in , rolled and bounced , allowing the crew to film its method of escape in slow - motion detail . "
" A Jesus Christ lizard running on water is so fast that a human would have to run at 65 miles per hour to achieve the same trick .
The speed makes it an enormous challenge to film .
After consulting with a scientist at Harvard University who has made a ground - breaking study of the lizard 's water sprint , the crew decided that as well as filming the behaviour at normal frame rates they would attempt to capture the close up details of the lizard 's run with a slow - motion camera filming at 2000 frames per second ( i.e. slowed down by 80 times ) .

It 's very hard to predict exactly where and when a lizard will run , what 's more it's all so quick that once the lizard is spotted it 's gone in a blur !
Learning from the scientist 's observation methods was essential and as a result it was decided to film the details of the sprint would need some degree of control to ensure that the crew had some idea of where and when the lizard would run .
They travelled to Belize , home of the lizard , to work with local animal experts who had some lizards in natural forest enclosures .
If , and when , these lizards decided to run , they always ran along the same stretch of water , where the cameraman could station his camera .
The key to success was using the latest digital slow - motion camera that continuously records into a memory buffer , so that when the cameraman hits the trigger button he downloads the action that took place a second or so before that moment .
Whenever a lizard sprinted past the cameraman over the water the cameraman hit the trigger , desperately trying to keep the lizard in the frame and in focus .
The final end result of this was stunning , slow motion shots of the lizards , with every drop of water visible as they sprinted through the surface . "
OK , we do n't actually have any notes on how this was shot .
But the macro shot of water beading up on the gecko's hydrophobic skin is gorgeous .

The series is playing now on BBC One .
Monday night I attended the " Stand Up America " rally in Houston hosted by the North Houston Tea Party Patriots .
And while I feel the event was a resounding success , I couldnt help but get a feeling of despair among 15,000 patriotic Americans who truly do want to see our country restored to the Constitutional Republic under which it was formed .
These are all good , hard - working , salt - of - the - earth people who simply want government out of their lives as every American should .
And I couldnt agree more .
No , its not that feeling of hope and determination to see our country freed from the grips of corruption and the abject dismissal of the public will by our " elected " leaders which caused me such despair .
It was the fact that while so many of these great Americans are so right on so many issues , they have for the most part , fallen hook , line and sinker for the Big Lie .
These are the red- blooded Americans who have drunk the " Islamo - fascist " Kool - Aid served up by the main stream media , especially Fox News , and created by the Pentagon , NGOs , " think - tanks " and intelligence agencies of the world .
This delusion is akin to the left - wing liberals and " progressives " who drank and still consume the " Change we can believe in " lie which swept Obama into office last year .
We were told more than 8 years ago that 9/11 changed everything .
We have largely bought that lie , collectively , as a nation and because of this , let the powers that be run roughshod over our Constitution , our rule of law and our way of life all in the name of " security " and defending our homeland from the " evil doers " of the world .
From this lie , has risen in this country a fervent patriotism and attitude that America can do no wrong in the world .
We re the " good guys " after all .
So while all these Tea Partiers , Red-Staters and conservative Republicans are right on so many issues such as ending the Federal Reserve system , abolishing the income tax , enforcing states rights , the global warming hoax , blocking Cap & Trade and the abysmal government " health - care " reform , and massively reducing the size and scope of our federal bureaucracy , they are dead wrong on their unflinching and unwitting support of " our troops . "
They still believe that " you re either with us , or you re with the terrorists . "
What a slick sales ( con ) job that line was …
A Century of War : Angl ... Engdahl , F. William Best Price : $ 1.43 Buy New $ 19.99 ( as of 05:55 EST - Details )
Now do nt get me wrong here .
As an honorably discharged Army veteran who served four years for his country , I know many people will get offended by that last statement , so let me explain further .
If youve ever read George Orwells 1984 , you know that , " Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia . "
This seems eerily similar to the lie that weve been sold about the terrorist threat to our country .
The lie that we need a " 100 - year war " because this enemy doesnt abide by the " traditional " rules of war ( whatever THAT means ) , and that we need to take the battle to them so we dont end up with a " mushroom cloud " over here , is just that : a LIE .
Perhaps a quick review of history will drive home this point :
" If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it , people will eventually come to believe it .
The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political , economic and / or military consequences of the lie .
It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent , for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie , and thus by extension , the truth is the greatest enemy of the State .
~ Joseph Goebbels , Nazi Propaganda Minister
Why of course the people do n’t want war .
Why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece ?
Naturally the common people do n’t want war neither in Russia , nor in England , nor for that matter in Germany .
That is understood .
But , after all , it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along , whether it is a democracy , or a fascist dictatorship , or a parliament , or a communist dictatorship .
Voice or no voice , the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders .
That is easy .
All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked , and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger .
It works the same in any country .

It is precisely this " Islamo - fascist / War on Terror " lie which is propagated by not only right - wing media personalities such as Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh and Bill OReilly among many others , but an increasing amount of left - wing media talking - heads like Chris Matthews , Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow as well now that " their guy " is in power .
The war is suddenly OK .
" Obama is just doing his best to clean up Bush mess .
Theres only so much he can do , you know . "
Yeah , right .
Well , my fellow patriotic Americans , its not OK .
It s not OK that we went into Iraq , killed over 1.3 million innocent civilians , polluted their soil and water with depleted uranium munitions , displaced millions of other Iraqis , and have turned their country into a third - world cesspool so that we could control their oil .
It s not OK that we went into Afghanistan so that we could re-invigorate the opium trade ( which had been all but decimated by the Taliban ) , keep the black market money flowing to fund the CIA , ISI , MI6 , Mossad , etc. , and ensure record crops of poppy fields while " our troops " stand guard .
Pat Tillman was about to come home and expose it all until he was murdered by his own government .
So , my fellow Americans , please understand that when you blindly say you " support the troops " because thats what good Americans do , you are only supporting the individual and NOT their command or their mission .
For it has been proven that their mission is a lie , a fraud , unconstitutional and illegal .
Support the individual and pray for their safety  not only from our " supposed " enemies who are merely defending their own homeland , sovereignty , property and natural resources , but from those in our own government who use them merely as instruments in their sick and twisted game of global empire and world domination .
As Henry Kissinger , one of the long - time establishments " elite " minions and another questionable winner of the Nobel " Peace " Prize , so bluntly put it , " Military men are just dumb stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy . "
This is the same attitude of your leaders in DC .
Yes , it is sad that our troops have been reduced to the heavy hand enforcers of western " democracy " under a corrupt and tyrannical American government .
Our troops are now nothing more than the strong arm of the global mafia : the cabal of central banks and greedy corporations of the world working in concert to rob the wealth of nations and impoverish and enslave the good people of the world .
These criminals own the entire military industrial complex , to include the " troops " and these are the same people pushing hard for their " global government " which will be pushed further down the path to realization in Copenhagen , Denmark this December under the guise of once again , " saving humanity from itself . "

These so - called " elites " are the true destroyers of humanity and all that is good in the world and they have the nerve to use false patriotism and wrap themselves in the American flag as they send our sons and daughters , brothers and sisters and fathers and mothers off to fight and die in unjust wars in foreign lands .
Not to protect and defend our Constitution , our ideals , our morals and our way of life , but to ensure the corporate takeover of the world ; to enable the raping and pillaging of sovereign lands not for the gain of world peace or " democracy , " but of PROFIT and greater and greater power ; and to lead humanity towards the neo- feudal system which has been their dream and ultimate end - game for decades , if not centuries .
If nothing else in my life , I have learned one very important lesson : if you want to get to the truth about anything , you need to only figure out two things :
1 . Who is benefitting from this ?
and
2. Follow the money .
By simply taking the time and doing your own research , your due diligence and your duty not only as an American citizen , but as a member of all humanity , you will always come to the truth .
As it was written in Matthew 7:7 , " Ask , and it shall be given to you , seek and ye shall find , knock and it shall be opened unto you . "
So I put this challenge out to ALL my fellow patriots , freedom - fighters , conservatives , libertarians and liberals alike :
Seek the TRUTH and ye shall find .
Reject the corporate - controlled mainstream media , especially the NeoCon conservative talk show hosts around the country .
Always remember this .
You could eat the most beautiful , juicy and delicious apple in the world , but if there is just one drop of cyanide in that apple , it will most likely kill you .
That s the essential purpose of the corporate - controlled media .
They are not there to inform or educate , they are there to indoctrinate .
They are there to perpetuate the false left / right paradigm so as to divide and conquer a nation .
They are there to lie , spin , distort and stretch reality to fit a pre-determined agenda .
They are controlled ultimately by the same people , corporations , and monied interests who control the Federal Reserve banking system which is destroying our country by design .
It s all about control and manipulation of our minds , our thoughts , our beliefs , our attitudes , and thus , our actions .

Unfortunately , the vast majority of the conservative minds in this country have fallen victim to the manipulation of the Big Lie , which is the " War on Terror . "
It s no more than the modern incarnation of the " War on Poverty , " the " War on Cancer , " or the " War on Drugs . "
All of which , I might add , have been colossal failures while lining the pockets and increasing the power of the authoritarian establishment which has benefitted from them all .
Ultimately , all the belief in the Big Lie will do is cripple the patriot movement as the outrage against the Democrats and the damage theyve done to our nation will increase support for the Republicans .
And the fake , NeoCon " conservatives " will once again be swept into power .
All the while , the hundred - year war rages on as one puppet of the establishment replaces another .
Quit buying into the Big Lie .
You re smarter than that .
And ask yourself the next time you blindly cheer in support of our troops , " who is benefitting from this ? "
Is it the country and citizens of Iraq or Afghanistan ?
Is it the believers of the essentially peaceful Islamic religion ?
Is it our troops coming home maimed , traumatized , poisoned and in body bags ?
Or is it Halliburton , KBR , BP Amoco , Exxon Mobil , CACI , Dyncorp , Blackwater , L3 Communications , Raytheon , Titan , GE , McDonnell Douglas and so on and so on ….?
Is it our federal government who has since 2001 , gutted our Constitution in a power grab never before seen in American history ?
Who has benefitted ?
Follow the money .
Seek the TRUTH .
And if you really do support the troops , fight , with everything you have to end these illegal wars of aggression and empire - building so that we can bring them home to do what they re sworn to do : protect our borders from foreign invasion , and protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America !

Breaking News !
Google is planning to hold a special Chrome OS event at its headquarters ( Mountain View , CA ) this Thursday , 19th .
After a long wait since July , this is company ’s first talks over Chrome OS .
The potential plan is to lay some technical background and excite the community with demos .
Google ’s VP of Product Management : Sundar Pichai , and Matthew Papakipos , will be seen as the engineers on stage .
From the last week , we had been hearing about Chrome OS launch this week .
This still may be the case at this event , but it looks for now that the more complete launch will in fact take place next year .
And if they are holding this event now with a complete overview , you can probably expect beta launch to be sometime on Jan or Feb .
Google first announced Chrome OS in July , but gave very few details about it .
It seemed the idea there was more to drop a nuclear bomb on Microsoft , which was just about to announce its online free version of Office .
In the subsequent months , interest has remained high for Chrome OS , but about all we ’ve seen is what the OS ’s browser may look like .
Meantime get a glimpse of all our posts on Chrome OS under “ suggested reading ”
We ’ll update you with more details on Thursday .

Benchmarking Ruby exception handling
Which is better , handling an exception or explicitly checking to see whether or not your code is going to break ?
The answer is " it depends " .
On the one hand exception handling allows us to write more legible code ( often summed up by the saying " it 's easier to ask forgiveness than permission " ) .
On the other , handling an exception is often a costly operation ; it can be faster to " look before you leap " .
But just how costly is exception handling ?
Happily it 's very easy to find out .
I was working away with my pair recently when this very question came up .
We were calculating a ratio between two numbers , but wanted to modify the calculation so that if the denominator was 0 , we 'd use 0.5 instead .
Our function looked something like this :
def calculate_ratio( apples , oranges ) apples / oranges rescue ZeroDivisionError apples / 0.5 end
It 's succinct and , I think , very readable .
We call this function a lot , and in a large percentage of those calls oranges will be 0 .
Just how expensive is that ?
There 's only one way to find out .
Test it !
The Benchmark module contains a few nifty functions for testing this kind of scenario .
I wrote two functions , ask_forgiveness and ask_permission and ran each of them a few million times with the bm ( ) function .
require " benchmark " include Benchmark LOOP_COUNT = 1000000 def ask_forgiveness ( a ) 1 / a rescue ZeroDivisionError 1 / 0.5 end def ask_permission ( a ) denominator = ( a == 0 ) ?
0.5 : a 1 / denominator end bm ( 5 ) do |test| test.report ( " Forgiveness : " ) do LOOP_COUNT.times do |i| ask_forgiveness ( i % 2 ) end end test.report ( " Permission : " ) do LOOP_COUNT.times do |i| ask_permission ( i % 2 ) end end end
We assumed that 50 % of our function calls would result in a ZeroDivisionError , which is why we 're passing i % 2 into our two functions ( it alternates between 0 and 1 ) .
And the results ?
user system total real Forgiveness : 6.780000 0.360000 7.140000 ( 7.172876 ) Permission : 1.080000 0.010000 1.090000 ( 1.090219 )
A clear win ( in this case ) for checking ahead of time .
It was worth benchmarking as I 'd normally go with the more legible exception handling approach every time .
Exception handling is at it's best when exceptions really are the exception to the rule ...
I love feedback and questions — please get in touch on Twitter or leave a comment .
If you ’re like me , you ’ll agree there ’s nothing so dispiriting as finding yourself in the lavishly appointed dining room of a luxury resort , flute of Prosecco in hand , about to embark on a nine - course tasting menu — when , from somewhere up on the ceiling , in wafts the opening verse of “ Lady in Red . ”
Maybe I ’m oversensitive , but it felt like a dentist ’s drill aimed squarely at my skull .
I loathed Chris de Burgh ’s 1986 original ; going cheek - to - cheek with this florid instrumental version was infinitely worse .
From that point on the meal became an afterthought , while the god-awful sound track consumed all my attention .
An orchestral arrangement of Barry Manilow ’s “ Mandy ” came and gave without mercy .
Mantovani ’s rendition of “ Leaving on a Jet Plane ” only made me wish I were .
They say music has the perceived effect of slowing down time .
In this case it made time grind to an agonizing halt .
By dessert ( rhubarb tart and six violins playing “ Against All Odds ” ) my thoughts were with Manuel Noriega , holed up in that embassy , besieged by the likes of Rick Astley .
When I finally escaped to my room , I savored the silence like never before .
At breakfast the next morning , however , it was a whole new vibe .
Jazz drifted through the room like sunlight glistening off the china .
The warble of Chet Baker ’s trumpet put me in a perky mood .
Everything seemed brighter , crisper , cooler .
Two meals , two playlists , two wildly different impressions of the very same table .
Some people are irked by bad lighting , excessive AC , the reek of European men ’s cologne .
I ’m hopelessly particular about music .
Background sound tracks can make or break my impression of a place — and these days every place has one , from wine bars to Williams - Sonoma .
Too often it ’s employed with alarming incompetence .
I ’m not talking about loud music in public spaces .
I ’m talking about bad music in public spaces .
If the right song playing at the right restaurant functions like a rave review posted in the window , the wrong music is like a violation notice from the Board of Health : do not approach .
back slowly away .
Most people , I ’m told , hardly notice background music , which I guess is the point .
But like a dog tuned to the shrillest frequencies , I seem to register only the most grating aural wallpaper , the Célines and Enriques and Mariahs ( she of the voice like a dog whistle ) .
I ’ve walked out of otherwise appealing shops that elect to blare Maroon 5 .
I ’ve hung up on reservations lines that put me on hold to “ Groovy Kind of Love . ”
I bring earplugs on planes to block out not the roar of the engines but the insipid pabulum of the boarding music .
In certain environments songs are presumed to help people relax .
They generally have the opposite effect .
Spas still insist on playing what my piano teacher liked to call “ newage ” ( “ rhymes with sewage ” ) .
This sounds innocuous enough for the first two minutes , but after an hour ties your nerves into knots faster than any therapist can undo them .
Airports play soaring ballads that are supposed to make you feel like you ’re flying ; they make me feel like stabbing someone with a piccolo .
Resorts pump their newage right into the pool via underwater speakers , leaving you no hope of escape .
Even hospitals get it unfathomably wrong .
A friend of mine went in for an MRI and had to endure not only her own claustrophobia but also the clinic ’s cheesy piped - in sound track — 45 minutes of continuous soft hits to the head .
The infuriating thing about background music is not that it ’s unavoidable ; it ’s that it screws with the natural order of things , elevating the blandest drivel ( “ Lady in Red ” ) to the status of a timeless classic — or , worse , sullying timeless classics ( “ Eleanor Rigby ” ) by programming them alongside the drivel .
It would be revealing to compile an alternative history of Western music , focused solely on Songs Played in Hotel Lobbies and Cruise - Ship Corridors Through the Ages .
You ’d document a bizarro parallel universe , one where Michael McDonald is more popular than Led Zeppelin and Vivaldi ’s Four Seasons trumps everything by Mozart .
The Eagles would be more revered than Dylan ; Jamiroquai bigger than Springsteen .
And at the top of the pyramid , with her Nagel - print cheekbones , would sit Sade .
The quintessential background record of any era , Sade ’s “ Smooth Operator ” ( 1984 ) was also the perfect theme for its time : languid , sexy , and reeking of money .
This explains why it ’s been playing in yacht clubs and business - class lounges since the Reagan administration , despite being a patently ridiculous song ( not least for the sax solo ) .
Its popularity highlights a key ingredient of the genre :
If you ’re going to make sultry , anodyne lounge music , it helps to sing with an accent .
Sade ’s own inflections — she rhymes Key Lah - go with Chicago — were indeterminate ( French ?
Latin ?
Nigerian ?
Who could tell ? ) , yet indisputably cosmopolitan .
An even better tactic for background success ?
Do n’t sing in English at all .
Whether it ’s Serge Gainsbourg wooing Jane Birkin or Cesaria Evora lamenting her saudade , foreign - language songs are believed to lend any venue an air of sophistication .
They ’re easy to listen to and easy not to listen to , since the lyrics make no sense .
Where would your neighborhood tapas bar be without the worldly stylings of the Gipsy Kings , the Buena Vista Social Club ( the Gipsy Kings of the 90’s ) , and Amadou & Mariam ( the Gipsy Kings of the 00’s ) ?
Then there ’s Brazilian music , which has supplanted reggae as the global sound track for chillaxing .
From Bali to Bodrum , every high - end sandal emporium and beachfront sushi bar seems to play the same 12 songs by the same six Brazilian singers — particularly Bebel Gilberto , the Brazilian Sade .
The samba is as ubiquitous as the caipirinha .
( Do n’t get me wrong , I adore Brazilian music , even after 3,500 listens .
Not knowing Portuguese , I used to think it the most romantic music of all .
I ’ve since learned that every song is about soccer .
But I love it no less . )
If you think I take this all too seriously , talk to Daniel Barenboim .
The Argentine conductor has spoken out vehemently against the creep of background music into every corner of public life , calling it “ as disturbing [ as ] the most despicable aspect of pornography . ”
Others agree .
A London - based group called Pipedown is waging a vigorous campaign against canned music ; in 2002 they staged a demonstration outside Selfridges department store .
Two years earlier , a bill was introduced in the British House of Commons proposing a ban on recorded music in civic spaces .
( It did n’t pass . )
Citizens have to reclaim “ the right not to listen to music , ” argue Alan Bradshaw and Morris B. Holbrook in their ( very funny ) 2008 treatise “ Must We Have Muzak Wherever We Go ? ”
Comparing background music to secondhand smoke and acid rain , the economists claim it promotes “ a culture of non-listening . ”
More troubling to the authors is the insidious manipulation at work by marketing and retail puppeteers who do n’t play music so much as deploy it .
Studies have shown that sad songs can actually boost greeting - card sales ; that slow songs inspire shoppers to spend more time in supermarkets ; and that classical music spurs diners to order more expensive bottles of wine .
Background music is as old as recording itself — though , unlike the recording industry , it shows no sign of going away .
It found its apotheosis in Muzak , created in 1934 and still heard in 400,000 locations worldwide .
Other services have expanded on the Muzak model , including the Austin - based DMX , which sends its 106 satellite channels out to Cheesecake Factories and Gold ’s Gyms across the nation , reaching 80 million defenseless listeners .
DMX ’s themed playlists range from Malt - Shop Oldies and Riviera Discothèque to Italian Bistro Blend , which sounds like a coffee and seems to perform the same function .
( “ Give me a nonfat ‘ Volare ’ with a double shot of Prima ! ” )
DMX , it turns out , was responsible for the turgid dinner mix I ’d heard at the resort .
This was Channel 22 , Beautiful Instrumentals .
Then again , the Chet Baker mix I ’d enjoyed over breakfast was also a DMX stream : Channel 5 , Straight - Ahead Jazz .
Perhaps they were n’t wholly evil after all .
Later I spoke to the resort ’s GM and gently suggested that he reconsider the dinner music .
He made no promises , though the phrase “ melon scooper in my eardrum ” was , I thought , fairly convincing .
Still , one man ’s Mantovani is another man ’s Mingus .
Who ’s to say the regular clientele wo n’t prefer Beautiful Instrumentals to Straight - Ahead Jazz ?
This is the fundamental problem with music in public spaces .
Not everyone has an opinion about the proper temperature of the salmon or the aesthetic merit of that floral arrangement .
But everyone has an opinion about music .
There ’s no accounting for taste , especially that of your customers .
No wonder so many places farm their music out to professionals .
My friend Jeremy Abrams is one of those professionals .
His consulting company , Audiostiles , devises playlists for Thomas Keller ’s restaurants and Four Seasons Hotels , among other clients .
The service is as much about branding as it is about entertainment .
As Abrams explains on his website , “ Décor , accessories , and clothes all create image , persona , and mood … .
Music now does the same . ”
A well - chosen “ soundscape ” also says , “ Trust us , we ’re hip .
Even if we did n’t program this iPod . ”
The idea that piped - in music could actually be hip is a relatively new one .
Perhaps I ’m just getting old and out of touch , but lately I ’ve been hearing songs I like in the Container Store .
Eight times out of 10 they still subject you to James Blunt , but just when you ’re ready to hang a noose around that Elfa closet rod , along comes Arcade Fire to set everything right .
The sea change , for me , came on a recent flight on Delta .
It ’s been my experience that music , like food , is best avoided on passenger jets .
So imagine my surprise at actually enjoying Delta ’s boarding music — even writing down the names of songs to buy later : Grant Lee Phillips ’s “ Fountain of Youth , ” M. Ward ’s “ For Beginners , ” Jeremy Messersmith ’s cover of the Replacements ’ “ Skyway ” ( my favorite song by my favorite band ) .
When was the last time you discovered great music on an airplane ?
For the most part , though , the song remains the same .
Three hours later I was in the airport waiting out a layover when my ears pricked up at a familiar line : “ Coast to coast , L.A. to Chicago .../ Across the north and south to Key Lah - go .... ”
It suddenly struck me that I ’ve heard “ Smooth Operator ” more times than I ’ve heard “ Born to Run , ” more often than I ’ve listened to NPR ’s All Things Considered , maybe more than I ever heard my own grandmother speak .
It ’s not as if I chose to ; I never owned the recording ( and if I did I would n’t tell anyone ) .
Yet at that particular moment , I confess , it was the ideal sound track .
The lazy spirals of saxophone melted the stress of the commute away .
The epic line at security did n’t loom as large .
I had considered popping a Xanax , but no longer felt the need .

Medical expenses are rising faster than the costs of any other service .
They are climbing at rates that exceed not only those of inflation and dollar depreciation but even the Federal government itself .
In fact , they are consuming an ever larger share of personal and national incomes .
Some 40 years ago American medical spending was estimated at 5 percent of national income ; today it is calculated at some 16.5 percent and rising continually .
Several reform proposals in Congress would boost the share ever higher .
Many observers offer lucid explanations of the medical - spending explosion .
Some are convinced that the present generation of Americans , which enjoys a level of income and living standard higher than that of its forebears , is more mindful of health and wholesome living and , therefore , is spending a larger share of income on health care .
But critics prefer to point to the ever growing number of Americans who are overweight or even obese , which may breed physical disorders and afflictions and finally acquire medical attention .
Other observers hold the endless stream of medical innovations responsible for rapidly rising health - care costs , such as new drugs and delicate tools for microsurgery .
They lay most of the expense explosion at the feet of technology .
But these writers never explain why new drugs and new tools should raise medical costs threefold and consume an ever larger share of national income .
Technical innovations usually lower the costs of production .
A few writers believe that the primary reason for rapidly rising costs of health care is a massive expansion of medical insurance which foots doctors and hospital bills .
They like to use an inordinate terminology that diverts the reader from the actual causes .
They broaden the concept of insurance to encompass Medicare and Medicaid , which are government programs providing medical care for the aged and needy , and then hint at insurance as the driving cost factor .
In reality , the number of Americans with health insurance actually is declining ; rising health - care costs and a declining number of employer - sponsored benefits are steadily reducing the number of insured Americans .
At the present , some 47 million Americans are bereft of any coverage .
Few observers dare to state that spiraling health - care costs are the inevitable consequence of a 1965 Social Security amendment molding Medicare and Medicaid .
It provided a basic welfare program that covers most persons aged 65 and older as well as all needy individuals .
Soon after its passage some four million patients rushed to seek treatment and some 18 million Americans registered to have 80 percent of doctor and surgeon bills paid by the new system .
By now , in 2006 , Medicare provides health benefits for 41 million elderly and disabled persons , and Medicaid , a joint federal - state program , serves some 50 million poor beneficiaries .
It is the fastest - growing item in most state budgets and accounts for some 20 percent of total state spending .
The program undoubtedly has saved lives as it has enabled elderly and poor people to receive medical treatment they were not able to afford on their own .
It has raised the quality of living for many .
But its sponsors completely ignore some undesirable consequences such as the soaring costs and the rising number of people who therefore choose to forego any health insurance coverage .
Surely , it has saved some lives but also may have cost some .
It has doubled , tripled , and quadrupled many phases of the health - care industry but also kept other service industries smaller than they would have been in a free service economy .
It has helped administrators of hospitals and extended - care facilities to embark upon substantial expansion and has stimulated development of many home - care services .
But there cannot be any doubt that the massive injection of political funds and the growing role of legislators and regulators have radically changed the very nature and structure of the health - care industry .
Medicare and Medicaid are political handiwork forged by legislators and regulators , fashioned by politicians who recast it in every national election .
It is a very popular political issue passed and argued about without ever being settled .
Politicians representing the beneficiaries are demanding ever more outlays , others speaking and acting for the people who are forced to cover the deficits are opposing the charges .
Facing ever rising costs , some want to reduce the cost - of living increases in benefits , others plan to increase the wage subject to payroll taxation .
In 2005 the benefit - politicians raised the maximum earnings subject to Social Security tax exactions to $ 90,000 with the tax rate at 12.4 percent , borne equally by employer and employee .
In 2006 they raised the maximum to $ 94,200 ; in coming years they will boost it to $ 100,000 and more .
Medicare and Medicaid stand in the center of attention in every national election as both parties may seek to outbid each other in promising more benefits .
In 2003 Congress was persuaded to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare , starting in 2006 .
Most of its costs , estimated at some $ 700 billion over the next 10 years , are to be paid by taxpayers .
But soaring costs are the least portentous consequences of the transformation of the health - care industry .
This academic observer is dismayed and disheartened by the role played by politics in such an important industry .
In a free and unhampered economy businessmen always seek to adjust their production to anticipated consumer demand ; the wishes and choices of consumers are paramount .
When government takes special interest in an industry , political judgments and motives take preference to the people 's choices .
When government on all its levels enters health care , the industry has to adjust to every dollar spent and every order given .
Surely , there are pains of readjustment but no particular economic crises .
People readily accommodate .
While they are not free to choose in the market place , they may plead and supplicate in the halls of politics .
Some courageous observers may even point to needless expenditures and waste as every health - care administrator may want to expand and improve his facilities .
After all , they no longer are limited by market orders but only by political considerations and favors .
Politics is likely to shape the future of medical care as far as the eye can see .
It builds upon popular political ideas , on old habits and predispositions , even resentment and envy .
It inflicts pain without end .
