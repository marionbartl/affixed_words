Like a robot lacking in judgment , stuck on a predetermined path - that 's how the government is behaving in its handling of the aid flotillas to the Gaza Strip .
The announcement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the security cabinet meeting Tuesday that the blockade of Gaza will continue and that Israel will keep on using force to prevent ships from entering Gaza 's port suggests that the foolishness continues and no lessons have been learned from this week 's incidents .

The Netanyahu - Ehud Barak government is oblivious to the impact of the failed takeover of the Turkish ship the Mavi Marmara , which ended with the killing of nine passengers .
It is oblivious to the international condemnation of this country 's actions - Israel once more finds itself isolated .
Most serious of all , it is oblivious to the damage it is causing to Israel 's strategic interests .
The lethal operation is making it difficult for the U.S. administration to rally a majority in the UN Security Council for new sanctions against Iran and is eroding the international front against the Islamic Republic , which the United States has put together with great diplomatic effort .
The naval operation challenges the negotiations with the Palestinians and weakens the bargaining ability of Netanyahu vis-a- vis U.S. President Barack Obama and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
The operation also ruins essential relations with Turkey and will cost Israel in lost tourists and export deals .
Instead of taking the initiative and developing a political exit strategy from the crisis , Netanyahu and Barak are digging themselves deeper into the quagmire .
The government apparently believes its own public relations , according to which Israel was the victim of " Al - Qaida supporters . "
If this is the case , it must immediately dismiss the heads of the security and intelligence services who failed to issue warnings in time and did not prepare accordingly to meet this new and dangerous enemy .
How does Israel plan to deal with the Irish ship the Rachel Corrie , which is on its way to the Gaza Strip ?
Will it also argue that the Irish government , which has given this ship its backing , is a member of Al - Qaida ?
Instead of insisting on continuing a policy that has failed , Netanyahu should pull himself together and minimize the damage of the naval operation .
He must appoint a commission of inquiry that will investigate what happened and lift the damaging and unnecessary blockade on the Gaza Strip , while developing a response to arms smuggling .
Statesmanship is measured by the ability to distinguish between what is important and what is not .
Netanyahu and Barak , who dragged Israel into a foolish struggle of prestige with Hamas and its supporters , erred by selecting a violent and damaging form of action .
They failed in this week 's test of statesmanship .

The Christie administration is contemplating making the nation 's most restrictive medical marijuana law even more restrictive .
Lawmakers do so at the expense of patients ' well being .
To review : In January , after years of debate , then - Gov. Jon Corzine signed legislation making New Jersey the 14th state to allow for the use of medical cannabis by qualified patients .
It authorizes select patients with a physician ’s recommendation to possess and obtain medical cannabis from up to six state - authorized “ alternative treatment centers . ”
Unlike the laws in 13 others states , state - qualified patients are not legally permitted to grow their own marijuana , nor are they allowed to use it to mitigate the symptoms of chronic painful conditions .
Yet these safeguards apparently provide little comfort to Gov. Chris Christie .
The governor has proposed amending state law so that patients would only be eligible to obtain medical cannabis in state hospitals .
He has also proposed limiting the cultivation of marijuana to a single supply source at Rutgers University .
Lawmakers ought to oppose to these amendments , which are unnecessary and , if enacted , would make New Jersey ’s law totally unworkable for patients .
How so ?
Consider this :
For over nine years the University of Massachusetts has sought unsuccessfully to cultivate marijuana for medical research purposes .
The university even went so far as to file a legal challenge with the Drug Enforcement Administration — which it won — to gain permission to grow pot .
Yet in 2009 the DEA ’s acting director overruled the agency ’s own administrative law judge in order to prohibit UMass from growing even a single marijuana plant , saying that would violate international conventions .
It is unlikely that a similar plan at Rutgers University would be met with any greater success .
Moreover , centralizing the supply of medical - grade cannabis severely limits patients ’ options .
Different strains of marijuana vary in their therapeutic prowess based on their percentages of distinct components known as cannabinoids .
By limiting patients ’ legal access to only one or two specific varieties of cannabis , lawmakers are needlessly consolidating the total number of patients that may be helped .
Finally , it is burdensome and unnecessary to limit patients ’ use of medical marijuana solely to hospitals .
As stated in 1988 by the DEA ’s own administrative law judge , “ Marijuana , in its natural form , is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man . ”
The plant ’s compounds are virtually non-toxic to healthy cells and organs , do not depress the central nervous system and are incapable of causing a fatal overdose .
Seriously ill patients in New Jersey have already waited years for legislative relief and safe access to medical marijuana .
Lawmakers should reject any further amendments or delays to the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act .
Paul Armentano is the deputy director of NORML , the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws .
A German man could face six months in prison after selecting an Adolf Hitler speech as his mobile phone ringtone .
According to the Telegraph , the 54 - year - old 's Nokia gave forth several times during a train journey in Hamburg , with Adolf pledging the " destruction of world Jewry " .
Fellow passengers alerted the police , who cuffed the man at his destination .
The Führer fan 's allegiance was confirmed by " swastika stickers and photos of Hitler " on the phone and the words " The greatest commander of all time " .
He 's charged with violating the German constitution , which takes a dim view of " public displays of the Nazis and all their works " . ®
You giggled at The Happening .
You snorted at The Village .
But now , for the first time ever , former indie auteur M. Night Shyamalan has set out to make a gonzo comedy on purpose , with The Last Airbender .
Spoilers ahead !
Advertisement
M. Night Shyamalan has always been fascinated by playing with genre conventions .
His famed love of twist endings is really an obsession with tweaking his audience 's expectations , and his best film , Unbreakable , is a superhero movie that comments on the superhero genre .
It was inevitable that he would slide into full - on genre pastiche .
Advertisement
And The Last Airbender is a lavish parody of big - budget fantasy epics .
It 's got everything : the personality - free hero , the nonsensical plot twists , the CG clutter , the bland romance , the new - age pablum .
No expense is spared — Shyamalan even makes sure to make fun of distractingly shitty 3 - D , by featuring it in his movie .
This is the part where I would insert a quick plot synopsis of the film , but it 's really unnecessary - Shyamalan has boiled every epic heroic story of the past 20 years down to its most basic , primal soup -y essence , so he can spray it all over the audience , in a kind of Hero 's - Journey bukkake .
You will be finding chunks of Joseph Campbell 's calcified spooge behind your ears for three days after watching this film , no matter how many times you bathe .
Shyamalan 's true achievement in this film is that he takes a thrilling cult TV series , Avatar : The Last Airbender , and he systematically leaches all the personality and soul out of it — in order to create something generic enough to serve as a universal spoof of every epic , ever .
All the story beats from the show 's first season are still present , but Shyamalan manages to make them appear totally arbitrary .
Stuff happens , and then more stuff happens , and what does it mean ?
We never know , because it 's time for more stuff to happen .
You start out laughing at how random and mindless everything in this movie is , but about an hour into it , you realize that the movie is actually laughing at you , for watching it in the first place .
And it 's laughing louder than you are , because it 's got Dolby surround - sound and you 're choking on your suspension of disbelief .

The comic recipe starts with the actors , who manage to recite every line of dialogue as though they 're ordering lunch for the fourth time that day .
( Because they were still peckish , or because their lunch order got lost the first three times . )
Nicola Peltz , who plays Katara , has one line of dialogue over and over through the movie : " We need to go ! "
She says this every few minutes , because this is Shyamalan 's way of letting us know that one set piece is over and it's time for the next set piece to begin .
" We need to go ! "
Depending on how badly the heroes need to go , she may pout , pushing her lips out into a trombone - player 's embouchure , for emphasis .
The film is simultaneously frenetic , racing at top speed , and yet totally disaffected , like the monomyth with mononucleosis .
Advertisement
Katara 's the girl sidekick and sorta - love interest to Aang , who 's an 11 - year - old monk with a bunch of cool tattoos and elemental powers .
We 're told that Aang is struggling with a lot of heavy shit — genocide , man .
It sucks , you know ? — but mostly he 's just sort of there .
The brilliance of Noah Ringer 's performance cannot be understated — he is the first performer ever to convince me utterly that he is standing in front of a greenscreen .
Even when Ringer is filmed on location , in front of a real - life mountain , he still manages to create the impression that his surroundings have been keyed in , and he 's actually in a studio somewhere .
This is a huge , crucial factor in the way the movie makes fun of its own epic -ness .
And I think everybody who has criticized Shyamalan for casting white actors as Asian characters in this film should admit they were wrong .
Clearly , Shyamalan tried to cast Asians , but he just could n't find any whose performances were lifeless enough .
Advertisement
I have n't even mentioned the dialog yet , which is where the real comic force of the movie comes in .
Like when Aang and his friends are taken prisoner by the Fire Nation and locked up with a bunch of Earth - benders , in a big dirt enclosure .
And Aang looks at the Earth - benders and shouts , " EARTH BENDERS !
THERE IS DIRT UNDER YOUR FEET !
THERE'S DIRT ALL AROUND YOU !
WHY DON'T YOU FIGHT ? "
And everybody 's like , " Whoa . "
They notice that there 's a lot of dirt here , all right .
How did they miss that ?
It 's like they 've got selective dirt - blindness .
Later in the film , Katara says my favorite line ever , " We need to show them that we believe in our beliefs as much as they believe in their beliefs . "
It 's as if Shyamalan had a cue card that he was planning to turn into an actual bit of dialog , but he forgot .
There 's a lot of cue - card writing in this film , and it feels like Shyamalan is leaving things as sign - posty as possible , in order to make fun of the by - the - numbers storytelling in so many Hollywood epics .
The master has come to school us all .

The third member of our main trio is Sokka , who 's played by one of the vampires from Twilight .
At one point , he falls in love with a silver - haired girl with insane costume jewelry , who looks like a refugee from the " wink of an eye " people , out of the original Star Trek .
We know that he's got the hots for her , because Katara tells us in a quickie voice - over .
Advertisement
Oh yeah - that 's another one of the ways in which this movie pokes fun at the very idea of epic fantasy : the endless confusing voice - over , in which tons of important story developments happen off - camera while we 're looking at a picture of a tree or a CG mountain .
Because why do we privilege the story of the hero 's progress over the tree ? , Shaymalan asks .
Why does the original Star Wars insist on showing us Luke Skywalker training with a lightsaber , instead of telling us that Luke Skywalker trained with a lightsaber while showing us a tracking shot of some rocks ?
Why pretend that one thing is more important than the other thing ?
Why pretend that any of it has any meaning ?
As a wise man once wrote , " A menu is as good as a myth . "
Also , if the original Star Wars had given us a tracking shot of rocks , with a voiceover explaining that Luke was learning to use a lightsaber someplace else , it would have freed up more screen time for Luke to stand around shouting , " JAWAS !
THERE IS SAND UNDER YOUR FEET ! "

Not to mention the many scenes in which characters rattle off exposition , and it feels as if somebody must have fed the scripts from the TV series into an office shredder , and then glued some of the word stripes together .
You can just imagine Shyamalan stopping the actors and demanding a retake , over and over again , because the actors were still stringing the sentences together as if they had a logical sequence .
It must have taken hours to get the right level of random , Ketamine - overdose level of dissociation into every scene where somebody explains about importance of the avatar and how you have to feel your feelings , in order to gerbil machete fish dumpling crank handle .
At its most sublime and brain - sluicing , the expository scenes approach the level of the opening act of D - War .
And that 's high praise .
Recently , at an Asian fusion restaurant , I was offered a thing called an Asiadilla .
This was a quesadilla with roast duck and hoisin sauce inside it .
Just let that idea sink into your mind and permeate your tastebuds — in essence , it 's Beijing Duck crossed with Tex - Mex .
With extra cheese .
Watching The Last Airbender is like being force - fed a hundred Asiadillas , washed down with a pitcher of overly sweet Saketinis .
The Asian kitsch flies at you , from the yin -yang fish to the army of Samurai who are all South Asian .
You want a cheesy foreign backdrop for your fantasy epic ?
M. Night Shyamalan will smother you in cheese !
Because the setting , in this movie , is just another trickster making fun of your desire to believe in it .
Airbender 's Asia is a giant pantomime , and you are Puss in Boots .

Through all of this chaos , two actors wander like lost souls , and they 're really the twin poles of this undertaking .
On the one side , you have Aasif Mandvi , of The Daily Show fame , who plays Commander Zhao in exactly the same way he handles the most ridiculous crap he has to say to Jon Stewart .
Every line he gets , he shouts and arches one eyebrow comically , in case you did n't already know this was a send - up .
( Anyone who 's watched Mandvi in the TV series Jericho knows he 's capable of subtlety and real emotion , so the fact that every one of his lines of dialogue in this film feels like it should be prefaced with an arch , " That 's right , Jon , " feels totally deliberate . )
Advertisement
And then there 's Shaun Toub , who stands out for the opposite reason :
He 's an honest - to - shit actual actor , and he looks as out of place as a zebra that 's wandered into an alpaca farm .
You can actually watch the realization dawn over Toub 's face that nobody else is doing any acting in this film , but he soldiers on , dedicated to his craft in spite of everything .
Toub , who 's playing the uncle of Dev Patel 's tormented Prince Zuko , is the real tragic hero of this movie , as you watch him struggle to cling to his dignity as everyone around him drowns in narrative sewage .
( Patel is pretty good when he 's acting opposite Toub . )
It 's a weird dichotomy in this film - the film 's villains are the only Asian people in the movie , but they 're also the only ones who have any personality whatsoever .

The Last Airbender , it must be said , features some incredibly great special effects ( despite the aforementioned CG - overload at times ) and the fight choreography is often really great .
We occasionally glimpse Momo , the flying lemur - bat , and we get a couple nice moments with Appa , the six - legged sky bison , and the landscape of Greenland is used to nice effect in a few scenes .
Every now and then , a cool idea or moment from the TV show breaks through the drone of engines grinding forward .
There are plenty of bad movies that know they 're bad — but TLA is the first bad movie that knows that you are bad .
You deserve your full share of the blame for this movie 's existence .
Airbender does n't just poke fun at its entire genre , with its hyperactive mix of randomness and blandness - it actually MST3Ks its audience .
Noah Ringer and that Civil War vampire from Twilight may seem at first to be sleepwalking through a rote adventure , but you realize at last that they 're actually delivering a commentary track on your callowness as an audience .
It 's deadpan , but unmistakable nonetheless .
Aang and Sokka become Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot , staring out of the screen and bemusedly riffing on our feeble attempts to invest in this saga .

In the traditional hero 's journey , the hero resists the call to adventure , before finally passing over the threshold into the dangerous but juicy fantasy world where he comes into his power .
And this is what happens to you , the audience , as you watch The Last Airbender , only in reverse .
You resist following this movie into the dark , scary place where heroes are pieces of furniture and heroism is a Monty Python routine performed by someone who 's never seen the original episodes .
But then it 's too late - you 've passed over the threshold , you are committed , you are on the journey and the story wo n't let you go .
You have been drawn into a place where you will lose , not only your power as an audience member , but quite possibly your mental faculties altoghether .
You are lost in the wilderness , and Shyamalan is your trickster guide on a journey into nothingness , from which only your soul - dead shadow will ever return .
Too late , you understand :
This is the last logic - bending movie you will ever be able to sit through .
Advertisement
In the middle of a summer of proctologically un - thought - out action movies , The Last Airbender breezes past self - parody into a full - on comedy assault that will have you hearing Shyamalan 's mocking laughter in your sleep .
It 's an absurdist masterpiece , in which a million things happen but nothing takes place .
( In completely flat 3 - D. )
This is the standard by which all future epics will be judged .

An Irish company has launched what could be the most efficient solar hot water panel ever produced .
Surface Power in County Mayo says it plans to create 20 new jobs over the next 12 months with the launch and international distribution of its new product .
Independent certification by TUV Rhineland has shown that when compared to other solar hot water panels the Surface developed panel was in one case as much as 131 % more efficient in morning and evening time and 76 % more efficient at midday .
Surface Power estimates that the product , which has undergone six years of development and testing , has the potential to reduce domestic and commercial hot water bills by up to 70 % if insulation standards meet new building regulations .
“ The market for the solar collector was worth in excess of one billion dollars in 2008 and has grown by 300 % since 1998 .
We received over 400 enquiries from the USA alone last month after the specifications were released during the Christmas period .
We also expect the international home renovation market to be very strong during the next three years , as our collector is the only pre-packaged vacuum collector on the world market .
This leads to quicker , simpler and cheaper installations , ” said John Quinn , Surface ’s founder .

CAIRO —
The owner of an Egyptian Internet cafe on Sunday said he witnessed police beating a young man to death and described the killing that has outraged rights activists .
Egypt's Interior Ministry has denied the allegations , claiming on Saturday that the 28 - year - old was wanted by police and died after choking on a joint he swallowed when policemen sought to arrest him .
Activists say 28 - year - old Khaled Said 's death is an example of rampant abuses made possible by a three - decade - old emergency law they describe as a central tool of repression by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's regime .
In a filmed interview posted online Sunday by a leading opposition party , cafe owner Hassan Mosbah said two police officers came into his establishment in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria , dragged Khaled Said out into the street and beat him to death there .
" We thought they would just interrogate him or ask him questions .
But they took him as he struggled with his hands behind his back and banged his head against the marble table inside here , " Mosbah said in an interview conducted by a journalist from the liberal oppositionnewspaper .
Mosbah said he told the police to take it outside and they hauled Said into the doorway of a nearby building .
He did not emerge alive , said the cafe owner .
A fact - finding mission by the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights , confirmed the cafe owner 's account .
" They dragged him to the adjacent building and banged his head against an iron door , the steps of the staircase and walls of the building , " the Cairo - based organization said in a statement Sunday .
Texas Governor Rick Perry suggested that Texas could still secede from the Union .
Let them !
Government works on the mythology that people actually know what they are doing .
The world runs on the same theory and in his seminal essay Why Americans hate foreign policy humorist P J O'Rourke pointed out the flaw in this thinking .
" The night before I left to cover the Iraq war , I got drunk with another friend , who works in TV news .
We were talking about how - as an approach to national security - invading Iraq was ... different .
" I 'd moved my family from Washington to New Hampshire .
My friend was considering getting his family out of New York .
' Do n't you hope , ' my friend said , ' that all this has been thought through by someone who is smarter than we are ?'
" It is , however , a universal tenet of democracy that no - one is . "
That tenet echoed loudly when I read the Prime Minister had apparently decided that picking a fight with the miners would be just the tonic to battle the impression that he is weak .
That sort of thinking , if it 's true of the PM , is of a piece with those who did n't think beyond what happens after a short sharp invasion of Iraq .
It 's cut from the same cloth as the decision to gamble the 60 - year - old relationship with Japan on the slim hope that an international court will stop whaling .
And it 's certainly in the same league as making that decision public just before you quietly announce a huge back flip on political advertising , leaving you open to the charge that foreign policy is being used for domestic political ends .
Since April , the notion that the people making decisions at the core of the Rudd Government are all too human has been pounding like a drum .
What this Government wins on the swings of daily tactical battles it loses on the strategic roundabout .
The short term has utterly swamped the long term and it's hard to avoid the conclusion that this is because there is chaos at its core and that is something that has been evident in this administration since its earliest days .
Do n't forget that the reason the Prime Minister needs to show strength is because some saw it as weak to shelve the emissions trading scheme .
So now , apparently , millions are to be expended ; jobs , national reputation and share value are to be risked to help heal a self - inflicted wound .
Let 's hope all this is fanciful because to the eye untutored in the mysterious genius of government it looks a lot like one daft idea is being wallpapered over another .
The last two months have been so untidy that some in Labor 's own ranks believe the only thing holding it up is that the alternative is unelectable .
They might be right but pause for a moment and ponder the cost of being wrong , again .
Imagine being the first Prime Minister to lose office after a single term since Jim Scullin in 1931 .
On the upside it would excite historians because Scullin beat Stanley Bruce in 1929 and he was the first and , until John Howard in 2007 , the only Prime Minister to lose his seat in a general election .
But that amusing footnote in history would be the only upside because the rest of what the historians would write would trash the reputation of Kevin Rudd .
He inherited a country with no net debt and the best set of accounts since Federation .
He arrived with approval ratings as high as any seen and was handed power to hire and fire in Cabinet beyond anything previously enjoyed by a Labor prime minister .
For the first two years he looked like a busy reformist and his reputation was enhanced by the Government 's response to the global financial crisis .
But while things looked good on the surface , there was trouble below deck .
His changes to the way government does business removed important bureaucratic checks and balances .
The criticism that was levelled against Mr Howard - that he centralised control in his office - is even truer of Mr Rudd .
Cabinet has been largely sidelined in favour of the gang of four in the Strategic Priorities and Budget Committee and almost everything of consequence has to be cleared by the Prime Minister 's Office .
The massive pipeline of government work all flows into the PMO : things have backed up and pressure has been building .
And then , all of a sudden , in an election year , the lid blew off .
After two years of dutifully ticking off every piddling election promise the Government abandoned core commitments in the space of a month as it cleared the deck for a poll .
It 's been very messy and the end result is that the Prime Minister 's reputation has been shredded .
On both sides of the political divide , internal polling reveals a deep disappointment in him .
He is now just another politician .
And because the back flips and back downs have been so spectacular it has masked all the good work that has been done by this Government .
His ministers and his caucus do not thank him for that and he has never been loved by his own .
He is now on very dangerous ground and the only salvation is a good election win .
A modest victory means he will face internal trouble from early in his second term .
This week the Prime Minister said he would win the election and win it well .
Billy McMahon said that .
He was wrong .
History remembers him as our worst post - war prime minister .
He was reviled by his colleagues and one , Paul Hasluck , wrote a withering assessment of him in his book The Chance of Politics .
" I confess to a dislike of McMahon .
The longer one is associated with him the deeper the contempt for him grows and I find it hard to allow him any merit .
Disloyal , devious , dishonest , untrustworthy , petty , cowardly - all these adjectives have been weighed by me and I could not in truth modify or reduce any one of them in its application to him . "
This time , Mr Rudd had best be right .

1 The vuvuzela
For many South Africa 2010 will always be synonymous with the plastic horn .
Fifa rejected calls for the horn – described by a South African journalist as " the instrument of hell " – to be banned .
The fact that the collective noise sounded like a swarm of mosquitoes did not stop the vuvuzela from being sold in the UK ‑ and even becoming an iPhone app .
2 The Jabulani
Barely a World Cup goes by without criticism of the official ball , but the Jabulani – meaning " be happy " or " rejoice " in Zulu – came in for particular flak .
The " roundest ball ever " was criticised by players and coaches alike in the runup to the tournament .
A series of high - profile and costly blunders by players , including one from England 's Robert Green , meant the condemnation continued , although , as usual , by the end of the tournament the ball had been accepted .
3 Managers on trend
Before the World Cup , Joachim Low was perhaps best known sartorially for his array of skinny scarves .
But once the competition began the German coach and his assistant were dazzling in blue knitwear .
" I 'm not driven by superstition but the coaching staff want me to wear the blue sweater because we always score four goals when I do , " he told the Sun .
The sweater 's luck ran out in the semi final , when Germany were beaten by Spain .
4 North Korea score against Brazil
Not many people backed the Democratic Republic of Korea – team officials refused to acknowledge the name North Korea ‑ against the five - time winners .
But after Brazil went 2 - 0 up , Ji Yun -nam thrashed home a shot with the kind of velocity North Korea usually reserves for test - firing missiles .
The Dear Leader would have been less pleased with the team 's performance in their next match , which they lost 7 - 0 .
5 Lampard 's goal that never was
After England struggled through the qualifiers , the nation found itself in the next round facing the old enemy .
England deserved to lose to Germany , but Lampard 's shot crossed the line and would have made the score 2 - 2 at half - time , if the officials had spotted it .
The one positive was Sepp Blatter promising Fifa would reopen the discussion on goal - line technology .
6 Ghana 's run
The first World Cup to be held in Africa proved a poor one for African teams .
South Africa , Nigeria , Ivory Coast , Cameroon and Algeria failed to get through their groups .
Ghana 's Black Stars beat the USA in the last 16 , earning pan-African enthusiasm along the way .
It looked as if the world 's second team could become the first African nation to reach the semi-finals , until they met Uruguay …
7 Hand of God mark II
Luis Suarez executed a textbook , point - blank save in the last minute of extra time , preventing Ghana from scoring a winner .
The problem was Suarez is a striker .
He was red-carded , but his wild celebrations in the tunnel after Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting penalty , and claims afterwards that he had produced " the best save of the tournament " , left a bitter taste .
8 Maradona 's fifth World Cup
Many were prepared for the Argentina manager to embarrass himself or his country after an iffy qualifying campaign .
While some aspects of his coaching style remained unorthodox , for example ending each day 's session by forcing some players and coaches to offer up their backsides for the rest of the team to wallop balls at , the team were a revelation until conceding four goals to Germany .
Not that there 's anything wrong with that .
9 Robbie Earle 's fans
When 36 women clad in orange mini dresses were ejected from the Holland v Denmark match for being part of an ambush marketing effort by a Dutch beer company , the incident was n't a huge story .
Then it emerged that the women had apparently all used tickets allocated to ITV pundit Robbie Earle for the use of his friends and family .
Earle was sacked .
Two of the 36 were arrested , but charges later dropped .
10 Paul the psychic octopus
The Weymouth - born , German - bred octopus correctly guessed the winner in all of Germany 's matches .
His psychic abilities came at a price however : Argentinian fans threatened to put Paul in a paella .
" There are always people who want to eat our octopus , " his keeper , Oliver Walenciak , said .
" But he is not shy and we are here to protect him as well .
He will survive . "
He picked Spain to win last night .
The Biggest Loser is so bad for its contestants , the millions who watch the show , and the culture in general .
A former contestant can attest to this better than anyone .

Season 3 Biggest Loser finalist Kai Hibbard and I spoke on the phone about her experiences on The Biggest Loser .
From seeing her fellow contestants forced to workout with injuries against doctor 's orders , to the extreme dehydration prior to weigh - ins , to the resultant eating disorder that Kai still is working to heal , the story she told was nothing like the fantasy that the Biggest Loser seeks to promote .
Kai on The Biggest Loser 's diet and exercise program :
" Unfortunately , what they 're telling you the contestants are doing and what they actually have the contestants doing are two different things , at least as far as my season goes .
We were working out anywhere between 2 and 5 hours a day , and we were working out severely injured .
There 's absolutely no reason to work a 270 pound girl out so hard that she pukes the first time you bring in a gym .
That was entirely for good tv .
" There was a registered dietician that was supposed to be helping [ the contestants at the ranch ] as well ...
But every time she tried to give us advice . . . the crew or production would step in and tell us that we were not to listen to anybody except our trainers .
And my trainer 's a nice person , but I have no idea what she had for a nutritional background at all . "

On how the trainers and producers overrode the show 's doctors :
" The doctor had taken our blood and tested us and sent us a solution , I do n't know exactly what it was but it was salty , so I 'm assuming that our electrolytes were off .
And when the trainers found out we were taking it , they told us under no certain terms were we to be taking that , because it would make us retain water and gain weight on the scale and we'd have to go home .
The doctors had ordered us to take it and the trainers were like , ‘ throw it out , right now . '
There was this interference between the people who were actually probably trying to get us healthy from the people who wanted a good television show . "
On the show 's low - calorie diet and her subsequent eating disorder :
" I think when I was on the actual ranch we were eating between 1,000 and 1,200 calories a day , I 'm not certain .
The thing is , it got worse when I got home ...
I would get e-mails constantly from the producers : ‘ what have you done today ? ' ‘ are you working out enough ? '
It was just always , always , always .
At that point , [ I had ] all the pressure on me , and [ I was ] trying to do right by what I had been told is the best thing to ever happen to me .
And they would tell you all the time , ‘ 200,000 other fat girls were in line right behind you .
How dare you waste this experience ?
How dare you let anybody down ? '
" So I got to a point where I was only eating about 1,000 calories a day and I was working out between 5 and 8 hours a day .
. . .
And my hair started to fall out .
I was covered in bruises .
I had dark circles under my eyes .
Not to get too completely graphic , but my period stopped altogether and I was only sleeping 3 hours a night .
I tried to tell the T.V. show about it and I was told , ' save it for the camera . '
" At that point , my boyfriend at the time , who 's now my husband , and my best friend and my family stepped in and they said , ‘ Hey , crazy , you 're going to die if you keep this up . '
At that point was doing really fun things like not eating at all .
. . my major food groups were water , black coffee and splenda .
I got to the point that when I was nervous or upset I was literally vomiting my food up .
And at one point the scale stalled , I was stuck at 163 , and my trainer and the producers all ordered me to take a free day .
. . .
They said , ‘ oh , you 're body needs to be shaken up . '
And I was so afraid of food at that point I went in [ to the store ] , I bought a bag of snicker doodle cookies , and a quart of milk , and a box of ex lax and I ate them all together .
And I knew that I was in trouble .
And it was at this point that I was like , ‘ Hey , where are those doctors and that psychologist that are supposed to be following up and keeping an eye on me that I kept hearing about ? ' "

On how she started to recover :
" Thank God my family intervened .
They got me semi - back - on - track all the way to the finale .
My very first meal where I actually ate again , my husband sat with me and it was a bowl of oatmeal and an egg - white omelet with salsa , and it took me an hour and a half and I cried through the whole thing . "

On how the show affected her body image :
" It gave me a really fun eating disorder that I battle every day , and it also messed up my mental body image because the lighter I got during that T.V. show , the more I hated my body .
And I tell you what , at 144 and at 262 and at 280 , I had never hated my body before that show .
" I do still struggle [ with an eating disorder ] .
I do .
My husband says I 'm still afraid of food .
. . .
I 'm still pretty messed up from the show .
It does n't help that when I go in public . . . the first thing they usually ask me is ‘ what do you weigh now ? ' "

On why she 's speaking out :
" I feel that I have a responsibility to counteract some of the harm that that show does .
Because I took a piece of being that problem , I now own a piece of being the solution .
. . .
When I have people come to me crying , telling me how hard they work and how they log their food and how they 've done everything they could and [ they ask ]
‘ Why can't I lose 12 pounds in a week like you ? '
I feel a responsibility to get out there and go , ‘ You know what ?
Sue me if you want to , NBC , but I 'm telling these people , I did n't lose 12 pounds in a week .
It did n't happen .
It was n't a week .
And even when it looks like I lost 12 pounds in a week . . .
I was so severely dehydrated that I was completely unhealthy . "

On the mass of contracts and waivers that she signed to be on The Biggest Loser :
" I think at the time when you sign it . . . and it says things like , ‘ you give yourself over to whatever doctor we have treat you and we do n't attest to the credentials of the doctor ' , you think , ‘ no one is going to treat another human being this poorly , why should I even worry about that ? '
You do n't realize that there are people out there who would treat you that poorly .
You also get reminded . . . over and over again that . . . this is a chance of a lifetime and there are 200,000 other fat people behind you and if you do n't sign it they will .
. . .
I believe I signed away my life story and gave them the right to fictionalize it if they wanted to .
I had an attorney look at it afterward and he was like , ‘ you signed away things that really can't be signed away here , and the problem is they 've got , like , 100 attorneys and you can't even afford me . '
I 'm terrified sometimes at the idea that I 'm putting my family at risk to talk about it , but . . . my family 's taught me that you can't go wrong with the truth .
I 'm just going to do what I 've got to do . "

Despite some initial glitches , HTC's Evo phone has turned into a best - seller for Sprint .
The first 4G smartphone ever , which is running Google 's Android operating system , sold three times more on the day of its launch than Sprint 's earlier hits , the Samsung Instinct and Palm Pre did over their first three days combined .
The HTC Evo is so hot that it has led to " temporary shortages " at some of Sprint 's stores across the U.S. , says the wireless carrier .
" HTC EVO 4G has more than lived up to our expectations that it would be one of the most anticipated technology products of the year , " Kevin Packingham , senior vice president of product development for Sprint said in a statement .
" We are working closely with our partners at HTC to increase the supply and get EVO 4G into the hands of everyone who wants one as quickly as possible . "
However , Sprint has n't given out details on the number of Evos sold .
Sprint's HTC
Evo sales announcement mirrors what the carrier said about the Palm Pre almost to the date a year ago .
The Pre was then a hugely anticipated phone on Sprint 's network .
And as thisnews story we dug up shows , Sprint parroted the same information about the Pre at launch – right down to the shortages and the talk about replenishing inventory quickly .
HTC and Sprint unveiled the Evo in May .
The feature - packed gadget has a huge 4.3 - inch touchscreen , 1 - GHz Snapdragon processor , a front - facing 1.3 - megapixel camera for video conferencing and a 8 - megapixel camera for shooting photos and videos .
It costs $ 200 with a two - year contract .
But last week , before the device 's public debut , some early Evo users complained of a bug in the device .
A problem with the device 's 8 - GB MicroSD card did n't allow them to save files or photos .
HTC fixed the issue on Friday morning through an over - the - air firmware patch .
The patch also took care of a security - related glitch in the phone .
Now the question is : Can the Evo sustain momentum , especially with the introduction of Apple 's new iPhone today , or will sales of the phone mirror the Palm Pre 's and quickly fizzle out ?

Barataria Bay , Louisiana .
Captain Dave Marino took me out today to have a look at the oil spill zone in the Mississippi River Delta .
We passed a lot of boats full of men wearing life jackets .
Everyone wearing a life jacket is working for BP , said Dave .
Because no one around here ever wears one normally .
We saw lots of fishing boats — everything from shrimp trawlers on down in size — all deployed in the “ lakes , ” as they call the open bays of water here .
They were working the spill .
But they were n’t working .
Just waiting , many tied companionably alongside each other .
The men were seriously unhappy they can’t fish right now .
It ’s the best year for brown shrimp ever , they said .
They wondered when they ’d get to fish again .
Some guessed it could be 20 or 30 years .
If that ’s true , they all know that means they wo n’t ever fish again .
Not here .
The oil has invaded the waters and the marshy islands .
It ’s killing the grasses and sedges one row at a time .
You can see the difference between dead ( gray ) , dying ( brown ) , and living ( green ) marsh in this photo .
As the dying vegetation becomes the dead it gets ripped away by the waves and the islands start to crumble and disappear .
The marshy islands are home to nesting birds and mammals like muskrats .
They ’re also spawning and nursery grounds for fish and shrimp .
The satellite image courtesy of NASA shows the way the spill came into the region of the Mississippi River Delta on May 24th .
Captain
Dave surveyed the dying marshes , the disappearing islands , and asked over and over how they ’re going to save any of this .
He said he did n’t know if he ’d fish right now even if they lifted the ban .
It just would n’t feel right .
The fish need to recover .
I ca n’t believe I ’m saying that , he said .
I ’m a fisherman .
You get the feeling that all the fishermen here are starting to think of themselves as fishermen in the past tense .
The title of the blog post , “ No More Fish , No Fishermen , ” is taken from a song of the same name , written by Canadian Shelley Posen about the death of the cod fishery in Newfoundland .

La pieza , que mide 4.16 por 3.62 , tiene apenas 38 centímetros de espesor , pesa 12 toneladas y la piedra con que se hizo fue traída de un yacimiento a la isla de Tenochtitlan
[ email protected ]
La diosa de la tierra luce sus colores , su cabello rojo y rizado que representa el inframundo , sus colores sin par , su anatomía humana y sus garras , en la exposición " Moctezuma II .
Tiempo y destino de un gobernante " , que desde este jueves a las nueve horas se podrá visitar en el Museo del Templo Mayor , en el Centro Histórico .
La muestra , con más de 200 piezas , es la primera que se presenta en torno a un gobernante prehispánico .
Podrá ser visitada por el público hasta enero de 2011 .
La Tlaltecuhtli se encontró en octubre de 2006 , aproximadamente a cuatro y medio metros de profundidad desde el nivel de la calle , en el predio de la Casa de las Ajaracas , del Centro Histórico de la Ciudad de México .
Su hallazgo ha revelado 16 ofrendas , algunas de las cuales se presentan en esta exposición .
" En ningún lugar de Mesoamérica , eso me atrevería a decir , hay ofrendas tan ricas como aquí " , dijo ayer el arqueólogo Leonardo López Luján , coordinador del proyecto Templo Mayor :
" Es una deidad femenina , la señora de la tierra ; en vez de manos y pies tiene grandes garras , posiblemente de un ave rapaz .
Su cuerpo tiene anatomía humana , su cabello rizado es el cabello del inframundo , de la muerte , del terror ; tiene como distintivo dos grandes círculos en sus mejillas .
Su boca se abre para proyectar la lengua , que da un sorbo a un flujo de sangre " .
La diosa de la tierra ocupa el vestíbulo del Museo y en torno de ella se encuentran piezas prehispánicas y de la colonia representativas de la época de ese imperio que llegó a ser uno de los más importantes del mundo .
La pieza , que mide 4.16 por 3.62 , tiene apenas 38 centímetros de espesor , pesa 12 toneladas y la piedra con que se hizo fue traída de un yacimiento a la isla de Tenochtitlan , explicó López Luján .
La gran pregunta para los investigadores es qué había en el centro de la escultura , en su abdomen , porque esta parte no se encontró .
" Era un personaje esculpido ; aun se pueden ver las sandalias del individuo que estaba ahí .
Lo que vemos son sandalias de obsidiana que las usaban sólo los soberanos , como Moctezuma , y personajes como el dios Sol o la diosa Luna " .
De mayor tamaño que el Calendario Azteca y Coyolxauhqui , el monolito es singular también porque conserva sus colores : rojo claro , rojo oscuro , amarillo , blanco , negro y azul maya .
Acerca de su origen , López Luján detalló : " La escultura - se ve en los códices - representa una divinidad que es devoradora .
Al principio del tiempo , en el Alfa del tiempo , Tlaltecuhtli es la madre de todas las criaturas , de las plantas , los animales , los seres humanos , del Sol y de la Luna , pero al final del ciclo , en el Omega , cuando llega el momento de la muerte , ella misma devora a sus hijos , abre sus fauces cuando se le representa como reptil y enguye a sus hijos .
Por eso todas las deidades que son advocaciones de la madre tierra , como Tlatecuhtli , Coyolxauhqui o Tonantzin , se les representa como mujeres , pero también con aspectos monstruosos , de animales ; son muy veneradas , pero también muy temidas .
No es como el Cristianismo , que tenemos el bien y el mal absoluto , sino que esos dos principios en las religiones mesoamericanas se funden en una sola divinidad " .
Hasta enero de 2011
" Moctezuma II .
Tiempo y destino de un gobernante " abre con la pieza Teocalli de la Guerra Sagrada , obra que viene del Museo Nacional de Antropología y que es una de las pocas que muestra una imagen del tlatoani .
Es una obra que , explicó ayer en el recorrido para la prensa el arqueólogo Eduardo Matos Moctezuma - curador de la exposición - , se hizo posiblemente en 1507 con motivo de la festividad del fuego nuevo .
Otra característica que la hace singular , es que en ella se aprecia el símbolo de la fundación de Tenochtitlan : el águila parada sobre el nopal .
Entre las piezas que se podrán apreciar figura además la Piedra dedicatoria del Templo Mayor , tallada en diorita verde por sus cinco caras ; el Corazón de piedra verde , pieza asociada con la fundación de la ciudad mexica ; el Disco de oro ( tezcacuitlapilli ) , el emblemático Retrato de Moctezuma II , proveniente de la Colección Maillé , y el Códice Moctezuma , proveniente del Museo Regional Cuauhnáhuac , en Morelos , donde se narra la muerte del tlatoani a manos de los españoles .
" Bernal Díaz decía que lo asomaron por el Palacio y que fue apedreado por el pueblo mexicano ; en tanto que los indígenas decían que fueron los españoles los que mataron al tlatoani " .
También figura en la muestra una pila bautismal en la que , como explicó Matos Moctezuma , los españoles aprovecharon la representación de una serpiente emplumada e hicieron el agujero para transformarlo en una pila bautismal .
" Una muestra muy clara de que cómo empiezan a tratar de imponerse las ideas del catolicismo sobre aquellas que había reodiominado en Mesoamérica " .
Nuevos hallazgos
Leonardo López Luján explicó que las excavaciones en la zona del Templo Mayor continúan en varios puntos , entre estos en el predio de las Ajaracas .
Los investigadores creen que la Tlaltecuhtli sería una lápida mortuoria del tlatoani Ahuizotl que estuvo antes de Moctezuma II .
" Estamos viviendo una época revolucionaria a nivel científico - dijo López Luján - .
El gran obstáculo que tenemos los que estudiamos Tenochtitlan es la ciudad de México , el mismo obstáculo de quienes estudian Roma , Jerusalem , Estambul , la excavación es muy complicada .
Este es un momento excepcional , hay muchos arqueólogos estudiando , tenemos realmente apoyo y surgen todos estos descubrimientos que poco a poco van complementando un rompecabezas que sabemos que nunca vamos a complementar , el de la ciudad de Tenochtitlan " .
" Moctezuma II .
Tiempo y destino de un gobernante " se exhibe en el Museo del Templo Mayor , en la calle Seminario 8 , Centro Histórico .
El recinto abre de martes a domingo , de 9 a 17 horas .
El costo de la entrada es de $ 51 .

MATCHMAKING
Placement
Before being seated in a league , players must play a number of placement matches .
Battle .net uses these placement matches to estimate your skill level and give you a starter point .
The number of placement matches is set to 5 .
This means that although the system will seat you in a league more quickly , it may do so less accurately .
Being placed in a league does n't cement you within that league , and if you are able to prove that you can hang with players more skilled than Battle .
net initially estimated , the system will promote you to a higher league .
Conversely , the system will relegate you to a lower - level league if the opponents you are initially grouped with prove to be too difficult .
It is not possible to be placed into the highest league , only promoted into the highest league .
Matchmaking Ratings
The prevailing theory behind the matchmaking system is that each player is assigned a hidden " matchmaking rating " , or MMR .
MMR determines who your opponents are , as well as whether you are promoted or demoted .
When you win or lose a game , your actual rating is compared with the MMR of your opponent and points are awarded or deducted as necessary .
MMR is only affected by the end result of a match , not the means used to achieve those results .
In - game details such as APM , unit composition , and tech path of either player are irrelevant .
An important reference point for understanding this theory is the WoW Arena Matchmaking System ( http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910422788&sid=1).
Examples
As Battle .net most closely resembles the WoW Arena system , we 'll use those values as a baseline .
Remember that you cannot see your matchmaking rating in SC2 , but you can in WoW Arena .
This becomes easier to estimate when using WoW Arena as a reference because your MMR is what your team 's rating is expected to become if you continue playing at your current level , and there are no hard separations between players .
It 's generally accepted that the hierarchy of WoW Arena participants looks like this :
0-1499 : Newb
1500 - 1799 : Average
1800 - 1999 : Fairly skilled
2000 - 2199 : Very skilled
2200 -3000 : Extremely skilled
If we expand that to SC2 , we would get Bronze , Silver , Gold , Platinum , and Diamond , respectively .
In WoW Arena , your MMR - which is persistent across arena seasons - starts at an average level while your team rating starts at 0 .
If you go 10 - 0 for your first 10 games , your MMR would probably skyrocket to 2200 .
The reason for this is that the system is unable to accurately determine your skill level , so your MMR rises more rapidly ( called " volatility " ) in the hopes that it finds an upper bound .
Even though your team rating will only be about 460 after going 10 - 0 , you at that point would be playing against the most skilled players because your MMR is so high .
The longer your win streak , the more your MMR increases until you are playing people that cause you to win 50 % of the time .
Once you start losing more games than you 're winning at a certain level , your MMR starts falling until it can comfortably seat you .
As you get closer to a 50 % win rate , your volatility drops and therefore your MMR does n't rise and fall as dramatically as it did at first .
The system acknowledges that just because your MMR is a certain level , you may not always perform at that level .
There is some allowance involved .
Search Functionality
The Battle .net matchmaking system will find opponents that are close to your skill level .
The degree of accuracy had yet to be determined by Rob Pardo according to this interview ( http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/99211-Battle-net-StarCraft-II-Matchmaking-Too-Good).
You will notice after a short time that the message " EXPANDING SEARCH ... " will appear when searching for a game .
This means the system is searching for opponents that may be higher or lower than your intended level .
What is not clear is whether the system eventually and continually expands the search until any opponent is found , or whether it merely widens the allowable MMR variance .
LEAGUES
League Overview
Leagues are divided evenly , comprising 20 % of active players across the board .
The inactivity period has not been announced by Blizzard .
Note that it is not possible to be placed directly into Diamond league , and that players can only be promoted into Diamond league .
Promotion and Demotion
In order to be promoted to a higher league , your MMR must sit comfortably within the boundaries of that league , meaning you 'll need to be averaging a 50 % win rate against those kinds of players .
If you are a 2250 MMR Platinum player who typically faces Diamond players , you will need to not only average a 50 % win rate against those Diamond players , but also maintain a much higher win rate against any Platinum players you may encounter .
Once your MMR reaches a certain threshold you may be eligible for promotion .
The system takes a moving average of your past X games and uses that to determine your eligibility for promotion .
If the moving average crosses a certain league threshold , you can be promoted to that league .
Dropping down to a lower league works the same way , only by losing .
You do not need to reach # 1 ( or any particular rank ) in your division to get promoted .
Divisions
Leagues comprise a number of divisions that are not ranked equally .
Divisions cap out at 100 players .
Divisions are loosely grouped by skill at the time of placement .
Note that you cannot move laterally within your league , so in order to move to a new division you must get promoted or demoted out of your league .

Read this post :
RATING
The important thing to know is that rating only determines your standing within your own division .
And even then , only indirectly , because you are playing against opponents beyond your division 's player pool .
Team Ratings
Your team wins or loses as a whole .
If your partners left the game early and you stuck around to defeat your opponents , your entire team will be credited with a win .
" Rating Inflation " and the Bonus Pool
The Bonus Pool is a pool of points that are awarded whenever players are placed into a new League .
The Bonus Pool also accrues over time .
Whenever a game is won , an amount equal to the rating earned is deducted from the Bonus Pool and added to the player 's rating .
This has the effect of increasing player ratings over time .
On the surface , this appears to be a negative thing .
However , War3's Ladder system had XP decay beyond a certain level .
Rather than forcing players to play games in the fashion War3 used , SC2 encourages players to play by generating a Bonus Pool .
The Bonus Pool accrues at a rate of 1 point per 2 hours , whether the player or team is active or not .
The Bonus Pool also begins building based on when the ladder season began .
That is , if Player A was placed into a division and started with a Bonus Pool of 100 , then 24 hours later Player B placed into a new division , Player B's Bonus Pool would be 112 .

Some more information from ZapRoffo :
With a matchmaking rating system , the way points are assigned is as follows .
There is a default point assignment ( was +/- 12 for wow , seems similar in sc2 ) for an " equal match result " .
The amount won or lost in any given match , though , is determined by comparing your displayed rating to your opponent 's matchmaking rating .
This is why many people are experiencing huge gains for wins and small losses .
It 's because they have n't played enough to raise their displayed rating to their matchmaking rating .
They may be matched as an 1800 matchmaking rating , but are at 1300 , so if they win against an equal opponent ( 1800 matchmaking ) , they get the points of a 1300 beating an 1800 , which may be +20 or something .
The opponent compares his displayed rating to your matchmaking rating to calculate his point change , if he 's displayed 1600 and you are also 1800 matchmaking , he will lose - 10 or so ( slightly less than - 12 default ) .
One huge misconception people I feel like people need to learn the truth about :
The bonus pool WILL NOT cause inflation of ratings in the long run as long as it only modifies your displayed rating and not your matchmaking rating , which appears to be the case .
In the long run , displayed ratings converge to matchmaking rating , so if matchmaking rating is unaffected there is no long term effect .
An example :
I start with a big bonus pool and win up to 1600 , and my matchmaking rating is 1700 .
Alice wins the same amount against similar quality opponents but with no bonus pool and goes to only 1350 or so , but also with 1700 matchmaking rating , because matchmaking is totally unaffected .
Now in my games I will only be looking at winning +13 or so from my opponents who are 1700 matchmaking , while Alice is looking at something like +16 or +17 from her 1700 matchmaking opponents .
I 'm looking at - 10 or - 11 from losses , while she 's looking at - 8 or so from those same people .
Eventually the result over a long enough period is we both end up at 1700 if no change in skill happens .
Even if I got enough of a bonus pool to get to 1900 or something , once that runs out I 'm going to lose more for losses than I get for wins against people who are my skill level until I get to the appropriate level .
The bonus pool just functions to get people 's displayed rating jump started so if they took a break they can jump to their rating more quickly .

" Tough " Divisions
Because divisions are generated as necessary , invariably the most skilled and most dedicated players will rise to the top and be placed in the low - numbered divisions .
Directly speaking , this does n't inherently mean players added to this division will encounter tougher games , just that they are less likely to reach the tournament qualifier cutoff of Top 8 because their rating is unlikely to be as high as the top players , who are expected to carry higher point totals due to their expected higher win rate .
TOURNAMENTS
The Top 8 players within each division automatically qualify for a tournament run on Battle .

The frequency of these tournaments is unknown .

How do we know when the economy is back on solid ground ?
I was interviewing economist Bruce Bartlett today about state and local finances and threw in a question about when we'd know the economy did n't need more stimulus .
Bartlett , who previously worked for Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush and Jack Kemp , gave a usefully clear answer : " When we start to see interest rates rise , " he said , " we can start to think about stopping .
But not before .
The rise in interest rates to me will be the grass starting to grow after the winter . "
And just so you have it , here 's a graph of monthly interest rates on 10 - year treasuries :
That said , the fact that the economy desperately needs more stimulus spending does not mean that it 's going to get substantially more in stimulus spending .
So maybe none of this matters : Congress has decided to stop bailing out the boat even though we 're still taking on water .

Another video that premiered today is B.o.B. ’s hit single Airplanes that features Paramore ’s front - woman Hayley Williams .
Airplanes is the second single to be lifted his debut album The Adventures of Bobby Ray , which hit # 1 on the Billboard charts in May .
It looks like the video had quite a small production budget , but it definitely does n’t look tacky in the slightest .
It does n’t feature Eminem , but there is definitely room for a future cameo to transform it into Airplanes Part II .
I make some changes to this recipe to make it healthier .
I would never make it as is .
The fat content is through the roof , and it 's delicious and fairly rich even with the changes .
1 . Replace the whipping cream with milk ( I 've made it with whole and skim and can barely tell the difference ) 2 .
Cut the cheese in half and add some cubed chicken breast instead to fill the tortillas .
3 . Use whole wheat tortillas ( I guarantee no one will notice the difference ) 4 .
Use olive oil or vegetable oil instead of butter in the sauce 5 .
Omit the sour cream .
I really do n't notice its absence .
The dish is plenty rich without it .
6 . Double the spinach for more sauciness and more healthiness .
Everyone LOVES these even with no cream , no butter , no sour cream and less cheese .
I also have some notes on the prep : 1 . It always takes a lot longer than 5 minutes for my milk mixture to thicken , and to get it to thicken at all I need to turn the stove up to medium high ( this was true even when I used butter instead of oil ) 2 . A stick blender works great and is so much easier than putting the sauce in the blender in batches .
3 . I use raw spinach instead of cooked , and find it cooks down in the pan with the sauce very nicely .
Just stir it in .
This recipe takes some time so I always make a double batch and freeze one in portions .
Everyone from my 2 year old to my husband to my in - laws rave and I make it every other week or so .
On Monday morning , a strike at a Honda auto parts factory in southeastern China fizzled out , as Honda ’s employing of a large number of substitute workers on Sunday drove majority of the strikers back to work .
Over 100 strikers held a protect outside the factory premises on Monday morning , noticing silently and glumly as replacement employees and ex-strikers waded through the factory gates .
A factory manager started the countdown for the morning shift and encouraged the strikers to return to work , saying , “ We wo n’t give your job to the new workers if you come in now ” .
In the last five minutes before the gates were shut down , around half a dozen strikers went back into the factory , with disappointed looks on their faces .
Some strikers had remained at home from the protest , and might have lost out on their jobs .
Though the factory increased salaries and benefits , the raise was well short of what the strikers had claimed .
A number of members of the factory ’s committee of workers , selected by the employees to stand for them when the strike started on Wednesday , have gone underground , dreading vengeance , whilst others have gone back to work in an endeavor to carry on looking for an improved arrangement .
There is only one man in the history of football who has achieved what Diego Maradona craves from the weeks ahead in South Africa .
Franz Beckenbauer is the sole World Cup - winning captain who went on to lead his country to the game 's summit as a coach .
The urbane German wrote a unique blueprint .
Maradona strikes an unlikely figure to follow in his footsteps .
In terms of temperament , philosophy and public perception , the Argentinian maverick comes from another planet .
One is pragmatic and refined ; the other strikingly volatile and unpredictable .
One never puts a foot , or a word , wrong .
The other made headlines during this World Cup 's preparations for having a fight with his own dog and ending up in hospital , pledging to run naked around El Obelisco in the centre of Buenos Aires if Argentina return triumphant , and running over a reporter en route to a press conference to name his final squad – promptly leaning out of the window to shout at the injured man : " What an arsehole you are ! "
Those who knew him in more innocent days still wonder about Maradona 's cranked - up personality .
As a youngster he was regarded as humble , accommodating , keen to listen to people and an all - round wonderful kid .
It was as if a switch flicked when he entered the hothouse of Serie A , became the adored prince of Napoli , and developed an intense relationship with drugs .
Maradona will turn 50 in October , and the second half of his life to date , with its series of barely believable dramas , has been played out by a character for whom the words humble and accommodating seem alien .
Rewinding to the autumn of 2008 , it remains an extraordinary decision for the Argentinian Football Association to have appointed him in the first place .
His track record in management amounted to a spell in charge of Mandiyú de Corrientes , and a brief encounter with Racing Club , neither of which was successful .
When the national team job came up , Maradona put his name forward .
The football cognoscenti had their doubts .
The will of the people of Argentina , who revere Maradona , turned out to be irresistible .
He is , unquestionably , the most idiosyncratic of all 32 coaches who will be guiding their squads through this World Cup .
The fusion of talent and heritage means Argentina are always worthy of attention .
But the inclusion of Maradona as technical as well as spiritual leader demands absolute scrutiny .
Do not turn away for a moment .
You have no idea what fireworks you might miss .
The Maradona factor is the principal reason why Argentina lag slightly behind the super - favourites for this competition .
A glance around Europe 's major leagues ( Lionel Messi ruled La Liga once again , Diego Milito is man of the moment in Serie A , Lucho González made the difference in France … it is not difficult to go on and on ) gives ample evidence that their pool of talent is as promising as any around .
" Player for player there is no better national team than ours , " reckons the peerless Messi .
The big problem , comparing Argentina with the most fancied of the contenders , is that Spain and Brazil arrive with able squads backed by solid and methodical men in the dugout .
( Brazil 's Carlos Dunga , incidentally , also has one eye on emulating Beckenbauer 's achievement , having lifted the golden trophy in 1994 . )
Never before has a World Cup been won with a weak link in the dugout .
In a coaching Venn diagram linking Maradona with Marcello Lippi , who masterminded Italy 's success at the last finals with exceptional shrewdness and unswerving focus , perhaps the only area of crossover is the fact neither man has much tolerance for the media .
Maradona 's stewardship are too numerous , the sense of trust too disjointed .
So accustomed have Argentina 's fans become to Maradona 's impulsive choices and puzzling formations , with 108 players juggled so far in little more than 18 months , it was no great surprise when his final squad contained some unusual names .
That does not make his decision to omit two of the stellar performers from Inter 's treble - winning side – Javier Zanetti and Esteban Cambiasso , who have almost 200 caps between them – any easier to comprehend , though .
Of the lesser lights who made the plane instead , Ariel Garcé has become symbolic of Maradona 's unconventional approach .
The story sounds apocryphal , but it has been reported that the defender who helped Colón finish 14th in the Argentinian league was included because Maradona had a dream that his team won the World Cup and the only face he could remember being there was Garcé's .
The 30 - year - old has only four caps .
Three came during friendlies in 2003 , and one came this year against Haiti .
Most supporters do not take his inclusion particularly seriously .
At Argentina 's farewell match at home to Canada a banner was unfurled : " Garcé , bring us some alfajores . "
Traditionally , Argentinians bring alfajores , caramel - filled biscuits , back from their holidays to give to friends .
Garcé had in fact bought tickets to catch some World Cup games as he intended to take a holiday in South Africa anyway .
" I do n't care what they say , " he said .
" I 'm going to the World Cup and nobody can take this happiness away from me . "
Some people speculate that Maradona 's emotional decisions are a little more calculating than merely the work of an eccentric man .
He does not want strong , dissenting voices around him , which perhaps explains why some of the more experienced men have been left behind ( and others , such as Juan Román Riquelme and his own mentor , Carlos Bilardo , have been alienated ) .
Then there is the curious case of Messi , who seldom looks at his happiest and most liberated in the albiceleste shirt of his country .
Does Maradona know how to use him , how the team should best function around him ?
Or does it suit Maradona that Messi has not been as successful for Argentina as he has for Barcelona because deep down his ego struggles with the idea that his position as the crème de la crème has a credible challenger ?
" The truth is that Maradona has always been very nice to me , " said Messi recently .
" At first , it was strange to have him : he was a little imposing .
But afterwards , we started getting used to him and he 's been our coach for a while , so now it 's normal .
He 's really close to the players .
He 's one of the guys , so there 's no problem . "
We will soon find out whether that is enough to guide a group with such bountiful natural ability to the promised land .
Floods have triggered landslides and mud flows in east China 's Fujian Province , leaving 76 dead and 79 missing as of 4 p.m.
Monday , said local flood control officials Tuesday .
The floods , the worst in one hundred years in some regions of Fujian , have affected 2.65 million people and destroyed 44,200 houses .
A total of 527,300 people have been evacuated in Fujian alone , said a spokesperson with the provincial Flood Control and Drought Relief Office .
Direct economic losses have reached 9.6 billion yuan ( 1.4 billion U.S. dollars ) , said the spokesperson .
As of 8 a.m. Monday , floods in 10 regions of south China had left 175 dead and 107 missing , according to the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters

Image caption The Tornado sign was captured during a flight
A prank by an RAF Tornado crew spotted flying with a sign saying " I 'm with stupid " has been laughed off by the Ministry of Defence .
The crew , from RAF Lossiemouth , was photographed during a high - speed exercise through hills in Snowdonia .
Plane - spotters captured the navigator holding up a piece of paper with the joke pointing to the pilot .
An RAF spokesman said it was a " light - hearted moment " and insisted the crew had not endangered the aircraft .
A billboard , erected in Mason City , Iowa and funded by the North Iowa Tea Party , which depicts Barack Obama between Hitler and Lenin , has " crossed the line " , according to other Tea Party activists in the state .
The billboard shows Hitler with the slogan " National Socialism " and Lenin with the legend " Marxist Socialism " , and Obama in between the two under the phrase " Democratic Socialism " .
Each photograph carries the word " Change " .
John
White , co-ordinator of the Iowa Tea Party movement , said that his organisation had previously asked members to stop using similar posters .
" At our last rally we saw some people with these kinds of signs and asked people to put them down , " he said , going on to call the erection of the billboard " a borderline hate crime " .
So far , the North Iowa Tea Party has declined to comment on the erection of the billboard or its contents .
NASA just released an interesting picture of our home planet , taken from the GOES satellite :
[ Click to massively englobenate . ]
This image is in the infrared , and maps out the heat emitted from Earth .
Brighter spots are giving off more IR -- like the desert region in southwest South America , and the westernmost tip of Africa peaking over on the right -- and darker spots show areas where less IR is emitted .
You might think that these dark spots are cooler , but you have to be careful here .
The dark areas are actually cool high clouds .
But they also trap the heat of the Earth -- they do n't heat up themselves , but prevent the heat below them from escaping .
High clouds like this are in reality warming us up slightly , even though they themselves are cold !
Interestingly , the low clouds in the image are white , as is open ocean .
That means that the Earth is good at radiating away heat from its surface whether or not low clouds are present .
Low clouds let the heat right through !
So the type of cloud present affects the way the Earth 's temperature is maintained .
One lesson to be learned here -- and it's a good one -- is that figuring out how the planet heats up and cools off is very complicated .
A corollary of this is that when someone ( a politician , say , or a demagogue ) starts railing about scientists who are struggling with this information , they are almost certainly oversimplifying the case .
Yeah , this stuff is hard .
But that 's precisely why I tend to side with the majority of scientists who devote their lives to looking at this data , and not some talking head on TV whose only job is to confuse the issue even further .
[ Note : I 'll have another post on this very topic coming very soon .
Stay Tuned .]

Rekordmange sliter med gjelden
Mange har problemer med å håndtere gjelden .

Fram til april hadde namsmennene mottatt 30 prosent flere søknader om gjeldsordning sammenlignet med i fjor .
Totalt mottok namsmennene 1.894 søknader om gjeldsordning fram til utgangen av april .
I samme periode i 2009 var tallet 1.456 .
Totalt kom det inn 4.779 søknader i fjor , og tallet vil trolig være langt høyere i 2010 .
– Det er ikke tvil om at finanskrisen har rammet mange mennesker , og hverdagen er vanskelig .
Vi vil i år få det høyeste antall søknader om gjeldsordning som vi har hatt siden ordningen ble innført i 1993 , sier Jonny Nauste , leder av Norges Politilederlag .
Han sier det ogs å er et dårlig tegn at flere ikke klarer å betjene husleien sin .
Mange familier , barn og voksne , blir rammet av den økonomiske situasjonen , sier Nauste .
Antallet utkastelser , såkalte fravikelser , har så langt i år økt med 23,6 prosent .
Namsmennene har mottatt 3.684 begjæringer om fravikelse .
Namsmennene har hittil i år mottatt over 78.000 utleggsbegjæringer , en økning på 7,2 prosent .

Last Tuesday , Eric Mertens gave the Galois tech talk Introducing Well - Founded Recursion .
I have to admit , most of this went over my head the first time I heard it .
Here are some notes that I ended up writing for myself as I stepped through the code again .
I suggest reading the slides first to get a feel for the presentation .
These notes are oriented towards a Haskell programmer who feels comfortable with the type system , but not Curry - Howard comfortable with the type system .
> module Quicksort where > > open import Data .
Nat public using ( ℕ ; suc ; zero ) > open import Data .
List public using ( List ; _∷_ ; [ ] ; _++_ ; [ _ ] ; length ; partition ) > open import Data .
Bool public using ( Bool ; true ; false ) > open import Data .
Product public using ( _×_ ; _ , _ ; proj₁ ; proj₂ )
Agda is a proof assistant based on intuitionistic type theory ; that is , the Curry - Howard isomorphism .
The Curry - Howard isomorphism states that things that look like types and data can also be treated as propositions and proofs , and one of the keys to understanding well - founded recursion in Agda is to freely interchange between the two , because we will use the type system as a way of making propositions about our code , which Agda will use when checking it .
We ’ll try to present both perspectives of the types and propositions .
Types : Data :: Propositions : Proofs
Agda needs to be convinced that your proof works : in particular , Agda wants to know if you 've covered all the cases ( exhaustive pattern matching , totality ) and if you are n't going to procrastinate on the answer ( termination ) .
Agda is very clever when it comes to case checking : if it knows that a case could n't be fulfilled in practice , because its type represents a falsehood , it will not ask you to fill it out .
However , the termination checker frequently needs help , which is where well - founded recursion comes in .
Warmups .
Our first data type today is top : the type inhabited by precisely one value , unit .
This is ( ) in Haskell .
Data inhabits a type the way a proof exists for a proposition ; you can think of a type as a “ house ” in which there reside any number of inhabitants , the data types .
Frequently infinitely many .
You ’ll see Set pop a lot : rigorously , it 's the type of “ small ” types , with Set₁ being larger , Set₂ larger still , and so forth ...
> data ⊤ :
Set where unit : ⊤
Bottom is the type inhabited by nothing at all .
If no proof exists for the proposition , it is false !
In the same way , the top proposition is vacuously true , since we said so !
At the value level , this is undefined or error “ foobar ” in Haskell ; at the type level , it 's be called Void , though no one actually uses that in real code .
In Agda , these are one and the same .
> data ⊥ :
Set where
We pulled in natural numbers from Data .
Nat , but here 's what a minimal definition would look like :
data ℕ : Set where zero : ℕ suc : ℕ → ℕ
It is worth dwelling that Agda numeric constants such as 0 or 2 are syntax sugar for zero and suc ( suc zero ) .
They also may show up in types , since Agda is dependently typed .
( In Haskell , you ’d have to push the definition of natural numbers into the type system ; here we can write a normal data definition and then lift them up automatically .
Power to the working class ! )
This function does something very strange :
> Rel : Set → Set₁ > Rel A = A → A → Set
In fact , it is equivalent to this expanded version :
Rel A = ( _ : A ) → ( _ : A ) → ( _ : Set )
So the resulting type is not A → A → Set , but rather , it is something whose type is A , something else whose type is A , and as a result something whose type is Set .
In Haskell terms , this is not a type function of kind * → * ; this is more like an illegal * -> ( a -> a -> *) .
Here is an example of a simple relation : less - than for natural numbers .
> data _< _ ( m : ℕ ) : ℕ →
Set where >
<- base : m < suc m > <- step : {n : ℕ} → m < n → m < suc n
Not so simple Agda syntax :
The ( m : ℕ ) indicates that _<_ is parametrized by m , making m , a value of type ℕ , available throughout our data constructors .
Parametrization means it is also required to be the first argument of _< _ ; at this point , you should check all of the type signatures of the constructors and see that they really are of form m<_
The {n :
ℕ} indicates an “ implicit ” parameter , which means when we go to invoke <- step , we do n't need to pass it ; Agda will automatically figure it out from a later argument , in this case , m < n .
Remember that “ for all x : A , y : B ” , is the same as providing a total function f(x : A ) : B .
So there 's a convenient shorthand ∀ x → which is equivalent to ( x : _ ) → ( the underscore means any type is ok . )
With the syntax out of the way , the mathematical intent of this expression should be clear : for any number , we automatically get a proof m < m+1 ; and with m<n → m < n+1 , we can inductively get the rest of the proofs .
If you squint , you can also see what is meant in terms of data : <- base is a nullary constructor , whereas <- step is a recursive constructor .
Let 's prove that 3 < 5 .
We start off with <- base : 3 < 4 ( how did we know we should start there and not with 4 < 5 ?
Notice that m , our parameter , is 3 : this is a hint that all of our types will be parametrized by 3 . )
Apply step once : 3 < suc 4 = 3 < 5 , QED .
> example₁ : 3 < 5 > example ₁ = <- step <- base
Recall that true propositions are inhabited by data types , whereas false propositions are not .
How can we invert them ?
In logic , we could say , “ Suppose that the proposition was the case ; derive a contradiction . ”
In types , we use the empty function : the function that has no domain , and thus while existing happily , ca n’t take any inputs .
A function has no domain only if it ’s input type is not inhabited , so the only way we can avoid having to give a contradiction is to ... not let them ask the question in the first place !
> _≮_ : Rel ℕ > a ≮ b = a < b → ⊥
( ) denotes falsity , in this case ( ) : 5 < 0 , which clearly can never be true , since <- base does n’t pattern match against it ( suc m != 0 ) .
A point worth mentioning is that Agda requires your programs to be complete , but does n't ask you to pattern match against absurdities .
> example₂ : 5 ≮ 2 > example ₂ ( < - step ( < - step ( ) ) )
Well - foundedness .
We introduce a little Agda notation ; modules let us parametrize over some variable over an extended block then just the constructors of a ‘ data ’ declaration .
Members of a module can be accessed ala WF .
Well - founded A ( rest of the arguments ) .
This is quite convenient and idiomatic , though not strictly necessary ; we could have just parametrized all of the members accordingly .
We also happen to be parametrizing over a type .
> module WF { A : Set} ( _<_ : Rel A ) where
Logically , what it means for an element to be accessible is that for all y such that y < x , y is accessible .
From a data and logic view , it states if you want me to give you Acc x , the data / proof you want , you 'll have to give me a proof that for all y , if you give me a proof that y < x , I can determine Acc y .
Now that we 're trying to prove properties about our types and functions , treating our data types as strictly data is making less and less sense .
> data Acc ( x : A ) :
Set where > acc : ( ∀ y → y < x → Acc y ) →
Acc x
The entire type A is well - founded if all elements in it are accessible .
Alternatively , the entire type A is well - founded if , given an element in it , I can produce an accessibility proof for that element .
Note that its type is Set ; this a type , the proposition I want to prove !
> Well - founded : Set >
Well - founded = ∀ x → Acc x
Proof for well - foundedness on naturals related by less - than .
> <- ℕ-wf : WF .
Well - founded _<_ > <- ℕ-wf x = WF.acc ( aux x ) > where > aux : ∀ x y → y < x → WF .
Acc _< _ y > -- : ( x : _ ) → ( ∀ y → y < x → WF .
Acc _< _ y ) > aux .( suc y ) y <- base = <- ℕ-wf y
Base case , ( e.g. x=5 , y=4 ) .
This , conveniently enough , triggers the well - founded structural recursion on ℕ by checking if y is well - founded now .
> aux .( suc x ) y ( < - step {x} y< x ) = aux x y y<x
The structural recursion here is on _< _ ; we are peeling back the layers of <- step until y<x = <- base , as might be the case for 3 < 4 ( but not 3 < 6 ) .
We 're essentially appealing to a weaker proof that is still sufficient to prove what we 're interested in .
Notice that we are also recursing on x ; actually , whatever we know about x , we knew from y<x ( less information content ! ) , so we indicate that with a dot .
Eventually , x will be small enough that y is not much smaller than x ( < - base ) .
Where do we deal with zero ?
Consider aux zero : ∀ y -> y < zero → WF .
Acc _<_ y .
This is the empty function , since y < zero = ⊥ ( no ℕ is less than zero ! )
In fact , this is how we get away with not writing cases for yx ( the upper triangle ) : it 's equivalent to y≮x which are all bottom , and give us empty functions for free .
In fact , there is a double - structural recursion going on here , one x , and one on y<x .
The structural recursion on x is on just aux , but once we conclude <- base , we do a different structural recursion on y with <- ℕ - wf .
This fills out the bottom right triangle on the xy - plane split by y=x - 1 ; the upper left triangle is not interesting , since it 's just a barren wasteland of bottom .
Standard mathematical trick : if you can reduce your problem into another that you 've already solved , you solved your problem !
> module Inverse- image - Well - founded { A B } > --
Should actually used ≺ , but I decided it looked to similar to < for comfort .
> ( _<_ : Rel B ) ( f : A → B ) where > _⊰_ : Rel A > x ⊰ y = f x < f y > > ii-acc : ∀ {x} → WF .
Acc _< _ ( f x ) → WF .
Acc _⊰_ x > ii-acc ( WF.acc g ) = WF.acc ( λ y fy < fx → ii-acc ( g ( f y ) fy < fx ) )
The types have to look right , so we unwrap our old proof g and wrap it into a new lambda , pushing the reduction via f into our proof ( i.e. WF.acc data constructor ) .
> ii-wf : WF .
Well - founded _<_ → WF .
Well - founded _⊰_ > ii - wf wf x = ii-acc ( wf ( f x ) ) > -- wf = λ x → ii-acc ( wf ( f x ) ) > -- I.e. of course the construction ii-acc will work for any x .
Here , we finally use our machinery to prove that lists , compared with their lengths , are well - founded .
> module <- on - length - Well - founded { A } where > open Inverse - image - Well - founded { List A } _ < _ length public > wf : WF .
Well - founded _⊰_ > wf = ii - wf <- ℕ-wf
A little bit of scaffolding code that does not actually “ change ” the proof , but changes the propositions .
We ’ll need this for the PartitionLemma .
> s<s : ∀ {a b} → a < b → suc a < suc b > s<s <- base = <- base > s<s ( < - step y ) = <- step ( s<s y )
Show that partitioning a list does n't increase its size .
> module PartitionLemma {
A } where > _≼_ : Rel ( List A ) > x ≼ y = length x < suc ( length y ) -- succ to let us reuse <
For all predicates and lists , each partition 's length is less than or equal to the original length of the list .
proj₁ and proj₂ are Haskell fst and snd .
> partition - size : ( p : A → Bool ) ( xs : List A ) > → proj₁ ( partition p xs ) ≼ xs > × proj₂ ( partition p xs ) ≼ xs
Though we 've expressed our proposition in terms of ≼ , we still use the original < constructor .
<- base actually means equality , in this context !
> partition - size p [ ] = <- base , <- base > partition - size p ( x ∷ xs ) > with p x | partition p xs | partition - size p xs > ... | true | as , bs | as - size , bs - size = s<s as - size , <- step bs - size > ... | false | as , bs | as - size , bs - size = <- step as - size , s<s bs -size
And finally , Quicksort .
> module Quick { A} ( p : A → A → Bool ) where
Open the presents ( proofs ) .
> open <- on-length - Well - founded > open PartitionLemma > quicksort ' : ( xs : List A ) → WF .
Acc _⊰_ xs → List A > quicksort ' [ ] _ = [ ] > quicksort ' ( x ∷ xs ) ( WF.acc g ) ::
From the partition lemma , we get small ≼ xs and big ≼ xs .
By making length well - founded , we are now able to “ glue ” together the layer of indirection : x ∷ xs originally was strictly smallers and structurally recursive , and the partition lemma lets us say to the termination checker that small , big and xs are essentially the same .
> with partition ( p x ) xs | partition - size ( p x ) xs > ... | small , big | small - size , big - size = small ' ++ [ x ] ++ big ' > where > small ' = quicksort ' small ( g small small - size ) > big ' = quicksort ' big ( g big big - size ) > quicksort : List A → List A > quicksort xs = quicksort ' xs ( wf xs )

Among the tidal wave of World Cup themed commercials , a disturbing trend emerges .
Several Dutch companies have come out with TV ads that prominently feature German bad guys .
Heineken ’s ad is perhaps the mildest , featuring a representative of the German football association proudly presenting earplugs to counter the noise of the Pletterpet , an orange cap .
It paints Germans as rather dull folk , not quite the traditional stereotype over here .
Supermarket C1000 on the other hand goes the full nine yards , as it has a Cruella de Ville look - alike announce that she has to take one for the German team .
Utilities company Nuon lets a ‘ typical ’ arrogant German fan get his comeuppance when his T - shirt turn orange , the Dutch national colour , while standing among his fellow fans .
Both Germany and the Netherlands participate in the upcoming World Cup in South Africa .
Anti-German sentiments were alive in the Netherlands from World War II onwards to well into the 1990s , but kids these days just do n’t seem to see the point .
Which makes it even odder that these ads are so blatantly anti-German .
Something I heard a lot this year , now that Dutch coach Louis van Gaal and Dutch players Mark van Bommel and Arjan Robben have had such a successful year at Bayern Munich : “ I never thought I would say this , but I am actually supporting the German side . ”

The Twilight Saga : Eclipse - Movie Synopsis
Blending romance and action fantasy , The Twilight Saga : Eclipse is the third of the Twilight Saga blockbuster films based upon the best - selling novels by Stephanie Meyer who published the story in 2007 to critical acclaim .
Released worldwide in over 4000 theaters and almost 200 IMAX cinemas , the film set box office records and doubled down on Twi -Fan Frenzy by landing more than $ 30 million in a single midnight preview showing across the United States and Canada .
Eclipse topped all previous Twilight films , earning over $ 300 million at the box office and the most money of any other film in this genre of all time !
Breaking News : The Twilight Saga : Eclipse being considered for the Horror & Sci-Fi Film Festival on Lincoln Road Mall in Miami Beach Under the stewardship of director David Slade , teen heartthrobs Rob Pattinson and Taylor Lautner ( playing vampire Edward Cullen and werewolf Jacob Black ) vie for the affections of Kristen Stewart ( the all - too - human Bella Swan ) amidst the growing tensions between camps of vampires , werewolves and the emerging army of newborn vamps under the dominion of Bryce Dallas Howard ( playing the deadly Victoria ) .
Edward and Bella - the star - crossed lovers of all the Twilight movies - are planning to get married so that she may finally make the transformation from human to vampire and thus make their love immortal .
At issue is the love triangle forming when Bella realizes she also has feelings for werewolf Jacob though she 's sworn herself to Edward .
As passions erupt between the three protagonists , Victoria 's newborn vamp army grows in strength and menaces the community which forces an alliance between the Cullens and the Wolf Pack .
Retreating to the woods , the newly allied vampires and werewolves begin to train to defend against the newborn army .
Edward and Jacob join forces in the mountains to protect Bella from harm and though Bella lowers her guard and kisses her werewolf admirer , she must ultimately surrender to her vampire true love Edward .
In the epic battle against the newborns , the vampires and the wolves defeat Victoria and her minions and Bella declares to Dakota Fanning ( Jane ) her plans to marry Edward and become vampire .
Eclipse draws to a close as Edward and Bella return to the meadow to share their feelings and move forward with their eternal bond .
Who is Charlene Strong and what makes her so special ?
Obama certainly has his hands full , but the LGBT community still hopes he can put the full force of his Presidency behind a swift change in law .
Some question whether he understands how important his roll in this movement is .
That could change very soon .
Charlene Strong is scheduled to meet with President Obama on June 22 .
ENDA 's chances of passing this year are minimal .
The LGBT community can still be legally fired for just being who they are for the foreseeable future .
Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell 's repeal remains in limbo .
The repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act has not even been discussed seriously in Congress .
On a personal note , she is a friend .
I love her dearly .
But you do n't need to know her as well as I do to consider her a friend .
Her story is so powerful it moved a reluctant Washington State Legislature to protect gay and lesbian families with a limited Domestic Partnership law .
Then , three years later , her story moved Washington State voters to give gay and lesbian couples all the same state rights as straight married couples under an expanded Domestic Partnership law .
It was the first time in U.S. history voters approved the expansion of rights for gay and lesbian families at the ballot box .
Her story continues to move people from ambivalence to support .
Charlene Strong 's message is a reminder to the LGBT community that anything is possible .
I have no doubt her story will move President Obama to action .
What is her story ?
Watch the trailer from her documentary For My Wife :
Charlene is not stopping with the President .
She wants the country to hear Kate 's story , so Kate 's life can continue to inspire understanding and support for LGBT community .
" There is real damage because of discrimination and it will continue without full equality , " Charlene said , " Anyone today who is told they can not be by their loved one 's side as they die would explode in outrage . "
US consolidates occupation of Iraq
9 June 2010
As the Obama administration escalates its war in Afghanistan , Iraq is cautiously being declared a success .
The top American commander in Iraq , General Raymond Odierno , declared last Friday that the country had held “ a legitimate and credible election ” , its security forces had improved and plans were “ on track ” for the withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq by September 1 .
Speaking at the West Point military academy late last month , President Obama was even more upbeat , declaring that as US troops depart , “ a strong American civilian presence will help Iraqis forge political and economic progress ” towards establishing “ a democratic Iraq that is sovereign and stable and self - reliant ” .
The reality is entirely different .
Even after the September deadline , the US military will maintain a huge military presence of 50,000 troops , ostensibly in “ non-combat ” and “ training ” roles , to prop up a puppet regime in Baghdad , which , three months after the national election , is yet to be formed .
While the character of the American occupation of Iraq is changing , its underlying purpose — to maintain the country firmly under US domination — remains the same .
In his comments last Friday , General Odierno declared that the “ drawdown ” was ahead of schedule — 600,000 containers of gear and 18,000 vehicles moved out ; and the number of bases down from 500 last year to 126 and set to decline to 94 by September 1 .
What is actually underway , however , is not a withdrawal , but a vast consolidation in preparation for the long - term occupation of the country by US forces .
The Stars and Stripes newspaper noted in an article on June 1 that the ratification of the US - Iraq security agreement in November 2008 governing the drawdown was followed by a massive expansion of base construction work .
“ In all , the military finished $ 496 million in base construction projects during 2009 , the highest annual figure since the war began and nearly a quarter of the $ 2.1 billion spent on American bases in Iraq since 2004 .
An additional $ 323 million worth of projects are set to be completed this year . ”
While the number of US bases may be declining , the Pentagon is establishing what are known as “ enduring presence posts ” — including four major bases : Joint Base Balad in the north , Camp Adder in southern Iraq , Al - Asad Air Base in the west and the Victory Base Complex around Baghdad International Airport .
These are sprawling fortified facilities — Balad alone currently houses more than 20,000 troops .
In addition to the 50,000 troops that will remain , there will be up to 65,000 contractors after September 1 .
Under the 2008 agreement , the US military handed over internal security functions to Iraqi forces last year , but , under the guise of “ training ” and “ support ” , retains tighter supervision of the army and police .
Moreover the Iraqi government can always “ request ” US troop assistance in mounting operations .
As Odierno explained in a letter to US personnel on June 1 , even after all US combat troops leave , “ we will continue to conduct partnered counter - terrorism operations and provide combat enablers to help the Iraqi Security Forces maintain pressure on the extremist networks . ”
The 2008 agreement sets December 31 , 2011 as the deadline for all US troops to quit Iraq , but the construction of huge new US bases indicates a long - term US military presence under a Strategic Framework Agreement that is yet to be negotiated .
As Stars and Stripes pointed out , “ the nascent condition of the Iraqi Air Force … could lead the Iraqi government to request that a US training force remain in the country beyond 2011 , most likely at Balad . ”
Accompanying the troop drawdown is a buildup of civilian operations centred on the US embassy in Baghdad .
The new embassy , situated in the fortified Green Zone , is the largest and most expensive in the world .
Opened in January 2009 , the complex includes 21 buildings , occupies 0.4 square kilometres and houses 1,000 regular employees as well as up to 3,000 additional staff .
The embassy ’s No 2 diplomat Cameron Munter told the Washington Post last month : “ Our commitment will not be on the scale of numbers and money that the military has .
But it will be extraordinarily substantial . ”
The Post also touched on certain sensitive projects that would not be handed over to embassy staff , including “ the collection of intelligence , initiatives to counter what the military calls ‘ malign Iranian influence ’ , and the integration of tens of thousands of former insurgents the military turned into Sunni paramilitary groups . ”
In other words , the US military will remain actively involved in monitoring and manipulating the sectarian divisions that Washington has exploited since the 2003 invasion to assert its control .
The “ ending ” of the insurgency , trumpeted by the Pentagon and White House , has involved the ruthless suppression of opposition to the US occupation , resulting in the deaths of more than a million Iraqis , another two million driven into exile , and tens of thousands detained and tortured .
Iraqi “ democracy ” rests on a police state apparatus developed and honed by the US military .
The “ legitimate and credible ” election in March was only open to those parties and politicians that accepted the occupation .
Seven years of war has had a devastating impact on the Iraqi people .
Unemployment and underemployment remain high .
According to last month ’s Brookings Iraq Index , as of last year , only 20 percent of the population had access to proper sanitation , 45 percent to clean water , 50 percent to more than 12 hours a day of electricity , 50 percent to adequate housing and 30 percent to health services .
A 2007 World Bank survey found that 23 percent of people were living in poverty on less than $ US2.20 a day .
The criminal US invasion of Iraq was not aimed at helping the Iraqi people .
Rather , its purpose was to subjugate the country in order to establish control over its vast energy reserves and to transform it into a base for wider American strategic objectives in the Middle East and Central Asia .
Having bloodily suppressed resistance in Iraq , the Obama administration is pulling its troops out in order to expand its neo-colonial war in Afghanistan and for new military aggression in other parts of the globe .
Being left behind is an extensive American civilian and military apparatus that will continue to control the levers of power in Baghdad , bully the Iraqi government into line on matters concerning US interests , keep a watchful eye on the country ’s festering sectarian tensions and leave the door open to a rapid return of US troops .

Patriotism , or very bad taste ?
Civilians driving on the Trans - Israel Highway 6 on Friday could not ignore a sign posted on a bus driving on the road , which conveyed a controversial message to the commandos who took park in the interception of the Gaza - bound flotilla : " Shayetet 13 , shame on you .
Why did you kill so few ? "
Even more surprising is that the bus itself was hired by the Israel Defense Forces and was driving soldiers home for the weekend .
A closer look revealed that the questionable display of support was the initiative of the driver himself , who saw a similar sign while on the road and decided to place it on the front of his bus , in order to " express support of the naval forces " .
" Shayetet 13 , shame on you .
Why did you kill so few ? "
The IDF agreed that this was an inappropriate form of protest , and after a talk between the soldiers ' commanders and the driver , the latter quickly apologized , removed the sign , and continued on his route .
While the driver is not an IDF employee and was only hired by the military to transport the soldiers , the incident evoked uneasiness among many who came across the bus .
" It is in bad taste that at a time when the entire incident is under investigation , when the whole world 's eyes are on Israel , which continues to suffer form criticism , such an incident happens with a bus that services the military , " a woman at a nearby gas station said .
Several of the soldiers who were on the bus were also unimpressed with the driver 's initiative .
They said that , contrary to what the sign said , they were proud of their comrades ' work at sea , and said anyone who took part in the takeover should be supported .
THE .net domain is the most popular on the internet , with more than 260 m hosts counted by the most recent Internet Domain Survey .
Hosts are separate computer “ addresses ” that are contacted when a website or domain name is called up .
Japan 's top - level domain .jp has the most hosts , counting over twice as many as Italy's .
The biggest generic top - level domains are .edu , used by education institutions across the world , and .mil , which is used only by the American military .
At the other end of the scale , only 47 hosts with the Afghanistan suffix .af were recorded , fewer than the Holy See 's 67 .
Iraq and North Korea are even less popular , ranking joint 251st and 261st out of a possible 268 domains .
And two went unused : .sj and .pm .
All the brilliantly witty things I had intended to write in this space have evaporated .

I recently went looking for an IRC client for my Nexus One and could n’t find any good information to narrow the field based on some quick google searches .
So I downloaded 4 from the market to give them a try .
Since others may also be looking for this sort of info I figured I ’d share my impressions .
If you are a developer of any of these apps , first thank you for making them free , I ’m obviously a fan of free software .
Second if I got anything wrong about your app , please ping me and I ’ll update this post .
Yaaic
Yaaic does n’t seem to explicitly support password protected channels , but you can work around this by running / join commands on connect .
One downside of this is there does n’t seem to be a way to edit or delete commands that are run on connect , which can be problematic for channels that rotate passwords .
You switch channels by swiping left or right which is feels natural except for it being very sensitive .
I keep swiping past channels in the middle , though this might be good if you have a lot of channels and do n’t want to have to do multiple swipes to get between them .
Could n’t find any options for notifications .
If fact the only options I can find beyond the server ’s settings are 5 booleans : reconnect , show icons , show colors , show timestamps and 24 hour format ( which is greyed out ) .
fIRC
Unfortunately it does n’t support SSL connections .
This is really a non starter for me
AndChat
Multiple channels are supported by tabs at the top ( or maybe they ’re buttons ) .
Supports highlighting with customizable notifications .
You can highlight any mention of your usual nick ( ie. blassey even though you may be logged in as blassey_ or lassey ) .
The notifications are noticeable , but not annoying and also show you what was said in a marque .
It has an option to keep chat logs , thought I do n’t know that IRC logs are the best use of my phone ’s memory .
Same thing as Yaaic for channels with passwords , except you can edit the commands .
And Chat has an option for join / part / quit message hiding , which is obviously nice as it unclutters your relatively small screen ( especially in popular channels ) .
Android IRC Free
Has a nag screen on launch asking you to buy the full version which lasts for 10 seconds .
I have n’t used this one nearly as much as the others because often I ’m hopping on IRC from my phone to make a quick comment to someone .
The 10s lag is incredibly annoying in this situation .
And I do n’t really see much in this app that justifies paying for it given the other free options .
It does support notifications though , very much like AndChat .
And the winner …
For me it ’s And Chat , at least for now .
This is based on personal taste , and use cases but And Chat seems to offer a lot of options that make IRC on a mobile phone work best for me .
Now a feature wish list :
Defense Secretary Robert Gates ( left ) may get help in cutting major weapons programs from an unexpected ally -- the tea party movement .
| AP Photos | AP photo composite by POLITICO Gates may get lift from tea parties
As Defense Secretary Robert Gates takes on General Electric , Boeing , Lockheed Martin and other “ powerful people ” in seeking cuts to major weapons programs , he may get help from an unexpected ally — the tea party movement .
Key tea party players , on and off Capitol Hill , are expressing a willingness to put the Pentagon budget on the chopping block if it will help rein in federal spending and eliminate a projected trillion - dollar - plus budget deficit .
Advertisement
Although generally hawkish and conservative with a libertarian streak — “ we ’re for strong defense ” is an oft - repeated mantra in the movement — tea party leaders and allies contacted by POLITICO said that both fairness and common sense dictate that the military budget be scrutinized for such cuts , a view that puts them in sync with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and some of the most liberal members of Congress .
“ Everything is on the table , ” insisted Mark Meckler , a national coordinator with the group Tea Party Patriots .
“ I have yet to hear anyone say , ‘ We ca n’t touch defense spending , ’ or any other issue .
...
Any tea partier who says something else lacks integrity . ”
Tea partiers say they are concerned about “ waste , fraud and abuse ” within all government programs .
To them , anything that government touches is riddled with inefficiency and corruption .
Yet , any tea party support for Gates ’s efforts to rein in military spending may be more philosophical than tactical .
Social spending , “ corporate bailouts ” and President Barack Obama ’s health care plan are much more popular targets of tea partiers ’ anger than the Pentagon .
And parochial politics — including jobs for constituents of tea party sympathizers on Capitol Hill — will come into play as well , as evidenced by the congressional battle over the second engine for the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter program , built jointly by GE and Rolls - Royce .
Gates and Obama have threatened a veto of the fiscal 2011 defense authorization bill over the second engine , but the House approved $ 485 million for the program anyway .
“ Possibly , the tea party movement could help in that regard , ” said Rep. Paul Broun ( R - Ga. ) , a tea party favorite , when asked about whether tea partiers would back Gates .
“ Most of these people want to look at all federal spending and put it all on the table .
They want to spend on strong defense , they want to support our troops , but they want to get rid of all the fluff , the fraud , the abuse , the waste in the federal government .
They want to see the federal government shrink in size . ”
Broun , a bitter critic of Obama — and no fan of Gates or the history of U.S. military intervention since World War II , including NATO — said the country “ cannot be a protector of the whole world .
We can not do that any longer .
We do n’t have the money to do it anyway . ”
“ I think it will help Gates , ” said Rep. Jeff Flake ( R - Ariz . ) , a longtime opponent of congressional pork - barrel spending .
“ Republicans too often over the last couple of decades have said , ‘ We want to limit spending but leave defense alone . ’
But I think we all recognize that if we ’re in a situation like Greece , then you ’re in worse shape than if you have one fewer aircraft carrier or whatever else . ”
Similar language is being used by tea party candidates running for the House and Senate in Republican primaries across the country — that the Pentagon has to be included in governmentwide spending cuts .
“ But in overall terms , we have to say , ‘ Is all spending on the military good ?
Is there waste in the military ?
Definitely , ” said Rand Paul , the tea party - favored candidate who won the GOP Senate nomination in Kentucky , in a video on his campaign website .
“ So there ’s an enormous amount of waste out there .
And we need to make sure that when we define national defense , we do n’t define all military spending as being toward national defense . ”
“ You have to look at the entire [ federal ] budget , and approximately 40 percent of the budget is military , ” Paul added .
“ So you really do have to look at the entire budget and say , ‘ We are going to cut , and we are going to look at waste , fraud and abuse all across the aisle , all across every bit of the budget . ’ ”
Paul , son of Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) and an opponent of the Iraq war , would ban lobbying and campaign donations by any company receiving a government contract valued at $ 1 million or more annually , including defense firms .
His father is a member of a bipartisan , bicameral group of lawmakers that wants to cut as much as $ 100 billion annually from the Pentagon budget , a rare fusion of far - left and far - right politics .
Chuck DeVore , a tea party candidate for the GOP Senate nomination in California , said cuts to defense spending are “ not an issue ” he has heard raised in the hundreds of movement events he has attended .
A retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserves , DeVore supports a robust missile defense program , wants to keep the Guantanamo Bay detention facility open and backs military tribunals for terrorism suspects .
Yet he ’s opposed to “ open nation building , ” such as the United States ’ efforts in Afghanistan .
Americans “ neither have enough people or treasure to be a global policeman for decades , ” DeVore states on his website .
In an interview , DeVore said the U.S. must rethink its military strategy to determine from where potential strategic threats will emerge in coming years and decades .
Like all tea party members , he decries the “ waste , fraud and abuse ” in government contracts .
DeVore , a member of the California Assembly , warned that generically opposing “ waste , fraud and abuse ” is not enough .
“ That ’s just a way to not be specific ” on which defense program a tea party member wants to slash or get deleted , he insisted , although he declined to offer any ideas for such cuts .
“ The tea party movement , Americans that are turning out at town hall meetings , are tired of the borrowing and the spending , and they want to see us put our fiscal house in order , ” said Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana , chairman of the House Republican Conference and a favorite of tea partiers .
“ If we are going to put our fiscal house in order , everything has to be on the table .
We have to be willing to look at domestic spending , we have to be able to look at entitlements , and we have to look at defense . ”
Pence , however , supports the second engine for the F - 35 JSF .
Rolls - Royce — which has secured the first procurement contract related to the F - 35 — is the second - largest employer in the Hoosier state .
The company has more than 4,000 employees in the Indianapolis area alone , demonstrating once again that all politics is local , even for tea party backers .
Other tea party figures said the movement should not get bogged down in fights over which federal programs to keep or slash , including weapons programs .
They prefer to stay more general in opposing government spending and deficits .
“ There is tremendous diversity of opinion in the tea party movement on what I ’m going to characterize as social issues or foreign policy issues , ” said Sal Russo , a veteran California GOP political operative who now is a driving force behind the Tea Party Express .
Tea party unity , in Russo ’s view comes from three basic principles : getting the national debt under control , cutting taxes and limiting the reach of the federal government .
The movement fractures when it gets beyond those basics , losing its political clout , he said .
“ Once you get past that , and one of the reasons why you see a lot of balkanization in the tea party movement , is that people find other issues that they want to talk about , ” Russo said .
“ At the Tea Party Express , we ’re going to refrain from doing that . ”
“ When most people think of government spending , they think of the massive health care bill , and they think of the [ Wall Street ] bailouts .
That ’s kind of what drove the tea party movement , ” said Ryan Hecker , one of the organizers of the Contract From America , the 2010 version of 1994 ’s Contract With America .
Hecker added that he was “ not an expert ” in defense spending and would rely on Gates or other Pentagon officials for advice on where to cut .
“ It ’s more difficult with the military because everyone wants a strong military , ” Hecker said .

I 'm confused .
When I walk around busy midtown Manhattan , I often smell marijuana .
Despite the crowds , some people smoke weed in public .
Usually the police leave them alone , and yet other times they act like a military force engaged in urban combat .
This February , cops stormed a Columbia , Mo. home , killed the family dog and terrorized a 7 - year - old boy -- for what ?
A tiny quantity of marijuana .
Two years ago , in Prince George 's County , Md. , cops raided Cheye Calvo 's home -- all because a box of marijuana was randomly shipped to his wife as part of a smuggling operation .
Only later did the police learn that Calvo was innocent -- and the mayor of that town .
" When this first happened , I assumed it was just a terrible , terrible mistake , " Calvo said .
" But the more I looked into it , the more I realized ( it was ) business as usual that brought the police through our front door .
This is just what they do .
We just do n't hear about it .
The only reason people heard about my story is that I happened to be a clean - cut white mayor . "
Radley Balko of Reason magazine says more than a hundred police SWAT raids are conducted every day .
Does the use of illicit drugs really justify the militarization of the police , the violent disregard for our civil liberties and the overpopulation of our prisons ?
It seems hard to believe .
I understand that people on drugs can do terrible harm -- wreck lives and hurt people .
But that 's true for alcohol , too .
But alcohol prohibition did n't work .
It created Al Capone and organized crime .
Now drug prohibition funds nasty Mexican gangs and the Taliban .
Is it worth it ?
I do n't think so , and I 'll discuss this issue tomorrow night on my Fox Business show .
Everything can be abused , but that does n't mean government can stop it , or should try to stop it .
Government goes astray when it tries to protect us from ourselves .
Many people fear that if drugs were legal , there would be much more use and abuse .
That 's possible , but there is little evidence to support that assumption .
In the Netherlands , marijuana has been legal for years .
Yet the Dutch are actually less likely to smoke than Americans .
Thirty - eight percent of American adolescents have smoked pot , while only 20 percent of Dutch teens have .
One Dutch official told me that " we 've succeeded in making pot boring . "
By contrast , what good has the drug war done ?
It 's been 40 years since Richard Nixon declared war on drugs .
Since then , government has spent billions and officials keep announcing their " successes . "
They are always holding press conferences showing off big drug busts .
So it 's not like authorities are n't trying .
We 've locked up 2.3 million people , a higher percentage than any other country .
That allows China to criticize America 's human - rights record because our prisons are " packed with inmates . "
Yet drugs are still everywhere .
The war on drugs wrecks far more lives than drugs do !
Need more proof ?
Fox News runs stories about Mexican cocaine cartels and marijuana gangs that smuggle drugs into Arizona .
Few stop to think that legalization would end the violence .
There are no Corona beer smugglers .
Beer sellers do n't smuggle .
They simply ship their product .
Drug laws cause drug crime .
The drug trade moved to Mexico partly because our government funded narcotics police in Colombia and sprayed the growing fields with herbicides .
We announced it was a success !
We cut way back on the Colombian drug trade .
But so what ?
All we did was squeeze the balloon .
The drug trade moved across the border to Peru , and now it 's moved to Mexico .
So the new president of Mexico is squeezing the balloon .
-- Now the trade and the violence are spilling over the border into the United States .
That 's what I call progress .
It the kind of progress we do n't need .
Economist Ludwig von Mises wrote : " ( O ) nce the principle is admitted that it is the duty of the government to protect the individual against his own foolishness , ( w ) hy not prevent him from reading bad books and bad plays ?
The mischief done by bad ideologies is more pernicious than that done by narcotic drugs . "
Right on , Ludwig !

Scottish brewery BrewDog has reclaimed the world record for the strongest beer in history with a 55 % alcohol beer which it has named “ The End of History . ”
Only 11 bottles will be available , and each bottle will come inside a stuffed animal – seven Stoats will be available at GBP500 and four grey squirrels at GBP700 , making it also the most expensive beer in history .
The challenge is now squarely in front of BrewDog ’s great rival , three time holder of the record for the world ’s strongest beer , Georg Tscheuschner of Schorschbräu brewery in Northern Bavaria .
This 55 % beer is so strong that it is pushing the limits of what can be achieved in terms of alcohol content without ruining the taste – the new beer pushes the alcohol limit out by a further 25 % over the previous record holder and the record is now more than double the alcoholic percentage of the world ’s strongest beer just 16 months ago .
The beer ’s name “ The End of History ” derives from philosopher Francis Fukuyama ’s book " The End of History and the Last Man " , in which he postulates that democracy and political and economic liberalism will triumph and democracy will be the end point of political evolution .
BrewDog ’s obvious claim is that no - one is going to beat their beer because it ’s the final statement and cannot be beaten – we think Fukuyama was a lot safer in making his claim than the boys at Brewdog are .
Schorschbräu's Georg Tscheuschner responded to the news saying , " this is a great challenge , but it 's not over yet . "
Regardless , it also seems to be a withdrawal from the battle , as BrewDog ’s blog states , “ The End of History ” , at 55 % , is the final instalment of our efforts to redefine the limits of contemporary brewing . ”
“ The End of History ” began life as a blond Belgian ale and was subsequently freeze distilled many times , infused with nettles from the Scottish Highlands and Fresh juniper berries and ... then put in a bottle created by a taxidermist .
To understand just where the Gray Squirrels and Mr Stoat fit into the picture ( we ’re still trying to figure it out ) , check out BrewDog ’s latest video .
Our extensive article on the history of beer and the battle between Schorschbräu and BrewDog can be found here .
After gazing intently at numerous sports infographics on the Web , we learned that most of the amazing and eye - popping infographics are produced outside the U.S. as hand - drawn graphics , inside the U.S. for newspapers , and through statistics designed visually by individuals who delve deeper than we ’d ever go into any sport .
The following 17 infographics are the best of the best , and they ’re ones that every sports fan should see .
It 's a year since the World Health Organization ( WHO ) officially declared a global pandemic of swine flu , triggering health emergencies across the planet .
But instead of accolades , the WHO and authorities everywhere are facing an avalanche of disturbing questions about the handling of the swine flu , and the influence of vested interests .
To put the key question most crudely : was the world wrongly persuaded to believe it was in the grip of a ghastly and severe pandemic by decision - making bodies unduly influenced by pharmaceutical companies hoping to sell billions of dollars worth of vaccines and anti-viral drugs ?
A report just out from the Council of Europe has come to some devastating conclusions .
The declaration of a pandemic lead to a " waste of huge sums of public money " , a " distortion of priorities " in public health services , the " provocation of unjustified fear " and the " creation of health risks through vaccines and medications " that may not have been sufficiently tested .
Clearly any untimely death is a tragedy , but from early on it looked like H1N1 was a relatively moderate strain of influenza , though it could be unusually harmful for certain groups .
And the global death toll is in the thousands not the predicted millions .
But governments in many places have been left with contracts for millions of doses of vaccines now going to waste .
A series of investigations have been launched into how authorities handled swine flu , with the damming Council of Europe report one of the first completed .
It originated from a motion tabled in the 47 nation Parliamentary Assembly titled , " Faked pandemics - a threat for health . "
It identifies three key problems : first , WHO 's excessive response and pandemic declaration ; second , excessive secrecy surrounding decision - making ; and third , the possibility of undue influence by drug companies through financial ties to key decision - makers .
The report explains that the WHO description of the definition of a " pandemic " was actually changed in May 2009 , after the first cases of swine flu were reported .
The change seems to have removed the requirement that a virus 's impact be severe , before a pandemic was declared .
The report cites concerns within the scientific community that the WHO rapidly moved towards declaring " pandemic level 6 " in June , 2009 , when swine flu presented " relatively mild symptoms " .
It went on to state that the declaration of the pandemic was only made possible by " changing the definition " and by " lowering the threshold for its declaration . "
But it was this all - important declaration which triggered pre-pandemic planning that would prove highly lucrative to industry : " pharmaceutical companies had a strong vested interest in the declaration of a pandemic " the report states .
At the same time , the membership list of the WHO's 16 - member " Emergency Committee " , instrumental in declaring the pandemic , remains secret - a lack of transparency strongly attacked by the report .
Last week the British Medical Journal , ( BMJ ) published its own journalistic investigation , revealing that specialists with financial links to the drug industry were intimately involved in WHO pre-pandemic planning .
For example , the WHO guidance for anti-viral medicines , including Roche 's Tamiflu , " was authored by an influenza expert who at the same time was receiving payments from Roche . "
BMJ also exposed the identities of three members of the secret " Emergency Committee " , including one with financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry .
As part of the call for a major clean - up , both the BMJ and the Council of Europe want health decision - making bodies to be entirely free of members with financial ties to drug makers .
Chairman of Australia 's Influenza Specialist Group ( ISG ) Alan Hampson , says such a reform is " unnecessary " , and " unachievable " , because so many experts have ties to drug - makers .
As an example , the ISG is 100 percent funded by drug and device companies , yet chair Alan Hampson says he sits on a number of committees offering advice to the Australian government , including on swine flu .
The WHO strongly rejects that decisions were unduly influenced , though it has commenced a high - level external investigation .
Even Australia has a review , though not an external public inquiry .
The Council of Europe report found " overwhelming evidence that the seriousness of the pandemic was vastly overrated " at the outset .
Indeed , very early on there was a private view among elites that even if swine flu was n't so serious , it was a good test run .
The exercise has certainly proved lucrative to industry , but at what cost to the credibility of agencies supposed to be protecting public health , not promoting private wealth .

I spent the last two days with a friend of mine , Frank Boldewin of reconstructer.org , analyzing the Adobe Reader / Flash 0 - day that ’s being exploited in the wild this week .
We had received a sample of a malicious PDF file which exploits the still unpatched vulnerability ( MD5 : 721601bdbec57cb103a9717eeef0 bfca ) and it turned out more interesting than we had expected .
Here is what we found :
Part I : The PDF file
The PDF file itself is rather large .
Analyzing the file with PDF Dissector , I found two interesting streams inside the PDF file .
Later I will describe that there is actually a third interesting stream , belonging to object 17 , in the PDF file .
This stream contains an encrypted EXE file which will be dropped and executed by the shellcode .
This can not be known before analyzing the shellcode though .
The first interesting stream can be found in PDF object 1 .
It is a binary stream that starts with the three characters CWS , the magic value of compressed Flash SWF files headers .
I dumped this stream to a file and it turned out to be a valid Flash file .
The second interesting stream belongs to PDF object 10 .
This stream contains a very short JavaScript code snippet that heap - sprays a huge array onto the heap .
In the screenshot below you can see the original code .
I then used PDF Dissector to execute the JavaScript code .
The byte array that gets heap - sprayed is stored in the variable _3 after execution .
I dumped this byte array to a file ( see heapspray .bin in the ZIP file at the end of this post ) and disassembled it with IDA Pro .
Later it will become clear that the embedded SWF file is actually exploiting the Flash player and not Adobe Reader ( or rather it exploits the Flash player DLL that is shipped with Adobe Reader ) .
The purpose of the PDF file is primarily to massage the heap into a predictable state for the Flash player exploit .
Part II : The shellcode – Stage I
In the disassembled file I expected to see a nop - sled followed by regular x86 code but this is not what I found .
There is something that looks like a huge nop - sled ( a long list of ‘ or al , 0 Ch ’ instructions ) but no valid code follows that nop - sled ( which will later turn out not to be a nop - sled at all ) .
Rather , following the ‘ nop - sled ’ I found a list of addresses that point into code of an Adobe Reader DLL called BIB .DLL .
We were dealing with return - oriented shellcode here .
You can find the documented IDB of the shellcode in the ZIP file at the end of this post .
For now please click on this link for a text file that contains the documented code .
The beginning looks like
[ code ]
seg000:00000BEC dd 7004919h ; pop ecx
seg000:00000BEC ; pop ecx
seg000:00000BEC
; mov dword ptr [ eax+0 Ch ] , 1
seg000:00000BEC ; pop esi
seg000:00000BEC ; pop ebx
seg000:00000BEC ; retn
seg000:00000BF0 dd 0CCCCCCCCh ; ecx = 0xCCCCCCCC
seg000:00000BF4 dd 70048 EFh ; ecx = 0x070048EF
seg000:00000BF8 dd 700156Fh ; esi = 0x0700156 F
seg000:00000BFC dd 0CCCCCCCCh ; ebx = 0xCCCCCCCC
seg000:00000C00 dd 7009084h ; retn
seg000:00000C04 dd 7009084h ; retn
[ / code ]
and continues for quite a while .
The first column shows the address .
The second column shows the values on the stack ( primarily addresses to ROP gadgets in BIB.DLL ) .
The third column shows what instructions can be found at the given addresses in BIB.DLL and what effects the shellcode has .
The ROP shellcode is a variant of the code found in this exploit POC by villy .
At first , the shellcode allocates memory using NtAllocateVirtualMemory ( accessed through sysenter ) .
Then , it copies a second stage shellcode to the allocated memory and executes it .
BIB.DLL is actually a DLL file that gets randomly relocated if you have address - space layout randomization enabled on your system .
Systems with enabled ASLR can not be exploited by this malicious PDF file .
This does not mean that the vulnerability can not be exploited if ASLR is enabled , it ’s just that the particular sample we looked at will not work in that case .
Part III : The shellcode – Stage II
The second stage shellcode is rather short .
All it does is to copy the third stage shellcode to the memory allocated by the first stage .
Afterwards the third stage is executed .
An IDB file for the second stage is included in the ZIP file at the end of this post .
[ code]seg000:00000000 pop edx
seg000:00000001 nop
seg000:00000002 push esp
seg000:00000003 nop
seg000:00000004 pop edx
seg000:00000005 jmp short loc_1C
seg000:00000007
seg000:00000007 loc_7 :
seg000:00000007 pop eax
seg000:00000008
seg000:00000008
In this loop of the second stage of
the shellcode , the third stage of the shellcode
seg000:00000008 is copied to a known address ( memory allocated
by the first ROP stage ) and executed afterwards .
seg000:00000008
seg000:00000008 CopyLoop :
seg000:00000008 mov ebx , [ edx ]
seg000:0000000A mov [ eax ] , ebx
seg000:0000000C add eax , 4
seg000:0000000 F add edx , 4
seg000:00000012 cmp ebx , 0C0C0C0Ch ; Search for this signature to stop copying .
seg000:00000018 jnz short CopyLoop
seg000:0000001A jmp short CopyTarget
seg000:0000001C
seg000:0000001C loc_1C :
seg000:0000001C call loc_7
seg000:00000021
seg000:00000021
After the copy loop is complete , the third stage of the shellcode begins here .
seg000:00000021
seg000:00000021 CopyTarget :
seg000:00000021 nop
[ / code ]
Part IV : The shellcode – Stage III
The third stage is larger again .
First , it resolves a bunch of Windows API functions through name hashes .
Then , it tries to figure out which open file handle points to the malicious PDF file itself .
This is done by estimating the file size of the malicious PDF file and by scanning potential candidate files for two characteristic signatures .
If the malicious PDF file is found , a section of the PDF file ( the third interesting stream I mentioned above ) is decrypted using a simple XOR decryption and then written to the file C:\-.exe .
This file is then executed .
Since the third stage is part of the heap - sprayed data you can actually find the third stage code in the IDB file of the ROP stage .
The third stage code begins right after the ROP stage ends .
If you want to check out the code of the third stage right now , please click on this link to see the text dump .
Part V : The dropped file - .exe
Inside the ZIP package at the end of this post you can find the commented IDB file of -.exe .
Once again , this file is rather simple .
Here is what it does :
It checks whether the current user is an administrator account .
If it ’s not , download http://210.211.31.214/img/xslu.exe and execute it .
Then shut down -.exe .
If it is , it extracts a file called C:\windows \EventSystem.dll and a file called C:\windows\system32\es.ini from its own resource section .
The BITS service ( Background Intelligent Transfer Service ) is shut down .
Windows file protection is disabled .
The original qmgr.dll file is moved to kernel64.dll
EventSystem.dll replaces the original C:\windows\system32\qmgr.dll , C:\windows\system32\dllcache\qmgr.dll and c:\windows\servicepackfiles\i386\qmgr.dll
qmgr.dll , EventSystem.dll , and es.ini get the timestamp of the original qmgr.dll
The BITS service is started again , now with the dropped qmgr.dll instead of the original qmgr.dll
If you want to check out the code right now , you can click on this link to see the disassembled file .
Part VI : The dropped file EventSystem.dll
The primary purpose of EventSystem.dll , the DLL file that was registered as a service by -.exe , is to collect information about the user ’s system and to send it to a server controlled by the attacker .
You can see a dump of what information is collected and sent in this log file .
Additionally , the EventSystem.dll file also contains code that can download new files from the internet and execute them afterwards .
You can check out the IDB file in the ZIP file at the end of this post for a complete disassembly .
Part VII : Finding the vulnerability in the Flash player
The description of the shellcode is now complete , but one question remains :
What is actually the vulnerability in the Flash player ?
Here is what we found :
The first step was to figure out when control flow is transferred from regular Flash player code to the first stage of the shellcode .
At zynamics we have a Pin tool plugin we use to automatically recognize shellcode and dump it to a file .
You can find the complete trace generated by the Pin tool plugin in the ZIP file ( pin_trace. txt ) .
Here is the important part :
[ code ] 0x0700156 F ::BIB.dll 8B 41 34 mov eax , dword ptr [ ecx+0x34 ]
0x07001572::BIB.dll FF 71 24 push dword ptr [ ecx+0x24 ]
0x07001575 ::BIB.dll FF 50 08 call dword ptr [ eax +0x8 ]
0x070048EF ::BIB.dll 94 xchg esp , eax
0x070048F0 ::BIB.dll C3 ret
0x07004919 ::BIB.dll 59 pop ecx
0x0700491A ::BIB.dll 59 pop ecx
0x0700491B::BIB.dll C7 40 0C 01 00 00 00 mov dword ptr [ eax+0xc ] , 0x1[ /code ]
At address 0x07004919 of BIB.dll , the ROP code of the first stage is executed .
Two instructions before , at address 0x070048 EF , the original stack of the executing thread is replaced by something controlled by the attacker .
To figure out where control flow is coming from it is possible to set a breakpoint on the XCHG instruction and take a look at the stack .
The return value of the active stack frame will point to memory on the heap where you can find code .
This code does not belong to any code section of any module , so where does it come from ?
Turns out that this code is just - in - time compiled ActionScript code that is created from the malicious SWF file inside the malicious PDF file .
To analyze exactly how control flow is transferred from the JIT-ed ActionScript code to the ROP stage of the shellcode , I have created a trace with OllyDbg that shows all instructions that are executed after the just - in - time compilation of the ActionScript code but before the ROP code .
You can find the trace in the ZIP file at the end of this post ( olly_trace.txt ) .
Here are the important parts :
[ code ] 28CDE2A0 mov eax , dword ptr ss :[ebp - 44 ]
…
28CDE2C0 mov edx , dword ptr ds :[ eax +10 ] EAX=25966241
…
28CDE2C6 mov ecx , dword ptr ds :[ edx+2b8 ]
EAX=25966241 , EDX=20259384
…
28CDE2D5 mov dword ptr ss:[ ebp-60 ] , ecx EAX=25966241 , ECX=0C0C0C0C , EDX=00259685
…
28CDE2 EF mov ecx , dword ptr ss :[ ebp-60 ]
EAX=25966241 , ECX=0012F5D0 , EDX=00259685
…
28CDE2F8 call dword ptr ds :[ ecx+0c ]
EAX=25966241 , ECX=0C0C0C0C , EDX=00259685 [/code ]
The call at 28CDE2F8 goes directly to 0x0700156 F in BIB.dll ( see the Pin tool trace ) .
So what is going on here ?
To understand these six lines of code you have to know a bit about the memory layout at address 0x25966241 ( the value in EAX ) and about the internals of just - in - time compiled ActionScript code .
Let ’s start with the memory layout .
Here is what I saw at 0x25966241 ( note that the dump starts at 0x25966240 ) .
[ code ] 0x25966240 C8 0E 3D 30 05 00 00 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0x25966250 78 84 93 25 20 44 90 25[/code ]
Now eax ( 0x25966241 ) is used as a pointer in instruction 0x28CDE2C0 .
You might already notice that the pointer is not aligned at all .
This is unusual .
Now comes the part where you need to know about compiled ActionScript internals .
When values like integer numbers or objects are created by ActionScript scripts , pointers to these objects are created and stored .
Interestingly , all ActionScript values must be 8 - byte aligned because the lowest three bits of pointers to such values are used to encode type information about the values .
For example , if the lowest three bits of such a pointer are 101 , then the pointed - to value is a boolean value .
111 identifies a double value and so on .
So apparently what is happening in the above code is that a pointer that includes type information is used as a regular pointer without stripping the type information first .
If you debug this piece of code and manually clear the lowest three bits to remove the type information , the value 25966241 turns into 25966240 ( which itself contains a pointer to a v-table of a class called ScriptObject , lending more credence to the theory I am exploring here ) .
So , when [ eax + 10 ] is read without stripping the type information , the pointer 0x20259384 is read .
This pointer points to the binary data that was heap - sprayed by the JavaScript code of the PDF file .
If you do strip the type information though , you get the pointer 0x25938478 which is a legitimate pointer to another part of the just - in - time compiled ActionScript code .
After instruction 28CDE2C0 the register EDX points to the heap - sprayed values .
Most of the heap - sprayed values are 0x0C0C0C0C DWORD values , so edx +2b8 most likely points to such a DWORD value and 0x0C0C0C0C is moved into register ECX .
Through some clever heap - spraying , one iteration of the heap - sprayed data actually starts at address 0x0C0C0C0C so the memory layout starting from 0x0C0C0C0C is controlled by the attacker .
He then controls the value of [ ecx+0 c ] , the address of the function to be executed next .
If you go back to the JavaScript code in the malicious PDF file now , you can see the value 156f0700 close to the beginning of the heap - sprayed string .
This is just the value 0x0700156 F which is the entry point to the attacker - controlled control - flow in BIB.dll ( see the Pin trace above again ) .
We know now how control flow is transferred from the just - in - time compiled code to the shellcode .
The question that remains is why does the JIT - compiler produce code that leads to incorrect pointer usage ?
There are two possible options here .
The first one is that the JIT - compiler has a bug and emits wrong x86 code , code that forgets to strip off the type information .
I do n’t think this is the case because the emitted code that leads to the control - flow hijack is generated in benign cases too .
I think it is far more likely that the compiler assumes pre-conditions about the generated code that are not true in this particular situation .
In all of the benign cases I have observed , the type information was stripped from the pointer before the JIT code was even executed .
In the malicious case this does not happen which leads me to believe that the compiler emits code that assumes that all input pointers to that code segment have been stripped of their type information but apparently this is not always the case .
Let ’s look at what could trip up the JIT compiler .
Part VII : The malformed Flash file
Using the SWFTools disassembler we had a look at the Flash file that was embedded in the PDF file .
It quickly turned out ( by looking at characteristic strings ) that the Flash file is a modified version of AES - PHP.swf from http://flashdynamix.com/.
Disassembling and comparing the original SWF file to the malicious PDF file generated just a single difference .

The only difference can be found in line 210 .
While the benign Flash file tries to access the property BOTTOM , the malicious Flash file tries to create a new function object .
This simple change messes up the internal ActionScript stack ( as can be seen in the differing stack depth numbers after the + ) because getproperty and newfunction have different effects on the ActionScript stack .
Subsequent ActionScript instructions then assume a stack layout which is simply wrong .
Nevertheless , the JIT compiler seems to accept this code and generates x86 code for it .
The consequence of this change seems to be that preconditions for JIT - compiled code that were previously true do not hold anymore and the attacker can control the control flow as seen above .
Part VIII : The end
Now it would be interesting to figure out exactly what trips up the JIT code generation to see how it gets into this situation .
I think we are going to wait for the patch for this and just use BinDiff to compare the patched version of the Flash player with the unpatched version . 🙂

The U.S. military is building an energy weapon that can blow up improvised bombs before militants do .
But it may be some time before the device is used in Afghanistan .
Not only is the weapon too bulky for the rugged terrain there , but " civilians could be killed if the weapon is activated over widespread areas , " USA Today reports .
Since the Iraq insurgency began in earnest , the Pentagon has spent billions of dollars on ways to harness the electromagnetic spectrum to beat improvised explosive devices , or IEDs .
Nearly every vehicle now deployed by the military has a radio frequency jammer that cuts off explosives ' remote triggers .
Electronic warfare aircraft spoof some of those signals , and set off the IEDs from on high .
Everything from Humvee - mounted lasers to man-made lightning guns have been tried out as bomb - zappers .
USA Today does n't provide many details about this particular " highly classified technology , " other than saying it " bypasses the triggering device of an IED and detonates its explosive . "
But the article does note that the ray gun was used at checkpoints in Iraq in 2005 and 2008 and " requires a tractor - trailer - size vehicle " to move it around .
That 's too large for Afghanistan – something the military is trying to fix .
Improvised bombs are , by far , the number one killer of troops in the conflict there .
General James Mattis , head of the U.S. Joint Forces Command , would even like to see the weapon mounted on an aircraft .
" This is an offensive capability that will change the face of this war , " he tells the paper .
( Of course , if civilians happen to be in the way when bombs are detonated by the zapper , that could be a major problem . )
Research on the weapon is being conducted by the Navy , which has a long - standing interest in bomb - blasters .
By 2005 , researchers at the Naval Surface Warfare Center 's Dahlgren Laboratory were already deep into a project called NIRF ( short for Neutralizing Improvised Explosive Devices with Radio Frequency ) .
The device produced a very high - frequency field , in the microwave range , to take out an IED 's electronics .
During a test early that year , the " generator that creates the radio frequencies damaged a counter - IED component ... in effect , frying itself , " Aviation Week reported at the time .
But by fiscal year 2008 , the Navy was asking for $ 11 million extra for the system .
In June of last year , the Office of Naval Research launched an effort to destabilize explosives " at the molecular level . "
In September , the Dahlgren lab opened a " Directed Energy Warfare Office " that evaluates real - life ray guns ability to take out improvised bombs .

BP Oil Spill : Gov. Bobby Jindal Declares State of Emergency as Tropical Storm Bonnie Heads to Gulf Officials worry storm could lead to massive damage and setbacks in oil crisis .
NEW ORLEANS July 22 , 2010  -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency today as Tropical Storm Bonnie heads directly toward the site of the Gulf Oil spill , threatening weeks worth of progress .
BP officials and the federal government are scrambling to prepare for storm , which grew in strength today to become the second named Atlantic storm of the season .
Bonnie is currently blasting the Dominican Republic , Haiti and Puerto Rico , and it's expected to continue to track west , right into the gulf 's warm waters that can supercharge a tropical storm into a hurricane .
Watch ' World News ' for the latest on the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
All operations at the spill site came to a standstill today as evacuations got underway .
Non-essential workers have already been shipped ashore , and drilling on the relief wells has been suspended .
It 's a disappointing setback for a drilling effort that was just days away from finally connecting with the damaged well .
Jindal said that BP is better prepared for this storm than it was when Hurricane Alex churned the gulf 's waters a few weeks ago .
" I think their plans are better than they were when they first started hurricane season , " Jindal , a Republican , said , even as he expressed his concerns about the damage it can do to cleanup efforts .
The worst case scenario is that all ships monitoring the blown - out well would have to be evacuated , and no one would know if the containment cap failed and oil was again pouring unchecked into the waters .
Even if the ships leave , the plan now is to leave the containment cap on .
BP and federal officials on Thursday discussed removing it in the event of an evacuation .
" We are prepared to leave the well unattended during this particular event , " National Incident Cmdr. Adm .
Thad Allen said today .
The first drill ship to go would be the DDIII , but the government and BP are trying to see if they can keep robots on site to monitor the cap if the storm hits .
" The vessels that operate these ROVs [ robots ] are some of the last ones to leave , " BP executive Doug Suttles said today .
On land , essential equipment and personnel are moving further inland , as the storm threatens the cleanup of the millions of gallons of oil that have already spilled into the gulf .
Workers are pulling up booms from the waters .
Jindal said that it 's particularly dangerous , given that most of the oil in the gulf 's waters remains submerged .
" One of the things that a storm can do is pick up some of that oil and redeposit it on our coast and inside of our wetlands , " Jindal told ABC News today .
" What we are very worried about is the oil getting pushed farther inland along the coast . "
" [ The storm ] could break the anchors , pull it out , and more than anything , it will tear it up , and once it 's torn up , it 's useless , " said Capt .
Rich Adams , who 's involved in the cleanup efforts in Florida .
BP has set up a hurricane hotline -- 281.366.6669 .
" As the storm approaches the spill site , the winds are going to come out of the southeast to east and drive some of the oil into the shoreline , into Louisiana shoreline , " said Jeff Masters of Weather Underground .

Michigan Woman Sues , Claims Doctor Forced Abortion After She Said Stop Caitlin Bruce claims she said stop ; Dr. Abraham Hodari says it was too late .
June 4 , 2010  --
A young Michigan woman who changed her mind about having an abortion while on the doctor 's table has accused her doctor of terminating her pregnancy even after she pleaded with him to stop .
A lawsuit filed by 20 - year - old Caitlin Bruce against Dr. Abraham Hodari is now winding its way through the Genesee County court system , but the case has raised questions about when an abortion can be stopped .
Bruce said she walked into Hodari's Feminine Health Care Clinic in Flint , Mich. , in April 2008 , intending to have an abortion .
She claims in an interview with ABCNews.com she changed her mind , but was pinned down , her mouth covered to muffle her screams , while Hodari forcibly terminated her pregnancy .
" This is a question about choice .
Who makes the decision here ?
He told her she could back out any time , " Bruce 's attorney Tom Pabst said .
" Who does he think he is ? "
Hodari's lawyer called the lawsuit " baseless " and said Bruce changed her mind too late and that the doctor had no choice but to finish what he started .
" He did nothing improper , " Hodari 's attorney Steve Weiss said .
In 2008 , Bruce was 18 , pregnant by her much - older boyfriend , and unemployed .
She had dropped out of high school in 11th grade and was just starting to build a life for herself .
Her father , she said , had convinced her that the best thing for her would be to terminate the pregnancy .
" He just thought I was too young and I had n't finished school , " Bruce said .
" And how was I going to support the baby ? "
Bruce said she 'd had doubts about the abortion from the beginning , describing her emotions after finding out about the pregnancy as excited and nervous at the same time .
" I was really confused , asking everybody else what I should do .
Everybody told me , ' You were too young , ' " she said .
" What I really wanted to hear was , ' We 'll help you out . ' "
In the end , she walked into the clinic .
When a technician performed a sonogram and handed Bruce the picture of her 6 - week - old fetus -- even though she had specifically filled out paper work saying she did n't want to see the ultrasound or any pictures -- she began to seriously question her decision .
" I sat in the room for like five minutes and cried , " she said .
What happened next is in dispute .
Michigan Woman Describes Horrific Abortion ; Doctor Says He 's Justified
Bruce said she was put into an examination room and told Hodari she was nervous .
" He was just teling me you 'll be okay , " she said .
" It 'll be fine .
It 's a quick procedure .
It 'll just feel like a cramp in your stomach . "
Bruce said she begged Hodari to stop as soon as she felt him insert the speculum to start the procedure and despite her objections , brutally forced the abortion on her while his assistants pinned her to the table .
" He had a real tight grip over my mouth , but I was screaming .. and trying to pull my legs together , " she said .
Bruce said Hodari , who she described as " very irate , " seemed to give up at one point , telling her she could go home .
As she began to relax , she said , he suddenly and painfully finished terminating the pregnancy .
" And that 's when I felt the worst pain in my stomach , " she said .
" It really felt like he was ripping everything in me out , that 's how painful it was . "
Bruce said Hodari never spoke another word to her afterward and that she simply laid in the room by herself , terrified .
But Weiss told ABCNews.com a different version of the abortion .
He said that by the time Bruce changed her mind , the procedure was already at the point where the pregnancy was doomed .
He had broken her water and Bruce was bleeding .
" By the time she said stop , Dr. Hodari had already placed the dilator into her uterus , " Weiss said .
" By that time the pregnancy had been terminated .
He had to continue the abortion . "
Though Hodari did remove the dilator at Bruce 's request , Weiss said , her health would have been in jeopardy if he did n't finish .
Weiss pointed to Bruce 's own expert witness who Weiss claimed agreed that the doctor should have finished the abortion once the pregnancy was no longer viable .
" From that point on her own expert witness has said Dr. Hodari acted within reason , " he said .
But Pabst argued that " we were n't at that point " in the procedure .
" The water was n't broken , " the lawyer said .
" She had n't felt the pain her in belly . "
Vicki Saporta , president of the Washington , D.C. - based National Abortion Federation , a professional association of abortion providers , said a patient in any medical setting should always have the right to say no .
" In any medical procedure whether it's an abortion or another procedure , if a patient says stop , a patient 's wishes need to be respected , " Saporta said .
" But the patient needs to be informed about the risks of stopping the procedure . "
She declined to comment specifically on Bruce 's case , but said that if a woman 's requests to stop an abortion at any point , she should be informed about that decision and given a medical consent form to sign and an emergency contact .
Depression , Suicide Attempt Lead to New Beginning
Bruce said she left Hodari 's office in a daze .
She said she returned to him not long after for a check up , not knowing where else to go and afraid she would never have children again .
Several weeks after the procedure , sunken into a deep depression , Bruce said she was in her car at the top of a hill , prepared to kill herself by speeding into a building at the bottom .
It was her mother 's phone call that saved her life , she says .
Once in therapy , she said , " My therapist had to convince me this was n't my fault what happened .
It was his fault because I told him to stop . "
Shortly after that , Bruce was surprised to be pregnant again .
She gave birth last year to a baby girl , who she is raising with her boyfriend .
" I still have my bad days , " she said .
" My therapist taught me how to work through them because I have to take care of my daughter .
I can't have her be the victim of my depression . "
Bruce said that while she still believes in a woman 's right to have an abortion , she wishes more women would consider their options more carefully that she did .
" If you want to have an abortion that 's your choice , " she said .
" A lot of women think if it as an easy out , but it 's not . "
They say alerts are then sent to police , nightclub bouncers or shop security staff , which allow them to nip trouble in the bud before arguments spiral into violence .
IN RECENT months several countries have experimented with measures to cool bubbly property markets .
Yet since The Economist 's global round - up of housing markets was last published in April , house - price inflation has accelerated in some of the very countries where the authorities have intervened to slow its rise .
Asia has been at the forefront of such interventions .
In February Singapore 's government raised down - payment requirements and imposed stamp duties on all residential properties sold within a year of purchase in a bid to curb speculation .
Despite these steps prices in the island nation rose by nearly 40 % in the year to the end of the second quarter , after a rise of just over 25 % in the year to the end of the first quarter .
Singapore has overtaken Hong Kong to become the frothiest housing market among those we monitor .
House prices in Australia rose by 20 % in the year to the end of the first quarter , faster than the 13.5 % recorded in the 12 months to late 2009 .
More concerning , however , is our analysis of “ fair value ” in housing , which is based on comparing the current ratio of house prices to rents with its long - term average .
By this measure Australian property is the most overvalued of any of the 20 countries we track .
A frothy property market was one of the reasons for the Reserve Bank of Australia raising interest rates six times between October and May .
Since then , the bank has become more sanguine about the state of the market .
It cited “ some signs that the earlier buoyancy in the housing market was easing ” when keeping interest rates on hold in June .
China 's property - cooling measures , meanwhile , which were similar to Singapore 's , were announced in April .
Our house - price figures for China now extend to the end of May .
They help explain why the Chinese government had become more concerned .
Year - on - year house - price inflation peaked in April at 12.8 % , but has since moderated a bit .

The prospect that house prices in China are about to fall sharply worries some .
Kenneth Rogoff , a Harvard professor , said this week : “ You 're starting to see that collapse in property and it 's going to hit the banking system . ”
But Sun Mingchun , chief economist for China at Nomura , an investment bank , reckons that high down - payment requirements and the preponderance of cash purchases by Chinese homebuyers will help to limit the effects of any falls on the real economy .
For America the balance of evidence points to a renewed housing slowdown .
Although both the Case - Shiller national and ten -city indices are up year - on - year , the national index fell during the three months to the end of March .
The FHFA index , which excludes houses that are financed with large mortgages , was still down compared with a year earlier .
More recent home - sales data have been similarly downbeat .
Sales of new homes declined by 33 % from April to May , thanks to the expiry of a tax credit .
Just 28,000 new units were sold during May , the lowest total on record for that month .
In Asia policymakers are trying to prick a bubble .
In America they are still dealing with the consequences of the last one .
Pornography will have its own top - level domain , dot - XXX , the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers decided Friday .
The proposal was made under ICANN 's rules for " sponsored " TLDs , through which domains have been created by interest groups including the aeronautical industry ( dot- aero ) and the cooperative movement ( dot- coop ) .
ICM Registry , the company that proposed the dot - XXX domain , welcomed the vote .
" It 's been a long time coming , " ICM Chairman Stuart Lawley said in a statement , adding that he is " excited " by the move .
" The decision should soon bring to fruition our six - year effort to create a specific Web address for online adult entertainment , and comes on the heels of an independent review that declared that ICANN 's previous decision to deny dot - xxx was wrong , " he said .
ICM Registry says it is a " completely independent entity with no affiliation , current or historic , with the adult entertainment industry . "
That claim of independence gave ICANN board member Rita Rodin Johnston pause for thought .
" I still question whether , in fact , there is a real sponsored community here , " she said in the board - meeting debate before the vote .
However , she went on to vote in favor of the new domain , saying that despite her personal reservations about the proposal , she felt obliged to by ICANN 's decision - making process .
" It really does n't matter what I think .
What 's important is that ICANN has a process that it set up and the process came back and said that sponsorship criterion was met , and that this board has the courage to follow that criterion , " she said .
Dot -XXX domains wo n't start appearing right away .
ICANN must first conduct a " due diligence " study of ICM 's business plan for the domain , and then the board will review the contract proposed for the operation of the domain .
That may involve referring the matter to ICANN 's Governmental Advisory Committee , which is next scheduled to meet in December in Colombia , said board member Bruce Tonkin .
" There is a potential that this is a prolonged process , " he said .
ICANN has considered introducing a top - level domain reserved for adult - oriented Web sites before .
It failed to reach a decision on the current proposal at a meeting in Nairobi , Kenya , in March , and rejected similar proposals in May 2006 and March 2007 .
Dot -XXX and another supported by ICM , dot - kids , were among a long list of TLDs rejected by ICANN in 2000 .
Friday 's vote was not unanimously in favor of creating the dot- XXX domain : ICANN CEO Rod Beckstrom and fellow board member Jean - Jacques Subrenat both abstained .
In a statement after the vote , Beckstrom explained his abstention , expressing doubts about the advice the board had been given on the project .
" While I accept the contribution to ICANN 's accountability and transparency provided by the existence and the use of the independent panel review process , I am nonetheless concerned about the determination by two of the three panelists that the ICANN board should not use business judgment in the conduct of its affairs .
In my view as CEO , the board must be able to use business judgment in order to protect the global public interest in the coordination of the root of the Internet and the domain name system , " he said .
Subrenat , a French academic and former diplomat , did not give a reason for his abstention , but explained at length that it was " estabished on an informed basis with all due care , in good faith , in the honest belief that it is in the interests of the corporation of which I am a member of the board , " and that it was " consistent with the dispositions of Article VI , Section 23 of the ICANN bylaws . "
That article merely notes that board members are presumed to concur with any decisions taken at meetings they attend , unless they abstain or vote against .

China to become world 's top manufacturer , ending America 's 110 - year reign
China is poised to become the world 's biggest manufacturer , ending America ’s 110 - year reign as the leading producer of goods .
Figures compiled by U.S economists reveal that America will drop to second place by 2011 .
By then China will be responsible for a fifth of all the goods manufactured worldwide .
Productive : Chinese workers make a fifth of all goods manufactured worldwide
Electrical machinery and equipment , clothes , footwear and furniture make up the most in demand items from consumers worldwide .
Toys and plastic items are also among the most in demand goods from a nation that has seen its exports quadruple in size over the last nine years .
Faster growth in China as the US emerges from its worst economic recession since the 1930s will see China take the top spot next year .
America has held the position as the world 's top manufacturer since the late 1890s when it nudged Britain into the number two position .
Britain now ranks seventh the world 's manufacturing league with economists warning that position is under threat from emerging nations .
Last year the UK produced goods worth $ 227 billion , just $ 13 billion ahead of South Korea and $ 20 billion in front of Russia .
The UK was responsible for 2.6 per cent of world manufacturing output , down from 5.5 per cent in 1980 .
Economists with the IHS Global Insight consultancy said China 's march to the top manufacturer has been expected .
Last year the country exported goods estimated at $ 1.7 trillion .
Pre-eminence : Henry Ford 's Model T car enhanced America 's reign as top producer
Eighty per cent of the exports were manufactured in factories .
Economists with the experts admitted they were surprised the US had managed to maintain its pole position for so long .
IHS had predicted America would lose its manufacturing crown in 2009 .
But a surprisingly strong output in 2009 kept China from claiming the top spot .
America produced goods valued at $ 1.717 billion while China 's outpout was $ 1,608 billion .
Economist Hal Sirkin , head of the global operations practice at the Boston Consulting Group , said the US should not worry about losing out to China .
" If you have a country with four times the population of the U.S. and a tenth of the wages , it is fairly obvious they will pull ahead at some time in productive capabilities , " he said .
Figures from the U.S. - China Business Council reveal how in nine years the amount of goods imported from China has tripled in size .
In 2000 the value of goods imported was at $ 100 billion but by 2009 that figure was at $ 296 billion .
In comparison the U.S. exported $ 69 billion worth of goods to China , mostly supplying raw materials , auto parts and electrical machinery .
Over - the - counter headache pill paracetamol , also known as acetaminophen , reduces the pain of social rejection according to a new study just published in Psychological Science .
Based on past findings of an overlap between the brain circuits involved in physical pain and those involved in feeling rejected , the researchers wondered whether painkillers would also ease emotional distress stemming from exclusion .
Not all painkillers work the same though : some work by numbing the local nerves – like benzocaine - based sort throat lozenges that make your mouth go numb , while others affect the brain systems that process pain no matter where it originates from in the body .
Paracetamol is largely of the second type meaning if social rejection and physical pain really do share some of the same brain circuits , the drug should dull the hurt from both .
To test this out , the researchers recruited a group of healthy students and asked them to take a pill every day for three weeks : half got placebo while the other half were given paracetamol , although they did n’t know which they were taking .
Each evening the participants were asked to complete a standard questionnaire that asked about if they ’d experienced hurt feelings or social exclusion during the day .
While both groups started out reporting the same levels of hurt feelings , by the end of the three weeks , those taking paracetamol reported significantly less .
The second experiment of the study was similar but instead of filling in questionnaires the participants were asked to take part in a brain scanning experiment at the end of the three weeks .
Inside the scanner , they were asked to take part in a video game that involved tossing a virtual ball between players who they thought were human opponents .
In reality , all the other moves were controlled by a computer programme that was preset to start excluding them from the game by not passing the ball to them .
The game was used in previous research and helped establish that brain activity in social rejection and physical pain overlapped .
The same overlap occurred in this new study , but the brain areas most linked to both physical and social pain – the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula – were less active in those who had been taking paracetamol for three weeks .
Those same participants also rated themselves as feeling less rejected on a brief post - game questionnaire than participants who had been taking placebo .
It ’s an intriguing finding because it suggests that a common and cheap painkiller might be useful in reducing feelings of social rejection which can feature prominently in conditions like depression and borderline personality disorder .
If this was a brand new drug , you can bet the pharmaceutical industry would be jumping up and down with glee at these findings and would already be planning trials to see if it works as a useful treatment .
But because paracetamol is so old it ca n’t be patented and so there is virtually no profit to be made from it .
Unfortunately , paracetemol can be toxic if taken too often , but it would be interesting to see if anyone does take up the baton to see if it might be a useful psychiatric treatment in appropriate doses .

Is the Israel lobby out of touch with America today ?
Or is this just the charm offensive for President Obama ?
Here ’s an ad that the lobby group FLAME ( Facts & Logic About the Middle East ) is running in at least one Jewish newspaper and that is on the group ’s website , too : an answer to the question , " Israel : An Apartheid State ?
Is there any truth at all in this oft - repeated calumny ? "
Excerpt :
Israel has granted permanent residence and full citizen rights to a large number of legal and illegal foreign workers and their families – from the Philippines , Eritrea , Colombia , Nigeria , and from many other countries .
Nobody , of course , is forced or requested to convert to Judaism as a condition of their being allowed to stay .
Israel has accepted a shipload of Vietnamese refugees who had sought asylum .
No Arab country has accepted a single one of those refugees .
Israel has brought in about 70,000 black Ethiopian Jews , who despite their backwardness have become fully integrated citizens of Israel .
Everything that Blacks were not allowed to do in South Africa is totally open to non-Jews in Israel .
Is this how the Israel lobby works , by employing racist stereotypes ?
Also , what about Blacks with a capital B ? Sounds very officially racial …
A friend saw it in J Weekly of Northern California , a relatively progressive Jewish news magazine .
Progressive .
Is there any truth to that oft - repeated claim ?

The power of prayer : a practical exercise for religious people .
Warning : this exercise is only for non-atheists .
Atheists should abstain as this wo n't work for them because of lack of faith .
This exercise is meant for religious people , to demonstrate the power of prayer .
If you 're a religious person and you are an adult , you surely have children .
Because you are heterosexual .
You have more than one .
Because you only have sex to further god 's purpose , which is to populate the earth with more religious people .
For this exercise we 'll need two children .
Take two ( 2 ) of your children ( their age does n't matter ) and break an arm ( 1 ) of each .
Use a hammer .
Take child A to an hospital and let it be treated by doctors .
Whatever you do : do n't pray for it .
If you can't help yourself , pray something like : " Oh lord , do n't heal this child . "
Take child B and lay it on a couch or a bed .
Gather your spouse and any other children you might have and start praying for it .
Pray that its arm may be healed in the name of Jesus .
Make it count .
Do n't hesitate to wail a bit .
It says in the bible that whatever you ask for you shall be given .
And the bible tells the truth .
Always .
Literally .
Jesus himself confirmed this .
You can command mountains .
Healing a broken arm is peanuts in comparison .
And Jesus would n't lie , now would he ?
Of course not .
Have faith .
Pray .
Pray .
Pray .
Notice how those stupid doctors have put a plaster cast around child A's broken arm .
Notice how uncomfortable that is .
Notice how they make it take all kinds of pills .
Notice how they give it injections with antibiotics .
Notice how that hurts .
Notice how child B's wound begins to smell a bit putrefied .
Notice how gangrene sets in .
Do n't worry .
Do n't panic .
This is just god testing your faith .
Rejoice .
Your faith is strong .
Invite your neighbors to come and pray with you .
Have faith .
Pray .
Try not to look too triumphant when you see child A struggling , while it tries to operate a computer and surf the net , with that awful cast hampering its every movement .
Try not to be upset by the howls of pain of child B . Just invite your congregation ( yes , the whole congregation ) over to your house to pray with you , your family and your neighbors .
Pray loudly .
Go all out .
Come on , give it some oomph .
You need to draw the lord 's attention .
He might be getting slightly hard of hearing by now or maybe he is otherwise engaged and he can't be everywhere at the same time , can he ?
Wait .
Yes , he can .
Anyhow , it will also drown out child B's anguished cries .
At the funeral of child B mock child A because its cast is itching .
While in prison for child neglect wonder why child A does n't come to visit you but prefers playing basketball with its friends instead .
How ungrateful .
However , god is always with you .
Marvel over god 's kindness .
Realize how good the lord is .
Understand that child B would have died anyway .
Whether you broke its arm or not .
Whether you took it to a stupid hospital or not .
It was his will .
There are several possibilities .
Maybe he has called child B to him because it is so precious to him .
In that case it is now sitting at his right hand , watching over you , its loving parent .
Maybe child B was an evil child and did n't deserve to be rescued .
In that case it is now in hell and will burn forever and ever and ever .
As it deserves .
For being evil .
Realize you are an insignificant worm who can't understand the lord 's purpose .
Prayer works .
It says so in the bible .
And everything in the bible is the literal truth .
If this were n't the case you could n't trust anything that is in the bible , could you ?
That would be just absurd .
Prayer works .
Jesus says so .
And Jesus would n't lie to you , would he ?
Of course he would n't .
He loves you .
Pray .
It always works .
Pray .

Take two ( 2 ) of your children ( their age does n't matter ) and break an arm ( 1 ) of each .
Use a hammer .
Take child A to an hospital and let it be treated by doctors .
Whatever you do : do n't pray for it .
If you can't help yourself , pray something like : " Oh lord , do n't heal this child .
" Take child B and lay it on a couch or a bed .
Gather your spouse and any other children you might have and start praying for it .
Pray that its arm may be healed in the name of Jesus .
Make it count .
Do n't hesitate to wail a bit .
It says in the bible that whatever you ask for you shall be given .
And the bible tells the truth .
Always .
Literally .
Jesus himself confirmed this .
You can command mountains .
Healing a broken arm is peanuts in comparison .
And Jesus would n't lie , now would he ?
Of course not .
Have faith .
Pray .
Pray .
Pray .
Notice how those stupid doctors have put a plaster cast around child A's broken arm .
Notice how uncomfortable that is .
Notice how they make it take all kinds of pills .
Notice how they give it injections with antibiotics .
Notice how that hurts .
Notice how child B's wound begins to smell a bit putrefied .
Notice how gangrene sets in .
Do n't worry .
Do n't panic .
This is just god testing your faith .
Rejoice .
Your faith is strong .
Invite your neighbors to come and pray with you .
Have faith .
Pray .
Try not to look too triumphant when you see child A struggling , while it tries to operate a computer and surf the net , with that awful cast hampering its every movement .
Try not to be upset by the howls of pain of child B . Just invite your congregation ( yes , the whole congregation ) over to your house to pray with you , your family and your neighbors .
Pray loudly .
Go all out .
Come on , give it some oomph .
You need to draw the lord 's attention .
He might be getting slightly hard of hearing by now or maybe he is otherwise engaged and he can't be everywhere at the same time , can he ?
Wait .
Yes , he can .
Anyhow , it will also drown out child B's anguished cries .
At the funeral of child B mock child A because its cast is itching .
While in prison for child neglect wonder why child A does n't come to visit you but prefers playing basketball with its friends instead .
How ungrateful .
However , god is always with you .
Marvel over god 's kindness .
Realize how good the lord is .
Understand that child B would have died anyway .
Whether you broke its arm or not .
Whether you took it to a stupid hospital or not .
It was his will .
There are several possibilities .
Maybe he has called child B to him because it is so precious to him .
In that case it is now sitting at his right hand , watching over you , its loving parent .
Maybe child B was an evil child and did n't deserve to be rescued .
In that case it is now in hell and will burn forever and ever and ever .
As it deserves .
For being evil .
Realize you are an insignificant worm who can't understand the lord 's purpose .
Prayer works .
It says so in the bible .
And everything in the bible is the literal truth .
If this were n't the case you could n't trust anything that is in the bible , could you ?
That would be just absurd .
Prayer works .
Jesus says so .
And Jesus would n't lie to you , would he ?
Of course he would n't .
He loves you .
Pray .
It always works .
Pray .
( Also works great in case of a major oil spill according to Oil Spill Prayer and governor Bob Riley of Alabama .
He is no idiot , is he ? )

While many smartphones have features that auto - complete words , correct typos on the fly and add punctuation , Mr. Kushler is aiming for the next level .
“ We ’ve squeezed the desktop computer , complete with keyboard and mouse , into something that fits in a pocket .
The information bandwidth has become very constricted , ” he said .
“ I thought , if we can find a better way to input that information , it could be something that would really take off . ”
Mr. Kushler says
Swype is a big breakthrough that could reach billions of people .
That ’s not as ambitious as it sounds .
To date , the T9 technology has been built into more than four billion devices worldwide .
In 1999 its creators sold it to AOL for a reported $ 350 million ; it is now owned by the speech - recognition company Nuance .
Swype ’s software detects where a finger pauses and changes direction as it traces out the pattern of a word .
The movements do not have to be precise because the software calculates which words a user is most likely trying to spell .
Capitalization and double letters can be indicated with a pause or squiggle , while spacing and punctuation are automatic .
Mr. Kushler , who is chief technology officer of Swype , estimates that the software can improve even the nimblest text - messager ’s pace by 20 to 30 percent .
The downside of being pope : When Pope Cardinal Ratguts went in that hat shop , presumably accompanied by a few flunky bishops and monsignors , and decided to try on the red cowboy hat , there was nobody there to say , " No , Holy Father , unless you 're planning to work up an act playing the guitar and singing faith - themed Roy Rogers and Gene Autry songs , I do n't think it 's you . "
-- Australian bishop emeritus Geoffrey Robinson , quoted
by the NYT's Laurie Goodstein and David M. Halbfinger
in " Church Office Failed to Act on Abuse Scandal "
[ T ]he future pope , it is now clear , was also part of a culture of nonresponsibility , denial , legalistic foot - dragging and outright obstruction .
More than any top Vatican official other than John Paul , it was Cardinal Ratzinger who might have taken decisive action in the 1990s to prevent the scandal from metastasizing in country after country , growing to such proportions that it now threatens to consume his own papacy .
[ C] hurch documents and interviews with canon lawyers and bishops cast that 2001 decision and the future pope ’s track record in a new and less flattering light .
The Vatican took action only after bishops from English - speaking nations became so concerned about resistance from top church officials that the Vatican convened a secret meeting to hear their complaints -- an extraordinary example of prelates from across the globe collectively pressing their superiors for reform , and one that had not previously been revealed .
And the policy that resulted from that meeting , in contrast to the way it has been described by the Vatican , was not a sharp break with past practices .
It was mainly a belated reaffirmation of longstanding church procedures that at least one bishop attending the meeting argued had been ignored for too long , according to church documents and interviews .
The office led by Cardinal Ratzinger , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , had actually been given authority over sexual abuse cases nearly 80 years earlier , in 1922 , documents show and canon lawyers confirm .
But for the two decades he was in charge of that office , the future pope never asserted that authority , failing to act even as the cases undermined the church ’s credibility in the United States , Australia , Ireland and elsewhere .
[ Emphasis added . ]

Bishops had a variety of disciplinary tools at their disposal -- including the power to remove accused priests from contact with children and to suspend them from ministry altogether -- that they could use without the Vatican ’s direct approval .
Some used this authority to sideline abusive priests , minimizing the damage inflicted on their victims .
Other bishops clearly made things worse , by shuffling abusers from one assignment to the next , never telling parishioners or reporting priests to the police .
But as court cases , financial settlements and media coverage mounted , many prelates looked to the Vatican for leadership and clarity on how to prosecute abusers under canon law and when to bring cases to the attention of the civil authorities .
In the worst cases , involving serial offenders who denied culpability and resisted discipline , some bishops sought the Vatican ’s guidance on how to dismiss them from the priesthood .
During this period , the three dozen staff members working for Cardinal Ratzinger at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith were busy pursuing other problems .
These included examining supernatural phenomena , like apparitions of the Virgin Mary , so that hoaxes did not “ corrupt the faith , ” according to the Rev. Brian Mulcahy , a former member of the staff .
Other sections weighed requests by divorced Catholics to remarry and vetted the applications of former priests who wanted to be reinstated .
The heart of the office , though , was its doctrinal section .
Cardinal Ratzinger , a German theologian appointed prefect of the congregation in 1981 , aimed his renowned intellectual firepower at what he saw as “ a fundamental threat to the faith of the church ” — the liberation theology movement sweeping across Latin America .
As Father [ Gilbert ]
Gauthé [ the honorary godfather of the priest abuse scandal , having in 1984 acknowledged molesting 37 minors ] was being prosecuted in Louisiana , Cardinal Ratzinger was publicly disciplining priests in Brazil and Peru for preaching that the church should work to empower the poor and oppressed , which the cardinal saw as a Marxist - inspired distortion of church doctrine .
Later , he also reined in a Dutch theologian who thought lay people should be able to perform priestly functions , and an American who taught that Catholics could dissent from church teachings about abortion , birth control , divorce and homosexuality .
Different Focus for Cardinal
Cardinal Ratzinger also focused on reining in national bishops ’ conferences , several of which , independent of Rome , had begun confronting the sexual abuse crisis and devising policies to address it in their countries .
He declared that such conferences had “ no theological basis ” and “ do not belong to the structure of the church . ”
Individual bishops , he reaffirmed , reigned supreme in their dioceses and reported only to the authority of the pope in Rome .
[ Do n't you just love that part about individual bishops reigning supreme in their dioceses ?
Not only does this negate the hated bishops ' conferences , but it is , I believe , what 's known in technical terms as a " papal get - out - of - jail - free card . "
See , it 's not our fault ; it 's those damned bishops ' fault !
Individual bishops , it would be more accurate to say , are free to run their dioceses exactly as they see fit as long as how they see fit is exactly how their Vatican masters wish . ]
the sainted Pope John Paul II .
Which already suggests how the scandal came to light first in the English - speaking world .
This tends to be the part of the Catholic world where doubts about the divinity of the Vatican princesses have gained the most traction .
And ( again by all accounts ) , the overriding goal of John Paul II 's papacy was to eradicate all that blasphemy , to return the Church to a state of unitary and unquestioned " truth " : what the pope says .
This of course is the way any authoritarian government or large bureacracy can be expected to react .
And that , I think , is a major reason why the Vatican 's astonishing bungling of the scandal holds such fascination for the non-Catholic world :
It 's a sort of cartoon version of the way pretty much all persons in authority seem instinctively to want to function .
They 're attacking the church was the sainted sleaze - pope 's response , and his sleaze - successor was only recently caught saying -- in the 21st century , some three decades into the scandal ! -- the same damned thing .
Of course there 's another reason why the non-Catholic world is riveted by the scandal .
It is , after all , about priests for Christ 's sake sexually abusing minors , while the people in charge fucking look the other way .
Naturally this has a lot of Catholics pretty riled up too .
Which is a point Howie has been making in his coverage of the unholy mess .
If you look at the history of priest - parishioner relationships , it 's hard not to conclude that the Vatican princesses have effectively written those young Catholics off as " booty " for priests whose livelihood depends on the hierarchy .
Despite the Church 's legendary wealth ( such a jarring contrast to the poverty of its worshippers in so many parts of the world ) , its field workers are compensated on a shoestring budget .
And remember that the job description , increasingly improbably in this day and age , includes the appearance of celibacy .
Somewhere along the line the deal apparently came to include , implicitly , all the Catholic boy - ass you can grab .
Now there 's a perk you truly can't put a price on .
You wonder if princesses of the rigidly authoritarian mindset of this pope and his predecessor , so desperately concerned with shoring up the unquestioned authority of the Church hierarchy , notably the highest reaches of that hierarchy , are capable of understanding how much damage they 're doing to that authority among the Catholic laity by telling the faithful , in effect , that their children 's bodies -- and the psyches that are mauled with them -- are fair game for predation by their Church 's hired help .
If you want a good laugh , let 's conclude with the NYT reporters ' conclusion :
Today , a debate is roiling the Vatican , pitting those who see the American zero - tolerance norms as problematic because they lack due process for accused priests , against those who want to change canon law to make it easier to penalize and dismiss priests .
Where Benedict lies on this spectrum , even after nearly three decades of handling abuse cases , is still an open question .
Oh , he 's such a darned stickler for due process , that Pope Cardinal Ratguts !
# And not just for the cardinal .
By all accounts nobody lost more sleep over the heresy of liberation theology and all those other blasphemies being practiced by , in particular , New World churchmen than Cardinal Ratguts ' master , that sleazy son of a bitch , His Eminence himself , Which already suggests how the scandal came to light first in the English - speaking world .
This tends to be the part of the Catholic world where doubts about the divinity of the Vatican princesses have gained the most traction .
And ( again by all accounts ) , the overriding goal of John Paul II 's papacy was to eradicate all that blasphemy , to return the Church to a state of unitary and unquestioned " truth " : This of course is the wayauthoritarian government or large bureacracy can be expected to react .

If you want a good laugh , let 's conclude with the NYT reporters ' conclusion :
Oh , he 's such a darned stickler for due process , that Pope Cardinal Ratguts !
If there was ever any question about the answer to Bishop Robinson 's question , every time anyone delves into the history of the Catholic sex - abuse scandal it becomes clearer that the reason the princesses of the Church did n't do nothin ' ' bout it is -- and Howie has done such a diligent job covering developments in the ongoing Vatican sex - scandal cover - up ( see , most recently , " The Pope Is In SHOCK That Belgians Are n't Paying Due Deference To Priestly Child Rapists " ) that I 've felt little need to chime in .
However , the kinds of " revelations " in the lengthy Goodstein - Halbfinger NYT piece are so rich in irony and predictability that I can't resist .
I do n't mean to denigrate the piece , which looks to be a solid and welcome bit of reporting , the kind of thing the NYT is one of the few papers that has the resources to produce .
But really , it 's hardly possible to imagine any response but laughter , unless it 's yawning , upon being told that , contrary to Pope Cardinal Ratguts ' " reputation as the Vatican insider who most clearly recognized the threat the spreading sexual abuse scandals posed to the Roman Catholic Church , " he was to all intents and purposes , if not the mastermind , then at least theof the cover - up : Gasp !
Who 'd - a thunk it ?
One simple but pungent discovery the NYT reporters made is that what the Vatican claims as a major turning point in its protracted ( mis ) handling of the sex - abuse problem , " the decision in 2001 to give the office led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger the authority to cut through a morass of bureaucracy and handle abuse cases directly , " was a sham .
It 's one of the fascinations of the scandal that it broke first in the English - speaking countries .
I 'm sure somebody can explain the " cultural differences " that account for this .
But one thing that surely never figured into it was that thewas confined to these countries , though of course the princesses of the Church liked to pretend that such was the case .
Now that Old World priests are catching up , not in committing abuse but in having their indiscretions made public , the official response is , asmight have put it : " Hummina - hummina - hummina .
" And as the NYT duo 's reporting underlines , the Vatican 's response hasbeen to muddle , obscure , and obfuscate .
It turns out that from the start of the scandal there were bishops " who sought to penalize and dismiss abusive priests , " but they could n't do it on their own .
" Dismissing a priest is not like disbarring a lawyer or stripping a doctor of his medical license .
In Catholic theology , ordaining a priest creates an indelible mark ; to return him to the lay state required the approval of the pope .
" Those bishops -- you know , the ones who actually assumed some responsibility for doing their job , not to mention for protecting their parishioners -- got as little help as the princesses could possibly get away with giving , or maybe .
One nifty trick :
The Vatican made sure there were enough overlapping jurisdictions ( " besides Cardinal Ratzinger ’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , bishops were sending off their files on abuse cases to the Congregations for the Clergy , for Bishops , for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments , and for the Evangelization of Peoples -- plus the Vatican ’s Secretariat of State ; its appeals court , the Apostolic Signatura ; and the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts " ) to create maximum confusion .
The NYT duo also points out that the " new Code of Canon Law issued in 1983 only muddled things further , among other things by setting a five - year statute of limitations within which abuse cases could be prosecuted . "
Way to go , abuse ferret - outers !
Why ?
Well , here 's one answer .
See if you can spot the magic words .
That 's right , ladies and germs , if you said " , " you 're a winner !
I was going to take out that typographical slug " Different Focus for Cardinal , " which after all is n't really part of the text .
But then I got to thinking , " ' Different Focus for Cardinal " is absolutely the point !

Foursquare is fast - approaching 1.6 million members and has just released CNN World Cup badges .
These interesting tidbits were revealed today when Foursquare Co-founder Dennis Crowley took the stage at the Mashable Media Summit to field questions from our Editor - in - Chief , Adam Ostrow .
The question - and - answer interview spanned a variety of topics including revenue potential , growth and future plans for the service .
We 've embedded the entire interview below and have also extracted some of the key points and big reveals .
Badge Rewards
Perhaps the biggest news — apart from the impressive growth metrics — is that Foursquare is addressing badge fatigue by experimenting with adding value to badges — which Crowley describes as " digital candy . "
Crowley used Internet Week as an example , stating that users who check - in at an Internet Week venue will unlock a special badge .
That badge — when presented to bouncers — will guarantee users priority entrance into some Internet Week parties and events .
Foursquare already makes it possible for businesses to offer specials around mayorships or checkins , but the badge rewards system could be the equivalent to a modern day VIP program .
The company is still testing the concept , but there 's obviously huge potential here .
CNN World Cup Badges
CNN and Foursquare have joined forces to release two CNN World Cup badges : South Africa Explorer and Super Fan .
Foursquare users who follow CNN can only unlock the South Africa Exloper badge by actually venturing to South Africa to attend the World Cup .
The rest of us , however , can grab the Super Fan badge by checking in to World Cup viewing parties and soccer - friendly pubs .
Some of the more than 100 badge - eligible venues will also be seeded with tips from CNN staffers .
Revenue Potential and the Future
As discussed above , Crowley mentioned that Foursquare is closing in on 1.6 million users .
While Crowley appears genuinely surprised by user adoption , the rapid rise in members and checkin acceleration over the past year , he also does n't believe growth will slow anytime soon .
The future for Foursquare will be defined by adding more value to service , which Crowley says will happen through more partnerships and more sophisticated features .
The hope is that the company can engineer ways to encourage interactions between users who are checked - in to the same venue .
In terms of revenue , Crowley says that company is generating money and that it 's helped to offset expansion costs .
He also sees a myriad of monetization opportunities , but did make it a point to state that they are not profitable , and that profitability is not something Foursquare is focused on right now .
To that end , we expect the startup to reveal funding news in the near future , especially given that Crowley insinuated as much during the interview .

Winning The War Against the American Dream
making people
suffer
As we watch this legislative sausage slowly crumble , I would hope that President Obama will take his economic agenda to the American people ...
The country needs to be instructed about the logic and necessity of this stimulus plan because they clearly do n't fully understand it .
And because of that , the Republicans are making headway with their rhetoric of " fiscal responsibility , " conflating stimulus with bailouts and the rest of their destructive obstructionism .
Despite his huge personal approval , Obama did n't start off with a lot of public support for the plan and support is inching down .
He is asking for a huge amount of money and the promise of bipartisanship is not working out .
I think it would be helpful if he explained what a stimulus is and why this plan will succeed .
People want him to succeed and they will back him if he makes the explicit case and give the plan some time to work if he asks them for it .
Not having congressional Republicans on the team wo n't matter if the American people stay behind him .
But if he continues to make bipartisanship the test of the plan 's success or failure , it really could fail whether it passes or not .
One of the main components of the success of the plan is its ability to inspire confidence and the Republicans , the Blue Dogs and their friends in the media are doing everything they can to ensure that Americans believe it wo n't work .
Big Tent Democrat reminds us that today is FDRs birthday and he excerpts one of his famous speeches to rally the country in 1932 .
This is the kind of thing that may be what Americans need to hear from their new president today as well :
It is well within the inventive capacity of man , who has built up this great social and economic machine capable of satisfying the wants of all , to insure that all who are willing and able to work receive from it at least the necessities of life .
In such a system , the reward for a day 's work will have to be greater , on the average , than it has been , and the reward to capital , especially capital which is speculative , will have to be less .
But I believe that after the experience of the last three years , the average citizen would rather receive a smaller return upon his savings in return for greater security for the principal , than experience for a moment the thrill or the prospect of being a millionaire only to find the next moment that his fortune , actual or expected , has withered in his hand because the economic machine has again broken down .
It is toward that objective that we must move if we are to profit by our recent experiences .
Probably few will disagree that the goal is desirable .
Yet many , of faint heart , fearful of change , sitting tightly on the roof - tops in the flood , will sternly resist striking out for it , lest they fail to attain it .
Even among those who are ready to attempt the journey there will be violent differences of opinion as to how it should be made .
So complex , so widely distributed over our whole society are the problems which confront us that men and women of common aim do not agree upon the method of attacking them .
Such disagreement leads to doing nothing , to drifting .
Agreement may come too late .
Let us not confuse objectives with methods .
Too many so - called leaders of the Nation fail to see the forest because of the trees .
Too many of them fail to recognize the vital necessity of planning for definite objectives .
True leadership calls for the setting forth of the objectives and the rallying of public opinion in support of these objectives .
Do not confuse objectives with methods .
When the Nation becomes substantially united in favor of planning the broad objectives of civilization , then true leadership must unite thought behind definite methods .
The country needs and , unless I mistake its temper , the country demands bold , persistent experimentation .
It is common sense to take a method and try it :
If it fails , admit it frankly and try another .
But above all , try something .
The millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the things to satisfy their needs are within easy reach .
We need enthusiasm , imagination and the ability to face facts , even unpleasant ones , bravely .
We need to correct , by drastic means if necessary , the faults in our economic system from which we now suffer .
We need the courage of the young .
Yours is not the task of making your way in the world , but the task of remaking the world which you will find before you .
May every one of us be granted the courage , the faith and the vision to give the best that is in us to that remaking !
If Obama could make a speech like that then the Democrats ( if they could rouse themselves to do it ) could go out and say that the tired program of tax cuts for everything is one of those things that has " failed and we should admit it . "
Right now , I 'm seeing the conservatives win the rhetorical war , at least among the elites ...
On MSNBC this morning we had a segment with Mort Zuckerman arguing that the stimulus bill needs to have more tax cuts , Governor Mark Sanford ( R ) arguing for less spending and Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia University worrying about deficits .
That 's the state of the debate at this moment and nowhere in it does anyone make the case that stimulus simply means that the government needs to spend a lot of money to put people to work and that those jobs should be in places where the taxpayers would get their money 's worth by either fixing long neglected infrastructure and education needs , create new ( green ) jobs for the future , or to provide services for people who are suffering during this recession .
Stimulating demand is part of that , but since , as the Republicans themselves admit , the tax rebates and tax cuts of the past few years have n't worked --- we need to go to the mattresses and inject money directly into the economy .
A huge government spending program is a blunt instrument , but it 's the only one we we have left .
You will not see the kind of start - ups because of the state of the economy , because of the policies that are coming out of the more taxes and more spending , which get to the Tax Extenders Package that 's before us today .
And that is my concern with the detachment that we have between what is happening in America on Main Street and what 's happening here in Washington DC and the Us Senate .
Madam president there is n't that reality check and that 's obviously exemplified by by the kind of legislation that we 're trying to ram through the congress once again .
That means more taxes and more spending that 's going to cost more jobs .
It 's going to provide more risk in the economy and therefore we 're not going to see the kind of economic growth the American people deserve .
And somehow we think that is not a cause and effect or a correlation between what we do here and what happens across America .
O know that in talking to my constituents and to small business owners I hear it day in and day out .
I go home and I talk to them and I listen more importantly and I hear what they 're saying and they are uniformly saying the same thing : that the policies coming out of Washington causes them great pause , it causes them alarm .
Today I receive my last unemployment check .
I 've used up all available extensions .
My position was eliminated on Feb. 1 , 2009 .
Since then I 've diligently searched for work .
I have a MA and 23 years experience .
I 've had three interviews and no offers .
My savings , including retirement , is gone .
I had to sell my house .
I 've moved from Michigan to Massachusetts into the home of my parents , who at 81 and 71 live on their investments ( which have been dwindling in this economy . )
At a time when I should be getting ready for my retirement and taking care of my parents , I 'm back at square one .
This is certainly not where I had planned to be .
This is certainly not the American dream I was raised to believe in , one whose premise is that if you work hard , get a good education , you will succeed .
General Petraeus , while intimately familiar with Afghanistan and its myriad problems , is inheriting direct command at a particularly fraught moment .
Seven months into President Obama ’s surge of forces , there is little evidence that the addition of tens of thousands of troops has beaten back the Taliban , or that Mr. Karzai ’s government will soon be able to hold and administer territory the United States helps it retake .
Mr. Obama admitted as much indirectly on Wednesday in the Rose Garden when he said : “ We have a clear goal .
We are going to break the Taliban ’s momentum . ”
They were the same words he used seven months ago at West Point in announcing the surge , and as one senior official said , “ The president was acknowledging that a third of the way into the surge , the momentum has not been broken . ”
One senior administration official noted that General McChrystal and Mr. Karzai “ just came off the most constructive week we ’ve had in a while with Karzai ” when the two men traveled through Kandahar , the site of the next big counterinsurgency push .
General McChrystal reported back that Mr. Karzai finally seemed deeply engaged in the details of the effort to regain control over the sprawling city , one of the Taliban ’s home bases , administration officials said .
General Petraeus will now be responsible for executing the Kandahar offensive into the spiritual heart of the Taliban .
White House and Congressional officials say they expect he will be confirmed quickly  probably by the end of next week .
General McChrystal had already prepared his brief resignation letter when he walked into the meeting with Mr. Obama ; he left quickly afterward , saying nothing to the reporters who converged near him .
Relieved of his post , he did not attend a regularly scheduled National Security Council meeting that included all the same administration officials whom he or his staff disparaged in the article .
“ I welcome debate , but I wo n’t tolerate division , ” the president said afterward .
He said that it was crucial for American troops and military officers to observe a “ strict adherence to the military chain of command and respect for civilian control over that chain of command . ”
In the Rolling Stone article , General McChrystal and his aides belittled many of their civilian counterparts on the Afghanistan strategy team .

America 's Pacific Northwest has a 37 % chance of being hit by a magnitude 8 or larger earthquake in the next 50 years , a new study shows .
That 's more than double previous estimates of a 10 - 15 % risk , says Chris Goldfinger , a marine geologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis .
In a monograph1 soon to be published by the US Geological Survey , Goldfinger and colleagues examined more than 80 core samples taken from the seabed between Vancouver Island , in south - western Canada , and Cape Mendocino , in northern California , looking for deposits from submarine landslides triggered by massive earthquakes .
All the sample locations lay near the Cascadia subduction zone , a fault zone some 1,000 kilometres long that runs alongside the northwest American coast not far offshore .
Using a combination of carbon - 14 dating of trapped plankton and geophysical measures of the sediments ' physical and magnetic characteristics , Goldfinger 's team looked for landslides that appeared to have occurred simultaneously in numerous locations .
" If we can link them together , a great earthquake is the most likely cause , " Goldfinger says .
From the team 's findings , he concludes that during the past 10,000 years -- the farthest back that the core samples allow him to peer -- the subduction zone has produced two types of earthquake .
About half -- 19 by Goldfinger 's count -- were megaquakes that rattled the entire region , producing magnitude - 9 tremblers comparable to the one in the Indian Ocean that unleashed a devastating tsunami on 26 December 2004 .
Most of these had been discovered by other studies .
The other type , of which Goldfinger identified 22 , affected only the southern portion of the fault zone , producing earthquakes of around magnitude 8 .
These earthquakes are smaller than the magnitude - 9 megaquakes , but are still uncomfortably large .
" These are similar to what took place in Chile " on 27 February 2010 , he says .
Ticking time bomb
Previous hazard estimates , based on the magnitude - 9 earthquakes , had set the recurrence interval for earthquakes in the region at about 500 years , with a 10 - 15 % chance of another in the next 50 years .
But Goldfinger 's study , by upping the total number of earthquakes to 41 , has cut the average recurrence interval to about 240 years .
The last earthquake on the subduction zone was on 27 January 1700 .
Adding in the new earthquakes , and taking into account the statistical distribution of intervals between them , the next earthquake is overdue , and there 's a 37 % probability it will occur somewhere along the Cascadia fault in the next 50 years .
" Public officials should maybe look at the new numbers and think about this earthquake as a real possibility in the next 50 years , instead of just a remote possibility , " Goldfinger says .
Other researchers have welcomed the work .
" Chris has done a huge labor with lots of cores and worked them up very carefully , " says Brian Atwater , a US Geological Survey geologist based at the University of Washington , Seattle , who has studied tsunami deposits from earthquakes along the northern half of the subduction zone .
" It 's very useful information , " says John Vidale , director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network at the University of Washington .
The US Geological Survey has already convened a workshop this summer for the sole purpose of determining how to incorporate the new findings into earthquake - hazard maps , he says .
He notes , though , that scientists must still work though all of Goldfinger 's data to make sure that all 41 findings do represent earthquakes .

Yesterday we got the good news that Comex will be releasing a Spirit like tool that will make it very easy to jailbreak iPhone 4 , iPhone 3GS ( old / new bootroom ) , iPhone 3G and iPod Touch 2G , iPod Touch 3G on iOS 4 .
We ’ve some more good news for new iPhone 4 users .
MuscleNerd of the iPhone Dev team has just confirmed that they ’re making good progress in unlocking iPhone 4 baseband .
The ‘ baseband ’ is the generic nickname given to the internal components of the iPhone that handle the phone calls and Internet access .
This ‘ baseband ’ is a tiny and unique independent computer system that runs inside your iPhone , it is separate to the main system that handles the applications ( such as email and google maps ) and it talks to the main part of the phone over an internal communications network .
Think of it like a cable modem or other peripheral that is attached to your home PC that needs occasional updates .
When a software update is released and presented to you within iTunes the baseband is sometimes updated ( to fix bugs or add new features ) .
When iPhone 4 was launched , folks at ModMyI had reported that :
The DevTeam and others have been checking through the iPhone 4 , and have noticed the baseband runs a completely different OS than on previous models .
The iPhone 3G and 3G [ S ] both ran Nucleus OS on the PMB8878 baseband CPU ( aka XGold 608 ) , where the iPhone 2G ran the PMB8876 ( aka S - Gold 2 ) .
i Phone 4 uses the PMB9800 , or X - Gold 618 – running a separate OS – ThreadX , an RTOS by ExpressLogic .
We had reported that MuscleNerd and planetbeing of the iPhone Dev team were having fun playing around with iPhone 4 baseband to figure out how to unlock it .
It looks like they ’ve made good progress as MuscleNerd has just tweeted :
Good progress on iPhone4 unlock with @planetbeing : http://is.gd/dh2WE
<- injected cmd ! ( Akin to http://is.gd/dh2Ze on 3G ) Next step is to keep the task backgrounded like we did for 3G / 3GS http://is.gd/dh7Jh.
Backgrounded task is the unlock .
As you can see in the screenshot below , they ’ve managed to run arbitrary code on the iPhone ’s baseband and are a step closer to unlocking iPhone 4 baseband .
MuscleNerd has n’t provided any details about when the tools to unlock iPhone 4 will be available .
But we doubt Dev Team will release them before Apple releases the iPhone software update ( iOS 4.0.1 ) to fix the incorrect reporting of signal strength to address the iPhone 4 reception issues .
As always , we ’ll let you know as soon as we ’ve any further updates .
So stay tuned here at iPhone Hacks or follow us on Twitter or subscribe to our RSS feed .

President Obama wants Congress to spend more money to help states and localities struggling with huge deficits .
But he does not want to call it a stimulus package , apparently .
Mr. Obama has intimated in the past that the federal government ’s job of propping up the economy was not yet done .
Last week , he sent a letter to Congress supporting efforts to pass two separate measures totaling as much as $ 50 billion in aid for states and cities .
With states still facing large budget shortfalls , Obama wants to minimize the potential loss of teachers , law enforcement officers , and firefighters .
He estimates that as many as 300,000 teachers could be laid off .
In this way , the money would largely pick up where the $ 787 billion federal stimulus bill left off .
Yet on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” Sunday , Obama adviser David Axelrod plumbed the depths of the English language in order to try to avoid calling the money a stimulus .
In the end , he conceded : “ We should not be too careless about pulling out of our stimulative efforts too quickly . ”
Mr. Axelrod ’s discomfort is an acknowledgment that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act did not deliver in precisely the way it was promised .
Touted as the only way of keeping unemployment below 10 percent , the unemployment rate tipped 10 percent anyway .
Obama ’s push for more stimulus , however , suggests that the administration believes that the stimulus package blunted the worst of the recession – as the White House has repeatedly argued .
The state and city stimulus is a bid to repeat the process this year for states and localities that cannot run deficits by law .
Critics argue that this tactic has created only the veneer of a recovery .
Jobs numbers released June 4 showed that the vast majority of new jobs were census jobs paid for by the government .
The private sector created only 41,000 jobs – its worst performance since January .
The Obama administration counters that it is better and more economical to keep teachers and police officers in their jobs until the recovery takes hold .
Otherwise , if laid off , they would be a drag on a still - fragile economy .

An initiative from The Open Group has developed a set of key considerations for how to build and measure return on investment ( ROI ) for cloud computing initiatives from a business perspective .
By examining the benefits cloud computing offers organizations and showing the potential return it can provide from the beginning , companies may find it easier to gain buy - in for cloud initiatives from the executive team , as well as the IT department .
Cloud computing has been described as a technological change brought about by the convergence of a number of new and existing technologies .
The promise of cloud computing is identified primarily by the following key technical characteristics :
• The ability to create the illusion of infinite capacity performance is the same if scaled for one or one hundred or one thousand users with consistent service - level characteristics .
• Abstraction of the infrastructure so applications are not locked into devices or locations .
• Pay - as - you - go usage of the IT service ; you only pay for what you use , with no or minimal up - front investment costs .
You typically just use the service through a connection and device .
• Service is on - demand and able to scale up and down with near instant availability .
Typically , no forward planning forecast is required .
• Access to applications and information can be obtained from any access point .
But this is only half the story .
These technical characteristics can also be found in many non-disruptive technology solutions .
What sets the promise of cloud computing apart is that the rate of change , magnitude of cost reduction and specific technical performance impact that cloud computing can provide is not just incremental , but can give a five - to - ten times order of magnitude of improvement .
The Capacity - Utilization Curve
The famous graphic used by Amazon Web Services illustrating the capacity versus utilization curve has become an icon in cloud computing .
The model illustrates the central idea around cloud - based services enabled through an on - demand business provisioning model to meet actual usage .
This model is important to businesses because one of the core precepts of cloud computing is to avoid the cost impact of over - provisioning and under - provisioning of computing resources .
This benefit is in addition to the opportunity for cost , revenue , and margin advantages of business services enabled by rapid deployment of cloud services with low entry cost , as well as the potential to enter and exploit new markets .
We contend that years from now when cloud computing is seen in a historical context , the capacity versus utilization curve will be seen as an iconic model that had the same effect as previous well - known business models , such as Moore 's Law , which , for example , has been seen as a major indicator of microprocessor speed in the computing industry and is now being applied to other industries , such as solar power , to define the rate of efficiency improvements .
8 Ways to Cloud Computing ROI
The problem with using the view of capacity and utilization alone is that it is a technology provider / seller viewpoint essentially based on key performance indicators ( KPIs ) rather than business benefit metrics .
This model is primarily concerned with two specific measurements :
• IT capacity - measured by storage , CPU cycles , network bandwidth or workload memory capacity as indicators of performance .
• IT utilization - measured by uptime availability and volume of usage as indicators of activity and usability .
But effective cost / performance ratios and levels of usage activity do not necessarily imply proportional business benefits .
They are just indicators of business activity that are not in themselves more valuable than lower operating cost .
What is needed instead is a set of business metrics that build on the cloud computing model .
Jonathan Narcisse will file to run for governor as an independent , he confirmed yesterday during campaign stops around the state .
Narcisse had supported Terry Branstad during the 1980s and Chet Culver ’s 2006 gubernatorial campaign , but now believes neither Branstad nor Culver is “ offering solutions . ”
Earlier this year , Narcisse declared that he would challenge Culver in the Democratic primary , but he did not submit signature petitions before the filing deadline .
The hurdle for running as an independent is much lower ; candidates need to collect only 1,500 signatures and file nominating papers by August 13 .
Narcisse has chosen Rick Marlar as his running mate .
Marlar finished third with 12 percent in the Republican primary for Iowa Senate district 45 .
Rod Boshart reported that Narcisse picked Marlar
because they share the same fervor for reform .
Marlar , a truck driver for 30 years and former pilot who logged four years in the submarine service , lives on 40 acres near Wayland and understands rural and farm life , he said .
Narcisse said Marlar reminded him of another truck driver in Iowa who was successful in gubernatorial politics , Ida Grove native Harold Hughes , who was elected governor and served in the U.S. Senate during his political career .
If Marlar wants to stand up to the Republican establishment , he’d be better off running as an independent in Senate district 45 , where Branstad ’s close ally Sandy Greiner won the primary easily with 66 percent of the vote .
Narcisse believes he has a shot if he can get into this fall ’s debates between the gubernatorial candidates .
His campaign strategy :
“ Culver and Branstad are going to wage an unprecedented negative campaign .
They ’re going to just pound each other to a bloody pulp , ” Narcisse predicted .
“ I believe that by the time they get through hammering each other , on Nov. 2 , if Iowans could vote for none of the above that none of the above would beat Branstad and Culver .
So my job now is to become ‘ None Of The Above Narcisse . ’ ”
I do n’t ever remember third - party candidates being invited to the Iowa gubernatorial debates .
If the media include Narcisse , they would have to include others such as Libertarian Eric Cooper and Constitution Party candidate Rick Phillips .
Narcisse will need to raise much more money to run the 99 - county campaign he is planning .
His May campaign disclosure report filed showed $ 3,360 in cash contributions , a $ 5,135 loan , and $ 2,945 cash on hand .
I ’m Mac D’Alessandro , and I ’d like to ask you a question .
Does it bother you that Stephen Lynch voted against health care reform that gave tens of millions of Americans access to health care and will make “ pre-existing condition ” restrictions a thing of the past ?
Does it irritate you that Stephen Lynch voted for the Iraq War and voted to continue funding it ?
Does it anger you that Stephen Lynch supported the Patriot Act and voted to re-authorize it , invading the privacy of law - abiding Americans ?
Does it infuriate you that Stephen Lynch does n’t believe that women should be able to make their own reproductive decisions ?
If so , you might be a Mac :
If you are a Mac , you ’re not alone :
Just 35 percent said that [ incumbent Stephen ]
Lynch deserves re-election , with 33 percent saying it is time for somebody new , and 32 percent not offering an opinion .
I ’m running for Congress because , like you , I ’m frustrated with the slow pace at which we ’re realizing the changes promised in 2008 .
I ’m running because I want Democrats to act like Democrats rather than obstruct the agenda for change and progress .

Gemini Observatory Press Release
For Immediate Release – June 29 , 2010 9:00 am EDT / Chile

A planet only about eight times the mass of Jupiter has been confirmed orbiting a Sun - like star at over 300 times farther from the star than the Earth is from our Sun .
The newly confirmed planet is the least massive planet known to orbit at such a great distance from its host star .
The discovery utilized high - resolution adaptive optics technology at the Gemini Observatory to take direct images and spectra of the planet .
First reported in September 2008 by a team led by David Lafrenière ( then at the University of Toronto , now at the University of Montreal and Center for Research in Astrophysics of Quebec ) , the suspected planetary system required further observations over time to confirm that the planet and star were indeed moving through space together .
“ Back in 2008 what we knew for sure was that there was this young planetary mass object sitting right next to a young Sun - like star on the sky , ” says Lafrenière .
The extremely close proximity of the two objects strongly suggested that they were associated with each other but it was still possible ( but unlikely ) that they were unrelated and only aligned by chance in the sky .
According to Lafrenière , “ Our new observations rule out this chance alignment possibility , and thus confirms that the planet and the star are related to each other . ”
With this confirmation by Lafrenière and colleagues , the system , known as 1RXS J160929.1 - 210524 ( or 1RXS 1609 for short ) , provides scientists with a unique specimen that challenges planetary formation theories due to its extreme separation from the star .
" The unlikely locale of this alien world could be telling us that nature has more than one way of making planets , " says co-author Ray Jayawardhana of the University of Toronto .
" Or , it could be hinting at a violent youth when close encounters between newborn planets hurl some siblings out to the hinterlands , " he adds .
With its initial detection by the team using the Gemini Observatory in April of 2008 this object became the first likely planet known to orbit a sun- like star that was revealed by direct imaging .
At the time of its discovery the team also obtained a spectrum of the planet and was able to determine many of its characteristics , which are confirmed in this new work .
“ In retrospect , this makes our initial data the first spectrum of a confirmed exoplanet ever ! ” says Lafrenière .
The spectrum shows absorption features due to water vapor , carbon monoxide , and molecular hydrogen in the planet ’s atmosphere .
Since the initial observations several other worlds have been discovered using direct imaging , including a system of three planets around the star HR 8799 also discovered with Gemini .
However , the planets around HR 8799 orbit much closer to their host star .
The team ’s recent work on 1RXS 1609 also verified that no additional large planets ( between 1 - 8 Jupiter masses ) are present in the system closer to the star .
Future observations may shed light on the origin of this mysterious far - out planet .
In particular , in a few years , it should be to possible to detect a slight difference in motion between the planet and its star due to their mutual orbit .
Co-author Marten van Kerkwijk ( University of Toronto ) notes that the difference will be “ very small , ” since the fastest possible orbital period is more than one thousand years .
But he adds that by using Gemini it should be possible to measure a very precise velocity of the planet relative to its host .
This will show whether the planet is likely on a roughly circular orbit , as would be expected if it really formed far from its host star , or whether it is in a very non-circular or even unbound orbit , as could be the case if it formed closer to its star , but was kicked out in a close encounter with another planet .
The host star is located about 500 light - years away in a group of young stars called the Upper Scorpius association that formed about five million years ago .
The original survey studied more than 85 stars in this association .
The planet has an estimated temperature of about 1800 Kelvin ( about 1500 degrees Celsius ) and is much hotter than Jupiter , which has a atmospheric cloud - top temperature of about 160 Kelvin ( - 110 degrees Celsius ) .
The host star has an estimated mass of about 85 % that of our Sun .
The young age of the system explains the high temperature of the planet .
The contraction of the planet under its own gravity during its formation quickly raised its temperature to thousands of degrees .
Once this contraction phase is over , the planet slowly cools down by radiating infrared light .
In billions of years , the planet will eventually reach a temperature similar to that of Jupiter .
The observations used the Near - Infrared Imager ( NIRI ) and the Altair adaptive optics system on the Gemini North telescope .
Adaptive optics allows scientists to remove much of the distortions caused by our atmosphere and dramatically sharpen views of space .
“ Without adaptive optics , we would simply have been unable to see this planet , ” says Lafrenière .
“ The atmosphere blurs the image of a star so much that it extends over and is much brighter than the image of a faint planet around it , rendering the planet undetectable .
Adaptive optics removes this blurring and provides a better view of faint objects very close to stars . ”
The result has been accepted for publication ( see preprint here ) in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal .
The Gemini Observatory is an international collaboration with two identical 8 - meter telescopes .
The Frederick C. Gillett Gemini Telescope is located at Mauna Kea , Hawai'i ( Gemini North ) and the other telescope at Cerro Pachón in northern Chile ( Gemini South ) , and hence provide full coverage of both hemispheres of the sky .
Both telescopes incorporate new technologies that allow large , relatively thin mirrors under active control to collect and focus both optical and infrared radiation from space .
The Gemini Observatory provides the astronomical communities in each partner country with state - of - the - art astronomical facilities that allocate observing time in proportion to each country 's contribution .
In addition to financial support , each country also contributes significant scientific and technical resources .
The national research agencies that form the Gemini partnership include : the US National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , the Canadian National Research Council ( NRC ) , the Chilean Comisión Nacional de Investigación Cientifica y Tecnológica ( CONICYT ) , the Australian Research Council ( ARC ) , the Argentinean Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas ( CONICET ) and the Brazilian Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico CNPq ) .
The observatory is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy , Inc. ( AURA ) under a cooperative agreement with the NSF .
The NSF also serves as the executive agency for the international partnership .
IT was n’t until some elementary schools banned Silly Bandz , those colorful plastic bracelets that are the latest fad among the pencil - box set , that Ramona Sidlo , who is 30 , wanted them for herself .
“ I thought , ‘ This is nuts that a rubber band is causing so much hype , ’ ” she said .
“ If kids are going crazy over these , I have to have them . ”
For the uninitiated , Silly Bandz are rubber bands , often in neon colors , that are shaped like everyday objects : a guitar , a baseball bat , a princess .
Unlike the beige round elastics stashed in your desk drawer , these are meant to be worn on the wrist , and they snap back into their original silicon - molded shape  a turtle , perhaps , or a dinosaur or tiara  when you take them off .
Children like to collect them by the Ziploc bag , and some principals have banished them , saying they ’re a distraction .
Image Silly Bandz have captured the attention of young children .

" Perl 5 to 6 " Lesson 27 - Common Perl 6 data processing idioms
# create a hash from a list of keys and values : # solution 1 : slices my %hash ; %hash{@keys} = @values ; # solution 2 : meta operators my % hash = @keys Z= > @values ; # create a hash from an array , with # true value for each array item : my %exists = @keys X= >
True ; # limit a value to a given range , here 0..10 .
my $ x = - 2 ; say 0 max $x min 10 ; # for debugging : dump the contents of a variable , # including its name , to STDERR note :$ x.perl ; # sort case - insensitively say @list.
sort : *.lc ; # mandatory attributes class Something { has $.required = die " Attribute ' required ' is mandatory " ; } Something.new ( required => 2 ) ; # no error Something.new ( ) # BOOM
Learning the specification of a language is not enough to be productive with it .
Rather you need to know how to solve specific problems .
Common usage patterns , called idioms , helps you not having to re-invent the wheel every time you 're faced with a problem .
So here a some common Perl 6 idioms , dealing with data structures .
# create a hash from a list of keys and values : # solution 1 : slices my %hash ; %hash{@keys} = @values ; # solution 2 : meta operators my % hash = @keys Z= > @values ;
The first solution is the same you 'd use in Perl 5 : assignment to a slice .
The second solution uses the zip operator Z , which joins to list like a zip fastener : 1 , 2 , 3 Z 10 , 20 , 30 is 1 , 10 , 2 , 20 , 3 , 30 .
The Z= > is a meta operator , which combines zip with => ( the Pair construction operator ) .
So 1 , 2 , 3 Z= > 10 , 20 , 30 evaluates to 1 => 10 , 2 => 20 , 3 => 30 .
Assignment to a hash variable turns that into a Hash .
For existence checks , the values in a hash often does n't matter , as long as they all evaluate to True in boolean context .
In that case , a nice way to initialize the hash from a given array or list of keys is
my %exists = @keys X= > True ;
which uses the cross meta operator to use the single value
True for every item in @keys .
Sometimes you want to get a number from somewhere , but clip it into a predefined range ( for example so that it can act as an array index ) .
In Perl 5 you often end up with things like $ a = $ b > $ upper ?
$ upper : $ b , and another conditional for the lower limit .
With the max and min infix operators , that simplifies considerably to
my $ in - range = $ lower max $x min $ upper ;
because $ lower max $x returns the larger of the two numbers , and thus clipping to the lower end of the range .
Since min and max are infix operators , you can also clip infix :
$x max= 0 ; $x min= 10 ;
Perl 5 has Data :: Dumper , Perl 6 objects have the .perl method .
Both generate code that reproduces the original data structure as faithfully as possible .
: $var generates a Pair ( " colonpair " ) , using the variable name as key ( but with sigil stripped ) .
So it 's the same as var => $ var . note ( ) writes to the standard error stream , appending a newline .
So note :$ var. perl is quick way of obtaining the value of a variable for debugging ; purposes , along with its name .
Like in Perl 5 , the sort built - in can take a function that compares two values , and then sorts according to that comparison .
Unlike Perl 5 , it 's a bit smarter , and automatically does a transformation for you if the function takes only one argument .
In general , if you want to compare by a transformed value , in Perl 5 you can do :
# WARNING : Perl 5 code ahead my @sorted = sort { transform ( $ a ) cmp transform ( $b ) } @values ; # or the so - called Schwartzian Transform : my @sorted = map { $ _ - > [ 1 ] } sort { $ a - > [ 0 ] cmp $ b - > [ 0 ] } map { [ transform ( $_ ) , $ _ ] } @values
The former solution requires repetitive typing of the transformation , and executes it for each comparison .
The second solution avoids that by storing the transformed value along with the original value , but it 's quite a bit of code to write .
Perl 6 automates the second solution ( and a bit more efficient than the naiive Schwartzian transform , by avoiding an array for each value ) when the transformation function has arity one , ie accepts one argument only :
my @sorted = sort &transform , @values ;
The typical way to enforce the presence of an attribute is to check its presence in the constructor - or in all constructors , if there are many .
That works in Perl 6 too , but it 's easier and safer to require the presence at the level of each attribute :
has $.attr = die " ' attr ' is mandatory " ;
This exploits the default value mechanism .
When a value is supplied , the code for generating the default value is never executed , and the die never triggers .
If any constructor fails to set it , an exception is thrown .
N/ A
All ideologies practise periods of convenient amnesia .
In the same way that a woman 's evident ability to forget the pain of childbirth ensures the continuity of the species , schools of political thought must obscure the memory of certain events in order to ensure their survival as credible philosophies .
The political left prefers to ignore the massive failures of communism in the last century as well as , in the here and now , the apparent unravelling of Europe 's treasured , unaffordable nanny - state .
Similarly , direct job creation — New Deal - style pump - priming — now also appears to have been erased from the left 's vocabulary .
For the political right , particularly in America , the rhinoceros that must be ignored is the catastrophic failure of the free market .
It has been only two years since unshackled free enterprise very nearly ruined this country 's economy , as well as the rest of the world's .
Two years since entire branches of the securities and derivatives markets were exposed as almost industrial - scale fraud .
But most shamefully , it 's been two years since Wall Street 's champions of rugged individualism , whose market - making entrepreneurship supposedly sets this nation apart , had to be rescued and wet - nursed by the big , paternal government that hardline conservatives abhor .
The new culture war
The right is doing its best right now to forget that inconvenient truth .
Actually , it 's apparently decided that the whole mess was the fault of big paternal government in the first place .
Victory night for Rand Paul .
The Tea Party - backed opthamologist wins the Republican nomination in Kentucky as his father , Ron Paul , the Republican congressman for Texas and former Libertarian party presidential candidate , looks on .
( Associated Press )
From the libertarian Tea Party to the lobbyists for the banks , to hardline conservatives eager to retake control of Congress , that is exactly the case being made here now .
Arthur C. Brooks , president of the American Enterprise Institute , was the latest to do so , in a sweeping essay published by the Washington Post on the weekend .
On one side of the " new culture war , " argued Brooks , are the forces that make America great — those who believe this country is " an exceptional nation organized around the principles of free enterprise , limited government and rewards determined by market forces . "
On the other are what he calls the statists , those " determined to impose expanding bureaucracies , a managed economy and large - scale income redistribution . "
" These visions , " writes Brooks , " are not reconcilable .
We must choose . "
Do n't regulate
This is a theme repeated across America nowadays , most recently at the polls in Kentucky a week ago .
Fuelled by the populist power of the Tea Party , ophthalmologist Rand Paul captured the Republican nomination for the mid-term Senate race in November .
Paul is a libertarian who shares the views of his more famous father , Texas congressman Ron Paul , who once ran for president under the Libertarian banner .
Basically , he believes the less government the better .
Libertarians oppose the regulation of the financial sector , including the mammoth bill just passed by both houses of Congress .
Rand Paul would , in fact , abolish the Federal Reserve , the financial sector 's ultimate overseer .
In his worldview , government is a drag on the dynamism of the market and should just get out of its way .
Similarly , conservative hardliners argue that government bailouts simply reward incompetence and malfeasance at the expense of ordinary citizens .
Actually , that is not just a conservative argument .
If there is one point of near - total consensus in this country , it is No More Bailouts .
Not Wall Street 's fault
But what Paul , and the Tea Partiers , and conservative hardliners , and Mr. Brooks 's weekend manifesto would rather forget is why George W. Bush , a self - described " market guy , " had to suppress his principles and open Washington 's bailout vaults for Wall Street two years ago .
Brooks now argues that the economic freefall at the time was n't really Wall Street 's fault .
" In truth , " he wrote , " it was government housing policy that was at the root of the crisis . "
Yes , there is some truth in that .
Successive administrations in Washington , pushing for greater access to credit for underprivileged minorities , did actively encourage lending to people who could n't pay back what they borrowed .
But saying the economic crisis would never have happened had it not been for U.S. government housing policy is like saying the Holocaust was a hoax because the gas chambers at Dachau were never actually used for mass killing , as they were elsewhere .
In other words , a gross concealment of reality based on an isolated truth .
The fact is , millions of American consumers were encouraged to lie about their incomes and take on ridiculous mortgages with the full complicity of the nation 's banks and credit rating agencies as government stood by , trusting the " self - regulating wisdom " of the markets .
Meanwhile , the country 's biggest financial institutions were promoting bundles of rotten mortgages , in many cases knowing full well the worthlessness of what they were selling .
The richest investment bank on Wall Street , it turns out , was actually betting against the stuff it was selling investors .
Swallowing hard
When this all collapsed , the so - called statists , argues Brooks , recognized a golden opportunity for offering big government as the solution .
" For a lot of panicky Americans , the prospect of a paternalistic government rescuing the nation from crisis seemed appealing as stock markets and home prices spiralled downward . "
Well , um , yes .
For the vast majority of Americans at the time , as I recall .
But Brooks , like most of the revisionists , just stops there .
It 's part of the convenient amnesia .
Here 's the question they ignore :
What if the government had done nothing ?
What if Bush had let the biggest financial institutions in the country sink under the weight of their own garbage ?
What if Obama , the leader of Brooks 's statist forces , had chosen not to continue Bush 's bailout , and had let GM and Chrysler go out of business ?
There is n't much doubt among economists what would have happened .
" The recession would have been a depression , " says Prof .
Peter Morici , a macroeconomist at the University of Maryland and a starchy critic of what he nonetheless considers the Obama administration 's " welfare for Wall Street . "
The Tea Partiers as well as probably Rand Paul and everybody else with a retirement plan would have seen their life savings evaporate by half , or worse .
Some ATM machines would have stopped delivering cash .
Some economists say unemployment would have hit 30 per cent or higher , rather than peaking at about 17 .
That is why market - guy Bush swallowed hard and ordered his officials to start bailing .
And that is why Democrats and Republicans joined together last week to pass the regulatory reform bill .
Rand Paul and his fellow libertarians may not have liked it , but as Republican Senator Jon Kyl put it , lawmakers have to separate " the theoretical and the interesting and the hypothetical questions that college students debate until 2 a .m. from the actual votes we have to cast based on real legislation here . "
Should he actually make it all the way to the U.S. Senate later this year , Rand Paul will probably discover the truth of that .
BP is in talks to sell assets , including stakes in its Alaska oil fields , to Apache for $ 10 billion to $ 12 billion , a person briefed on the matter said on Sunday .
Should a deal be reached  one is not expected immediately  it would help provide BP with additional money to pay for cleaning up the immense oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
Talks are continuing and may not result in a transaction , this person cautioned .
As it struggles to finally plug the gushing well in the gulf , including by installing a new containment cap , BP has been taking steps to pay for the cleanup costs .
Last month , the company pledged to President Obama that it would set aside $ 20 billion in an escrow fund to handle claims , although some analysts have estimated that BP ’s total liability may rise to $ 70 billion .
Among the assets that may be sold is BP ’s 26 percent stake in the Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska ’s North Slope , the largest oil field in North America .
When a person is driving while listening to music , and rhythmically thumping on the steering wheel , as if playing the drums to the beat of the music .
Most often observed at stop lights ; also the person 's lips are normally viewed attempting to sing or mouth the words to the song .
On rare occasions , you may actually hear the person 's voice and / or hear the ' thumps ' of them drumming the steering wheel .
On very rare occasions the person will close their eyes and raise their neck up to emphasis a high note , thus sitting at the stop light , even after the light turns green .
Photo Gallery Documenting Destruction
In May 1945 , US pilots embarked on hundreds of reconnaissance flights , aboard the same bombers which had razed much of Germany to the ground .
Instead of launching bombs they shot photographs , creating a hard - hitting portrait of their trail of destruction .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
By building a machine that uses 2,000 bouncing beads to spin a paddle and perform work , researchers from the University of Twente have finally realized a long - debated thought experiment .
A similar machine was first proposed in 1912 by the Polish physicist Marian Smoluchowski .
In his thought experiment , he suggested that tiny moving particles could generate enough force to spin a windmill - type paddle .
A locking mechanism such as a pawl could prevent backward motion , forcing the wheel to move in the forward direction only .
However , several years later , physicist Richard Feynman argued that , in reality , the bouncing beads would not be capable of doing meaningful work .
Feynman showed that , since the entire system operates at the same temperature , a pawl would occasionally slip off the wheel .
As a result , the system would generate zero net movement .
Now , physicist Devaraj van der Meer from the University of Twente and his colleagues have demonstrated that such a machine can in fact spin the paddles forward only , generating a positive net movement .
The details of their study will be published in an upcoming issue of Physical Review Letters .
Looking somewhat like a high - speed lotto machine , the new system consists of a vigorously shaken platform that causes 2,000 small glass beads to bounce around .
When the beads make contact with the vanes of a windmill - like device inside the machine , the vanes move , turning a rod , which rotates a sensor .
In this machine , 2,000 bouncing beads spin the vanes of a ratchet .
Credit : University of Twente .
The key challenge was getting the vanes to move in the forward direction only , which the scientists achieved with - somewhat surprisingly - duct tape .
With duct tape covering one side of each vane , the vanes spun in one direction only .
Since the beads lost more energy when they hit the soft duct - taped side than the non-taped side of the vanes , the machine generated a positive net movement .
Van der
Meer noted that the machine does n’t come close to violating the second law of thermodynamics , since the system is extremely inefficient .
Most of the beads ’ energy is lost through heat and sound .
However , the system could still provide scientists with insight into classical mechanics .
For instance , the system exhibits a property called back interaction , so that not only do the beads move the vanes , but the vanes also move the beads .
After the vanes begin to turn in one direction , the researchers observed a new roiling pattern in the beads .
The physicists say this back interaction might also occur in tiny “ molecular ratchets , ” which include molecules in the body such as RNA polymerase and protein kinesin .
At much smaller scales , these molecules move themselves through the body by ratcheting along tracks inside cells .
The macroscopic system built here could help researchers better understand how molecular ratchets work by allowing the researchers to observe and manipulate the interactions on a large scale .

The planet is heated to searing temperatures by its star
Astronomers have measured high - speed winds in the atmosphere of a planet orbiting a distant star .
Data on carbon monoxide gas in the atmosphere show that it is streaming at fierce speeds from the planet 's hot day side to its cool night side .
Writing in Nature , a team detected longitudinal winds of roughly 2 km/s ( 7,000 km /h ) in the atmosphere of a " hot Jupiter " planet .
Hot Jupiters are gas giants that orbit very close to their parent stars .
In the future , astronomers may be able to use this type of observation to study the atmospheres of Earth - like planets Ignas Snellen , University of Leiden
The planet HD209458 b orbits a star in the constellation Pegasus , some 150 light - years away .
It circles this star at around one - eighth the distance Mercury orbits the Sun .
This means the exoplanet is heated intensely by its parent star , and has a surface temperature of about 1,000C on its hot side .
But as the planet always has the same side to its star , one side is searing , whereas the other is much cooler .
" On Earth , big temperature differences inevitably lead to fierce winds , and as our new measurements reveal , the situation is no different on HD209458 b , " said co-author Simon Albrecht , from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) in Cambridge , US .
Ignas Snellen , who led the team of astronomers , commented : " HD209458 b is definitely not a place for the faint - hearted .
The researcher , based at Leiden University in the Netherlands , added : " By studying the poisonous carbon monoxide gas with great accuracy we found evidence for a ' super wind ' , blowing at a speed of 5,000 to 10,000 km per hour . "

The researchers used the Very Large Telescope for their observations
The researchers used the European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) and its powerful CRIRES spectrograph to detect and analyse the tiny fraction of starlight that filtered through the planet 's atmosphere as it passed in front of its star .
The chemicals in the atmosphere , such as carbon monoxide , produce distinctive fingerprints , known as absorption lines , in this spectrum of stellar light .
Team member Remco de Kok , from the Netherlands Institute for Space Research ( SRON ) , said CRIRES was uniquely equipped to deliver precise measurements of the carbon monoxide lines .
HD209458 b Orbits a star in the constellation Pegasus , 150 light - years away
Is about 60 % the size of Jupiter , another gas giant
Orbits its star at one eighth the distance from the Sun to Mercury
Has a surface temperature of about 1,000C on its hot side
Discovered by US and Swiss astronomers in November 1999
Parent star is similar to the Sun and is classified as a ' yellow dwarf '
" This high precision allows us to measure the velocity of the carbon monoxide gas for the first time using the Doppler effect . "
The Doppler effect , or Doppler shift , is the change in the wavelength of the planet 's light spectrum caused by its motion towards or away from Earth .
The authors were able to use the Doppler shift to obtain a direct measurement of the exoplanet 's mass .
The effect was used to calculate the velocity of the exoplanet as it orbited its home star - its orbital velocity .
Once the orbital velocity of HD209458 b was known , the masses of both the star and planet could be calculated using Newton 's law of gravity .
Mercedes Lopez - Morales , from the Carnegie Institution of Washington , US , who was not connected with the study , said : " Measuring spectral lines from molecules in the atmosphere of an exoplanet and using them to derive the planet 's mass directly is a remarkable achievement .
" Equally striking is the fact that the observations have been made using ground - based telescope facilities .
Until a few months ago , such challenging precision measurements were thought to be possible only from space - based platforms . "
The astronomers also measured how much carbon is present in the atmosphere of this planet .
" It seems that H209458 b is actually as carbon - rich as Jupiter and Saturn .
This could indicate that it was formed in the same way , " said Dr Snellen .
" In the future , astronomers may be able to use this type of observation to study the atmospheres of Earth - like planets , to determine whether life also exists elsewhere in the Universe . "

Cross Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet ¶
This article provides a simple positive model for preventing XSS using output encoding properly .
While there are a huge number of XSS attack vectors , following a few simple rules can completely defend against this serious attack .
This article does not explore the technical or business impact of XSS .
Suffice it to say that it can lead to an attacker gaining the ability to do anything a victim can do through their browser .
Both reflected and stored XSS can be addressed by performing the appropriate validation and encoding on the server - side .
DOM Based XSS can be addressed with a special subset of rules described in the DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet .
For a cheatsheet on the attack vectors related to XSS , please refer to the XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet .
More background on browser security and the various browsers can be found in the Browser Security Handbook .
Before reading this cheatsheet , it is important to have a fundamental understanding of Injection Theory .
A Positive XSS Prevention Model¶
This article treats an HTML page like a template , with slots where a developer is allowed to put untrusted data .
These slots cover the vast majority of the common places where a developer might want to put untrusted data .
Putting untrusted data in other places in the HTML is not allowed .
This is a " whitelist " model , that denies everything that is not specifically allowed .
Given the way browsers parse HTML , each of the different types of slots has slightly different security rules .
When you put untrusted data into these slots , you need to take certain steps to make sure that the data does not break out of that slot into a context that allows code execution .
In a way , this approach treats an HTML document like a parameterized database query - the data is kept in specific places and is isolated from code contexts with encoding .
This document sets out the most common types of slots and the rules for putting untrusted data into them safely .
Based on the various specifications , known XSS vectors , and a great deal of manual testing with all the popular browsers , we have determined that the rules proposed here are safe .
The slots are defined and a few examples of each are provided .
Developers SHOULD NOT put data into any other slots without a very careful analysis to ensure that what they are doing is safe .
Browser parsing is extremely tricky and many innocuous looking characters can be significant in the right context .
Why Can't I Just HTML Entity Encode Untrusted Data¶
HTML entity encoding is okay for untrusted data that you put in the body of the HTML document , such as inside a < div > tag .
It even sort of works for untrusted data that goes into attributes , particularly if you 're religious about using quotes around your attributes .
But HTML entity encoding does n't work if you 're putting untrusted data inside a < script > tag anywhere , or an event handler attribute like onmouseover , or inside CSS , or in a URL .
So even if you use an HTML entity encoding method everywhere , you are still most likely vulnerable to XSS .
You MUST use the encode syntax for the part of the HTML document you 're putting untrusted data into .
That 's what the rules below are all about .
You Need a Security Encoding Library ¶
Writing these encoders is not tremendously difficult , but there are quite a few hidden pitfalls .
For example , you might be tempted to use some of the escaping shortcuts like \ " in JavaScript .
However , these values are dangerous and may be misinterpreted by the nested parsers in the browser .
You might also forget to escape the escape character , which attackers can use to neutralize your attempts to be safe .
OWASP recommends using a security - focused encoding library to make sure these rules are properly implemented .
Microsoft provides an encoding library named the Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library for the .NET platform and ASP .
NET Framework has built - in ValidateRequest function that provides limited sanitization .
The OWASP Java Encoder Project provides a high - performance encoding library for Java .
XSS Prevention Rules¶
The following rules are intended to prevent all XSS in your application .
While these rules do not allow absolute freedom in putting untrusted data into an HTML document , they should cover the vast majority of common use cases .
You do not have to allow all the rules in your organization .
Many organizations may find that allowing only Rule # 1 and Rule # 2 are sufficient for their needs .
Please add a note to the discussion page if there is an additional context that is often required and can be secured with encoding .
Do NOT simply encode / escape the list of example characters provided in the various rules .
It is NOT sufficient to encode / escape only that list .
Blacklist approaches are quite fragile .
The whitelist rules here have been carefully designed to provide protection even against future vulnerabilities introduced by browser changes .
RULE #0 - Never Insert Untrusted Data Except in Allowed Locations ¶
The first rule is to deny all - do n't put untrusted data into your HTML document unless it is within one of the slots defined in Rule # 1 through Rule # 5 .
The reason for Rule # 0 is that there are so many strange contexts within HTML that the list of encoding rules gets very complicated .
We can't think of any good reason to put untrusted data in these contexts .
This includes " nested contexts " like a URL inside a JavaScript -- the encoding rules for those locations are tricky and dangerous .
If you insist on putting untrusted data into nested contexts , please do a lot of cross - browser testing and let us know what you find out .
Directly in a script :
< script >... NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE ...</ script >
Inside an HTML comment :
<!--... NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE ...-->
In an attribute name :
< div ...
NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE ...= test />
In a tag name :
< NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE ... href = " / test " />
Directly in CSS :
< style > .. .
NEVER PUT UNTRUSTED DATA HERE ... </ style >
Most importantly , never accept actual JavaScript code from an untrusted source and then run it .
For example , a parameter named " callback " that contains a JavaScript code snippet .
No amount of encoding / escaping can fix that .
RULE # 1 - HTML Encode Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Element Content¶
Rule # 1 is for when you want to put untrusted data directly into the HTML body somewhere .
This includes inside normal tags like div , p , b , td , etc .
Most web frameworks have a method for HTML encoding / escaping for the characters detailed below .
However , this is absolutely not sufficient for other HTML contexts .
You need to implement the other rules detailed here as well .
< body > ... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ... </ body >
< div > ... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ... </ div >
Encode the following characters with HTML entity encoding to prevent switching into any execution context , such as script , style , or event handlers .
Using hex entities is recommended in the spec .
In addition to the 5 characters significant in XML ( & , < , > , " , ' ) , the forward slash is included as it helps to end an HTML entity .
& --> & < --> < > --> > " --> " ' --> ' / --> / ' not recommended because its not in the HTML spec ( See : section 24.4.1 ) ' is in the XML and XHTML specs .
Forward slash is included as it helps end an HTML entity
RULE # 2 - Attribute Encode Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Common Attributes ¶
Rule # 2 is for putting untrusted data into typical attribute values like width , name , value , etc .
This should not be used for complex attributes like href , src , style , or any of the event handlers like onmouseover .
It is extremely important that event handler attributes should follow Rule # 3 for HTML JavaScript Data Values .
Inside UNquoted attribute :
< div attr = ... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ... > content
Inside single quoted attribute :
< div attr = '... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ...' > content
Inside double quoted attribute :
< div attr = " ... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ... " > content
Except for alphanumeric characters , encode all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with the &#xHH ; format ( or a named entity if available ) to prevent switching out of the attribute .
The reason this rule is so broad is that developers frequently leave attributes unquoted .
Properly quoted attributes can only be escaped with the corresponding quote .
Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters , including [ space ] % * + , - / ; < = > ^ and | .
RULE # 3 - JavaScript Encode Before Inserting Untrusted Data into JavaScript Data Values¶
Rule # 3 concerns dynamically generated JavaScript code - both script blocks and event - handler attributes .
The only safe place to put untrusted data into this code is inside a quoted " data value . "
Including untrusted data inside any other JavaScript context is quite dangerous , as it is extremely easy to switch into an execution context with characters including ( but not limited to ) semi-colon , equals , space , plus , and many more , so use with caution .
Inside a quoted string :
< script > alert ( '... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ...' ) </ script >
One side of a quoted expression :
< script > x = '... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ...' </ script >
Inside quoted event handler :
< div onmouseover = " x= '... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ...' " </ div >
Please note there are some JavaScript functions that can never safely use untrusted data as input - EVEN IF JAVASCRIPT ENCODED !
For example :
< script > window .
setInterval ( '... EVEN IF YOU ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA YOU ARE XSSED HERE ...' ) ; </ script >
Except for alphanumeric characters , encode all characters less than 256 with the \xHH format to prevent switching out of the data value into the script context or into another attribute .
DO NOT use any escaping shortcuts like \ " because the quote character may be matched by the HTML attribute parser which runs first .
These escaping shortcuts are also susceptible to escape - the - escape attacks where the attacker sends \ " and the vulnerable code turns that into \\ " which enables the quote .
If an event handler is properly quoted , breaking out requires the corresponding quote .
However , we have intentionally made this rule quite broad because event handler attributes are often left unquoted .
Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters including [ space ] % * + , - / ; < = > ^ and | .
Also , a </ script > closing tag will close a script block even though it is inside a quoted string because the HTML parser runs before the JavaScript parser .
Please note this is an aggressive encoding policy that over - encodes .
If there is a guarantee that proper quoting is accomplished then a much smaller character set is needed .
Please look at the OWASP Java Encoder JavaScript encoding examples for examples of proper JavaScript use that requires minimal encoding .
RULE # 3.1 - HTML
Encode JSON values in an HTML context and read the data with JSON . parse ¶
In a Web 2.0 world , the need for having data dynamically generated by an application in a JavaScript context is common .
One strategy is to make an AJAX call to get the values , but this is n't always performant .
Often , an initial block of JSON is loaded into the page to act as a single place to store multiple values .
This data is tricky , though not impossible , to encode / escape correctly without breaking the format and content of the values .
Ensure returned Content - Type header is application / json and not text / html .
This shall instruct the browser not misunderstand the context and execute injected script
Bad HTTP response :
HTTP/1.1 200 Date : Wed , 06 Feb 2013 10:28:54 GMT
Server : Microsoft - IIS /7.5 ....
Content - Type : text / html ; charset=utf -8 <-- bad ....
Content - Length : 373 Keep - Alive : timeout=5 , max=100 Connection : Keep - Alive { " Message " : " No HTTP resource was found that matches the request URI ' dev.net.ie/api/pay/.html?HouseNumber=9&AddressLine
= The + Gardens< script>alert(1)</script>&AddressLine2=foxlodge+woods&TownName=Meath'. " , " MessageDetail " : " No type was found that matches the controller named ' pay ' . " }
<-- this script will pop !!
Good HTTP response :
HTTP/1.1 200 Date : Wed , 06 Feb 2013 10:28:54 GMT
Server : Microsoft - IIS /7.5 ....
Content - Type : application / json ; charset=utf - 8 <-- good .....
A common anti-pattern one would see :
< script > //
Do NOT do this without encoding the data with one of the techniques listed below .
var initData = < %= data .
to_json %> ; </ script >
JSON serialization ¶
A safe JSON serializer will allow developers to serialize JSON as string of literal JavaScript which can be embedded in an HTML in the contents of the < script > tag .
HTML characters and JavaScript line terminators need be encoded .
Consider the Yahoo JavaScript Serializer for this task .
HTML entity encoding ¶
This technique has the advantage that HTML entity encoding is widely supported and helps separate data from server side code without crossing any context boundaries .
Consider placing the JSON block on the page as a normal element and then parsing the innerHTML to get the contents .
The JavaScript that reads the span can live in an external file , thus making the implementation of CSP enforcement easier .
< div id = " init_data " style = " display : none " > < %= html_encode(data.to_json ) %> </ div >
// external js file var dataElement = document .
getElementById ( ' init_data ' ) ; // decode and parse the content of the div var initData = JSON . parse ( dataElement . textContent ) ;
An alternative to encoding and decoding JSON directly in JavaScript , is to normalize JSON server - side by converting < to \u003c before delivering it to the browser .
Rule # 4 is for when you want to put untrusted data into a style sheet or a style tag .
CSS is surprisingly powerful , and can be used for numerous attacks .
Therefore , it 's important that you only use untrusted data in a property value and not into other places in style data .
You should stay away from putting untrusted data into complex properties like url , behavior , and custom ( - moz - binding ) .
You should also not put untrusted data into IE 's expression property value which allows JavaScript .
Property value :
< style > selector { property : ... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ... ; } </ style >
< style > selector { property : " ... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ... " ; } </ style >
< span style = " property : ... ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ... " > text </ span >
Please note there are some CSS contexts that can never safely use untrusted data as input - EVEN IF PROPERLY CSS ENCODED !
You will have to ensure that URLs only start with http not javascript and that properties never start with " expression " .
For example :
{ background - url : " javascript:alert ( 1 ) " ; } // and all other URLs { text - size : " expression ( alert ( ' XSS ' ) ) " ; } // only in IE
Except for alphanumeric characters , encode all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with the \HH encoding format .
DO NOT use any escaping shortcuts like \ " because the quote character may be matched by the HTML attribute parser which runs first .
These escaping shortcuts are also susceptible to escape - the - escape attacks where the attacker sends \ " and the vulnerable code turns that into \\ " which enables the quote .
If attribute is quoted , breaking out requires the corresponding quote .
All attributes should be quoted but your encoding should be strong enough to prevent XSS when untrusted data is placed in unquoted contexts .
Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters including [ space ] % * + , - / ; < = > ^ and | .
Also , the </ style > tag will close the style block even though it is inside a quoted string because the HTML parser runs before the JavaScript parser .
Please note that we recommend aggressive CSS encoding and validation to prevent XSS attacks for both quoted and unquoted attributes .
RULE # 5 - URL Encode Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML URL Parameter Values¶
Rule # 5 is for when you want to put untrusted data into HTTP GET parameter value .
< a href = " http://www.somesite.com?test=...ENCODE UNTRUSTED DATA BEFORE PUTTING HERE ... " > link </ a >
Except for alphanumeric characters , encode all characters with ASCII values less than 256 with the %HH encoding format .
Including untrusted data in data : URLs should not be allowed as there is no good way to disable attacks with encoding / escaping to prevent switching out of the URL .
All attributes should be quoted .
Unquoted attributes can be broken out of with many characters including [ space ] % * + , - / ; < = > ^ and | .
Note that entity encoding is useless in this context .
WARNING : Do not encode complete or relative URLs with URL encoding !
If untrusted input is meant to be placed into href , src or other URL - based attributes , it should be validated to make sure it does not point to an unexpected protocol , especially javascript links .
URLs should then be encoded based on the context of display like any other piece of data .
For example , user driven URLs in HREF links should be attribute encoded .
For example :
String userURL = request .
getParameter ( " userURL " ) boolean isValidURL = Validator .
IsValidURL ( userURL , 255 ) ; if ( isValidURL ) { < a href = " <%=encoder.encodeForHTMLAttribute(userURL ) % > " > link </ a > }
RULE # 6 - Sanitize HTML Markup with a Library Designed for the Job¶
If your application handles markup -- untrusted input that is supposed to contain HTML -- it can be very difficult to validate .
Encoding is also difficult , since it would break all the tags that are supposed to be in the input .
Therefore , you need a library that can parse and clean HTML formatted text .
There are several available at OWASP that are simple to use :
HtmlSanitizer
An open - source .
Net library .
The HTML is cleaned with a white list approach .
All allowed tags and attributes can be configured .
The library is unit tested with the OWASP XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet
var sanitizer = new HtmlSanitizer ( ) ; sanitizer .
AllowedAttributes .
Add ( " class " ) ; var sanitized = sanitizer .
Sanitize ( html ) ;
OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer
import org.owasp.html.Sanitizers ; import org.owasp.html.PolicyFactory ; PolicyFactory sanitizer = Sanitizers .
FORMATTING . and ( Sanitizers .
BLOCKS ) ;
String cleanResults = sanitizer .
sanitize ( " < p> Hello , < b> World ! </b > " ) ;
For more information on OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer policy construction , see here .
Ruby on Rails SanitizeHelper
The SanitizeHelper module provides a set of methods for scrubbing text of undesired HTML elements .
< %= sanitize @comment .
body , tags : %w ( strong em a ) , attributes : %w ( href ) %>
Other libraries that provide HTML Sanitization include :
RULE # 7 - Avoid JavaScript URLs ¶
Untrusted URLs that include the protocol javascript : will execute JavaScript code when used in URL DOM locations such as anchor tag HREF attributes or iFrame src locations .
Be sure to validate all untrusted URLs to ensure they only contain safe schemes such as HTTPS .
RULE # 8 - Prevent DOM - based XSS ¶
For details on what DOM - based XSS is , and defenses against this type of XSS flaw , please see the OWASP article on DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet .
Bonus Rule # 1 : Use HTTPOnly cookie flag ¶
Preventing all XSS flaws in an application is hard , as you can see .
To help mitigate the impact of an XSS flaw on your site , OWASP also recommends you set the HTTPOnly flag on your session cookie and any custom cookies you have that are not accessed by any JavaScript you wrote .
This cookie flag is typically on by default in .NET apps , but in other languages you have to set it manually .
For more details on the HTTPOnly cookie flag , including what it does , and how to use it , see the OWASP article on HTTPOnly .
Bonus Rule # 2 : Implement Content Security Policy ¶
There is another good complex solution to mitigate the impact of an XSS flaw called Content Security Policy .
It 's a browser side mechanism which allows you to create source whitelists for client side resources of your web application , e.g. JavaScript , CSS , images , etc. CSP via special HTTP header instructs the browser to only execute or render resources from those sources .
For example this CSP :
Content - Security - Policy : default - src : ' self ' ; script- src : ' self ' static.domain.tld
Will instruct web browser to load all resources only from the page 's origin and JavaScript source code files additionally from static.domain.tld .
For more details on Content Security Policy , including what it does , and how to use it , see this article on Content Security Policy .
Bonus Rule # 3 : Use an Auto - Escaping Template System¶
Many web application frameworks provide automatic contextual escaping functionality such as AngularJS strict contextual escaping and Go Templates .
Use these technologies when you can .
Bonus Rule # 4 : Properly use modern JS frameworks ¶
Modern JavaScript frameworks have pretty good XSS protection built in .
Usually framework API allows bypassing that protection in order to render unescaped HTML or include executable code .
The following API methods and props in the table below are considered dangerous and by using them you are potentially exposing your users to an XSS vulnerability .
If you really have to use them remember that now all the data must be sanitized by yourself .
JavaScript framework Dangerous methods / props Angular ( 2+ ) bypassSecurityTrust React dangerouslySetInnerHTML
Svelte {@html ...} Vue ( 2+ ) v-html
Avoid template injection in Angular by building with -- prod parameter ( ng build -- prod ) .
Also remember to keep your framework updated to the latest version with all possible bugfixes .
The X - XSS - Protection header has been deprecated by modern browsers and its use can introduce additional security issues on the client side .
As such , it is recommended to set the header as X - XSS - Protection : 0 in order to disable the XSS Auditor , and not allow it to take the default behavior of the browser handling the response .

The following snippets of HTML demonstrate how to safely render untrusted data in a variety of different contexts .
Safe HTML
Attributes include : align , alink , alt , bgcolor , border , cellpadding , cellspacing , class , color , cols , colspan , coords , dir , face , height , hspace , ismap , lang , marginheight , marginwidth , multiple , nohref , noresize , noshade , nowrap , ref , rel , rev , rows , rowspan , scrolling , shape , span , summary , tabindex , title , usemap , valign , value , vlink , vspace , width .
Output Encoding Rules Summary ¶
The purpose of output encoding ( as it relates to Cross Site Scripting ) is to convert untrusted input into a safe form where the input is displayed as data to the user without executing as code in the browser .
The following charts details a list of critical output encoding methods needed to stop Cross Site Scripting .
Encoding Type Encoding Mechanism HTML Entity Encoding Convert & to & , Convert < to < , Convert > to > , Convert " to " , Convert ' to ' , Convert / to / HTML Attribute Encoding Except for alphanumeric characters , encode all characters with the HTML Entity &#xHH ; format , including spaces .
( HH = Hex Value ) URL Encoding Standard percent encoding , see here .
URL encoding should only be used to encode parameter values , not the entire URL or path fragments of a URL .
JavaScript Encoding Except for alphanumeric characters , encode all characters with the \uXXXX unicode encoding format ( X = Integer ) .
CSS Hex Encoding CSS encoding supports \ XX and \ XXXXXX .
Using a two character encode can cause problems if the next character continues the encode sequence .
There are two solutions ( a) Add a space after the CSS encode ( will be ignored by the CSS parser ) ( b ) use the full amount of CSS encoding possible by zero padding the value .

You knew George Washington was a soldier and a politician .
Maybe you even knew he was a farmer .
But , did you know he dabbled in the spirits , too ?
Well , it was more than a dabble .
President Washington had one of the largest , most successful commercial distilling operations of his day .
And , on July 1 , you can experience it for yourself .
George Washington 's Distillery is hosting the first public sale and tasting of George Washington Rye Whiskey .
The distillery is producing the spirit using the recipe found in the first president 's historic records .
With only 500 bottles available at a cost of $ 85 each , the rye whiskey made by the former master distiller of Maker 's Mark quickly will become a collector 's item .
" This is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity for a collector 's item in the whiskey world , " said Frank Coleman of the Distilled Spirits Council .
Coleman said the spirits are a white whiskey with a lot of fruit and sweetness , and it 's just like what Washington would have sold in Old Town Alexandria .
" Basically it 's 18th century distilling from field to glass , " he said .
Coleman expects all of the bottles to sell on July 1 , even at the $ 85 price tag .
He said that collectible whiskey is becoming very popular throughout the world , so owning the first run from George Washington 's Distillery will be something special .
" It 's a better investment than the S&P 500 , " Coleman joked .
The event will also feature the unveiling of a new piece of art that is an historic recreation of the site .
It will hang in the Distillery museum .
The event opens to the public at noon on July 1 just south of the main entrance to Mount Vernon .
George Washington began commercial distilling in 1797 and marketed to local farmers just a few miles away in Old Town .
According to the Distillery website , at peak production , the distillery produced 11,000 gallons of whiskey , yielding a profit of $ 7,500 in 1799 .
Late in the 19th century , while investigating chicken cholera , Louis Pasteur infected some birds with bacteria that he confidently believed would kill them .
He was wrong : not only did the chickens survive ; they were completely immune .
Pasteur had made a mistake .
But in doing so he had also found a vaccine .
Fast forward to the 21st century and France , the country that gave the world the father of modern medicine , – as well as some of the greatest scientists and thinkers of history – is no longer quite so ready to see the benefits of getting things wrong , according to a growing number of intellectuals and education specialists .
They claim the French school system is leaving children bereft of creativity , flexibility of thought and – crucially – confidence in their own mental abilities .
In an attempt to counter this culture of " intellectual timorousness " , a group of academics from the country 's elite institutions is hosting a festival in Paris this week with a rather unusual mission : its participants are being encouraged to make as many mistakes as possible .
" A large part of the French school system is based on the idée reçue that errors are negative , when in fact it is by this very process of learning ... that you make progress , " said Maëlle Lenoir , of the Association Paris Montagne .
" The French system is founded on a strict learning of knowledge , rather than on creativity or innovation .
And yet it was Einstein himself who said that ' the only sure way to avoid making mistakes is to have no new ideas ' . "
Observers of the French school system , while praising certain key successes , have repeatedly highlighted the shortcomings of an educational process which is highly " top down " and results - driven , and which , they say , puts far more emphasis on having the right answer than the thought process by which a pupil might explore the question being asked .
" I'm a scientist .
I had nothing to do with education .
But then my six - year - old boy went to school and his teacher told me , ' He 's a nice kid , but he asks too many questions , ' " said François Taddei , the author of an education report published last year for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .
" This is the problem of the French system , " he added .
" You are supposed to know the right answer .
You are not supposed to express your own opinions or ask questions . "
One teacher who has attempted to rebel against the national model is Girolamo Ramunni , a lecturer at the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts in Paris , a higher education establishment specialising in science and industry .
Ramunni , an Italian who left school himself at the age of 14 , says he tries to encourage his students to reject the pressure to always be right by , for example , giving them problems to solve " which could not be solved " .
" At the beginning they do n't want to take risks , " he said .
" But after a while you notice that they are becoming more creative .
" Once they 've accepted that getting things wrong is not the end of the world , yes , they may come up with some crazy ideas , but they will have some good ones too . "
Organisers of the self - declared " festival of errors " , which began in the École Normale Supérieure in central Paris and continues until Saturday , hope to demonstrate to young participants the potential wonder of making mistakes through a series of science - based workshops .
Yesterday , Arthur , 12 , explained that it was " difficult " to get questions wrong .
" You 're ashamed , " he said .
Waiting for him was Isolde Serfaty , a parent who criticised the " competition and pressure to always do better " that French children face .
" They are marked right from primary school , " she said , referring to the marks out of 20 used as measurements of achievement across France .
For Taddei , the problem is just a small part of a wider malaise which is leaving the national education system – which was born out of the revolutionary ideals of equality and fraternity – increasingly ill - equipped to help level out the injustices of modern society .
Many observers feel the present system , which has been largely unchanged for decades , is calculated to serve the interests of the privileged few .
Asked whether even pupils at exclusive lycées such as Paris 's Henri IV were blighted by the fear of making mistakes , Lenoir said : " I would suggest that at Henri IV they are not so scared of making a mistake because they already know they are right . "
The free festival is aimed at fostering scientific enthusiasm in under - 18s from socially neglected parts of the Ile de France region around Paris .
Great mistakes : from penicillin to crisps
After inoculating several dishes with the bacterium staphylococcus , Alexander Fleming forgot to cover them up before going on holiday .
On his return , one of the dishes had grown mould .
Fleming observed that the bacteria around the mould were all dead , thus discovering that the mould Penicillium had antibacterial properties .
In 1492 Christopher Columbus set sail westwards intent on discovering a new route to Asia .
Miscalculating the Earth 's circumference meant he actually landed in America , opening up trade links between the old and new worlds .
In 1839 Charles Goodyear accidentally dropped some india rubber mixed with sulphur on to a hot stove , discovering the vulcanisation process which made possible the commercial use of rubber .
Chef George Crum invented crisps in 1853 when a customer at a restaurant in New York , returned his fries to the kitchen .
In anger , Crum sliced them as thinly as possible , over - fried them and doused them in salt .
The customer was delighted and the crisp was born .

Asus Immensity : ROG board with on - board HD 5770
Click to immensify the Immensity
Click to immensify the Immensity
Given that Asus had already treated us to a pre-Computex preview , we were n’t expecting any grand surprises from the company ’s presence at the show .
Well , we were wrong .
Feast your eyes on the Asus Immensity – arguably the first Republic of Gamers motherboard that does exactly what it says on the tin .
The Crosshair never shot anyone , the Maximus did n’t utter rousing speeches about this life and the next and the Rampage never played Mr T – but the Immensity is an… immense motherboard .
Before we go any further , we should make it clear that Asus is still referring to the board as a ' concept ' .
That said , there was a definite sense of excitement about the board and we’d be far from surprised to see it making it into production .
As you ’d expect , it ’s a high - end LGA1366 board based on Intel ’s X58 chipset .
It also includes Lucid ’s Hydra chip .
Previously a favourite of MSI , the Hydra allows you to mix and match ATI and Nvidia GPUs in a multi-GPU system .
While our initial testing was disappointing , Asus ( and MSI ) are both optimistic about its progress , and we ’re keen to take another look .
That ’s not all for the Immensity .
It also has a GPU on - board , in the shape of one of the mid-range Radeon HD 5000 - series chips .
Asus ’ thinking is that if you ’re buying a board with the Hydra on it , you must be aiming to build a multi-GPU system – so why not provide the first GPU onboard ?
The downsides are that it reduces flexibility , but we can see where it ’s coming from – if you already have a good graphics card ( and they ’re lasting longer and longer these days ) , an Immensity would be a one - stop way to get a multi-GPU PC .
The Immensity ’s design also signals a return to what ’s supposedly at the heart of the ROG brand – gaming performance .
If the Hydra ’s new drivers work as promised , then buying an Immensity would improve your games ' performance .
There was some debate about the specific GPU Asus had chosen to integrate .
We were told it was a Radeon HD 5770 , but other journalists have been told it was a HD 5450 .
As the board we saw is a concept model , the specific model of GPU is clearly under debate - and the cooling on the board you see pictured was made of rubber , so it 's obviously a non-working sample .
Should the Immensity make it to production , we would n’t be surprised to see it change quite significantly from what 's presented here .
Fortunately , we had the chance to quiz two very senior Asus employees about the Immensity .
Read on to find out more .
Looks like Verizon and Motorola are coming clean with the Droid X a little earlier than planned -- it just appeared on the official Droid page , complete with confirmation of that 4.3 - inch screen size .
Interestingly , rolling over the image reveals a box that says it has a " 720 p screen , " which would be crazy -- especially since the Droid X prototype we played with had what looked to be the same 854 x 480 resolution as the original Droid , although we could n't confirm it at the time .
A true 720 p screen res would also be far denser than the 800 x 480 panel on the EVO 4G , so we 're thinking Verizon actually means 720 p out over HDMI , not anything else .
We 'll see though -- the official launch event is still set for June 23 , and we 're still waiting to find out about the slider Droid 2 , so there are a lot of potential surprises still to come .
We just confirmed that the Droid X prototype we saw had an 854 x 480 display , so we 'll have to see if Motorola and Verizon have a serious surprise for us come Wednesday -- we know at least one Engadget editor who 's crossing his fingers .
Sure enough , Verizon has changed the ad to read " Captures 720p " instead of " 720 p screen , " so that would basically confirm the 854 x 480 display .
A nerd can dream , though !

Democrat Maureen Reed dropped out of the 6th Congressional District race on Sunday , leaving one DFLer to take on Republican U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann this fall .
Reed said in a message to supporters that a prolonged primary battle against state .
Sen . Tarryl Clark , the DFL - endorsed candidate , would only help Bachmann in her bid for a third term .
Bachmann , a Stillwater resident and darling of the “ tea party ” movement and conservative talk show circuit , already has raised about $ 2.4 million .
“ I feel that it is time for the DFL to unify behind one candidate in this race , ” Reed said .
Reed , a physician and former head of the University of Minnesota ’s Board of Regents , is a former candidate for lieutenant governor on the Independence Party ticket .
The Grant resident routinely emphasized her centrist credentials during her campaign .
Clark , of St. Cloud , praised Reed as a “ spirited competitor ” and said they shared the same goal — “ taking back our communities , from Waite Park to Blaine to Stillwater . ”
“ We both saw that Washington , and our current member of Congress , are simply not working for us , ” Clark said in a statement .
The race is expected to be among the most expensive House races in the country .
Reed and Clark have raised more than $ 1 million each .
The National Republican Congressional Committee pounced on Reed ’s announcement , saying in a statement that Republicans should thank her for bowing out and guaranteeing Bachmann an easy win against Clark this fall .
“ With her penchant for backing massive job - killing tax increases and cheering on the reckless Obama agenda , Clark ’s liberal views put her far outside the mainstream among voters from St. Cloud to Stillwater , ” said committee spokesman Tom Erickson .

Andrew Sullivan is actually too kind when he says :
When Andrew Breitbart offers $ 100,000 for a private email list - serv archive , essentially all bets are off .
Every blogger or writer who has ever offered an opinion is now on warning : your opponents will not just argue against you , they will do all they can to ransack your private life , cull your email in - tray , and use whatever material they have to unleash the moronic hounds of today 's right - wing base .
Yes , the Economist was right .
This is not about transparency , or hypocrisy .
It 's about power .
And when you are Andrew Breitbart , power is all that matters .
There is not a whit of thoughtfulness about this , not an iota of pretense that it might actually advance the conversation about how to deal with , say , a world still perilously close to a second Great Depression , a government that is bankrupt , two wars that have been or are being lost , an energy crisis that is also threatening our planet 's ecosystem , and a media increasingly incapable of holding the powerful accountable .
Meanwhile , the GOP leaders , having done all they can to destroy a presidency by obstructing everything and anything he might do or have done to address the crippling problems bequeathed him by his predecessor , are now also waging a scorched earth battle to prevent the working poor from having any real access to affordable health insurance .
This is what the right now is : no solutions , just anger , paranoia , insecurity and partisan hatred .
When they do n't hold the Presidency , this vitriolic streak of hatred within the veins of conservatism can't control itself and so it 's unleashed on us all very openly .
Andrew Breitbart is a hatchetman in a long line of hatchetmen for the right wing .
They have existed before the ' I Jerk , ' and they will exist long after he 's gone .
I know every time one of them appears and acts so despicable it seems like it 's the first time anybody could be such a subhuman .
Usually guys like Breitbart attack minorities and the poor , but he has some cash in his pocket now and technology is much different than it used to be so he 's hoping to destroy lives of journos .
The conservative movement has always been about this type of politics .
It 's nothing new .
People need to pick up books and read about a thing called history .
It 's not very pretty ( movement conservatism ) and politics has had an ugly side to it for centuries .
While I was doing research for Over The Cliff , I came across information that truly disgusted me .
I 've been promoting our new book because I believe we capture the latest chapter of right - wing thuggery that has befallen America , the real victim of conservative hit men , but if you can pick up Rick Perlstein 's great book about Barry Goldwater called Before The Storm you will not believe what you read .
History just keeps repeating itself .
Here 's an example of the disgusting behavior of conservatives back in the days after Nixon went down in defeat to John Kennedy and Goldwater was becoming the rising right wing star .
And I 'll just say this : ' Remember the Dark Ages of Newburgh " via Chapter 7 : Stories of Orange Country :
I hope you can read the graphics .
It 's just a small sample of what Perlstein uncovered in his wonderful book .

The Big Shell was a large marine decontamination facility established approximately 30 kilometers offshore from Manhattan , New York .
The facility was comprised of two hexagonal structures , Shell 1 and Shell 2 , connected end - on - end , north to south .
Each structure consisted of a central " core " surrounded by six struts .
Contents show ]
History
According to the United States Government , the sinking of the USS Discovery in New York Harbor in 2007 caused a large quantity of crude oil to be discharged into the sea .
The government immediately responded with the construction of an oil fence .
Using chlorine derivatives , they sterilized the entire zone of polluted sea and constructed a huge marine decontamination facility .
Biological reactors managed in " nodes " were installed inside the Big Shell , and it became a symbol of environmental protection .
Also , the Big Shell utilized a genetically altered form of sea lice that had its DNA altered with that of the bacterium Pseudomonas to give it the ability to decompose crude oil through an enzyme in its body .
They were used to a great extent in order to reduce costs and the number of spill maintenance workers .
The sea lice were benign and harmless , but they had ravenous appetites , making them a pest as well .
[ 1 ]
Several of the employees , specifically at Strut E , were also avid gamers , and often arranged to have game software delivered to the Big Shell for their own personal usage . [ 2 ]
In reality , the Big Shell 's construction had merely been a cover story , to disguise the development of Arsenal Gear .
The oil had intentionally been spilt after the Discovery 's sinking , by a duplicate tanker sent by the Patriots , which had then been sank in the same area .
The original tanker had contained no crude oil at all , having instead been used to transport Metal Gear RAY , prior to its theft .
In 2009 , a terrorist group calling themselves the " Sons of Liberty " led by Solidus Snake , a.k.a. former President George Sears , attacked the Big Shell while a government sponsored tour was being held .
President James Johnson and the rest of the party were captured and taken hostage .
They demanded a ransom of $ 30 billion .
They also stated that if the government was unable to meet their demands , they would blow the Big Shell out of the water , which would result in the ignition of the remaining crude oil in Manhattan Harbor , creating an inferno .
The chlorides used to decontaminate the harbor would be ignited as well , releasing clouds of toxins containing catastrophic levels of dioxins , totally destroying the Hudson Bay ecosystem , with naught but a toxic soup remaining for centuries to come .
Solid Snake and Hal Emmerich of Philanthropy later discovered that the Big Shell had not actually been cleaning the environment at all .
[ 3 ]
Although it had several facilities that were utilized to clean up the oil spill , they had not been running at full capacity , as Snake learned during his infiltration of the facility .
Otacon also speculated that more crude oil may have been spilt into the harbor to replace any oil that was cleaned out of the bay , and deduced that the " toxic gas " theory sounded too suspicious to even be considered remotely true .
The decontamination effort that followed was staged in order to complete tests on Arsenal Gear and the AI , GW , as part of the S3 Plan .
It was because of this that the Big Shell was chosen for the location of Raiden 's engineered mission .
During the Big Shell Incident , the facility was damaged in several places by various attacks , battles and bomb explosions ;
Shell 2 in particular suffered heavy damage to its
Core section and the connecting bridge between the two shells was also destroyed .
Finally , the entire Big Shell was completely destroyed altogether when Arsenal Gear went active , as the chains holding the structures in place were severed , causing the struts to break apart and collapse in on each other before sinking into the sea .
Layout and functions
The Big Shell was composed of two " shells , " each containing six struts around the core of the shell .
Oil fences were also erected in order to contain the crude oil .
The facility was also almost completely automated , which meant that there were few human personnel required at the Big Shell .
The steeple - like structures dotting the facility were piles installed to draw up the polluted seawater , which is then stored in a sediment pool ( see Strut D ) , and then travels to Shell 2 for the oil to be removed from the sea water and eventually traveled to Strut L for it to be completely sterilized before flushed out .
Each of the strut pillars , from the waterline up to the actual strut platforms , also had a height of approximately 40 meters , or 130 feet . [ 4 ]
The two shells were connected by a bridge .
The Big Shell balanced itself by attaching shell struts to the shell core .
If both shell cores were to be destroyed at the same time , the entire facility would collapse .
Most of the functions and layout were given out in a brochure . [ 5 ]
Each shell 's main struts are hexagonal in shape , while the shell core is square - shaped .
Shell 1
The Shell 1 Core was one of the more important facilities , and it was the center of the Big Shell :
Its first basement floor contained a meeting hall that was used for the receptions for the President as well as the environmental protection inspection team .
Because of it being used by high - ranking officials , it also contains biometrics scanning equipment at the door to the meeting hall .
A break - room is also situated nearby .
The second floor basement contained a computer room that was used to monitor the flow of polluted water and the status of filtration , as well as where all tasks of the Big Shell are carried out .
Presumably , the computer room also was the location where GW was being programmed , which made security in this area very tight .
The second floor basement also contained a large door that led straight into Arsenal Gear .
Strut A contained a pump facility to supply energy for the circulation of polluted sea water into the sections of the Big Shell , although the pump facility itself was actually congregated in the southern section of Strut A .
The controls for the pump facility were located in the northern section of Strut A. Strut A also contained a dock that was used for deep sea submarines to investigate for damages around the Big Shell underwater .
Strut B acted as the electric generator of the entire facility , with its power substation being located on the first floor .
As such , its transformer room also required electric appliances such as PSF - Z1s [ 6 ]
Strut C was the residential area of the facility , which contained a kitchen , a pantry , restrooms , and a mess hall to support the few workers it has .
Strut D contained sediment pool no .
1 , which was a facility where polluted water was stored without disruption so that its large pollutants could settle and then be extracted from the water .
Strut E contained a heliport , which was used as an aerial transport hub to deliver supplies to the facility due to the oil fences surrounding the Big Shell cutting off its sea entrances from seafaring transport vessels .
Strut E also contained a conveyor system that transports supplies throughout the different areas of the facility , to which it sorts the supplies to where it needs to go via the markings of its containers .
Strut F acted as a warehouse for several of their equipment that they did n't have any immediate use for .
At least one set of equipment included toys such as action figures . [ 7 ]
Shell 2
The Shell 2 Core was where the actual filtration system resided .
It purified the waters via benign bacteria in the area that broke down the oil in the water via microbes decomposing microcarbons .
The area below the first floor contained a vat for this purpose .
As a side effect of the microbes decomposing the oil by absorbing large amounts of oxygen in the purification chamber , the water within the chamber also had its buoyancy virtually eliminated , which meant there was virtually no chance of getting back to the surface once one falls into the vat .
The first floor also contained an air purification facility that eliminated the stench from the seawater that resulted from the oil spill .
However , the vat broke at some point , causing the shell to flood in areas below the first floor .
Strut G contained the oil processing facility .
Strut H contained a warehouse . [ 8 ]
Strut I contained an assembly facility .
Strut J contained a power plant .
Strut K contained a biochem lab .
Strut L contained the effluent processing facility , which treated sea water that was expunged of oil was treated with chlorine and other chemicals to sterilize and disinfect the sea water so it could be made suitable for flushing back into the ocean again .
The strut also contained an emergency ladder of a height of at least 40 meters / 130 feet . [ 4 ]
Equipment
Deep sea submarine
The Big Shell lacked life boats , and this along with its long distance from Manhattan 's shore was the reason why Snake , Raiden , and Otacon had to use the stolen Kasatka transport chopper to evacuate the hostages on Big Shell . [ 10 ]

Wharf roach : [ 13 ]
A crustacean of order Isopoda under the family Ligidaie that lives primarily near reefs and seashores .
They have antennae and seven pairs of legs .
Although their normal diet usually composes of algae and dead organisms , the variety on the Big Shells were created in a lab and genetically engineered to break down the spilled oil by splicing their genes with that of the bacterium Pseudomonas so they could absorb and eat oil .
This ability was the reason why the Big Shell itself was oil - free , although they also seemed to enjoy rations .
In addition , they had an aversion to cold vapor , meaning that a coolant spray would drive them away .

Behind the scenes
The Big Shell is a major location in the 2001 game Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty .
Hideo Kojima had come up with the idea for the Big Shell being an oil platform in order to fulfill one of two scenarios he had in mind for the second game : specifically , infiltrating an immobile area , as he had already utilized Alaska for the previous game . [ 14 ]
In Hideo Kojima 's " Grand Game Plan " for Metal Gear Solid 2 , the Big Shell was originally to have been called the Big Blue Apple ( a combination of " Big Blue Sea " and the " Big Apple , " nicknames for the ocean and New York City , respectively ) .
There was also to have been an aquarium for all of the aquatic wildlife in the Hudson Bay , which could be used to monitor and identify wildlife via a miniature submarine device , as well as have Doc give more details on the marine environment and fauna when contacted .
It is also implied that it " drew out " gold and silver minerals from the sewers .
These features ultimately never made the cut .
Additionally , although the Big Shell 's involvement in Arsenal Gear 's construction was the same , it was originally to have been constructed to raise up the USS Discovery ( nicknamed the Arsenal Ship ) and recover valuable data on Arsenal Gear in order to resume its development .
The Big Shell bears a striking resemblance to a series of British World War II anti-aircraft facilities , all of which featured a central core surrounded by octagonal struts .
Mother Base , the offshore base of operations for the Militaires Sans Frontières in Metal Gear Solid : Peace Walker , as well as the offshore base of operations of the same name used by Diamond Dogs in Metal Gear Solid V : The Phantom Pain , both have a similar hexagonal design to the Big Shell .
In the IGN live demo for The Phantom Pain at Gamescom 2015 , they even directly compared Mother Base , or rather , one of the Forward Operating Bases , to Big Shell .
A rubber ducky and a Vulcan Raven action figure can be found in the flooded chambers of Shell 2's core .
Big Shell acted as the password for an " encrypted file " on the Metal Gear Rising : Revengeance website .
The file in question was a corrupted blueprint of a cross-section of RAY .
The Big Shell also appears in the Versus Battle for the series official site .

After years of having its news generated by algorithms , Google News is testing a new " Editor 's Pick " section with publishers , enabling them to select and promote specific content to users .
The new feature — a module of content that is hand - picked by editors at partnering news organizations — with a " small percentage " of users , according to report by Megan Garber of Nieman Lab .
Partners include less than a dozen publishers , such as Reuters , Slate and The Washington Post .
Although social media and other web tools have enabled users to personalize their news streams , the ubiquity of content has created an echo chamber that some readers are trying to parse through to find not only what they want to know , but the news they " need " to know as well .
This is where human " editors " and curators play a crucial role in helping readers filter through the noise .
And although it is only a small test , it marks a significant shift for Google News , which includes the footer tagline : " The selection and placement of stories on this page were determined automatically by a computer program . "
See the screenshot of stories picked by Slate 's editors below :
The Value of Curation in the Age of Personalized News
It may be a step in the right direction for Google — who began experimenting with new content formats to present content using the likes of FastFlip and contextualized content with Living Stories — to help news organizations and showcase the curation expertise of editors .
It can also give publishers the opportunity to put forward and promote content that may not be performing well in terms of traffic or meme value , but are important to share in the interest of public awareness ( i.e. government scandals to hold officials accountable , human rights injustices in countries afar , etc. ) .
There is no doubt that news has become increasingly social ; readers are often pointed to content that is recommended by friends on Facebook , Twitter and Digg .
That 's because there is a lot of value in receiving news from friends , whom often have similar interests .
News That Content Farms Can't Point You To
Limor Elkayam , the founder of iSpotAStory.com , which curates content from the Web using editors , told Mashable that she thinks that Google is realizing the value and benefit of having human editors filtering content .
" Computer algorithms are great for many things , but when it comes to news , people still want that human element , telling them what they should read or pay attention to ; it's why people love Twitter for getting news ... there 's a human behind it . "
Whatever Google decides to do with the feature , it has the potential to add a lot of value to readers in getting pointed to content by professional journalists .

Is this a feature you find worthwhile ?
R. Henry Gurr ’s book played an important role in my interest in car design .
After seeing GM ’s show car display in the infield at a USRRC road race at the Riverside International Raceway in 1964 ( which included the Monza GT ) , I had a letter on its way to GM Design Staff the next morning inquiring about how to become a car designer .
GM ’s response included photos of several of the cars I mentioned seeing , a list of schools I might consider , and a recommendation to purchase the book , Automobile Design by Henry Gurr .
I ordered the book and still have it .
R.H. Gurr had quite a career with Disney after leaving Ford .
There is a great interview with Bob Gurr at the Walt Disney Imagineering Fan Club site , and a candid biography at the Laughing Place which connects Disney fans throughout the world .
You ’ll really enjoy reading Bob ’s the interview and biography .
In Automobile Design are illustrations and renderings by Henry Gurr , Ron Hill , Stan Parker , Bob Caderet , and others .
There are several great examples of bold pencil renderings , sports cars in action illustrations , and Prismacolor pencil on Canson .
Be sure to check out the comments for more information and images !
Back cover copy :
Automobile Design , Subtitle : The Complete Styling Book
Published in 1955 by Dan R. Post Publications , Arcadia , California
Text and Illustrations by R. H. Gurr
Here is the book to open new fields of thought and action for anyone interested in the design and styling of car .
Whether used a the handbook for comprehensive drawing and design instruction , for gaining a qualified background of manufacturers ’ view and professional design approach and technique in preparation for automobile styling as a career , for reference to it gold mine of fascinating illustrations in the development of a single glass fiber or steel - bodied custom car , or only to elect from it beautiful renderings suitable for framing Automobile Design is the kind of book you ’ll not only enjoy but will be proud to share with friends .
Here are the rudiments of automobile drawing in plain crisp language , with an unequalled selection of supporting sketches and renderings .
This is the book that will turn armchair doodler into artist of professional stature , and produce among the casually interested a pencil - pushing effort revealing latent ability .
R. H. Gurr is an outstanding professional automobile designer .
His experience following graduation from The Art enter School — the west ’s leading job - condition prep school — has included a stint at one of the largest manufacturers in Detroit , special product work as an associate of George Walker Industrial Design , and his recent development of the utopia cars and car and truck antique replicas for Disneyland .
He possesses a rare combination of creative and rendering ability , coupled with crystal - clear engineering comprehension .
Automobile Design is the greatly enlarged , contemporized version of the book originally titled How to Draw Cars of Tomorrow .
Coverage of the subject has been improved by the inclusion of important new chapters , together with a great number of additional illustrations , including the rendering work of several other professional automobile designers , among whom are Stan Parker , Ron Hill , and Bob Caderet , all currently of General Motors ’ Studios .
Some of the facts pertinently revealed here may shock the reader .
Nowhere else between the covers of a book can such candid and unbiased view of manufacturer ’s aims , designers ’ problems , and consumers ’ benefits be found — confidential observations of such impact they could never have been said had the author been committed professionally during the period when the book was written .
You ’ll quote it , but if your friends pick up this book you will have to tie it down to keep it from disappearing .
Law - Abiding Citizens Heart Gangsters
The Red & Black Cafe in Portland , an anarchist establishment , has been the center of controversy — and that ’s an understatement — over its request that a police officer leave the premises .
Seems that , given some questionable shootings involving local cops , he was making the clientele a little skittish .
Surveying reader comments in the various Internet venues where the story has been covered has been an enormous — if appalling — window on the authoritarianism of what passes for our political culture .
One commenter wrote , based on his observation of “ vicious street crimes ” : “ You are fools living in a bubble for thinking we do not need the thin blue line . ”
If anyone qualifies as a fool living in a bubble , it ’s someone who seriously believes that the only people the police go after are those engaged in “ vicious street crimes . ”
Over the past thirty years , thanks to the War on Drugs and assorted other moral panics , mainstream police culture has been relentlessly militarized and the due process guarantees of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments turned into toilet paper .
The entire Drug War culture is a corrupt empire built on civil forfeiture robbery , coerced testimony from jailhouse snitches , warrants obtained on perjured testimony , entrapment operations that should be illegal , planted evidence , and plea bargain blackmail .
Cops have become beasts of prey , viewing urban populations as an occupied enemy to be terrorized and intimidated into submission with shows of force .
Urban cops openly brag about showing the general population who ’s boss .
You think it ’s a coincidence that they ’ve almost universally shifted to black Nazi Chic uniforms ?
The cops and their sympathizers who commented on the Portland story have essentially admitted as much .
Bruce , a 26 - year police veteran , commented that all the allegations of excessive force in Portland involved someone who “ was not complying with the Officers orders . ”
There you have it : either obey authority figures without question and to the letter , or you deserve to be killed .
Another reader , BuffaloDan , contributed this little gem : “ ‘ Vegans ’ who feel ‘ persecuted ’ probably have a bag of weed on them .
Try obeying the laws and you wo n’t feel so ‘ persecuted . ' ”
Or as they say at Bob Jones University , “ the problem no doubt lies with you . ”
Because in Pleasantville , where The Policeman is Your Friend , Officer Friendly never goes after anyone who ’s not clearly a “ bad guy ” ( apparently with “ lawbreaker ” tattoed on his forehead , same as the folks in Arizona with those “ illegal alien ” tattoos ) .
Now let ’s all finish our tuna casserole and jello mold in time for Lawrence Welk !
I challenge anyone who shares these sentiments to subscribe to Radley Balko ’s blog for a month .
There are dozens or hundreds of SWAT raids every week all around the country , for simple possession , with the same kinds of unannounced 3 AM breakins that used to be associated with the Gestapo and OGPU .
You can read every week of people tasered to death or physically brutalized for “ resisting arrest ” when in fact they were in diabetic comas or having epileptic seizures .
You can read of people ( including grandmothers and little girls ) beaten within an inch of their lives for “ noncompliance , ” despite posing absolutely no physical threat of any kind , simply because the alpha male cop went off on them like a pit bull on angel dust in the face of a lesser creature that refused to show its belly .
And unless someone ’s lucky enough to have clear video footage to prove the cops are lying each other up — and usually not even then — you can count on the worst happening to them being suspension with pay pending a pro forma finding that “ all procedures were followed ” and there was “ no evidence of wrongdoing . ”
Remember that quote from Martin Niemöller that starts out “ First they came for the Jews … ? ”
Keep telling yourself , if it makes it easier for you to go to sleep at night , that it will never happen to you so long as you ’re a good , pink little citizen who keeps his nose clean , because the police are a thin blue line between your pink little suburb and chaos , that they only go after the “ bad people ” and “ troublemakers . ”
But you ’re living in a bubble .

Link gets back on the saddle
Nintendo as usual is working on some new Zelda installments , these for the Wii and DS .
The first -- The Legend of Zelda : Skyward Sword -- is due for the former platform , and continues in the vein of Twilight Princess with motion control , though taking it a step further with WiiMotion Plus support .
The new scheme will allow you to access inventory items and use them at will with simple movements , one of which involves the new whip weapon .
That should give Konami ideas ...
Though it appears to be something of a mish mash of Twilight Princess and Wind Waker , Nintendo says " it will offer a multitude of new game - play mechanics , giving it a refreshingly different feel from all of the past titles in the series . "
Let 's hope it's not a load of bullhockey , as the Zelda series has traditionally prided itself on reinvention .
Skyward Sword will release next year .
The second is an update of the beloved Ocarina of Time , enhanced for the 3DS with high resolution and 3D support .
You can't see it much from the image gallery , but we 're told it looks great in action .
Not much else is known about the game , unfortunately , but we can't wait to get our hands on it to see the classic in a new light .
That 's all for now -- stay tuned to our feature section for hands - on previews of Zelda titles and more from E3 .

Glastonbury 2010 - The Countdown Is Over
South Australian police say it appears the leaders of a secretive religious sect may have been stockpiling weapons with plans to move to a Pacific island .
Guns , high - powered ammunition and explosives equipment have been seized in raids on 12 properties in and near Adelaide linked with the Agape Ministries of God .
Four people have been arrested or reported for firearms offences , but police say the sect leaders have not been located .
The largest seizure was at Mount Magnificent , south of Adelaide , where detonators , fuses and 20,000 rounds of ammunition were found in a shipping container .
Detective Superintendent Jim Jeffery says ammunition was hidden in steel - framed bed heads .
" These findings of course are very concerning for the investigators , particularly given that it 's suspected that high - powered weapons have been fired on that property up at Mount Magnificent , " he said .
" The reasons for stockpiling and hiding this ammunition clearly needs to be ascertained and we have n't located those weapons as yet . "
Two men - a Mount Compass man , 49 , and an Upper Sturt man , 46 - have been arrested and another two men , 48 and 38 , have been reported for firearms offences .
George Kruszewski lives near the Agape Ministries property at Oakden in Adelaide and says the group has the hallmarks of a cult .
" I know a few of the people that are , you might say , the inner circle of people there .
They seem to be involved in finance and business and that sort of thing , you know doing deals and in fact one of them said he'd lend me any amount of money I wanted provided it was over $ 10 million , " he said .
Roger Gore also lives nearby .
" The whole place is just very quiet , very secure and I suppose from a distance like we are here you would wonder what goes on in there , " he said .
" The delivery vans go in and come out . "
Major fraud , firearms and commercial and electronic crime sections of the SA Police are involved in the ongoing investigation .
We put a lot of trust in our teachers – as pupils we trust that they know what they are talking about , and as parents we trust that they are educating our children .
But unfortunately ( and no doubt unintentionally ) many of our teachers repeat the same myths that they were taught .
Through the Internet we pick up the odd myth here and there and even in books and papers we see the same errors being repeated .
This is the third in our “ fact ” debunking lists – the other two are : Top 10 Fascinating Facts That Are Wrong , and 10 More Fascinating Facts That Are Wrong .
As always , be sure to add any of your favorites via the comments below .
10 High - Fructose Corn Syrup
Myth : high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) is making us fat
Since HFCS entered the American food supply in the 1970s , and the rates of obesity started to rise about then .
Consequently , many blame HFCS for the fat plague .
It ’s true of course that the calories HFCS contributes can be linked to the nation ’s obesity problems , but its calories are no different from those in refined white sugar : the makeup of HFCS ( 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose ) is close to that of white sugar ( 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose ) , which means that our bodies digest HFCS and sugar in very similar ways .
Nutritionally speaking , the two are virtually identical .
Interesting Fact : Coca Cola produced in Mexico is still made with sugar ( as opposed to corn syrup in the US ) , and many people claim to be able to taste the difference – refusing to buy the “ inferior ” American coke .
Unfortunately a truly scientific blind test has not been done and the various tests online all vary widely in their conclusions .
9 Cell Phone Cancer
Myth : Cell phones cause brain cancer
Lawsuits and news headlines have fueled the myth that cell phones cause cancer , particularly brain cancer , and 30 percent of Americans still believe this myth , according to the Discovery Health / Prevention telephone survey .
Consumers could easily have missed the reports showing no danger from cell phones because they did n’t receive alarming front - page coverage like the original reports .
A few studies suggested a link with certain rare types of brain tumors , but the consensus among well - designed population studies is that there is no consistent association between cell phone use and brain cancer .
[ Source ]
Interesting Fact : The very first patent for a cell phone like device ( wireless telephone ) was granted in 1908 to Nathan B. Stubblefield who some people claim invented the radio before Tesla and Marconi .
Stubblefield died as a self - imposed hermit by starving to death .
8 Horse Statues
Myth :
The number of hooves in the air on a statue of a horse tells us how its rider died
In my research for this list I was very surprised to come across this myth – I , like many others , had always believed it to be true !
The idea is that when a statue of a horse has one foot in the air , his rider was wounded in battle but survived .
If he has two hooves in the air the rider was killed , and if he has none in the air , the rider survived .
While this is a myth – interestingly it does seem to apply to the majority of statues relating to Gettysburg equestrians though not James Longstreet who was not wounded but his statue does have one leg raised ( pictured above ) .
Interesting Fact : A statue of a horse with a rider is called an equestrian statue – which is derived from the latin “ eques ” for Knight and “ equus ” for horse .
A statue of a horse is called an “ equine statue ” .
7 Round World
Myth : Christopher Columbus discovered that the world was round
This is a very old myth that is surprisingly believed by millions of people .
What we are told is that the Genoese Columbus ’ peers doomed his trip to failure because they thought he would fall off the edge of the earth .
Now – this was in the 1490s but man has known the earth was round since the idea was first put forth by Pythagorus 2,000 years before Spain even existed .
Columbus did fail to reach his original destination , but in so doing he discovered the Americas .
Not a bad end to a failed journey really .
The round earth theory was so well established that the navigational methods at the time were all based on the fact that the earth was round .
Interesting Fact :
At the age of 53 , Columbus returned to Spain from the Americas and was promptly arrested with his two brothers for the atrocities he had committed .
They remained in jail for six weeks before the King finally released them and restored their wealth and property .
Columbus believed that his explorations to the New World would result in the beginning of the Last Judgement of man .
6 Bananas Crisis
Myth :
In ten years there will be no bananas left
There is some basis in truth to this myth ( as is often the case ) – there is a disease ( fusarium wilt , or Panama disease ) that is threatening bananas in some Asian countries and it is the Banana most Americans are familiar with ( the Cavendish banana ) but it is not likely to wipe out the entire world ’s stock of bananas – or even the Cavendish banana as it has not infected some of the larger exporting farms .
Furthermore , the cavendish is only one of roughly 300 types of bananas that are available and good for human consumption .
Interesting Fact : Bananas do n’t grow on trees – the plant that produces the banana is actually a herb .
5 Newton ’s Apple
Myth : Newton devised his universal law of gravity when an apple fell on his head from the tree under which he was sitting
It is always exciting to think of a great discovery happening in the blink of an eye due to a coincidental event – we consider that if it were not for the right person being in the right place at the right time , man would have lost an incredibly significant piece of knowledge .
For this reason people have clung to the idea that Newton devised his universal law of gravity because of an apple hitting him on the head .
But in fact the first mention of an apple in relation to Newton came 60 years after his death : “ Whilst he was musing in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity ( which brought an apple from the tree to the ground ) was not limited to a certain distance from the earth but that this power must extend much further . ” ( John Conduitt )
Interesting Fact :
Though he is better known for his love of science , the Bible was Sir Isaac Newton ’s greatest passion .
He devoted more time to the study of Scripture than to science , and he said , “ I have a fundamental belief in the Bible as the Word of God , written by those who were inspired .
I study the Bible daily . ”
He spent a great deal of time trying to discover hidden messages within the Bible .

4 Typhoid Mary
Myth : Typhoid Mary , the most dangerous woman in America , killed hundreds ( if not thousands ) by infecting them with typhoid
The story is Typhoid Mary is relatively well known and it certainly is true that she ( Mary Mallon ) carried Typhoid fever without catching it herself .
It is also true that she caused human deaths as a consequence .
What is not true is the enormity of the carnage she left behind her .
In fact , Mary ( who worked as a cook ) caused 30 – 53 ( different sources cite different numbers ) people to catch Typhoid , but only 3 of those people died .
When it was first discovered that Mary was the cause of these people becoming ill , she was quarantined .
This was for a short time only as it was felt that it was unfair to quarantine her as others in a similar situation were not .
Mary was allowed to leave on the condition that she stop working as a cook .
She accepted the condition but unable to get a job paying as well as cooking , she took on a false name and began working at a hospital as a cook .
She caused 25 people there to become sick and one died .
For this reason she was arrested and put in quarantine until she died 18 years later .
She is pictured above in a bed during her first quarantine .
Interesting Fact : Typhoid is spread by the salmonella typhi pathogen which would normally be killed by the heat of cooking – but one of Mary ’s specialty dishes ( that was frequently requested by diners ) was her peach icecream .
Mary ’s lack of hygiene when using the toilet enabled the bacteria to transfer from feces to her hands .
3 Einstein Failed Math
Myth : Einstein failed math at school
This is a surprisingly old error which everyone seems to believe .
Its origins seem to be a 1935 article in the Ripley ’s Believe it or not magazine in which the myth first appears in print under the heading “ Greatest living mathematician failed in mathematics . ”
Many failing students probably take heart in the myth thinking that there may be hope for them if Einstein could flunk math and still become a genius , but unfortunately for them , Einstein showed genius from a very young age – including in the field of mathematics .
When he was shown the article from the magazine , Einstein laughed and said : “ I never failed in mathematics .
Before I was fifteen I had mastered differential and integral calculus . ”
Interesting Fact :
In 1905 , during his spare time , Einstein produced four papers that upended physics .
The first showed that light could be conceived as particles as well as waves .
The second proved the existence of atoms and molecules .
The third , the special theory of relativity , said that there was no such thing as absolute time or space .
And the fourth noted an equivalence between energy and mass described by the most famous equation in all of physics , E=mc^2 . [ Source ]
2 Titanic SOS
Myth : The Titanic was the first ship to send out the SOS signal
Initially the Titanic sent out the CQD signal ( standing for “ All stations : distress ” ) but Britain had recently signed up to the new standard of SOS so one of the crew suggested that it be used as well : “ Send SOS ; it ’s the new call , and besides , this may be your last chance to send it ! ”
It certainly was new to British ships , but the standard had been in use for some years prior and there is even a newspaper article from 1909 which describes its use by an American ship , the Arapahoe .
Interesting Fact : Contrary to popular belief , SOS does not stand for anything .
Some believe it means “ save our souls ” or “ send out ships ” but in fact , the signal was chosen because it was so simple to send that a person who was unfamiliar with radio equipment could send it in the case of an emergency (… / – – – / … SOS in Morse Code – is far easier than the previous distress signal of CQD : -.-. / – -.- / -.. ) .
1 Margarine Madness
Myth : Margarine is 1 molecule away from plastic
Americans eat four times as much margarine as butter every year which seems surprising considering so many people believe this little myth about the chemical spread .
While much of the negative stuff we hear about margarine is true , this particular myth is not .
Margarine is made by heating vegetable oil and infusing it with hydrogen – in other words saturating it to a point that it remains hard at room temperature .
It is then mixed with other ingredients to give a white lump that resembles fat .
Yellow food coloring is added and voila – we have margarine .
There is not one molecule of anything that you could add to margarine to turn it into plastic .
Interesting Fact : Margarine was invented because Emperor Louis Napoleon III of France offered a prize in 1869 for anyone that could come up with a cheap butter alternative for the army and the lower classes .
Hippolyte Mège - Mouriés ( a French chemist ) won the prize with his oleomargarine .
Governments around the world tried to stop people from using margarine by putting heavy taxes on it and banning its coloring .
Believe it or not , it is still illegal to sell butter - colored margarine in Missouri [ source ] and it was illegal in Quebec until July 2008 [ source ] .
Disgraced Jewish American lobbyist and businessman Jack Abramoff , who served three and a half years for fraud and corruption and was released this month to a half way house , has found employment at a kosher pizzeria , the Baltimore Jewish Times reported this week .
Open gallery view Jack Abramoff in 2006 Credit : AP
In 2006 , Abramoff pleaded guilty to fraud , tax evasion and conspiracy to bribe public officials in a deal that required him to cooperate with investigators probing his relationships with members of Congress .
The investigation into Abramoff led to the conviction of a congressman .
In 2008 , a Washington court found Abramoff guilty of bribing White House officials with holidays and expensive presents in exchange for political favors .
He was given a four - year sentence to be served in conjunction with previous charges related to defrauding American Indian tribes and corruption of public officials .
The owner of Tov Pizza , Ron Rosenbluth , said Abramoff began working there Monday .
Rosenbluth told the Baltimore Jewish Times that Abramoff works in almost all areas of restaurant business , with a focus on marketing strategy .
" We 're all Jews , " Rosenbluth told the newspaper .
" I 'm more than happy to help a Jew in any way I can . "
The restaurant owner says he has hired halfway house residents before and he thinks Abramoff could bring traffic to his 26 - year - old business .
Before his stint in jail Abramoff reportedly owned Signatures , a kosher restaurant located in downtown Washington , D.C .
Bikers Pedal across America with Message of Population Sustainability
On Thursday , Rick Oltman and I drove out to the Golden Gate Bridge for a friendly bon voyage to Frosty Wooldridge and three biker companions .
It was far too early in the morning for a proper champagne send - off , but Rick ( as Media Director for the Californians for Population Stabilization ) brought his video cam to record the serious reason for the event : to spread the word that continuing Washington ’s immigration / overpopulation policy is bad news for America ’s future .
Below , three out of four bike riders : left to right , Denis Lemay , Scott Poindexter and Frosty Wooldridge , with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background .
A press release set out the goals :
COLORADO TEACHER TO TRAVEL COAST TO COAST ON BICYCLE IN THE NAME OF OVERPOPULATION !
Frosty Wooldridge , Colorado teacher and world bicycle traveler , will depart on an epic coast to coast bicycle ride from the Golden Gate Bridge , San Francisco , 3,500 miles to Washington , D.C. in the Summer of 2010 . [… ]
Riders : Denis Lemay of Canada , Scott Poindexter of Colorado , Bob Johannes of Colorado , Frosty Wooldridge of Colorado
He rides with the purpose of alerting the public that America faces adding 100 million people within 25 years if it fails to change its current demographic course .
No amount of environmental conservation will afford a viable and sustainable civilization with the current high rate of growth .
Overpopulation issues that will be addressed include : 1 . Growing water shortages
2. Accelerating carbon - based energy crisis
3. Accelerating air pollution and acidified oceans
4. Species extinction , and quality of life for Americans
5 . Failed stewardship of a nation that will be handed to future generations
6. Solutions to overpopulation and continued population growth
The issue of overpopulation caused by out of control legal and illegal immigration continues to be one of the main issues shaping the future of our country .
Please support Frosty and his team .

In the video , Frosty further explains what he has in mind .
Happy trails across America !
Women 's body is the specimen of the continuing test of ultimate extreme softness .
Minyanville professor Kevin Depew made some important observations in a Buzz late in the day yesterday that I think are worth sharing with everyone .
Summer of Municipal Discontent
With fiscal years for states beginning on July 1 , this summer could very well bring a host of unwelcome headlines for financial markets .
Miraculously , Illinois has managed to surpass California in terms of fiscal distress .
Fine , we all know that fiscal woes are coming .
But here 's the nut of the thing :
Who owns this muni debt ?
Well , consider this round two for American households .
According to page 91 of the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds report , there is $ 2.8 trillion in muni debt outstanding .
Here 's the order of ownership :
Households ­ $ 1 trillion
Banks ­ $ 220 billion
Insurance companies ­ $ 350 billion
Mutual funds ­ $ 500 billion
Money markets ­ $ 370 billion
Broker / dealers own just $ 40 billion .
My friend Conor observes that , " for the cynical folks who think bailouts only happen if Goldman Sachs ( GS ) stands to benefit ... "
Well , that belief will likely be put ot the test .
Even worse , consider the fact that households make up a significant portion of holders of muni debt indirectly though the banks , insurance companies , mutual funds and money markets above .
The $ 1 trillion ownership figure is actually much higher .
And still worse than that , over the last three quarters the household sector has bought 80 % of all flows into munis .
Federal Reserve Flow of Funds
Warren Buffett recently declared he was nervous about insuring any muni debt , a business he eagerly took on in 2008 .
I would further note , given the reality of unfunded liabilities , mostly pensions , and the state of financial markets and continued declines in tax revenues - specifically in terms of property taxes - there is every opportunity for municipalities to default in great numbers .

Exxon researchers have already admitted that its dispersant products , Corexit 9527A and Corexit 9500A , are significantly toxic for aquatic life .
But no one knew how toxic the chemicals are for humans .
John Sheffield , president of Alabaster Corporation , which makes Sea Brat 4 , a safer , less toxic alternative to Corexit , contacted me with accusations that he believes Exxon has known for quite a while that the primary ingredient in Corexit is very toxic .
He included the material safety data sheets for various Corexit products and documents issued from the companies involved to support his claims , which I have pasted below ( pdf ) .
In some cases , I have included screen shots from outside sources ( CITGO , for example ) to bolster Sheffield ’s claims .
This gets a little dense , but the key word to look out for is ” Norpar , ” Exxon ’s line of solvants .
Sheffield writes :
This product ( Norpar ) is basically kerosene .
Although kerosene and napthalene ( cigarette lighter fluid ) are typically the main ingredients .
…
Norpar is a family of Exxon solvent products .
Chemical industry insiders have said Exxon froze that market to everyone including existing customers who had already purchased the products so they would have a large reserve stockpiled for use .
Which is an indication of the business they are doing and the business they expect to do .
Other transportation insiders indicate that as many as 30 tankers a day have been reserved by Nalco [ the company that makes Corexit ] .
The story is that Norpar solvent is the primary ingredient in Corexit .
The attached documents :
Documents publicly available reveal the true make up of Corexit and the “ proprietary ” ingredients !
1. Document titled “ Dispersion and Biodegradation of Oil Spills on Water ” by Exxon Research & Engineering Company .
www.iosc.org/papers/00544.pdf
This paper describes the ingredients of Exxon ’s Corexit 9500 as being “ a blend of Span 80 and Tween 80 in a paraffinic solvent , Norpar 13 . ” ( PDF document , Page 3 last two paragraphs . )
Section 2 : Composition / Information on Ingredients states : “ This product contains approximately 99 % linear paraffins , primarily C13 - C14 . ”
Carbon chains C12 to C16 are basically kerosene although they make up diesel and various heating oils .
The CAS Numbers ( chemical identification numbers ) on various Corexit products as shown upon the MSDS sheets as follows :
Corexit 9500 “ 64742-47 - 8 ” described as a naphthol which is like naphtha the main ingredient in cigarette lighter fluid .
From CITGO :
Corexit CAS
No is the same :
Norpar 13 “ 64771 - 72 - 8 ” is the chemical name for “ Kerosene ”
The proprietary “ organic sulfonic acid salt ” is disclosed in the 2001 patent filing US 6168702 described as “ Chemical demulsifier for desalting heavy crude ” owned by Exxon Research & Engineering .
From MSDS for Norpar 13 :
Product has a low order of acute oral and dermal toxicity , but minute amounts aspirated into the lungs during ingestion or vomiting may cause mild to severe pulmonary injury and possibly death .
This product is judged to have an acute oral LD50 ( rat ) greater than 5 g/kg of body weight , and an acute dermal LD50 ( rabbit ) greater than 3.16 g/kg of body weight .

Rockstar , the video game industry and millions of players ( not to mention investors in Rockstar ’s publicly traded parent company , Take - Two Interactive Software ) have been waiting a decade for this moment .
Ever since Grand Theft Auto III redefined single - player gaming in 2001 , Rockstar has been known as The Company That Makes G.T.A. , nothing more .
Sure , the company has found moderate success with its noirish Max Payne franchise and its Midnight Club racing series , but Rockstar has been eager to demonstrate that it can create a blockbuster out of more than the profanity - spewing drug dealers and submachine - gun - toting thugs who populate the world of Grand Theft Auto .
And now it has , though this project involved no small leap of faith ( and no small expense : between $ 80 million and $ 100 million , according to industry executives ) .
For a genre that has been so essential to the film business , it may seem surprising that the western has traditionally never lent itself to video games .
Then again , western games , like Activision ’s Gun from 2005 , have never sold well because there has never before been a western game that was truly made well .
And that may be because the western , perhaps more than any other genre , exposes how much more work is required to make a convincing game than to make a “ realistic ” film .
John Huston set Hollywood on its ear in 1948 with “ The Treasure of the Sierra Madre ” by shooting on location .
But all of those mountains and plains and ridges and gorges were already sitting there waiting to be photographed .
But if you want mesas and forests and gulches and rivers in a video game , you have to build them by hand , from digital scratch if you will .
Moreover , in a game you have to build all of it .
In noninteractive entertainment  be it a play , film or television program  the director controls exactly what the audience sees at every single moment .
That is why it makes sense to build sets that are nothing more than plywood facades : if the audience ca n’t see it , it has no reason to exist .
By contrast , a great western game allows players to roam the frontier as they please .
See that outcropping over there in the distance ?
You can climb it if you like , or just keep riding .
When you come into one of the many towns and villages there may be dozens of buildings to explore , and they are all populated with folks going about their daily lives , even if you never visit .
BP ’s shareholders may receive more this year from the company ’s coffers than those affected by the spill in the Gulf of Mexico will receive in their lifetime .
BP CEO Tony Hayward has indicated that he will go ahead with massive dividend payouts to shareholders in the aftermath of the worst oil spill in US history .
$ 10 billion in payouts are scheduled for this year .
The cost of the spill has been estimated in the tens of billions , but ExxonMobil only ended up paying a $ 507 million settlement for the 1994 Exxon Valdez spill after 20 years of appeals .
ADVERTISEMENT
BP ’s dividend ratio is now at 7.4 percent per year , more than twice the average payout of companies listed in the S&P 500 .
This means that US investors who hold BP stock effectively earn 7.4 % interest on their shares — more when US tax law is taken into account — in addition to any gains or losses as a result of price shifts in the stock ’s value .
Democratic senators Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) and Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) wrote to BP ’s CEO on Wednesday asking them to delay dividend payments until a reasonable estimate can be reached for the cost of the spill ’s cleanup .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ We find it unfathomable that BP would pay out a dividend to shareholders before the total cost of BPÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s oil spill clean - up is estimated , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â the senators wrote .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ While we understand the need to reassure shareholders that the disaster in the Gulf will not substantially impact BPÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s long term financial health , we are concerned that such action to move money off of the companyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s books and into investors pockets will make it much more difficult to repay the U.S. government and American communities that are working around the clock to stem the damage caused by this devastating oil spill , Ã¢â‚ ¬
Â  they added .
On the opposing side are some British cities and British pension funds , which depend on dividends like BP to pay retirees .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ BP ’s dividend is of crucial importance to the City and to the pensions of millions who depend on payouts from profitable companies to boost their retirement funds , ” the Guardian noted Friday .
“ Together with rival Shell , BP accounted for 25 % of the total dividends of Ã ‚Â £ 50 bn paid in the UK market last year .
Any cut in the dividend could result in investors selling BP shares , further weakening the company , which has lost nearly 30 % of its value since the disaster began . ”
If BP cuts its dividend , its share price would almost certainly fall further .
The company has lost nearly 30 % of its market value since the spill occurred Apr. 20 .
The decline has shaved tens of billions of the firm ’s market capitalization .
As of Friday morning , BP shares traded slightly higher in premarket trading on news that Hayward planned to keep the dividend intact .
Diane Abbott
Electoral Reform
Opposed to proportional representation as it would involve candidates being appointed from the centre and would break the constituency link .
Supports the introduction of the Alternative Vote ( AV ) .
Immigration
Britain must maintain an open immigration policy .
Anger over immigration is often a proxy for working - class concern over a lack of jobs and affordable housing .
The Labour movement must address these issues rather than pandering to right - wing xenophobia .
Iraq War
Opposed the war on principle and voted against it .
If Labour fails to address the issues raised by the illegal invasion it will lose the next election .
Spending Cuts
Argues that Labour should consider increasing taxation on high earners as an alternative to dramatic cuts in public spending .
But has cited Trident and the Afghanistan war as examples of cuts she would make .
Trident
Trident has no practical purpose and is maintained merely to avoid the charge that Labour is " soft " on defence .
It is not the weapon we need for the challenges and wars ahead and is wholly reliant on US technology .
Britain cannot persuasively argue for arms reduction if it insists on clinging on to its own nuclear deterrent .
Ed Balls
Electoral Reform
Supports AV but opposes proportional representation as it would break the constituency link and would institutionalise hung parliaments .
Immigration
Labour successfully controlled immigration from outside of the European Union but should have imposed transitional controls on immigration from Eastern Europe .
The pace of immigration was too much for some low - skilled and low - income communities to bear .
Iraq War
Would have voted for the war had he been an MP in 2003 .
Now believes that Britain made the wrong judgement and lacked the evidence needed to justify an invasion .
Spending Cuts
Balls has argued that Labour was wrong to pledge to halve the deficit by 2014 on the grounds that the cuts to public services would have been too great .
Has criticised the coalition 's decision to cut spending this year as economically illiterate , warning that it risks triggering a double - dip recession , and has urged Labour to mount an unambiguous defence of a universal welfare state .
Trident
Supports the renewal of Trident and argues that Britain would not strengthen its position in multilateral talks or in dealing with the Middle East by unilaterally disarming .
Andy Burnham
Electoral Reform
Burnham admits that there are severe weaknesses to first - past - the - post but argues that Labour should be wary of " rushing headlong " towards the alternative vote .
Has said that Labour should only support AV if it is in the long - term interests of the party .
Immigration
Labour has a dangerous tendency not to talk about immigration , leaving a vacuum for others to exploit .
In many parts of the country immigration was the biggest election issue .
Disagrees with Ed Balls and believes that it is essential to maintain the free movement of labour within the European Union .
The best way to address concern over immigration is to resolve issues such as the status of agency workers .
Iraq War
Voted for the war and continues to stand by that decision .
The issues of weapons of mass destruction and human rights were intrinsically linked ; the only way Saddam maintained his iron grip on the country was through the pretence that he had WMD .
Spending Cuts
Opposes the coalition 's decision to ring - fence health spending on the grounds that this will damage other services " beyond repair " .
Has called for Labour to reject cuts that damage the potential for growth and that limit the life chances of young people , such as cuts to university spending .
Trident
In an uncertain world it would be irresponsible for Britain to abandon its nuclear deterrent .
But the government should explore the possibility of greater co-operation with France and other nuclear states .
David Miliband
Electoral Reform
Supports the alternative vote because it retains single - member constituencies and ensures that all MPs are elected with at least 50 per cent of the vote .
Immigration
Immigration was a real election issue but it must be understood as one of fairness , not of race .
There are real fairness issues over the allocation of social housing , the regulation of the labour market and public services .
Iraq War
Argues that there was a clear case for invading Iraq based on the many resolutions passed by the UN demanding full compliance by Saddam Hussain .
But had Miliband known at the time that there were no weapons of mass destruction he would not have voted for the war .
Believes that the next seven years in Iraq will determine history 's judgement on the war .
There is now a chance that the Middle East will have only its third reasonably democratic regime .
Spending Cuts
Miliband 's deficit reduction plan envisages a 2:1 ratio of spending cuts to tax rises , rather than the 4:1 split favoured by the government .
Has proposed ending charitable status for private schools rather than " taking money from the poorest children " .
Trident
Britain is fulfilling its obligations under the non-proliferation treaty and has reduced its nuclear stockpiles by two - thirds since the end of the Cold War .
Scrapping Trident now would prevent Britain from aiding multilateral negotiations in the future .
Ed Miliband
Electoral Reform
Has praised the coalition 's decision to hold a referendum on the alternative vote and will campaign in favour of a " yes " vote .
Immigration
Labour must look beyond the symptoms and address the causes of fear over immigration .
It would be dangerous and wrong to call for an end to the free movement of labour within the European Union .
Iraq War
Believes the weapons inspectors should have been given more time in order to reflect the belief that war should always be a last resort .
Would have voted against the war had he been an MP .
Spending Cuts
Miliband has called for a 50:50 ratio of spending cuts to tax rises , rather than the 67:33 split favoured by Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling .
Argues that it was not the irresponsibility of the government that created the deficit but the irresponsibility of the financial services industry .
Trident
Supports the retention of an independent nuclear deterrent but believes moves towards multilateral disarmament should be encouraged .
Has called for the government to examine both the pace and the necessity of the renewal of Trident .
Britain should have the minimal possible deterrent required to maintain security .
Knesset - Abgeordneter über Konvoi - Angriff : " Es musste jemand sterben "
Die Soldaten sollten töten , um abzuschrecken .
Das glaubt Jamal Zahalka , der Vorsitzende der palästinensischen Knesset - Fraktion Balad .
Israel bleibe jetzt nur noch die Aufhebung der Blockade .
taz : Herr Zahalka , Ihre Parteigenossin Chanin Soabi ist auf einem der Schiffe , die heute Nacht von der israelischen Marine abgefangen wurden .
Stehen Sie in Kontakt zu ihr ?
Jamal Zahalka :
Wir haben seit gestern Abend nichts von ihr gehört .
Soweit wir wissen , ist sie aber nicht unter den Verletzten .
Wie kommt es , dass Frau Soabi gefahren ist und nicht Sie selbst ?
Normalerweise schickt jede Fraktion einen Teilnehmer .
Ich war schon vor drei Wochen nach Zypern gereist in der Absicht , auf einem der Schiffe mitzufahren , was sich aber aus technischen Gründen zerschlagen hat .
Was hoffen Sie zu erreichen ?
Wir wollen die Blockade brechen , die Israel über den Gazastreifen verhängt hat und die unmenschlich ist .
1,5 Millionen Menschen in ein großes Gefängnis zu sperren ist kollektive Bestrafung und verstößt gegen internationales Recht .
Jamal Zahalka Jamal Zahalka , 55 , stammt aus dem arabischisraelischen Dorf Kfar Kana , ist Chef der palästinensischen Knesset - Fraktion Balad ( arabisches Initialwort für " National - Demokratische Versammlung ) .
Zahalka gehört zu den schärfsten Kritikern der Trennanlagen und ist gegen die , wie er sagt , " Zerschneidung " der Palästinensergebiete in " Kantone " .
Was wissen Sie über die Organisatoren der Schiffe ?
Ich kenne die Organisationen nicht .
Tatsache ist , dass es sich um Aktivisten aus aller Welt und aller Religionen handelt .
Es sind Muslime , Christen und Juden mitgefahren .
Israel versucht sie zu delegitimieren , indem schon bevor die Schiffe überhaupt losgefahren sind , davon die Rede war , dass Terroristen an Bord sind .
Die Operation der israelischen Armee ist ein Akt der Piraterie und ein Kriegsverbrechen .
Israel hatte von vornherein geplant , hart zuzuschlagen .
Die Soldaten sollten Leute töten , um andere abzuschrecken .
Dann glauben
Sie nicht an die Version der Israelis , dass die Soldaten erst dann zu schießen begannen , als sie selbst in Lebensgefahr gerieten ?
Wer ein Schiff kapert , handelt nicht aus Notwehr .
Schon vor einer
Woche hat ein Sprecher der Armee gesagt , die Schiffe sollten um jeden Preis abgefangen werden , bevor sie Gaza erreichen .
Wir sehen jetzt , welchen Preis die Aktion forderte .
Vielleicht hat die israelische Führung nicht über neunzehn Leute entschieden , die umgebracht werden sollten , vielleicht auch nicht über zehn .
Sicher aber ist , dass jemand sterben musste , um den Abschreckungseffekt zu erreichen .
Wie wird es jetzt weitergehen ?
Balad hat über Streiks und Demonstrationen entschieden .
Rechnen Sie mit Eskalationen ?
Wenn es zu Gewalt kommen sollte , dann werden wir Araber die Opfer sein .
Es war bislang immer so , dass die Eskalation von der israelischen Polizei ausging .
Was tun Sie , um den Zorn in der arabisch - israelischen Öffentlichkeit abzumildern ?
Unsere Partei ist eine politische Bewegung , unsere Öffentlichkeit ist eine gewaltlose .
Wir rufen zu friedlichen Demonstrationen auf und zum Streik .
Was sollte Israel nun tun ?
Die Blockade aufheben .
Und wenn sich die israelische Regierung weigert , dann muss der Druck intensiviert werden .
Es kann nicht sein , dass man einen Staat , der 1,5 Millionen Menschen einsperrt , als normalen Staat betrachtet und mit ihm umgeht , als sei nichts passiert .
Israel verlangt die Freigabe von Gilad Schalit .
Dann würde auch die Blockade enden .
Warum lässt die Hamas Schalit nicht frei ?
Das eine hat mit dem anderen nichts zu tun .
Die Blockade hat angefangen , lange bevor Schalit gefangen genommen wurde .
Heute benutzt ihn Israel lediglich als Vorwand für das Embargo .
Warum wird immer nur Israel für die Blockade verantwortlich gemacht , wo doch auch Ägypten die Grenzen geschlossen hält ?
Natürlich sollten auch die Ägypter die Grenzen öffnen .
Das tun sie von Zeit zu Zeit , insgesamt aber viel zu wenig .
Die ägyptische Regierung kapituliert unter dem Druck der USA und Europas .
There 's a fever running through the Internet today - World Cup Fever .
Today 's Web traffic has been classified as " Heavy " for the better part of the day , according to measurements by Akamai .
At its peak , traffic for News sites globally started a steady climb about 6 am ET and peaked six hours later , at Noon ET , reaching nearly 12.1 million visitors per minute .
And even though the traffic dipped going into the afternoon , it stayed well above normal - registering some 6.5 million vpn , or 130 percent of normal - at 5 p.m. ET .
The bulk of the demand in the last 24 hours has come from North America and Europe - but all regions are reporting " Heavy " usage .
The traffic suggests that the Internet was most active during the Mexico - South Africa game and stayed heavy through the France - Uruguay game .
It 's also very likely that today being a workday had more people turning to their office computers to follow the action , instead of their TVs .
The day 's traffic far exceeded the previous record of 8.5 million vpm , which was set when Barack Obama won the U.S. presidential election .
Top 5 Frontline Digital Retailers - 2009 ( based on unit % share )
Top 5 Casual Digital Retailers - 2009 ( based on unit % share )
NPD Group claimed Wednesday that full - game PC digital download purchases reached 21.3 million in the U.S. during 2009 , nearly even with 23.5 million physical unit buys , signifying an important shift in purchasing habits .
The tracking firm said that , according to its estimates , PC digital downloads represented 48 percent of unit sales for PC last year , and accounted for 36 percent of dollar sales .
Retail sales of PC games declined 23 percent in the U.S. to $ 538 million in 2009 , NPD reported in January this year .
As online sales from downloadable content , full game downloads , subscriptions , microtransactions and mobile continue to increase , NPD is looking at ways to measure the impact of those emerging models on a regular basis .
Social gaming on networks such as Facebook also are bringing in new gamers who are willing to spend big money on virtual items .
developer Zynga alone is on track to bring in a projected $ 1 billion for 2010 , according to recent reports -- and those revenues are going under NPD 's monthly sales radar .
A recent Gamasutra analysis estimated that NPD 's monthly U.S. retail sales reports may have overlooked $ 2 billion in non-retail revenues in 2009 , or about 20 percent of the total reported industry sales for the year .
"
The popularity of social network gaming increased from Q3'09 to Q4'09 as 4.8 million more people played games on a social network in the U.S. , " said NPD game analyst Anita Frazier .
" This demonstrates how consumers can now experience casual types of games through myriad vehicles , broadening the competitive landscape .
" NPD also cited a 30 percent increase in iPhone and iPod Touch usage as gaming devices from Q2 2009 to Q4 2009 .
The firm said 97 percent of people who downloaded a game app last year also downloaded a free version of a game .
Additionally , NPD estimated ranks for the top digital retailers in the areas of frontline ( retailers with a focus on games also offered at physical retail ) and casual ( focus on smaller games with a try - and - buy or ad revenue model ) .

The Last Airbender will carve a new path in visual effects , showing you things no movie ever has : water tentacles and gusts of fire .
We visited Industrial Light and Magic , and saw what every other movie will be copying soon .
Advertisement
Whether Airbender satisfies fans of the classic Nickelodeon cartoon , and whether it succeeds in being a Star Wars for a new generation , one thing 's clear after spending the day at ILM :
It 's going to be an innovative film from a VFX perspective , maybe as groundbreaking as The Matrix was in its day .
Here are seven things the ILM team showed a group of visiting reporters a couple of months ago :
Advertisement
1 ) Fire that actually looks like fire .
This is a lot harder than it sounds .
Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman recounts that he went outside and lit some stuff on fire , so he would have a bunch of studies of real fire to show to director M. Night Shyamalan .
But when Helman showed the footage of actual fire to Shyamalan , his response was , " You know what ?
That fire looks CG . "
Even real fire looked fake .
" [ Shyamalan ] did n't think he was ever really convinced by CG fire in a movie , " says digital compositor Barry Williams .
What was the solution to creating fire that looked believable , and was able to " bend " in a way that still looked realistic ?
Burning Man !
The designers got hold of some footage from the annual neo - hippie festival in Nevada , in which someone is controlling a pillar of fire , and barely keeping it in check .
That footage gave the designers a clue to how to show the same sense of power and control , not to mention the structure of fire , in a simulation .
2 ) Showing water floating in a believable way .
Another really challenging element to show being bent was water — the designers searched for ages to find some reference films for this element .
They wound up with some YouTube videos , including one showing a guy punching through a water balloon , and one showing a guy being hit in the head with a water balloon in slow - motion .
Advertisement
Finally , they hit the motherlode : A NASA video of water in zero gravity .
The ILM crew showed us a video of Katara learning to bend water , filmed in Greenland .
A ball of water flies out of the ocean and Katara tries to keep control over it .
It starts to drip and finally loses its shape altogether .
The messy water bubble flies through the air , and it does look impressive .
It falls on her friend , and he 's pissed .
Advertisement
A later scene shows a master of waterbending fighting , with snakes of water everywhere , and tentacles coming out of a steam pot .
Katara manipulates the water to come out of some urns and cover the evil Prince Zuko , then freeze him .
He looks around anxiously , and then he 's encased in ice .

3 ) Figuring out what " air " looks like .
The whole point of Aang is that he's an airbender , so what does it look like when you bend air ?
Is it like a gust of wind ?
Is it like clouds ?
In the end , the ILM team decided that what you want to see is what the air is pulling up — whether it 's dust or snow , depending on what environment Aang is in .
They used the same algorithm for air that they 'd used for fire , except that they did n't render it as fire .
We saw some test footage showing Aang , with his hands tied , running around a room and climbing a wall while Prince Zuko shot fireballs at him .
In another scene , Zuko shoots fireballs at Aang , who 's spinning and waving his hands , using air to deflect them .
In another scene , Aang is surrounded by spinning doors , and the Fire Nation is attacking him .
He uses blasts of air to close the doors , and we saw how they rendered the lines of air .

" With the bending of the elements , you wanted to match the movements and the performance of the actor , " says VFX supervisor Christian Alzmann .
" You could n't really start designing until you had that performance in the can . "
The film - makers also decided that every type of " bending " should have its own martial arts style , just like a good Kung - fu film has the Crane style or the Dragon style .
Advertisement
Also , whenever someone manifests one of the elements , he or she has to do it in a way that 's personal .
We have to see it as an extension of their personality .
4 ) Momo , a CG creature with a real presence .
In The Last Airbender , Aang has a pet flying lemur named Momo .
The guy who brought Momo to life in this movie , Tim Harrington , also animated the famous sequence of Yoda attacking Count Dooku in Star Wars Episode II : Attack Of The Clones .
Advertisement
Noah Ringer , who plays Aang , carried around a blue - screen bag that stood in for Momo .
But when it came to putting Momo into the scenes , says Harrington , they had to make sure that Momo could really interact with Aang .
The VFX crew spent a lot of time at the zoo observing real lemurs .
Then they shot footage of Noah pantomiming with an imaginary lemur — sometimes he had to pull his arm in a little so that the lemur 's limbs would have a place to go .
" We really needed to know where his head is , where his shoulders are , where his arms were going to be , " says Harrington .
The hard part was Momo 's wings , which are based on a bat's .
Harrington spent a lot of time figuring out how to get the light to scatter through Momo 's wing membrane .
The mechanics of how Momo flies were based on the giant fruit bat , which Harrington figured was roughly the same weight .
But the wings had to be able to fold up and disappear when Momo was n't using them .
In an early prototype , they stuck out over Momo 's forearms , but then the designers folded the wings one more time , " so they folded nicely over the forearm , " says Harrington .
Advertisement
Here 's a new TV spot that gives your best glimpse of Momo so far :
5 ) A six - legged creature that walks naturally .
There 's no such thing as a six - legged mammal in nature , although obviously insects are six - legged .
So realizing Appa , the six - legged flying bison , was a major challenge , says Harrington .
Early versions of Appa were " a bit too far off - model from the show , " he adds , but the show 's creators and Shyamalan guided the VFX crew back to the show 's model .
Advertisement
According to Harrington :
We looked at polar bears , and we thought of the front two legs as arms that are offset slightly , and the back legs are legs ...
We looked at polar bears , bison [ and ] elephants to get kind of the physics and the weight right .
We also looked at beavers .
There are scenes where he actually swims and kind of uses his beaver tail in the water .
Advertisement
He showed us an early visualization in which Appa hovers in mid-air and a group of kids are hanging from his paws .
Appa is looking over his shoulder , as if to say , " Let 's get going . "
It starts as just a group of kids dangling in mid-air on a greenscreen , holding onto hangers that will be Appa 's wrist pivots .
Appa is added piece by piece , including his fur which responds to the wind , and his face , which has to be expressive and obviously intelligent — but not too human , or Appa becomes " creepy . "

" [ Shyamalan ] thought of him as the big quiet kid in the class , who 's really quiet and calm and keeps it together , but if a couple other kids get in a fight , he might be the one who steps in and keeps the peace , " says Harrington .
" Kind of a gentle giant . "
Harrington and other designers faced similar challenges creating the Komodo rhino , which the Fire Nation people ride into battle — real Komodo dragons " have kind of a dorky walk , " so the designers went for something closer to a bulldog 's movements .
He showed us an incredibly intricate composite CG shot of a Firebender riding a Komodo rhino off a ship , up a wall and over the top , where it shoots fire down at the people inside a walled city .

6 ) Facial motion capture .
James Cameron 's
Avatar already pushed the envelope as far as capturing an actor 's performance and translating it to CG goes , but Airbender may go even further .
If you do n't notice when Aang is n't being played by Noah Ringer , then Harrington and his crew will have succeeded .
Advertisement
There are actually three Aangs in the movie .
There 's Ringer , who 's an accomplished martial artist and actually plays the character most of the time .
There 's his stunt double Jade , a girl who 's roughly the same size and shape as Ringer , but you can kind of tell in some of the raw footage that it 's not really Ringer .
And then there 's a CG rendering of Aang , who 's doing some of the crazy acrobatics and ultra - dangerous stunts that no actor or stunt - person can do .
We saw one scene where Aang flees the Fire Nation and runs and skips across a whole bunch of piers , which wobble realistically , and you can see that it 's a long , long way down — this sequence is all CG , and there 's a moment where the flesh - and - blood Aang drops out of frame for a second , and then reappears as CG Aang .
To put Ringer 's face onto the other Aangs , Harrington captured a closeup of Ringer scowling and grimacing , with a billion dots to capture every aspect of the performance .
This is n't just like Benjamin Button , Harrington points out — they did n't just have to put Brad Pitt 's performance onto the old Benjamin Button without worrying if it was a perfect fit .
" This has to be a one - to - one match , " says Harrington .
" This takes the geometry and shrink - wraps it , like dead on , to these dots , and animates it to the dots . "
So Noah 's head is added to animated Aang , and in one or two cases , to the stunt - Aang , Jade .

7 ) Creating digital environments that feel like an extension of the real footage .
The locations the film visits are based around the styles of the different tribes — so for example , when you visit the Northern Air Temple , you see a lot of precipices and mesas that only an airbender can reach .
" They have the kites and they can control the air currents , " says Alzmann .
The production team studied a lot of temples in Burma and Cambodia and had someone actually do some filming in Vietnam , to make each shot look as real as possible .
Advertisement
Alzmann showed us one shot that started with a real valley , and then a computer generated temple and bridge were layered in — the temple is being sacked by the Fire Nation .
In general , the team took a " less is more " approach to layering in computer - generated details to all the scenes , aiming for the most photorealistic images they could create .
It was all part of the drive to make rural Pennsylvania and Greenland look like Asia .
Likewise , we see the huge armada of the Fire Nation , but the only physical prop was a short section of deck , and then the VFX team added the rest digitally .

The filmmakers put a lot of work into creating the contrast between the Southern Water Tribe and the Northern Water Tribe — you see that the Southern Water Tribe has lost everything and can't bend water very well any more , so they 're stuck making igloos .
Meanwhile , the Northern Water Tribe is the last bastion of free benders who have n't been captured by the Fire Nation , and their buildings have more ornamentation .
Their architecture is loosely based on Tibet , and Alzmann and Barry Williams put a lot of thought into creating a layout of their city that felt like people could actually live there .
An unreleased movie about the life of infamous hacker Adrian Lamo has leaked to BitTorrent .
The movie , titled Hackers Wanted , failed to get a conventional release following alleged conflicts between its producer and others on the team .
Lamo has been telling Torrent Freak how he feels about this unofficial release .
According to ‘ Hackers Wanted ’ director Sam Bozzo , the movie was set to explore the differences between true hackers and today ’s “ computer criminals ” and would follow the lives of hackers who found themselves arrested after pointing out security holes in computer systems .
“ Commonly thought of as computer criminals and vandals , a true hacker is an innovative thinker able to “ hack ” himself out of a given problem or situation , whether it be computer related or not , ” Bozzo explained .
“ Historically , hackers have accounted for mankind ’s greatest inventions and discoveries and yet have repeatedly been persecuted for their new ideas by the powerful and fearful , ” he adds .
The movie is about hacking , throughout history , and uses the story of Adrian Lamo , a hacker best known for breaking into several high - security networks and revealing network flaws in the systems of Fortune 500 companies , to exemplify it .
Even though he subsequently told the organizations of his findings he became wanted by the FBI for hacking into systems at The New York Times Co. & Microsoft .
The FBI were unable to find him , so Lamo – who always said he ’d face any consequences of his actions – negotiated his surrender through the U.S. Attorney ’s office , and handed himself over to the FBI .
It sounds like a great story so little wonder it was chosen to become the subject of a movie featuring tech celebrities including Digg ’s Kevin Rose , Leo Laporte and Steve Wozniak .
Sadly , although it was completed , internal conflict with its producer meant that it was unlikely to see a release , officially at least .
A little while ago ‘ Hackers Wanted ’ leaked to BitTorrent and is currently being shared , among other places , on The Pirate Bay .
As soon as we became aware of the leak , Torrent Freak made contact with Adrian Lamo to request a comment .
Clearly , as a former hacker , Lamo is acutely aware that the accusatory finger could be pointed at him , but he assured us that he had nothing to do with the leak .
Lamo told us that a release of the film was never going to happen , as the producer Dana Brunetti had too many “ ego conflicts ” with the cast and crew .
But the movie is leaked now , so how does Lamo feel about that ?
“ I ’m saddened that someone saw fit to violate our confidentiality , but in my heart , glad for all the cast , crew , and others who never would have seen their work recognized , ” he told us .
“ It ’s ironic that a film about overcoming barriers , about new technologies , about thinking differently , had to come to the public eye by being hacked out of the hands of people who , after making a film about the free flow of information , tried to lock away that information forever .
The truth tends to itself , ” he concludes .
Lamo is , however , pragmatic about sharing .
Readers will remember an article we published last year when director Sam Bozzo was persuaded by “ some hacker friends ” to feel more relaxed about reaching a whole new audience via a movie leak .
That hacker was Adrian Lamo .
It 's Our Energy Pearl Harbor Matt Simmons
By The Maritime Executive 01-03-2011 02:54:18
by Nichole Williamson , Assistant Editor , MarEx
Today , Tony Munoz , Editor - in - chief of MarEx and I had the pleasure of attending a speech given by Matt Simmons at the 7th Annual Energy Ocean International Conference , in Ft. Lauderdale , FL .
Mr. Simmons is the founder of the Ocean Energy Institute and is Chairman Emeritus of Simmons & Company International , one of the world ’s largest investment banking firms .
He now serves on the Board of Trustees for the Ocean Energy Institute , a non-profit research institute dedicated to development of ocean energy in all forms with a focus on offshore wind energy .
As a well - known and respected oil industry executive and author of the book Twilight in the Desert : the Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy , Mr. Simmons drew quite a crowd this afternoon .
He spoke about the oil spill in the gulf saying , “ It is the greatest human tragedy we ’ve ever had .
It is our Energy Pearl Harbor . ”
The oil spill must be attended to with the same “ intensity ” as was used by the U.S. in WWII after the attack on Pearl Harbor .
He says that BP has given us nothing but bad information about this disaster from the very conservative BP report of 1,000 barrels leaking a day to the release of the video that they say is the leaking oil .
Simmons claims there is a different source of the leak and the video being released to the media is just a 4 - foot oil plume , which is much too small to cause such a massive oil slick .
NOAA ship the “ Thomas Jefferson , ” a technologically advanced ship used for mapping the ocean floor , has found a 400 foot lake of heavy oil sitting at the ocean floor .
Mr. Simmons warned , with so much oil in the gulf ( what he believes has been 120,000 barrels a day ) a hurricane will spread oil over the entire gulf coast .
Matt Simmons does n’t hide his dislike for BP , calling them one of the worst run companies , who he believes will likely have to file Chapter 11 in the next few weeks .
A company so horribly run , it thought they could be “ self - insured , ” which is a relief to the insurance industry .
MarEx asked Mr. Simmons what the repercussions would be for Transocean , to which he responded “ Transocean is clean as a whistle on this . ”
BP will bear the full brunt of the damages .
Simmons reminded the crowd , the 11 men who lost their lives were Transocean employees and BP may face manslaughter charges for their deaths as well .
He also mentioned the story of a Transocean worker , Jason Anderson , who told his wife he was concerned about safety on the rig and that BP was straying from procedures to finish the well more quickly .
Jason took out a will and for four days had long talks with his wife about how to raise their children before returning to the rig .
Jason was one of the eleven to lose his life in the explosion on April 20th .
To refocus on the Energy Ocean Conference , Mr. Simmons predicts a massive fuel shortage in the near future and cites ocean energy as the last frontier .
He says the U.S. Government needs to endorse Ocean Energy to put it into action .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Amazon.com
Inc cut the price on its most expensive Kindle electronic reader , the latest salvo in a price war in response to Apple Inc ’s pricier iPad tablet computer .

Amazon.com is launching an improved Kindle electronic reader and cutting the price , in a move to address the threat from Apple Inc 's iPad tablet computer .

It was the second price cut for the online retailer ’s line of e-book readers in as many weeks .
Last week , Amazon cut the price of its cheaper Kindle with a 6 - inch screen to $ 189 , hours after bookstore chain Barnes & Noble Inc lowered the price of its “ Nook ” e-reader to $ 199 .
Both had cost $ 259 .
Amazon and Barnes & Noble could be forced to cut prices further on their devices to compete with the iPad , Which also functions as an e-book reader and which sold more than 2 million units in its first 60 days on the market .
“ ( Prices ) could go to zero , ” said Needham & Co analyst Charles Wolf , who said manufacturers should price the devices low to drive sales of e-books .
If priced correctly , e-books would make up for any losses on the e-readers themselves .
“ Amazon ’s model should be selling books - and to hell with the device itself , ” Wolf said .
“ The iPad is raising hell with everybody . ”
The price cut on Thursday was on the Kindle DX , which comes with a 9.7 - inch screen .
The company said it updated that reader to include a new graphite enclosure and a new , high contrast electronic ink display .
The reader will sell for $ 379 , down from $ 489 , and have free 3G wireless connection with no monthly bills or annual contracts , as the earlier model did , the company said .
The new Kindle DX is available for pre-order starting today and it ships July 7 .
The latest price cut comes as retailers such as Amazon and specialty book store chain Barnes & Noble try to protect their share of the e-books market , the rare bright spot in the moribund bookselling industry .
Earlier this week , Barnes & Noble said sales on its website , which includes e-books sold via the Nook , would rise this year by 75 percent and reach $ 1 billion .
It added the Nook will be central to reaching its goal of winning 25 percent of the e-book market within a few years .
It currently has about 20 percent of the e-books market .
But Barnes & Noble , the No. 1 U.S. bookstore chain by sales , also warned that investments to develop the Nook and its e-bookstore would weigh on results this year .
In addition to the iPad , the Nook and Kindle also compete with Sony ’s Reader device .
Industry experts and rivals say the field will get even busier , with more e-readers expected this year .
Borders Group
Inc is set to launch its own e-bookstore soon but is not developing its own reader .
Apple ’s iPad , launched in April at a starting price of $ 499 , but unlike competing models , it has a color screen and can be used as a full computer .
Still , some analysts say dedicated e-readers such as Nook and Kindle are appealing because they consume less power , are easier to read on , and weigh less .
Kindle ’s base price plunged even lower on Thursday morning to $ 149.99 -- but only for one day -- on Woot.com , the quirky online store whose purchase by Amazon was announced on Thursday .
By 9:30 AM ET , the e-readers were already sold out .
Shares of Amazon.com were down 1.2 percent on Thursday , while Barnes & Noble shares were down 2.1 percent and Apple shares were down 2 percent .
Gallagher plans to take it slow and not rush into any art projects .
TAMPA , FL — Despite having been hurt more times than he can count , local kindergartner Kyle Gallagher told reporters this week that he 's finally ready to get out there and start playdating again .

Gallagher , whose last serious relationship ended three months ago , said his decision to meet new children and return to the playdating scene was n't easy .
" I 'd be lying if I said I was n't nervous — after all , it 's been a while since I 've played spacemen with someone else , " Gallagher said between small sips from a grape - juice box .
" But I just can't worry about that kind of thing anymore .
It 's time to get back on that horse and see what 's out there for me . "
Advertisement
" I mean , I 'm almost five and a half , " he added .
" I 'm not getting any younger . "
According to sources close to Gallagher , the small child has focused on keeping himself busy in recent weeks by drawing pictures of ninjas and searching for hidden treasures in hopes of distracting himself from the pain of his recent breakup .

Despite his efforts to forget about Jeremy and the time the two spent together jumping up and down on his bed , Gallagher admitted Monday that he missed having someone to share the things in his life with , be they his electric train set , or the " giant , pointy sticks " he would oftentimes find in his backyard .
" The playdating scene can be shallow , and you meet a lot of kids who wo n't think twice before lying to your face , but there 's got to be that special someone out there somewhere , " Gallagher said .
" Look , I 'm not going to say that it 's not hard , because it is .
But what am I supposed to do ?
Sit in the corner and cry all day ? "

Added Gallagher , " Trust me , I 've done that already . "
Saying that all that he wants is someone to practice handstands with , or someone who has the same favorite color in common , the 5 - year - old told reporters that he was just going to take things one step at a time .

" I 'm not looking to get into anything serious right away , " Gallagher said .
" I 'm not necessarily ready to open up about my dreams of becoming a fireman or someday owning a trampoline , but it 'll be nice not to be alone anymore . "
" Just as long as they treat me with respect , I 'll be happy , " he added .
" I 'm tired of playing games . "

Gallagher said that his mother , Samantha , has been an additional source of frustration , due to her active role in his personal life .
" I keep telling her I 'm fine on my own , that I 'll start playdating again when the time is right , " Gallagher said .
" But she 's always nagging me about this person or the other that she wants me to meet .
I know she means well , but , give me a break .
She treats me like a baby . "

Despite the many challenges that lie ahead , Gallagher told reporters that he remained optimistic about finding a new best friend .
" Next year I 'll be in first grade , and I 'm starting swim classes , so I 'll have some options , " he said .
" I just do n't want to come off as desperate .
I want to have fun , learn how to write , and maybe even get a puppy dog named Oscar .
If I have time to dive into a new relationship , then great . "

" After all , playdating is like riding a bike , " Gallagher added .
" Whatever that 's like . "

FOR those people eagerly , and perhaps prematurely , counting down for the return of the warmth of the summer months , today marks a significant turning point on the calendar .
As the shortest day of the year descends on the Riverina , summer optimists can view today as a step closer to the end of the cold , miserable and dark winter months .
After the winter solstice comes to an end , residents will notice the days slowly growing longer , the nights shortening and the sun growing stronger and brighter as the last two months of winter play out .
Today at 9.28 pm the sun will be at the most northerly position of the year , known as the winter solstice , to make the shortest day on Australia 's calendar .
The sun will rise at 7.18 am and will set at 5.05 pm , giving a mere total of nine hours and 47 minutes of daylight .
This is in striking contrast to the 16 hours and 38 minutes of brilliant sunshine Londoners will enjoy on the other side of the world .
The sun will rise at 4.43 am and set at 9.21 pm over London today .

For months people had been asking me if I ’m still living in Victorville and if so , why I stopped writing about it .
Some dumbshit even accused me of running back to live the big city life , as if I was too embarrassed to tell people “ da trufe . ”
Well , I ’m still here , still proud , still shooting and perfecting my aim .
And I figure it ’s about time for me to crack my knuckles and see if I still got what it takes to do a proper Victorville update .
A lot of things have happened in the six months since my last dispatch .
For one , the tough economic times have begun to take their toll , forcing me to trade down my dream McTractHome for a doublewide trailer .
It overlooks a golf course and is in a quiet neighborhood on the other side of the freeway , filled with pensioners who retired out here in the 80s and have been waiting to die in doublewide trailers such as mine ever since .
My only neighbor is a grandma just like that , or at least I think she ’s a grandma .
Thing is , I have n’t seen her leave her house ever since I moved here six months ago , but I do hear someone who sounds like a frail old woman greeting a male nurse that comes over once a day to change her Depends .
Other than that , the flicker of a television set reflected in one of the windows is the only sign of life .
Sometimes I get the feeling that she spies on me .
I wonder what she thinks about the ghetto bird that constantly hovers above an apartment complex a few blocks away .
In other Victorville news , Ames visited a few months back and got arrested , I ate shit on my motorcycle , someone dumped a few tons of raw sewage — a.k.a. unprocessed human shit — on the edge of the city , someone else found a woman ’s head stuffed inside a backpack , the city is out of money and under grand - jury investigation for all sorts of fraud .
Oh yeah , and it seems like not a week goes by without a roadside shootout or the cops or the SWAT team being called to take care of a domestic dispute gone wrong .
Like this lover ’ quarrel from last November , which opened up just like a horror movie : with a woman smeared in blood running down a deserted suburban street yelling for help .
The wounded woman ran into the street screaming , “ He shot me , he shot me , ” according to witness Robert Evans .
Evans was on his way to visit a friend in the 16000 block of Majela Avenue near Village Drive and Clovis Street at about 3:40 p.m. when he spotted the victim .
“ She came running across the street right in front of my car and she was bleeding all over the place , ” Evans said .
Deputies arrived and ordered the man outside but he did not comply , officials said .
“ At that time we set up a perimeter and used the ( Sheriff ’s ) helicopter and units ’ ( public address ) to order him outside , ” Capt .
Cliff Reynolds said .
According to reports , the unidentified man and 40 - year - old victim were arguing when the shooting took place .
The relationship between the two was not established Friday night , although several witnesses stated the couple may have been married .
Several people were evacuated including Vanessa Serrano and her family .
“ This is kind of crazy , ” she said .
“ There ’s never been anything like this here . ”
According to initial reports , the man may have threatened to kill himself before he barricaded himself in the residence .
The SWAT team was in no rush , so by the time they stormed the house that evening , all they found was a corpse .
Obviously the cops were n’t paying attention ; they did n’t even hear the single tell - tale gunshot .
But hey , you ca n’t blame them for being lazy .
Just last week , the FBI announced that Victorville ’s crime rate has gone up , while the rest of the country , and even the surrounding Victor Valley , have seen major a drop .
These days , Victorville cops have to work overtime just to log all the various murders , shootings , stabbings , fights , armed robberies and botched drug deals .
Fatigue might have been the cause of this whoopsie daisy , which happened on March 1st , when a patrol car double - teamed a pedestrian in a one - two combo with a civilian vehicle .
I ’ll let Beatriz Valenzuela , the Daily Press crime beat reporter , take it away :
An unidentified man stepped into the path of a vehicle traveling east on Highway 18 and then was immediately struck again by a San Bernardino County Sheriff ’s patrol car , authorities said .
Investigators are now asking for help in identifying the man .
Robert Squire was traveling east on Highway 18 in his 2002 Mitsubishi Gallant Sunday night followed by an Apple Valley station patrol vehicle , according to sheriff ’s officials .
A man stepped directly in front of Squire ’s vehicle and was struck , sending the man flying into the air .
He was then struck by the Apple Valley unit .
Both Squire and the deputy stopped immediately to help the man and called for rescuers .
The man was airlifted to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center and his condition was unknown .
The man had no identification with him and is being referred to as John Doe .
He is described as an adult Hispanic man .
If a cop wants to do some real policing , all they have to do is pull someone over .
Chances are , they ’ll find some dope or nab a drunk driver , a car thief or a desperate hood who ’d rather shoot it out than allow them to drag him back to jail , like in this routine traffic stop which could ’ve been turned into one hell of a COPS segment :
A Victorville sheriff ’s deputy pulled over a vehicle near Mojave and Village drives Thursday evening when for unknown reasons , one of the occupants got out and began to argue with the deputy , pulled out a firearm and shot at her but missed .
At least one shot hit her patrol vehicle , sheriff ’s officials said .
The driver sped away with the deputy in pursuit .
The driver then made an abrupt U - turn and once again fired at the deputy again striking her vehicle , authorities said .
At that point , the deputy returned fire .
The 1993 Mercury Cougar sped off again .
The deputy then called for assistance , according to reports .
In total , witnesses reported hearing about five to six shots .
Numerous sheriff ’s deputies from neighboring stations and California Highway Patrol Units including a helicopter descended on the scene .
The guy was caught later that day , but you gotta give credit where credit is due : the hoodlum was one hell of a shot .
Just look at the position of that bullet hole :
He was able to squeeze off an almost perfect head shot , even while in mid-motion after busting a u-turn .
That shows experience , and reminds me of a local who told me that gangbangers go out into the desert to practice their drive - by marksmanship .
All in all , Victorville appears to be developing just as expected .
But there is a twist to the story .
Most people automatically assume that isolated subprime suburbs like Victorville will go the way of the Salton Sea , slowly emptying out and inevitably turning into ghost sprawl inhabited by degenerate half - mutant hobos .
It ’s a nice fantasy , but reality does n’t provide such neat , poetic endings .
As weird as it may sound , the exact opposite is true : Victorville is actually growing .
Fast .
A couple of months ago , U - Haul International released its annual “ Top 50 U.S. Destination Cities ” index , and guess what ?
For the first time , Victorville made the cut , ranking # 49 , ahead of Fresno and behind Miami , on the national list and # 11 for California .
That ’s right .
Far from disappearing into a sea of dirt and tumble weeds , Victorville is actually adding people faster than any other city in San Bernardino County , growing by 2.5 % from 2008 to 2009 .
Hell , Victorville grew at more than twice the rate of California , which added only 1.1 % in the same period .
Why ?
Well , it might have something to do with the cost of living and the fact that Victorville ’s rents have been in a race to the absolute bottom .
The market seems to be flooded with rental properties even more than it was when I moved here a year ago .
I was paying $ 1,200 a month for a 3 - bedroom McTractHome .
Now you can find a similar rental for under a grand — like this one for $ 975 .
Whatever else might be making people move , employment opportunity is definitely not it .
If you did n’t have a job before coming here , you might as well not bother looking .
But it does n’t look like people are commuting , either .
Three gas stations and a Starbucks in the center of town closed down recently .
So where are people getting the money to pay for their rentals ?
Is the whole city living on welfare ?
Stay tuned for more updates … maybe Ames will tell you about his run-in with the law .
For now , I ’ll leave you with this : a picture of my trailer ’s manufacturer tag , which is sorta like the ones sewn into clothes .
As you can see , it was made in the U.S.A. and should not be left out in temperatures under 25 ºF .

For some reason , BP continues to invest its resources in keeping journalists away from oil spill disaster sites .
The tactic is clearly failing –we all have access to horrific pictures of dead animals and oily beaches–but BP still insists on bullying reporters .
Of course , BP does n’t want to take the blame , which is why it has apparently hired mercenaries to shoo journalists away .
Scott Walker , a reporter with New Orleans news station WDSU , was recently blocked from interviewing BP employees working on a beach by mercenaries from a company called Talon Security .
This happened just two days after Doug Suttles , BP ’s COO , released this statement : “ Recent media reports have suggested that individuals involved in the cleanup operation have been prohibited from speaking to the media , and this is simply untrue . ”
One look at the video below ( hat tip , Business Insider ) proves that this most certainly is true .
When we spoke to Lieutenant Commander Chris O’Neill , the Chief of Media Relations for the
U.S. Coast Guard , regarding a recent incident where CBS reporters investigating an oily beach were threatened with arrest , we were told that , “ The incident
is n’t reflective of policy for media access to the spill site or spill
mitigation efforts . ”
A note to BP :
When you blatantly defy Coast Guard policies–and your own COO ’s assurances –everyone will find out .
( Thanks , YouTube ! )

Decisive message :
Israel will not allow any ships to reach the Gaza Strip , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Thursday , during a special session held by the forum of top seven government ministers .
The meeting was called in the wake of the deadly raid on a Gaza - bound vessel earlier in the week and the expected arrival of another ship , the Rachel Corrie , in the coming days .
However , the prime minister is still reportedly willing to show flexibility on Israel 's blockade policy .
During Thursday 's session , Netanyahu said : " We shall not allow the ships to reach Gaza .
Not now and not later on .
We intend to direct the Rachel Corrie ship to the Ashdod Port and transfer its civilian goods to Gaza following a security check . "
Officials expect no confrontation
Earlier , security officials estimated that activists aboard the Rachel Corrie will prefer to dock in Ashdod rather than to go on to Gaza .
Officials believe the activists will seek to transfer their goods via land , while collaborating with Israel .
" If this is not the case , we will do everything to stop them without casualties , " a security official said .
" We are engaging in negotiations with whoever is out there . "
Earlier Thursday , PM Netanyahu met with Quarter Envoy Tony Blair and told him he 's willing to examine " creative ways " to bring aid into Gaza , after the goods are examined .
Blair told the PM he noticed that in the latter 's speech Wednesday he made a distinction between Israel 's legitimate right to prevent arms smuggling and the transfer of civilian goods , which should be allowed to come in .
The prime minister confirmed , stressing that every ship that may be smuggling missiles and rockets must be inspected .

" You can't take a country that 's over - borrowed and make it more creditworthy by lending it more money , " he said .
" They 're throwing Greece further and further and further in the hole by not addressing the problem directly and properly . "
Asked when a Greek default could happen , Weinberg answered : " at High - Frequency , we are advising people to take their cell phones on their August vacation . "
He said a Greek default would be " harsh " for the euro .
Greek officials did not respond to CNBC.com requests for comment .
On Thursday , Nassim Taleb , professor and author of the bestselling book " The Black Swan , " told CNBC that the economic situation today is drastically worse than a couple of years ago , and that the euro is doomed as a concept .
But famous investor Jim Rogers said now may be a time to buy the single European currency , as there are so many investors who are bearish about it that a rally may be in the making .
IMF and EU funds worth about 7.5 billion euros ( $ 9 billion ) , crucial for Greece to be able to pay foreign debt , are due to be disbursed at the end of August , Weinberg said .
" Unless ( Greeks ) meet the quantified adjustment targets that they agreed to in the memorandum of understanding with the IMF , they wo n't get this money , " he said , adding that his bet is that Greece will not meet the criteria .
EU Wo n't Let Default Happen
Under the memorandum of understanding , performance criteria include ceilings on the budget deficit , cutting government and social security spending , as well as revamping key public companies .
However , other analysts say the implications of a Greek default on the euro zone 's financial institutions and economy are so great that the two institutions will disburse the funds even if the country does not fully meet the criteria .
As David Cameron lined up with Barak Obama to condemn Scotland over Lockerbie , his ministers were having a cosy meeting with the senior Libyan politician Abdel - Fatah Yunis al - Obeidi , Gaddafi 's secretary general for public security .
Obeidi respresents the same Libyan government , remember , who must have instructed Megrahi to put the bomb on PanAm Flight 103
Prince Andrew charms Libya for British business
Ian Black the Guardian 's Middle East editor writes : " Obeidi 's busy UK schedule underlines the warmth and intensity of bilateral relations since Tony Blair met Gaddafi in 2004 .
Obeidi has been to the Farnborough air show , met the Scotland Yard counter - terrorism command and Gerald Howarth , the minister for international security strategy , held talks in the Lords , and paid a courtesy call on Prince Andrew , who promotes British business in Libya .
Illegal immigration is an area of growing cooperation . "
You can read Black 's full story here in The Guardian
It rather backs up the points I made on The Jeremy Vine show today summarised as follows .
1 Cameron 's position is untenable and hypocritical .
If he truly deplores the release of a man he believes is guilty of mass murder , why is his government still on good terms with Col Gaddafi , who instructed that same man to kill ?
Megrahi was a tool , a Libyan agent .
He did n't get up one morning and take a notion to bomb the airliner .
That means Gaddafi is a murderer too .
He denies involvement but paid compensation to victims .
So will David Cameron cut off all relations with Tripoli and prevent British business raking in the cash ?
Do n't hold your breath .
Blair may have done the deal in the desert , Cameron will do nothing to damage it .
2. That White House press conference demonstrates why Scotland needs independence Since foreign affairs are not devolved to Edinburgh , David Cameron officially speaks for us .
On this occasion he trashed us in front of the world .
Where were we ?
We should have had a right to reply at least .
After all , Scottish troops are fighting and dying in Afghanistan , as they did in Iraq , to support America .
Would Obama and Cameron have condemned a friendly , independent sovereign nation like this ?
3 . Whisperings about oil deals ... all lead back to the British government , not Scotland .
We do n't even have a say on our OWN oil reserves never mind Libya's .
The UK government was desperate for Megrahi to be released .
Blair wanted to bring Gaddafi back into the fold for geo-political reasons and boost business at the same time .
That is why Westminster tried to put pressure on Scotland to agree to a prisoner transfer .
We resisted that .
The hypocrisy of David Miliband , who now condemns the Scots when he was pushing for release at the time when he was Foreign Secretary , is breath - taking .
4 . For the record I said at the time I did n't think Kenny MacAskill should have released Megrahi because I anticipated that the UK government would use it to damage the SNP .
I feared Scotland would take the flak from a totally duplicitous opposition .
However , that is political thinking .
MacAskill was trying to do the right thing as justice minister after a request for compassionate release .
It would have been wrong for him , as a government minister , to allow party interests to play a part in his decision making .
It should be noted that his decision was supported by much of Scottish civic society including the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church .
It was certainly a humane decision and that 's why it was supported by Nelson Mandela as well .

If you want to listen to Jeremy Vine , our Lockerbie discussion is first on the show after the Bob Marley record , which I must say is well worth hearing again .
" Backwards and hateful ideas … oust John Stossel , " said Colorofchange.org .
In a newspaper , the organization went on :
" It 's time that FOX drop Stossel … we 'll go directly after the network with a public campaign unlike anything we 've pursued to date . "
Media Matters joined in : " By airing Stossel 's repugnant comments , Fox legitimizes his indefensible position . "
What " indefensible " position did I take ?
I said this : " Private businesses ought to get to discriminate .
I wo n't ever go to a place that 's racist , and I will tell everybody else not to , and I 'll speak against them .
But it should be their right to be racist . "
Read that carefully : I condemned racism .
I said I 'd speak out against and boycott a racist 's business .
But to some people , I committed heresy .
I failed to accept the entire catechism .
I did n't say that we need government to fight racism and prohibit racist policies in private establishments .
For this , they demand that I be fired .
This controversy started when Rand Paul , who had just won a senatorial primary , told TV talker Rachel Maddow that the part of the Civil Rights
Act that bans discrimination by private business is improper interference with property owners ' rights .
He , too , condemned racism .
But the chattering class 's reaction to Paul 's statements must have made him uncomfortable .
The next day , he issued a statement saying that he would have voted for the entire act because federal intervention was needed .
Maybe .
At the time , racism was so pervasive that such an intrusive law may have been a good thing .
But , as a libertarian , I say : Individuals should be surrounded by a sphere of privacy where government does not intrude .
Part of the Civil Rights
Act violates freedom of association .
That 's why I told Fox 's Megyn Kelly , " It 's time now to repeal that part of the law . "
You can't say that in America ?
America 's fundamental political philosophy has deteriorated quite a bit if we can't distinguish between government and private conduct .
I enthusiastically support the parts of the civil rights act that struck down Jim Crow laws , which required segregation in government facilities , mass transit , and sometimes in private restaurants and hotels .
Jim Crow was evil .
It had no place in America .
Racist policies in private restaurants are also evil , but they do not involve force .
Government is force , so it should not be used to combat nonviolent racism on private property , even property open to the public .
I just do n't trust government to decide what discrimination is acceptable .
Its clumsy fist cannot deter private nonviolent racism without stomping on the rights of individuals .
Today , because of government antidiscrimination policy , all - women gyms are sued and forced to admit men , a gay softball team is told it may not reject bisexuals and a Christian wedding photographer is fined thousands of dollars for refusing to take photos of a homosexual wedding .
I 'll say it again : Racial discrimination is bad .
But we have ways besides government to end it .
The free market often punishes racists .
Today , a business that does n't hire blacks loses customers and good employees .
It will atrophy , while its more inclusive competitors thrive .
In the pre-1964 South , things were different .
But even then , private forces worked against bigotry .
White owners of railroads and streetcars objected to mandated segregation .
Historian Jennifer Roback writes that in 1902 the Mobile Light and Railroad Company " flat out refused to enforce " Mobile , Alabama 's segregation law .
In cities throughout the South , beginning in 1960 , student - led sit-ins and boycotts peacefully shamed businesses into desegregating whites - only lunch counters .
Those voluntary actions were the first steps in changing a rancid culture .
If anything , Washington jumped on a bandwagon that was already rolling .
It was n't free markets in the South that perpetuated racism .
It was government colluding with private individuals ( some in the KKK ) to intimidate those who would have integrated .
It was private action that started challenging the racists , and it was succeeding — four years before the Civil Rights Act passed .
Government is a blunt instrument of violence that one day might do something you like but the next day will do something you abhor .
Better to leave things to us — people — acting together privately .

Ixtoc I was an exploratory oil well being drilled by the semi-submersible drilling rig Sedco 135 in the Bay of Campeche of the Gulf of Mexico , about 100 km ( 62 mi ) northwest of Ciudad del Carmen , Campeche in waters 50 m ( 164 ft ) deep .
[ 2 ]
On 3 June 1979 , the well suffered a blowout resulting in one of the largest oil spills in history . [ 3 ]
Accident [ edit ]
Mexico 's state - owned oil company Pemex ( Petróleos Mexicanos ) was drilling a 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) deep oil well when the drilling rig Sedco 135 lost drilling mud circulation .
In modern rotary drilling , mud is circulated down the drill pipe and back up the wellbore to the surface .
The goal is to equalize the pressure through the shaft and to monitor the returning mud for gas .
Without the counter - pressure provided by the circulating mud , the pressure in the formation allowed oil to fill the well column , blowing out the well .
The oil caught fire , and Sedco 135 burned and collapsed into the sea . [ 2 ]
At the time of the accident Sedco 135 was drilling at a depth of about 3,600 metres ( 11,800 ft ) below the seafloor . [ 4 ]
The day before Ixtoc suffered the blowout and resulting fire that caused her to sink , the drill bit hit a region of soft strata .
Subsequently , the circulation of drilling mud was lost resulting in a loss of hydrostatic pressure .
[ 5 ]
Rather than returning to the surface , the drilling mud was escaping into fractures that had formed in the rock at the bottom of the hole .
Pemex officials decided to remove the bit , run the drill pipe back into the hole and pump materials down this open - ended drill pipe to seal off the fractures that were causing the loss of circulation .
During the removal of the pipe on Sedco 135 , the drilling mud suddenly began to flow up towards the surface ; by removing the drill - string the well was swabbed ( an effect observed when mud must flow down the annulus to replace displaced drill pipe volume below the bit ) leading to a kick .
Normally , this flow can be stopped by activating shear rams contained in the blowout preventer ( BOP ) .
These rams are designed to sever and seal off the well on the ocean floor ; however , in this case , the drill collars had been brought in line with the BOP and the BOP rams were not able to sever the thick steel walls of the drill collars leading to a catastrophic blowout .
The drilling mud was followed by a large quantity of oil and gas at a flow rate that was still increasing .
The oil and gas fumes exploded on contact with the operating pump motors , starting a fire which led to the collapse of the Sedco 135 drilling tower .
The collapse caused damage to underlying well structures .
The damage to the well structures led to the release of significant quantities of oil into the Gulf . [ 4 ]
Volume and extent of spill [ edit ]
c. September 1979 SpillSeptember 1979
In the initial stages of the spill , an estimated 30,000 barrels ( 5,000 m3 ) of oil per day were flowing from the well .
In July 1979 , the pumping of mud into the well reduced the flow to 20,000 barrels ( 3,000 m3 ) per day , and early in August the pumping of nearly 100,000 steel , iron , and lead balls into the well reduced the flow to 10,000 barrels ( 2,000 m3 ) per day .
Pemex claimed that half of the released oil burned when it reached the surface , a third of it evaporated , and the rest was contained or dispersed . [ 6 ]
Mexican authorities also drilled two relief wells into the main well to lower the pressure of the blowout , however , the oil continued to flow for three months following the completion of the first relief well .
[ 7 ]
In total , around 138,600,000 US gallons of oil ( gal ) and 3.3 million barrels of oil were spilled throughout the , roughly , 10 months it took for the oil to stop leaking . [ 8 ]
Pemex contracted Conair Aviation to spray the chemical dispersant Corexit 9527 on the oil .
A total of 493 aerial missions were flown , treating 1,100 square miles ( 2,800 km2 ) of oil slick .
Dispersants were not used in the U.S. area of the spill because of the dispersant 's inability to treat weathered oil .
Eventually the on - scene coordinator ( OSC ) requested that Mexico stop using dispersants north of 25 °N . [ 6 ]
In Texas , an emphasis was placed on coastal countermeasures protecting the bays and lagoons formed by the barrier islands .
Impacts of oil on the barrier island beaches were ranked as second in importance to protecting inlets to the bays and lagoons .
This was done with the placement of skimmers and booms .
Efforts were concentrated on the Brazos - Santiago Pass , Port Mansfield Channel , Aransas Pass , and Cedar Bayou which during the spill was sealed with sand .
Economically and environmentally sensitive barrier island beaches were cleaned daily .
Laborers used rakes and shovels to clean beaches rather than heavier equipment which removed too much sand .
Ultimately , 71,500 barrels ( 11,000 m3 ) of oil impacted 162 miles ( 260 km ) of U.S. beaches , and over 10,000 cubic yards ( 8,000 m3 ) of oiled material were removed . [ 6 ]
Containment [ edit ]
In the next nine months , experts and divers including Red Adair were brought in to contain and cap the oil well .
[ 6 ]
An average of approximately 10,000 to 30,000 barrels ( 2,000 to 5,000 m3 ) per day were discharged into the Gulf until it was finally capped on 23 March 1980 , nearly 10 months later . [ 9 ]
In similarity to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill 31 years later , the list of methods attempted to remediate the leak included lowering a cap over the well , plugging the leak with mud and " junk " , use of dispersants , and spending months attempting to drill relief wells . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
Aftermath [ edit ]
Prevailing currents carried the oil towards the Texas coastline .
The US government had two months to prepare booms to protect major inlets .
Pemex spent $ 100 million to clean up the spill and avoided most compensation claims by asserting sovereign immunity as a state - run company . [ 12 ]
The oil slick surrounded Rancho Nuevo , in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas , which is one of the few nesting sites for Kemp 's ridley sea turtles .
Thousands of baby sea turtles were airlifted to a clean portion of the Gulf of Mexico to help save the rare species .
Long - term effects [ edit ]
The oil that was lost during the blow - out polluted a considerable part of the offshore region in the Gulf of Mexico as well as much of the coastal zone , which consists primarily of sandy beaches and barrier islands often enclosing extensive shallow lagoons .
The oil on Mexican beaches in early September was calculated to be about 6000 metric tons .
Based on reports from various groups and individuals , five times that figure is thought to represent a fair estimate of what had landed on Mexican beaches .
Investigations along the Texas coast show that approximately 4000 metric tons of oil or less than 1 percent was deposited there .
The rest of the oil , about 120,000 metric tons or 25 percent , sank to the bottom of the Gulf . [ 13 ]
The oil had a severe impact on the littoral crab and mollusk fauna of the beaches which were contaminated .
The populations of crabs , e.g. the ghost crab Ocypode quadrata , was almost eliminated over a wide area .
The crab populations on coral islands along the coast were also reduced to only a few percents of the normal populations about nine months after the spill . [ 13 ]
A study concluded that the most persistent problems were the coastal lagoons lining the bay , as well as the pollution of estuaries .
Specifically , they had problematic effects on the breeding and growth of several different species of food fish species . [ 14 ]
The oil washed ashore , 30 cm ( 1 ft. ) deep in some places , as it was pushed north by prevailing winds and currents until it crossed the Texas border two months later and eventually coated almost 170 miles ( 270 km ) of US beaches .
The beach that caused most international concern in Mexico was Rancho Nuevo , a key nesting ground for critically endangered Kemp 's ridley sea turtles which had already moved inland in their hundreds to lay eggs .
By the time the eggs hatched , the oil had reached the shore .
Fishing was banned or restricted by Mexican authorities in contaminated areas north and south of the well .
Fish and octopus catches dropped by 50 to 70 % from the 1978 levels . [ 13 ]
Other species that had longer life spans took longer to recover , and it took until the late - 1980s that the population of Kemp 's ridley turtles , started recovering .
Ridley turtles only produce a few hundred eggs each year , in contrast with the millions of eggs that shrimp lay . [ 15 ]
There is much less information on the impact of the Ixtoc I spill on benthic species ( bottom dwellers ) .
The best studies were on the Texas coast over 1000 km from the spill .
Massive kills can occur when oil reaches the benthos in sufficient quantity .
The only indication of a massive kill may be the remains of the dead organisms , but if they lack hard parts there will be little evidence . [ 16 ]
A report prepared for the US Bureau of Land Management concluded concerning the spill 's effect on US waters :
Despite a massive intrusion of petroleum hydrocarbon pollutants from the Ixtoc I event into the study region of the South Texas Outer Continental Shelf during 1979 - 1980 , no definitive damage can be associated with this or other known spillage events ( e .g . , Burmah Agate ) on either the epibenthic commercial shrimp population ( based on chemical evidence ) or the benthic infaunal community .
Such conclusions have no bearing on intertidal or littoral communities , which were not the subject of this study . [ 17 ]

NEW YORK — The entire Yankees squad poured off the bench , out of the dugout , and onto the field Monday after CC Sabathia reacted to a particularly strenuous inning by plopping down on the bench , stretching out , and taking a nap .
" When that happens to your pitcher , you just have to support him and get out of the way , " said shortstop Derek Jeter , who was one of the first Yankees on his feet when Sabathia began to recline .
" In that situation , a good teammate just lets his pitcher sleep .
It does n't matter if he 's right or wrong . "
Umpires were able to clear the field and play resumed shortly after Sabathia woke , although team medics have not yet been able to return Sabathia to an upright position

Can gay people be citizens of the United States ?
According to Virginia 's Attorney General , apparently not :
In March , Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli ( R ) told the state ’s colleges and universities to rescind policies that ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , arguing that schools have no legal authority to adopt such statements .
On Friday , Cuccinelli appeared at Boys State , where a high school student asked him , “ How is that not a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment ? ”
Cuccinelli responded by suggesting that the amendment was not designed to protect gay men and women : “ State universities are not free to create any specially protected classes other than those dictated by the General Assembly , ” Cuccinelli said .
“ Your question is , why is that not a violation of the 14th Amendment ’s equal protection clause .
Frankly , the category of sexual orientation would never have been contemplated by the people who wrote and voted for and passed the 14th Amendment , ” he said .
Here 's what those people wrote , voted for and passed :
All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside .
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .
All persons ... no mention of excluding those you did n't like or thought were " icky . "
It 's pretty damn clear .

Restaurants and bars are whacked with county health violations if they so much as operate a dysfunctional dishwasher , and yet cops are given free reign to swagger through businesses on horseback in some kind of bizarre display of letting the scum know who their bosses are .
Remember one of the early scenes in the classic movie Planet of the Apes ?
The apes on horseback ride roughshod over the scurrying humans , whipping them into submission , capturing them in huge nets , and reminding them that they are slaves .
Armed with torture devices known as “ Tasers , ” all that cops in Tampa Florida are missing is the whip , because apparently they believe that , as Gods and masters of the serfs and not public servants , they have the right to ride on horseback through private businesses in an effort scare the patrons of bars and restaurants into submission .
“ Police officers on horseback have become a familiar sight in Tampa ’s Ybor City , but recently someone snapped a video clip of one officer walking the beat not around a local business but right through it , ” reports WTSP.com .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
{openx:49}
“ Eleven seconds into the video , you can hear a woman scream .
Apparently , the owners of a tattoo parlor adjacent to the bar – are worried that with big crowds on weekends someone could get hurt . ”
But the scream is the desired response – this is all about the thug cops , who have been trained that Americans are dangerous domestic terrorists , asserting their dominance over the gelded public in a public display of power similar to how a big fat magpie arrogantly struts across a garden to frighten away smaller birds .
This is psychological terrorism on an animalistic level , a way of brainwashing the dumbed - down public into cowering and screaming whenever a God police officer approaches .
The fact that this violates every health and safety code in the book , which is thrown at business owners for petty infractions on a routine basis , is another example of how society is now being divided into a two - tier caste system of masters and servants .
The majority of respondents to the story agreed .
“ A “ strong presence ” huh ? ” asks one .
“ Why stop here ?
Why not brown shirts and swastikas ?
Jack booted thugs on every corner are a “ strong presence ” too and we are n’t far away ” .
“ Nothing says police oppression and disease , more than indoor trotting horses , ” adds another .

In a move that could shake up the mobile - phone industry , AT&T said Wednesday that it will become the first major carrier to stop offering new customers “ all you can eat ” data plans and shift to charging them based on their usage .
The new pricing , which AT&T will put in place next week , will be optional for existing customers , and comes as Apple is widely expected to introduce its latest iPhone Monday .
AT&T is the exclusive carrier in the United States for the popular phone , which has created bottlenecks on its network , particularly in cities including San Francisco and New York , where users consume large amounts of data .
Other carriers could mimic AT&T ’s move , analysts said , setting a trend that could reshape how customers pay for data on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets like the iPad .
Broadband providers in general — wireless and wired — have talked for years about moving away from unlimited data plans and have conducted limited experiments with tiered pricing .
AT&T ’s move comes as consumers increasingly use their phones to check e-mail , watch videos , locate shops and surf the Web as well as to make calls .
Those activities frequently require more bandwidth than phone calls .
“ Clearly this is a pain point for all operators , ” said Charles Golvin , an analyst with Forrester Research , an industry research firm .
“ They need to address the challenge that unlimited plans can promote usage that can become a problem for the network . ”
Andrew Jay Schwartzman , senior vice president at the Media Access Project , a nonprofit public interest law firm that focuses on broadband issues , said other carriers are likely to follow AT&T ’s lead .
“ My guess is ( AT&T ’s competitors ) will watch for a while and then try some variant on the same thing , ” he said .
AT&T portrayed the move as consumer - friendly .
Under the new pricing system , customers can pay $ 15 a month for an entry - level plan with a cap of 200 megabytes a month .
A $ 25 - a- month plan will allow them to transfer up to 2 gigabytes of data in a month .
Currently , the company charges smartphone customers $ 30 a month for unlimited data usage .
That rate is a barrier for consumers who do n’t have a smartphone but are interested in getting one , said AT&T spokesman John Britton .
“ We ’re trying to make mobile data more affordable for more people , ” he said .
Britton asserted that the new plans will benefit the bulk of AT&T ’s existing smartphone subscribers .
According to AT&T , 65 percent of its smartphone customers use less than 200 megabytes of data a month and 98 percent use less than 2 gigabytes of data each month .
A gigabyte is enough for hundreds of e-mails and Web pages , but it ’s quickly eaten up by Internet video and video conferencing .
However , the move comes amid well - publicized problems for AT&T in handling the data traffic generated by iPhone users .
Previous reports have shown that a disproportionate portion of the Web surfing done on mobile devices is done on iPhones .
And the 200,000 available applications have encouraged iPhone users to use their phones in novel and sometimes data - intensive ways , from streaming music from their home computers to streaming online videos to getting turn - by - turn directions .
Consumers who exceed the caps — even by only small amounts — will see sizable charges .
Britton noted , though , that consumers on the lower - end data plan can switch mid-month to the higher - end plan if they see they are going to go over their limit and can switch back the following month .
AT&T is providing consumers a number of tools to monitor data usage and will text message customers when they reach certain levels .
Analysts said AT&T ’s move was to be expected , given the increasing amounts of bandwidth iPhone users have been consuming — especially with a new , multitasking iPhone operating system expected to be released this month .
That feature alone could bump many iPhone users into a higher , more expensive pricing tier .
The new iPhone operating system could increase data consumption by 25 to 30 percent because it will allow customers to run multiple Internet - connected programs simultaneously , said Chetan Sharma , an independent wireless analyst .
“ It was inevitable ; unlimited data pricing was completely unsustainable , ” he said .
Consumers expressed mixed emotions about the move .
Some worried that they might be negatively impacted by the caps .
James London , a 20 - year - old De Anza College student , uses his iPhone for a lot of data - intensive tasks , including streaming video .
“ I ’m not the happiest person about it , ” London said .
“ But it could be worse . ”
Others figured they ’d be unaffected by the data caps .
Albert Poon , a 41 - year - old San Francisco resident , said he uses his iPhone all the time , but has consumed only 1 gigabyte of data in the past two months .
“ I ca n’t imagine two gigs is going to cramp my style very much , ” he said .
Verizon Wireless , the largest wireless carrier and AT&T ’s chief rival , had no immediate comment on AT&T ’s move .
There has been much speculation that Verizon may sell its own version of the iPhone .
For the iPad , the tablet computer Apple released a few months ago , the $ 25 - a - month 2 - gigabyte plan will replace the $ 30 unlimited plan .
iPad owners can keep the unlimited plan as long as they keep paying $ 30 a month , AT&T said .

The town of Nottingham , New Hampshire decided this week that it was time to overturn a 10 - year ban on allowing town employees to carry firearms to work .
What a brilliant idea !
A former town police officer said " this concerns me . "
The Nottingham Board of Selectmen recently changed the rules in the town 's employee handbook allowing everyone to carry a firearm to work with them , which should really work out well in town offices where people sometimes air grievances .
Speaking to New England Cable News , former police officer and gun owner Judy Doughty said , " I 'm not against the second amendment , and I 'm not against anyone owning their own gun , but I think that can be a place like a public building where it effects a lot of people where they just do n't have to bring it into those public buildings . "
The town administrator who changed the law said the locals ' negative reaction surprised him .

As Polaroid reinvents itself with new cameras and a new marketing campaign featuring Lady Gaga , the former Cambridge - based company will tomorrow unveil an exclusive photo of the pop star that will be presented to the MIT Museum .
And Gaga herself might even pop in .
If Gaga , who happens to be in town this week for concerts at TD Garden , does show up at the museum tomorrow ( and we were told yesterday that possiblity " is TBD " ) , here 's hoping she 'll treat the photographers there better than the ones she insulted in New York earlier this month .
As for tomorrow , Gaga and her team will be at MIT in the morning to direct the photo shoot with the large - format Polaroid that takes highly detailed , 20 - by - 24 - inch instant photos .
Jon Pollock , chief marketing officer for Polaroid , said the company has half a dozen products it 's working on with Gaga , " that will be Gaga - inspired and designed products , under the combined Gaga - Polaroid brand . "
Not everybody is sad that Guillermo Del Toro is n't going to be directing The Hobbit after all .
Lauren Panepinto , creative director at Orbit Books and Yen Press , explains why she had misgivings about a Pan 's Labyrinth - style Hobbit .
Advertisement
Back when Guillermo Del Toro was announced as the director of The Hobbit , my initial response was an unenthusiastic groan .
Immediately after this thought I felt some intense fangirl guilt - was n't Pan 's Labyrinth a fabulous and visually original movie ?
Absolutely .
Is n't Del Toro one of the most visually stunning directors working today ?
Undeniable .
Is he one of barely a handful of producers today that can get fantasy movies done without the studios screwing them up ?
A resounding Yes .
But what I immediately thought was : " If I see one guy with eyeballs in the palms of his hands , I am going to lose it . "
See , I 'm a huge Hellboy comics fan , especially of Mike Mignola 's art , and Del Toro 's handling of the films really left me cold .
The first film was a cautious adaptation , in much the way Singer 's lukewarm first X - Men film was .
But that was fine - there 's only so much freedom you can squeeze out of a big studio when trying to adapt something so unique , and as downright strange , to the screen as a big red demon ghostbuster .
And all while worrying about making enough money to greenlight a second film .
But with Hellboy II , Del Toro had all the freedom to push the visual style into something really fabulous , and we got ...
Pan 's Labyrinth with a big red demon ghostbuster .
Do n't tell me you all did n't think it when you saw the guy in the cave with the wings and the palm - eyeballs .
You know you did .

Is it unfair to expect a director to be able to perfectly adapt a comic 's visual style to the screen ?
Some would say yes , but Robert Rodriguez did a damn fine job with Sin City , and Zack Snyder absolutely nailed the visual translations of both 300 and Watchmen .
There is a difference between directing a story of your own creation , and an adaptation of a property that is already loved and lauded for its visuals .
Peter Jackson was so careful to stay true to so much of the visual library built up over the decades since Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings , and it paid off in the universal joy of fans everywhere .
I just could n't bring myself to trust that Del Toro would be able to follow P. J.'s lead and resist remaking the movies in his style .
Maybe Peter Jackson will direct , maybe not .
Certainly there are a lot of candidates , and there are plenty of directors better suited to working within an established visual language .
I 'd take Alfonso Cuaron in a hot second .
Who should direct The Hobbit ?
Given that our first two choices —
Peter Jackson , who said he can't , and Guillermo del Toro , who … Read more

Del Toro has an imagination with his own creations that I will pay to see again and again .
And truly , this is the best thing about Del Toro leaving The Hobbit .
He can get back to the creative freedom of his own stories .
That is where he truly shines .
And now I can stop wondering which Tolkein characters were most likely to end up with the eyeball treatment .
( My guess was the trolls . )

Off - field indiscretions are not just the domain of men's sport in Australia -- their women 's rugby World Cup team includes a player banished from teaching after grooming students for sex .
Tricia Brown , who had her teaching registration suspended until 2014 after an investigation last year , was today selected in the Walleroos 26 - strong squad for next month 's tournament in England .
Brown , 31 , was suspended after she admitted courting two year 12 students into lesbian relationships while employed as a physical education teacher at both a private and public school in Brisbane .
Queensland College of Teachers documents obtained by The Courier Mail newspaper found Brown took at least one of her underage students to gay nightclubs using fake ID and gave gifts and fluffy toys .
The college 's disciplinary committee report labelled her a " predator towards young girls " adding " there is definitely a pattern of behaviour . "
In March this year Brown said she regretted her behaviour , had made " some very poor decisions " but would not rule out a return to teaching when her ban expired .
" For me now it 's a case of trying to move forward in a positive and right direction , so I 'm not letting myself or my family or friends down again . "
The Queensland and Australian Rugby Unions were happy for Brown to remain in the sport though she will not be permitted to coach or be involved in any official capacity with rugby players under the age of 18 .
The fact Brown did not face criminal charges was questioned in the newspaper 's online forum .
" Just imagine if this was a man .... he'd be jailed , and put on the sex offenders register , " wrote one correspondent .
" If there is to be true equality between the sexes then the law must be applied equally and indiscriminately .
There should be no difference between the sexes when it comes to passing sentence on crimes , " said another .
Australia 's squad includes Kirsty Giteau , sister of Wallabies five - eighth Matt Giteau .
Australia have been grouped with defending champions , the New Zealand Black Ferns , in pool A alongside Wales and South Africa .
The other competing teams are England , USA , Ireland , Kazakhstan ( pool B ) plus France , Canada , Scotland and pool C outsider Sweden .
The tournament runs from August 20 to September 5 .
The final will be played at the Twickenham Stoop in London .
Michael Steele speaks truth to power
I 'm not really sure what to make of this video that has just surfaced of Michael Steele at a fundraiser in Connecticut talking about the Afghanistan war .
It 's unequivocal : Steele says that the war was one of Obama 's choosing , that we should n't be there , and -- crucially -- that history teaches us it 's probably a lost cause .
That puts him at odds with the entire GOP and many Dems .
It 's the must - watch video of the morning :
Steele starts off with a standard GOP talking point :
That Stanley McChrystal 's barbed comments about members of the administration show " frustration " on the part of military leaders towards Obama .
But then he seems to veer off in an odd direction :
" Keep in mind again , federal candidates , this was a war of Obama 's choosing .
This is not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in . " ...
" It was the president who was trying to be cute by half by flipping a script demonizing Iraq , while saying the battle really should be in Afghanistan .
Well , if he 's such a student of history , has he not understood that you know that 's the one thing you do n't do , is engage in a land war in Afghanistan ?
All right , because everyone who has tried , over a thousand years of history , has failed .
And there are reasons for that .
There are other ways to engage in Afghanistan . "
Let me have a stab at guessing what happened here .
I say Steele initially meant to say that the Afghan war was n't a war of our choosing because we were attacked on September 11th , forcing us to invade .
But that came out all wrong because he garbled it by mixing it with an attack on Obama .
Next , Steele tried to attack Obama by pointing out that during the campaign he insulated himself against charges that he 's a dove by calling for a ramp up in Afghanistan .
Fair enough .
But then he compounded the mess by slipping into a kind of auto - pilot mode where he just started criticizing the Afghan war as a disaster and unwinnable because it 's now Obama 's war .
Result : Steele said that Obama chose this war , that we should n't be there , and we now can't win .
Anyone got a better explanation ?
UPDATE , 10:44 a.m. : RNC spokesman Doug Heye clarifies :
“ I think both parties were responsible , ’’ said T general manager Richard Davey , adding that Stanton ’s SUV was packed with fellow students who had been drinking .
“ The T and Boston College students could have done a better job that night existing with each other , on the road and on the track . ’’
The case has more jerking turns than a Green Line ride at rush hour .
It left Jane Stanton ’s lawyer proclaiming exoneration for his client yesterday ( and threatening a lawsuit ) ; BC officials blaming the MBTA for rushing to judgment ; and T officials saying fault should be shared by everyone involved in the crash .
Dieujuste , who was informed of his recent suspension yesterday , could not be reached for comment .
He did not respond to an e-mail sent via Facebook .
Operator Edwin Dieujuste , 34 , testified before a clerk magistrate that he had a clean motor vehicle driving record , several officials said , though a subsequent review revealed multiple moving violations in Florida and Massachusetts .
And yesterday , amid inquiries from the Globe , T officials said they were suspending the trolley driver indefinitely and pursuing perjury charges against him for testimony he gave in a hearing about the crash .
Then , in a closed - door hearing in Brighton District Court last week , the most serious charges against Jane Stanton , the BC student driving the Jeep , were abruptly dismissed .
Her toxicology tests showed she had not been drinking , her cellphone records showed she had not been texting , and she faced only three civil traffic infractions , officials and her lawyer said .
But since then , the story has taken several striking twists , far from the glare of the cameras .
In May , with no fanfare , the MBTA suspended the trolley driver for two weeks after the agency ’s investigators determined he was driving 35 miles per hour at the time of the crash , well over the 10 - mile - per - hour speed limit , T officials confirmed yesterday .
All of which turned a relatively minor incident into national news , splashed across the pages and websites of The New York Times , USA Today , ESPN , and the Huffington Post , as well as every major media outlet in Boston .
The hockey team not only failed to receive the customary White House invitation that national champions receive , it has n’t gotten so much as a congratulatory sign on the Massachusetts Turnpike .
Three members of the BC hockey team , which had just won the national championship , were passengers in the Jeep , and detectives found the vehicle strewn with beer cans and a bottle of vodka .
“ These students should be held accountable for their reckless and dangerous behavior , ’’ railed the MBTA police chief the day after the crash .
When a sport utility vehicle jammed with Boston College students collided with a Green Line trolley on a Saturday night in late April , outraged MBTA officials wasted no time in placing blame .
Barely a day passed before they said they would pursue criminal charges and demanded restitution for their damaged rail car .
But Stanton ’s lawyer , Paul F. Walsh Jr. , said his client was performing the critical role of a good and responsible friend : serving as a designated driver .
“ Jane Stanton did n’t cause this accident , ’’ said Walsh .
“ They maligned a poor freshman at BC who was doing the right thing .
She was the designated driver .
She ’s a good kid .
She feels awful . ’’
The T pursued three criminal charges against Stanton , according to several authorities : operating a motor vehicle to endanger , a minor transporting alcohol , and leaving the scene of property damage .
All charges were dismissed last Thursday in the closed - door hearing before Brighton District Court Clerk - Magistrate Patricia McDermott .
Stanton was held responsible and paid fines on three civil infractions ‘ an open container of alcohol violation , impeded operation of a motor vehicle , and uniform stopping and turning .
The impeded operation , officials say , was for having so many passengers in the car , and the uniform stopping and turning was for not having enough caution when she crossed the trolley tracks .
Each carried a $ 35 fine , while the fine for the open container was $ 500 .
All the passengers were also held responsible for the open container violation at a separate hearing .
On the night of the crash , the friends , freshmen at BC , dined at an Applebee ’s , then attended a party near campus .
There were seven passengers in the Jeep Cherokee , including three members of the national championship hockey team and one member of the women ’s lacrosse team .
The trolley was traveling west on Commonwealth Avenue just after midnight as Stanton attempted to cross its path while making a U - turn .
After the crash , some of the passengers in the Jeep fled the area , and Stanton drove another 500 feet before stopping .
She suffered severe facial cuts and later told detectives she could n’t remember anything about the accident .
Detectives tracked down several passengers in the hospital .
No trolley passengers were injured .
Angry T officials immediately said they would press charges and seek damages , and the storyline was indeed alluring : drunken BC kids cause mishap near campus .
But within a month , with no public notice , Dieujuste was suspended for 10 days and sent to a retraining course .
Informed by the Globe yesterday that the trolley operator had been suspended and the BC driver had all criminal charges dismissed , BC spokesman Jack Dunn did nothing to hide his anger at T officials .
“ The T , particularly the chief , painted it as drunken college students , ’’ said Dunn .
“ The driver does n’t drink .
She was sober and making a legal turn . ’’
Dunn said the students had always told BC officials that the trolley appeared to , in his words , “ be flying out of nowhere . ’’
He said they left the scene , dazed , to seek medical treatment .
Of the fact that underaged students were drinking , he said , “ The student athletes are not blameless .
While we ’re pleased to hear that their account appears to be validated by the investigation , they still face university sanctions for underage drinking . ’’
Walsh , Stanton ’s lawyer , described “ a rush to judgment , ’’ saying , “ I got frantic calls — ‘ We want her medical records .
We want toxicology tests .
We want her cellphone records . ’
Clean as a whistle .
She was the designated driver .
No alcohol , no drugs , no cellphone use , no texting . ’’
Meantime , Davey , of the MBTA , defended Dieujuste ’s hiring yesterday , even though the operator had three separate charges of violating traffic signals in Florida , as well as a speeding violation , since 2003 .
Under T policy , a driver cannot have two moving violations in the same year within three years of his or her hiring .
Dieujuste joined the MBTA in 2008 , so his past infractions did not fall within the window of the T ’s policy .
Dieujuste had testified in a magistrate ’s hearing in May that his driving record was clean .
He then failed to attend the hearing against Stanton last week , during which McDermott reviewed his driving record , which included a license suspension .
“ Under our policy , this was an appropriate hire , ’’ Davey said , noting that Dieujuste has had no disciplinary record in his time at the T .
“ He had issues five , six , seven years ago .
Not being forthcoming about it is something I ’m not happy about . ’’

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The following are highlights from a House of Representatives Budget Committee hearing on Wednesday with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testifying .
For text of prepared testimony , click on
FROM Q&A WITH LAWMAKERS
BERNANKE ON TIMING OF REDUCING GOV’T SPENDING
“ In terms of the time frame , right now , I do n’t think is the time , this very moment is not the time , to radically reduce our spending , or raise our taxes , because the economy is still in recovery mode and needs that support .
However , the risk of course of ongoing deficits is the potential loss of confidence in markets and the way to reassure the markets is by creating a plausible plan for a medium - term stability in the fiscal situation .
Obviously you ca n’t run deficits ( of ) 10 percent of GDP forever . ”
BERNANKE ON U.S. DOLLAR ’S ROLE AS RESERVE CURRENCY
“ The dollar is still the dominant reserve currency and U.S. Treasuries obviously are very attractive as you can see from the increase in their prices during the recent turmoil .
“ So the U.S. dollar has been a safe - haven currency where investors have gone when they ’ve been concerned about other currencies and other economies . ”
BERNANKE ON COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE
“ We are concerned about it , it clearly is a very weak point in the economy .
For many banks , including small and medium - sized banks , it is a problem .
We have done a number of things .
The Federal Reserve , working with the Treasury , has developed programs to try to restart the commercial mortgage - backed securities markets .
Beyond that we have issued guidance to banks on commercial real estate and we ’re trying to work with them to restructure commercial real estate loans and to find ways to manage in terms of loans , so we ’re doing the best we can with banks and with the markets .
There seems to be , I would say , a few glimmers of hope in this area , some stabilization of prices in some markets , for example , but it does remain a serious concern and we ’re watching it very carefully . ”
BERNANKE ON FISCAL BREATHING ROOM
“ Countries have different amounts of fiscal capacity if you will .
Countries like Greece , which are clearly being shut out from the market because of their debt and deficit ratios , need immediate and sharp changes in their position .
The United States , as I said in my remarks , is favored in that we are a safe - haven currency .
We are a large , diversified economy and we have a long record of paying our debts , paying our interest .
So we have a little more breathing space -- but potentially .
But I do n’t know exactly how much ( space ) we have , and I ’m going to try to say -- I do n’t disagree with you -- you said we need a program for returning our trajectory of fiscal policy to a sustainable path . ”
BERNANKE ON BANKERS ’ PAY PACKAGES
“ We will be pushing the banks to move as quickly as possible to restructure their compensation packages so that they will not be engendering excessive risk - taking .
So we will be doing that very quickly .
“ We hope to have a public report about this near the end of the year , early next year , but I want to assure you that the actions we will be taking will not wait for the report .
We will be immediately working with the banks , and we have been working with banks already , to get them to modify their compensation practices . ”
“ The structure of the compensation packages needs to change so that there ’s not an incentive to take excessive risks .
Packages where the trader gets all the upside and none of the downside , that ’s the kind of thing we ’re trying to get rid of . ”
BERNANKE ON GOLD PRICE
“ Gold is out there doing something different from the rest of the commodity group .
I do n’t fully understand the movements in the gold price , but I do think that there ’s a great deal of uncertainty and anxiety in financial markets right now .
Some people believe that holding gold will be a hedge against the fact that they view many other investments as being risky and hard to predict at this point . ”
BERNANKE ON EUROPEAN ACTIONS
“ I am encouraged by the response of the Europeans ... I think the markets remain uncertain about whether these measures will be successful and that ’s why you ’re still seeing a lot volatility in the markets .
What I can assure you of is that the European leadership is fully committed to addressing this problem , preserving the euro zone and preserving the European Union and they are working , I think , very aggressively right now to try to establish some effective solutions . ”
BERNANKE ON RECOVERY , DOUBLE DIP RISK
“ It appears to us that the recovery has made an important transition from being supported primarily by inventory dynamics and by fiscal policy toward recovery being led now more by private final demand , including consumer spending .
That is encouraging in terms of the sustainability .
“ Our current most likely outlook is that the economy will continue to recover at a moderate pace ...
A double dip never can be entirely ruled out , of course , but right now our expectation is the economy will continue to grow at around a 3 to 4 percent pace this year . ”
FROM BERNANKE’S PREPARED TESTIMONY
ON GROWTH , INFLATION OUTLOOK
“ The recovery in economic activity that began in the second half of last year has continued at a moderate pace so far this year .
Moreover , the economy -- supported by stimulative monetary policy and the concerted efforts of policymakers to stabilize the financial system -- appears to be on track to continue to expand through this year and next .
The latest economic projections of Federal Reserve Governors and Reserve Bank presidents , which were made near the end of April , anticipate that real gross domestic product ( GDP ) will grow in the neighborhood of 3 - 1/ 2 percent over the course of 2010 as a whole and at a somewhat faster pace next year .
This pace of growth , were it to be realized , would probably be associated with only a slow reduction in the unemployment rate over time .
In this environment , inflation is likely to remain subdued .
“ Although the support to economic growth from fiscal policy is likely to diminish in the coming year , the incoming data suggest that gains in private final demand will sustain the recovery in economic activity . ”
ON CONSTRAINTS TO GROWTH
“ Significant restraints on the pace of the recovery remain .
In the housing market , sales and construction have been temporarily boosted lately by the homebuyer tax credit .
But looking through these temporary movements , underlying housing activity appears to have firmed only a little since mid-2009 , with activity being weighed down , in part , by a large inventory of distressed or vacant existing houses and by the difficulties of many builders in obtaining credit .
Spending on nonresidential buildings also is being held back by high vacancy rates , low property prices , and strained credit conditions .
Meanwhile , pressures on state and local budgets , though tempered somewhat by ongoing federal support , have led these governments to make further cuts in employment and construction spending . ”
ON EFFECTS OF EUROPEAN DEBT CRISIS
“ The actions taken by European leaders represent a firm commitment to resolve the prevailing stresses and restore market confidence and stability .
If markets continue to stabilize , then the effects of the crisis on economic growth in the United States seem likely to be modest .
Although the recent fall in equity prices and weaker economic prospects in Europe will leave some imprint on the U.S. economy , offsetting factors include declines in interest rates on Treasury bonds and home mortgages as well as lower prices for oil and some other globally traded commodities .
The Federal Reserve will remain highly attentive to developments abroad and to their potential effects on the U.S. economy . ”
A MUSLIM woman has complained after allegedly being told to remove her face veil during a job interview at a Northern Territory hospital .
Northern Territory Anti-Discrimination Commission officers have launched an investigation , the NT Newsreports .
Acting commissioner Lisa Coffey has refused to discuss the case - or even confirm that a complaint had been lodged .
But it is believed a doctor asked the young woman to remover he veil during the interview for an administration job at Royal Darwin Hospital .
She refused - and filed an official complaint .
The case comes at a time when several western countries are following France 's lead in banning the wearing of the hijab in public .
The doctor is believed to have engaged a lawyer to represent him .
Discriminating against someone because of their religion is illegal .
But whether insisting a Muslim woman remove her hijab is discriminatory has not been tested in the Northern Territory .
NT Islamic Society president Adil Jamil said less than 2 per cent of Territory Muslim women wore a veil .
He said it was considered " offensive " to ask a woman to take off her hijab .
" It 's against their religious beliefs , " he said .
" It can seriously hurt their inner self .
" Under traditional Islamic view , a woman cannot show her face to any man except her husband and male relatives . "
Mr Jamil said there were about 2000 Muslims in the NT from 23 countries .
Three - quarters of them are of Pakistani , Bangladeshi and Indonesian heritage .
Mr Jamil said a few Territory - born Muslim women wore a veil .
" They see it as reinforcing their religious beliefs and inner satisfaction , " he said .
Originally published as Interviewee asked to remove hijab
For much of the world , 69 year - old Greta Berlin , spokeswoman and co-founder of the Free Gaza Movement , is a hero .
Berlin recently gained international attention for orchestrating the Gaza aid flotilla , calling Israel " a terrorist state " in interviews and articles .
Along with other leading members of her movement , mostly retired and well - to - do California - based women , Berlin has spewed anti-Israel hate rhetoric while simultaneously campaigning for the Palestinian cause .
It is ironic that these self - professed humanitarians , with Greta Berlin in the lead , choose to side with and support Hamas , the radical Islamic terrorist organization that seeks to drastically limit the rights of Gaza women and eradicate any form of liberalism in the Strip .
Since coming into power , Hamas has implemented strict religious decrees , in line with Islamic law , into public life in the Strip .
Last summer , Gaza 's top judge ordered female lawyers to wear Muslim headscarves to ensure that women dress in accordance with Islamic law , which requires women to cover up in public and wear loose fitting garments that show only their hands and faces .
The Gaza - based Palestinian Center for Human Rights issued a statement dubbing the new dress code for female lawyers a " dangerous violation of personal freedoms and women 's rights . "
Since Hamas ' rise to power , modesty squads patrol Gaza beaches to ensure that both women and men are properly covered , admonishing and even arresting women who are not swimming in full - length robes .
An increasing number of public schools are enforcing headscarves and cloaks as uniforms upon girls , sending females attired in jeans back home .
From musical concerts to hair salons , Hamas has stamped its interpretation of Islamic law into every imaginable aspect of everyday life .
In March 2010 , Hamas banned men from working in women 's beauty parlors and hair salons , which have been the target of explosions and other attacks since Hamas took over three years ago .
Hamas warned that anyone breaking the new salon law will be arrested and tried .
In April , Hamas sent police to break up the first major hip - hop concert , in Gaza .
A Hamas policeman said the dancing routines were " immoral . "
Hamas forbids men and women from publicly dancing together and Hamas militants carrying AK - 47s have been reported to stop such dancing venues in the past .
Excuse for anti-Israel hate ?
Under the Hamas regime , groups of radical Islamic Salafis associated with al - Qaeda and more extreme than Hamas ideologically , have been growing at an alarming rate .
In May , masked gunmen stormed a UN summer camp for children after fundamentalist Muslims accused the UNRWA organization of “ teaching schoolgirls fitness , dancing and immorality . ”
Such Salafi groups have targeted Internet cafes , burned down institutions associated with Christianity , and have attacked foreign schools and wedding parties .
Indeed , if this is the kind of “ free ” Gaza that Greta Berlin and those other liberal - minded Californian counterparts have in mind , one must question what is the real agenda of the Free Gaza Movement ?
As 21 - year old Jihad Rostom told BBC news in March 2010 , “ Hamas wants to force themselves onto the people .
They want the people to submit to them , this is their cover .
They destroyed the reputation of Islam by saying we ’re doing this because it is religion . "
Another Gazan , Lama Hourani , who campaigns for the rights of working women in Gaza , told BBC that the way Hamas presents Islam , “ the liberties of a woman are always subject to the consent of a male relative .
They do n’t look at men and women as equal . ”
Hence , one must question the rationality and objective behind Greta Berlin ’s media campaigns .
Does she truly support the children and women of Gaza or are they being used as an excuse to vent out her hatred against the existence of the Jewish State ?
Berlin has said nothing about the treatment of Palestinian women under the Hamas regime in Gaza .
There is no freedom of political expression or gender equality under radical Islamic Hamas and the extremist Salafi groups that want to control Gaza .
The political freedoms that Greta Berlin enjoys living in the USA as an American woman and the political freedoms enjoyed by women living in Israel - Jews , Christians , and Muslims alike - are almost non-existent for the women of Gaza and many other Muslim countries .
This is a fact of life in Gaza that has nothing to do with Israel and everything to do with Hamas ’ interpretation and implementation of Sharia law .
It is shameful that women of Western and liberal mindsets do nothing to support the rights of Muslim women in countries where political freedoms are allotted only to the men who support the political parties in power .

In a last - minute turn in global climate talks , international negotiators agreed over the weekend to adopt more ambitious plans than expected to trim government subsidies to oil companies worldwide , part of a broader effort to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions .
Earlier this week , negotiators were hammering out an agreement among the top 20 industrialized and emerging nations that called for each to take “ voluntary ” measures to cut production and consumption incentives .
But privately under pressure from the Obama administration over the last two days , the group now is preparing to sign an agreement that omits the word “ voluntary . ”
In another change in the language of the proposed agreement , the pact will pledge an ongoing review process that evaluates how well countries are living up to their commitment .
The tougher language was seen in part as a reaction to the ongoing oil spill crisis in the Gulf of Mexico .
The statement containing the new agreement was described by officials close to the negotiations Sunday afternoon as the final communique was being pieced together .
The agreement ’s climate passage will be part of a more sweeping statement that will be issued by members of the G - 20 nations shortly before they wrap up their summer summit Sunday evening .
Much of the weekend gathering has focused on reaching a group consensus on how to counter the global economic crisis .
On that point , leaders appear headed toward a joint statement Sunday afternoon that embraces a commitment to economic stimulus as well as to fiscal austerity .
The communique will likely set a goal of cutting deficits in government spending in half by 2013 , officials say , and putting debt on a downward slope by 2016 .
In a letter to other leaders last week , Obama said the U.S. would pursue economic recovery while also reducing the U.S. deficit to 3 % of gross domestic product by the 2015 fiscal year .
Officials who have seen the communique say it reflects President Obama ’s suggestions .
In any version , a summit communique has little real force of its own and is effective only according to how strictly nations decide to abide by its tenets .
And Sunday ’s statement will not lay out in great detail how and when countries will cut subsidies .
As now crafted , the communique will say that the leaders “ encourage continued and full implementation of country - specific strategies and will continue to review progress toward this commitment at upcoming summits . ”
Although not binding , the wording is significant to the parties , both as a reflection of the commitment of the world leaders and for its power to shape future conversations .
Where the climate passages are concerned , activists have been concerned for several days now about the explicit use of the word “ voluntary ” to describe the countries ’ commitment to cutting subsidies .
It came across to many as a step back from the agreement of a G - 20 meeting last year in Pittsburgh , where leaders formally proposed phasing out subsidies for fossil fuels .
Environmentalists were especially upset about it in light of the gulf oil spill .
“ That was a signal of weakening , ” said Jake Schmidt , international climate policy director of the National Resources Defense Council .
“ It does n’t have the same political ‘ oomph , ’ and lacks the political signal that the countries are expected to live up to it . ”

Odd Eggs , Double Yolks , No Yolks , etc .
Why does my hen lay double yolkers nearly every day and is it normal ?
It 's not normal .
Double yolks are a " mistake " in the chicken 's reproductive system that sometimes happens when a hen just starts laying eggs and her system is still trying to figure out how to do it correctly .
It may also be hereditary .
Looks like your hen falls in the latter category .
DOUBLE YOLK EGGS :
Double Yolkers appear when ovulation occurs too rapidly , or when one yolk somehow gets " lost " and is joined by the next yolk .
Double yolkers may be by a pullet whose productive cycle is not yet well synchronized .
They 're occasionally laid by a heavy - breed hen , often as an inherited trait .
The photo below shows a normal guinea egg on the left and a double yolk guinea egg on the right .
The double yolker weighed just over 2 ounces .
It 's the only double yolk guinea egg we 've ever gotten in the 3 years we 've been raising guinea fowl .
It was laid 23 September 2003 and was one of the last guinea eggs laid before they stopped laying for the winter .
The egg was 5 months old when this picture was taken and the insides were too dried up to photograph , but there were two yolks in there .
Maybe next time ...
NO YOLK :
No - yolkers are called " dwarf " , " wind " [ or , more commonly , " fart " ] eggs .
Such an egg is most often a pullet 's first effort , produced before her laying mechanism is fully geared up .
In a mature hen , a wind egg is unlikely , but can occur if a bit of reproductive tissue breaks away , stimulating the egg producing glands to treat it like a yolk and wrap it in albumen , membranes and a shell as it travels through the egg tube .
You can tell this has occurred if , instead of a yolk , the egg contains a small particle of grayish tissue .
In the old days , no yolkers were called " cock " eggs .
Since they contained no yolk and therefore can't hatch , our forebears believed they were laid by roosters .
This type of egg occurs in many varieties of fowl .
We 've found them in chickens , both standard and bantams , guineas and Coturnix Quail ( about the size of a small marble ) .
The above is a Pearl Guinea fart egg , very dark in color and less than 1 inch wide , laid in August , 2004 .
It 's the only Guinea fart egg we 've seen since we started raising Guineas .
MORE THAN TWO YOLKS :
Occasionally , an egg contains more than two yolks .
I once found a pullet 's egg that contained three .
The greatest number of yolks found in one egg is NINE .
Record breaking eggs are likely to be multiple yolkers .
The Guinness Book of Records lists the world 's largest [ chicken ] egg ( with a diameter of 9 inches / 22.5 cm ) as having five yolks and the heaviest egg ( 1 pound / 0.45 kg ) as having a double yolk and a double shell .
NO SHELL :
Every once in a while we get an egg with a membrane , but without a shell .
It feels like a water balloon .
This is another accident of the hen 's reproductive system and is not necessarily an indication of any problem .
The membrane was placed on the yolk and white , but it somehow slipped past the " shell mechanism " and the shell was n't deposited .
The photo below ( left ) is of an egg without a shell laid by one of our Barred Rock hens on 15 September 2004 .
The photo was taken 3 days later and the membrane had already begun drying up .
The photo on the right was sent by Jen Peters of Mendocino County Calif .
It was freshly laid by one of her chickens in mid-June , 2010 .
You can see right through the membrane .
EGG WITHIN AN EGG :
An egg within an egg , or a double shelled egg appears when an egg that is nearly ready to be laid reverses direction and gets a new layer of albumen covered by a second shell .
Sometimes the reversed egg joins up with the next egg and the two are encased together within a new shell .
Double shelled eggs are so rare that no one knows exactly why or how they happen .
The photo below was provided by one of our website visitors , Michelle Byerly , of Jasper , Texas .
The bowl is a standard single serving cereal bowl .
The egg was laid either by a Buff Orpington or a Black Australorp in early 2004 .
The egg found inside the other had no yolk ( fart egg ) .
ODD SHAPED EGGS :
This happens from time to time and is just an " accident " .
The long , thin egg below was laid by one of our Barred Rock hens in June , 2004 .
It is over 2 1 / 2 inches long and less than 1 1/4 inches across the middle .
A Chinese hen has produced a spoon - shaped egg .
The hen is owned by Huang Yazhou , a railway worker from Huaibei city , Anhui province , reports Chinanews.com .
One morning , Huang awoke to hear the hen , which he bought from a market two months ago , making weird noises .
When he checked , Huang found the hen had laid a spoon - shaped egg , 8.5 centimeters long and 35 grammes in weight .
Huang said he had never seen an egg like it before in his life .
An egg in China has been found with a tail .
The egg , found by chef Wang at his restaurant in Anyang city , Henan province , is normal size , but has a tail that is 3 cm long .
It is not known why the egg has the tail reports Dahe Daily .
Wang says he wants to hatch the egg and see what will come out .
WORMY EGGS :
Wormy eggs are extremely rare , occurring only in hens with a high parasite load .
Finding a worm in an egg is not only unappetizing , but is a clear indication that you are not doing a good job in keeping your hens healthy and parasite - free .
SHELL DISCOLORATION :
This is fairly common and occurs most often in brown eggs .
The pigment is sometimes deposited on the egg unevenly during production resulting in one end being a light tan and the other a darker brown .
The large end usually has the darker color .
The deposit of the pigment rarely forms a recognizable pattern ( like seeing shapes in clouds ) .
OFF FLAVOR :
Off flavor eggs may result from something the hen ate or from environmental odors .
Hens that eat onions , garlic , fruit peelings , fish meal , and fish oil will lay eggs with an undesirable flavor .
Eggs can also absorb odors that translate into unpleasant flavors if they 're stored near kerosene , carbolic acid , mold , must , fruits and vegetables .
The latest Science :
We modified the dictator game … and studied how inequality acceptance develops in adolescence .
We found that as children enter adolescence , they increasingly view inequalities reflecting differences in individual achievements , but not luck , as fair , whereas efficiency considerations mainly play a role in late adolescence . …
We assumed that there were three salient fairness views in this situation : strict egalitarianism , finding all inequalities unfair ; meritocratism , justifying inequalities reflecting differences in production ; and libertarianism , justifying all inequalities in earnings . …
The large majority of 5th graders were strict egalitarians , and , remarkably , there were almost no meritocrats at this grade level .
In contrast , meritocratism was the dominant position in late adolescence , and the share of strict egalitarians fell dramatically .
The share of libertarians was stable across grade levels .
…
From 9th grade , … efficiency considerations played a more important role for males than females .

This seems support for my view that frequent school scoring serves the function of making kids accept dominance and inequality :
At school , our kids are rated and ranked far more often than most adults will tolerate , even though this actually slows their learning !
It seems that modern schools function in part to help humans overcome their ( genetically and culturally ) inherited aversions to hierarchy and dominance .
Modern workplaces require workers who are far more accepting than are foragers of being told what to do when , and of being explicitly ranked , and our schools prepare kids to accept this more primate - like environment .

The evidence strongly suggests that students learn better when they are not graded and certainly not when they are graded on a curve .

Subjects worked on different tasks and received performance - contingent payments that varied in amount from small to very large relative to their typical levels of pay .
With some important exceptions , very high reward levels had a detrimental effect on performance .

The White Star Line was a British shipping company most famous for its ill fated flag ship the RMS Titanic and World War I sister ship , Britannic .
The White Star Line was originally founded in Liverpool in 1845 by John Pilkington and Henry Wilson .
The company 's initial focus was on the Australian gold mine trade .
In the early 1850's if you had sound ships and ran the Australian route , it would almost be difficult to not succeed .
In one month of 1853 , no less than 32,000 " get rich quick " hopefuls left port in Liverpool bound or Australia to strike their fortunes in gold .
Australia 's colony population jumped from 430,000 to 1.7 million in just 3 years after gold was discovered .

Josh Ritter has a way with metaphor .
It ’s one of the literary touches in his music that have established him among the cream of the young singer - songwriter crop , and it is all over his albums : romantic diplomacy in a missile silo ; Columbus ’s doomed fourth ship ; a mummy whose curse is the realization that love is mortal .
It was no big surprise , then , that in describing the creative crisis that led to his new album , “ So Runs the World Away ” ( Pytheas ) , Mr. Ritter , 33 , chose a particularly striking image .
“ When you ’re getting started , you ’re like a baby horse getting shot through a cannon , ” he said , seated at his kitchen table in Brooklyn and gesturing to illustrate the momentum of the projectile .
“ You either land running or you do n’t .
That initial shot is really exhilarating , but then you have to decide :
What are you doing this for , and how are you going to keep going ? ”
For a decade now , Mr. Ritter has been running steadily , guitar in hand .
His songs , built from simple , folky patterns into sharp vignettes or sprawling Whitmanesque meditations , have won over many critics , as well as what might be called the soft - rock establishment : NPR , Starbucks and noncommercial radio stations .
Sales of his albums have been modest .
But by courting fans for the long haul at a time when short - lived blog attention is often the yardstick for success , he has become a model for the way artists sustain careers in the wide middle zone between stardom and obscurity .

The attack on the Gaza relief flotilla jeopardizes Israel itself
Israel ’s botched raid against the Gaza - bound humanitarian flotilla on May 31 is the latest sign that Israel is on a disastrous course that it seems incapable of reversing .
The attack also highlights the extent to which Israel has become a strategic liability for the United States .
This situation is likely to get worse over time , which will cause major problems for Americans who have a deep attachment to the Jewish state .
The bungled assault on the Mavi Marmara , the lead ship in the flotilla , shows once again that Israel is addicted to using military force yet unable to do so effectively .
One would think that the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) would improve over time from all the practice .
Instead , it has become the gang that cannot shoot straight .
The IDF last scored a clear - cut victory in the Six Day War in 1967 ; the record since then is a litany of unsuccessful campaigns .
The War of Attrition ( 1969 - 70 ) was at best a draw , and Israel fell victim to one of the great surprise attacks in military history in the October War of 1973 .
In 1982 , the IDF invaded Lebanon and ended up in a protracted and bloody fight with Hezbollah .
Eighteen years later , Israel conceded defeat and pulled out of the Lebanese quagmire .
Israel tried to quell the First Intifada by force in the late 1980s , with Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin telling his troops to break the bones of the Palestinian demonstrators .
But that strategy failed and Israel was forced to join the Oslo Peace Process instead , which was another failed endeavor .
The IDF has not become more competent in recent years .
By almost all accounts — including the Israeli government ’s own commission of inquiry — it performed abysmally in the 2006 Lebanon war .
The IDF then launched a new campaign against the people of Gaza in December 2008 , in part to “ restore Israel ’s deterrence ” but also to weaken or topple Hamas .
Although the mighty IDF was free to pummel Gaza at will , Hamas survived and Israel was widely condemned for the destruction and killing it wrought on Gaza ’s civilian population .
Indeed , the Goldstone Report , written under UN auspices , accused Israel of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity .
Earlier this year , the Mossad murdered a Hamas leader in Dubai , but the assassins were seen on multiple security cameras and were found to have used forged passports from Australia and a handful of European countries .
The result was an embarrassing diplomatic row , with Australia , Ireland , and Britain each expelling an Israeli diplomat .
Given this history , it is not surprising that the IDF mishandled the operation against the Gaza flotilla , despite having weeks to plan it .
The assault forces that landed on the Mavi Marmara were unprepared for serious resistance and responded by shooting nine activists , some at point - blank range .
None of the activists had their own guns .
The bloody operation was condemned around the world — except in the United States , of course .
Even within Israel , the IDF was roundly criticized for this latest failure .
These ill - conceived operations have harmful consequences for Israel .
Failures leave adversaries intact and make Israeli leaders worry that their deterrent reputation is being undermined .
To rectify that , the IDF is turned loose again , but the result is usually another misadventure , which gives Israel new incentives to do it again , and so on .
This spiral logic , coupled with Israel ’s intoxication with military force , helps explain why the Israeli press routinely carries articles predicting where Israel ’s next war will be .
Israel ’s recent debacles have also damaged its international reputation .
Respondents to a 2010 worldwide opinion poll done for the BBC said that Israel , Iran , and Pakistan had the most negative influence in the world ; even North Korea ranked better .
More worrying for Israel is that its once close strategic relationship with Turkey has been badly damaged by the 2008 - 09 Gaza war and especially by the assault on the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish ship filled with Turkish nationals .
But surely the most troubling development for Israel is the growing chorus of voices in the United States who say that Israel ’s behavior is threatening American interests around the world , to include endangering its soldiers .
If that sentiment grows , it could seriously harm Israel ’s relationship with the United States .
Life as an Apartheid State
The flotilla tragedy highlights another way in which Israel is in deep trouble .
Israel ’s response makes it obvious that its leaders are not interested in allowing the Palestinians to have a viable state in Gaza and the West Bank , but instead are bent on creating a “ Greater Israel ” in which the Palestinians are confined to a handful of impoverished enclaves .
Israel insists that its blockade is solely intended to keep weapons out of Gaza .
Hardly anyone would criticize Israel if this were true , but it is not .
The real aim of the blockade is to punish the people of Gaza for supporting Hamas and resisting Israel ’s efforts to maintain Gaza as a giant open - air prison .
Of course , there was much evidence that this was the case before the debacle on the Mavi Marmara .
When the blockade began in 2006 , Dov Weisglass , a close aide to Prime Ministers Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert , said , “ The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet , but not to make them die of hunger . ”
And the Gaza onslaught 18 months ago was designed to punish the Gazans , not enforce a weapons embargo .
The ships in the flotilla were transporting humanitarian aid , not weapons for Hamas , and Israel ’s willingness to use deadly force to prevent a humanitarian aid convoy from reaching Gaza makes it abundantly clear that Israel wants to humiliate and subdue the Palestinians , not live side - by - side with them in separate states .
Collective punishment of the Palestinians in Gaza is unlikely to end anytime soon .
Israel ’s leaders have shown little interest in lifting the blockade or negotiating sincerely .
The sad truth is that Israel has been brutalizing the Palestinians for so long that it is almost impossible to break the habit .
It is hardly surprising that Jimmy Carter said last year , “ the citizens of Palestine are treated more like animals than human beings . ”
They are , and they will be for the foreseeable future .
Consequently , there is not going to be a two - state solution .
Instead , Gaza and the West Bank will become part of a Greater Israel , which will be an apartheid state bearing a marked resemblance to white - ruled South Africa .
Israelis and their American supporters invariably bristle at this comparison , but that is their future if they create a Greater Israel while denying full political rights to an Arab population that will soon outnumber the Jewish population in the entirety of the land .
In fact , two former Israeli prime ministers — Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak — have made this very point .
Olmert went so far as to argue , “ as soon as that happens , the state of Israel is finished . ”
He ’s right , because Israel will not be able to maintain itself as an apartheid state .
Like racist South Africa , it will eventually evolve into a democratic bi-national state whose politics will be dominated by the more numerous Palestinians .
But that process will take many years , and during that time , Israel will continue to oppress the Palestinians .
Its actions will be seen and condemned by growing numbers of people and more and more governments around the world .
Israel is unwittingly destroying its own future as a Jewish state , and doing so with tacit U.S. support .
America ’s Albatross
The combination of Israel ’s strategic incompetence and its gradual transformation into an apartheid state creates significant problems for the United States .
There is growing recognition in both countries that their interests are diverging ; indeed this perspective is even garnering attention inside the American Jewish community .
Jewish Week , for example , recently published an article entitled “ The Gaza Blockade : What Do You Do When U.S. and Israeli Interests Are n’t in Synch ? ”
Leaders in both countries are now saying that Israeli policy toward the Palestinians is undermining U.S. security .
Vice President Biden and Gen. David Petraeus , the head of Central Command , both made this point recently , and the head of the Mossad , Meir Dagan , told the Knesset in June , “ Israel is gradually turning from an asset to the United States to a burden . ”
It is easy to see why .
Because the United States gives Israel so much support and U.S. politicians routinely laud the “ special relationship ” in the most lavish terms , people around the globe naturally associate the United States with Israel ’s actions .
Unfortunately , this makes huge numbers of people in the Arab and Islamic world furious with the United States for supporting Israel ’s cruel treatment of the Palestinians .
That anger in turn helps fuel terrorism against America .
Remember that the 9/11 Commission Report , which describes Khalid Sheik Muhammad as the “ principal architect of the 9/11 attacks , ” concludes that his “ animus toward the United States stemmed not from his experiences there as a student , but rather from his violent disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel . ”
Osama bin Laden ’s hostility toward the United States was fuelled in part by this same concern .
Popular anger toward the United States also threatens the rulers of Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia , key U.S. allies who are frequently seen as America ’s lackeys .
The collapse of any of these regimes would be a big blow to the U.S. position in the region ; however , Washington ’s unyielding support for Israel makes these governments weaker , not stronger .
More importantly , the rupture in Israel ’s relationship with Turkey will surely damage America ’s otherwise close relationship with Turkey , a NATO member and a key U.S. ally in Europe and the Middle East .
Finally , there is the danger that Israel might attack Iran ’s nuclear facilities , which could have terrible consequences for the United States .
The last thing America needs is another war with an Islamic country , especially one that could easily interfere in its ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
This is why the Pentagon opposes striking Iran , whether with Israeli or U.S. forces .
But Netanyahu might do it anyway if he thinks it would be good for Israel , even if it were bad for the United States .
Dark Days Ahead for the Lobby
Israel ’s troubled trajectory is also causing major headaches for its American supporters .
First , there is the matter of choosing between Israel and the United States .
This is sometimes referred to as the issue of dual loyalty , but that term is a misnomer .
Americans are allowed to have dual citizenship — and in effect , dual loyalty — and this is no problem as long as the interests of the other country are in synch with America ’s interests .
For decades , Israel ’s supporters have striven to shape public discourse in the United States so that most Americans believe the two countries ’ interests are identical .
That situation is changing , however .
Not only is there now open talk about clashing interests , but knowledgeable people are openly asking whether Israel ’s actions are detrimental to U.S. security .
The lobby has been scrambling to discredit this new discourse , either by reasserting the standard argument that Israel ’s interests are synonymous with America ’s or by claiming that Israel — to quote a recent statement by Mortimer Zuckerman , a key figure in the lobby — “ has been an ally that has paid dividends exceeding its costs . ”
A more sophisticated approach , which is reflected in an AIPAC - sponsored letter that 337 congresspersons sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March , acknowledges that there will be differences between the two countries , but argues that “ such differences are best resolved quietly , in trust and confidence . ”
In other words , keep the differences behind closed doors and away from the American public .
It is too late , however , to quell the public debate about whether Israel ’s actions are damaging U.S. interests .
In fact , it is likely to grow louder and more contentious with time .
This changing discourse creates a daunting problem for Israel ’s supporters , because they will have to side either with Israel or the United States when the two countries ’ interests clash .
Thus far , most of the key individuals and institutions in the lobby have sided with Israel when there was a dispute .
For example , President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu have had two big public fights over settlements .
Both times the lobby sided with Netanyahu and helped him thwart Obama .
It seems clear that individuals like Abraham Foxman , who heads the Anti-Defamation League , and organizations like AIPAC are primarily concerned about Israel ’s interests , not America’s .
This situation is very dangerous for the lobby .
The real problem is not dual loyalty but choosing between the two loyalties and ultimately putting the interests of Israel ahead of those of America .
The lobby ’s unstinting commitment to defending Israel , which sometimes means shortchanging U.S. interests , is likely to become more apparent to more Americans in the future , and that could lead to a wicked backlash against Israel ’s supporters as well as Israel .
The lobby faces yet another challenge : defending an apartheid state in the liberal West is not going to be easy .
Once it is widely recognized that the two - state solution is dead and Israel has become like white - ruled South Africa — and that day is not far off — support for Israel inside the American Jewish community is likely to diminish significantly .
The main reason is that apartheid is a despicable political system that is fundamentally at odds with basic American values as well as core Jewish values .
For sure there will be some Jews who will defend Israel no matter what kind of political system it has .
But their numbers will shrink over time , in large part because survey data shows that younger American Jews feel less attachment to Israel than their elders , which makes them less inclined to defend Israel blindly .
The bottom line is that Israel will not be able to maintain itself as an apartheid state over the long term because it will not be able to depend on the American Jewish community to defend such a reprehensible political order .
Assisted Suicide
Israel is facing a bleak future , yet there is no reason to think that it will change course anytime soon .
The political center of gravity in Israel has shifted sharply to the right and there is no sizable pro-peace political party or movement .
Moreover , it remains firmly committed to the belief that what cannot be solved by force can be solved with greater force , and many Israelis view the Palestinians with contempt if not hatred .
Neither the Palestinians nor any of Israel ’s immediate neighbors are powerful enough to deter it , and the lobby will remain influential enough over the next decade to protect Israel from meaningful U.S. pressure .
Remarkably , the lobby is helping Israel commit national suicide while also doing serious damage to American security interests .
Voices challenging this tragic situation have grown slightly more numerous in recent years , but the majority of political commentators and virtually all U.S. politicians seem blissfully ignorant of where this is headed , or unwilling to risk their careers by speaking out .

Editor 's Note : Correspondent , Hendrick Voss asks :
" Will it also take 40 years until we can read the transcripts of conversations that took place in the State Department and in the U.S. embassy in Tegucigalpa last year when the decision was made that Zelaya ’s overtures to the Honduran left wing had gone too far and that School of the Americas graduates had to step in to prevent the U.S. from being squeezed out ? "
The answer of course is " yes " , i.e. unless in the intervening period , Washington is lifted up by its ankles and the truth is shaken out of all its pockets .
- Les Blough , Editor
For nearly four decades , there ’s been an open ques­tion about the 1971 coup that brought dic­ta­tor Hugo Banzer Suárez to power in Bolivia : was the U.S. gov­ern­ment involved ?
Thanks to newly declas­si­fied doc­u­ments , we now have an answer .
Banzer was a dic­ta­tor of Bolivia from 1971 - 8 and a demo­c­ra­t­i­cally elected pres­i­dent from 1997 - 2001 .
His three - ​day coup in August 1971 was sig­nif­i­cant not only for the fight­ing that accom­pa­nied it , which left 110 dead and 600 wounded , but for the seven - ​year regime that fol­lowed , one of the most repres­sive in Bolivia ’s his­tory .
Under Banzer ’s rule , more than 14,000 Boli­vians were arrested with­out a judi­cial order , more than 8,000 were tortured — with elec­tric­ity , water , beatings — and more than 200 were exe­cuted or dis­ap­peared .
( I ’m writ­ing a long arti­cle about the legacy of the regime for Nar­ra­tive Mag­a­zine .
It will hope­fully be out by the end of the year . )
Amer­i­can sup­port for Banzer before and after the coup was never in doubt .
He had trained at the School of the Amer­i­cas in Panama and the Armored Cav­alry School in Texas , and in the late 60s served as mil­i­tary attaché in Wash­ing­ton .
In the five months after he ousted left - ​wing dic­ta­tor Gen­eral Juan José Torres , Banzer was rewarded with $ 50 mil­lion in grants and aid from the Nixon Administration .
But while U.S. sup­port for Banzer during the coup has been widely assumed among Boli­vians and Latin Amer­i­can his­to­ri­ans , the only proof ( until now ) was been a Wash­ing­ton Post reportpub­lished a week after the event , which said that U.S. Air Force Major Robert J. Lundin had advised the plot­ters and lent them a long - ​range radio .
The report was never sub­stan­ti­ated , how­ever , and the State Depart­ment denied it imme­di­ately , assert­ing unequiv­o­callythat the U.S. played no part in the over­throw of Torres .
A col­lec­tion of declas­si­fied doc­u­mentsrecently released * by the same State Depart­ment proves that this denial was not only incor­rect , but a lie : the Nixon Admin­is­tra­tion , acting with the full knowl­edge of the State Depart­ment , autho­rized nearly half a mil­lion dollars — ” coup money , ” accord­ing to the ambas­sador in La Paz — for the politi­cians and mil­i­tary offi­cers plot­ting against Torres .
The CIA handed at least some of this money over to the coup ’s lead­ers in the days lead­ing up to Banzer ’s seizure of power .
Min­utes from a July 8 , 1971 meet­ing of the 40 Com­mit­tee ( an executive - ​branch group chaired by Henry Kissinger and tasked with over­sight of covert oper­a­tions ) included dis­cus­sion of a CIA pro­posalto give $ 410,000 to a group of oppo­si­tion politi­cians and mil­i­tary lead­ers , money that they knew would be used to over­throw Torres .
( Under Sec­re­tary of State U. Alexis John­son : “ what we are actu­ally orga­niz­ing is a coup in itself , is n’t it ? ” )
Though the com­mit­tee decided to wait to hear from Ambas­sador Ernest Sir­a­cusa ( he opposed the mea­sure ) the plan was ulti­mately approved .
The same day that the coup began in Santa Cruz , Bolivia , an NSC staffer reported to Kissinger that the CIA had trans­ferred money to two high - ​ranking mem­bers of the opposition .
The CIA pro­posal had its roots in a June con­ver­sa­tionbetween Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger , when they decided that Torres ’s over­tures to the Boli­vian left wing had gone too far :
Kissinger :
We are having a major prob­lem in Bolivia , too .
And — Nixon : I got that .
Con­nally men­tioned that .
What do you want to do about that ?
Kissinger : I ’ve told [ CIA Deputy Direc­tor of Plans Thomas ] Karamessines to crank up an oper­a­tion , post - ​haste .
Even the Ambas­sador there , who ’s been a softy , is now saying that we must start play­ing with the mil­i­tary there or the thing is going to go down the drain .
Nixon : Yeah .
Kissinger :
That ’s due in on Monday .
Nixon :
What does Karamessines think we need ?
A coup ?
Kissinger :
We ’ll see what we can , whether — in what con­text .
They ’re going to squeeze us out in another two months .
They ’ve already gotten rid of the Peace Corps , which is an asset , but now they want to get rid of USIA and mil­i­tary people .
And I do n’t know whether we can even think of a coup , but we have to find out what the lay of the land is there .
The CIA was almost cer­tainly cor­rect that regard­less of U.S. involve­ment “ an attempt to oust Torres in the next few months , if not sooner , [ was ] inevitable . ”
But even though they rec­og­nized that sup­port­ing the coup was “ a high risk operation , ” they decided they might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb :
The U.S. Gov­ern­ment will be the log­i­cal cul­prit in the minds of Boli­vians .
More­over , we fully expect the CIA to come under fire and accu­sa­tions of CIA involve­ment seem inevitable .
Since the CIA has been accused reg­u­larly ( and falsely ) of innu­mer­able plots and activ­i­ties in Bolivia , one more accu­sa­tion should not cause exces­sive public reaction .
On August 26 , three days after Banzer claimed power , Kissinger and Nixon spoke on the tele­phone .
Kissinger briefed the Pres­i­dent on his recent meet­ing with Viet­nam POW wives and the Pres­i­dent told Kissinger that “ the trou­ble with Reagan is quite clear .
He really is simplistic . ”
At the end of the con­ver­sa­tion , Kissinger noted , “ In Bolivia there has been a coup .
It has brought on a right - ​wing government . ”
Nixon ’s response ?
“ What about Chile . ”
* In July 2009 the State Depart­ment Released volume E - 10 of For­eign Rela­tions of the United States 1968 - 1972 , but with­held the Bolivia chap­ter until declas­si­fi­ca­tion could be com­pleted .
The Bolivia doc­u­ments were released some­time between March 1 of this year ( when I last checked the FRUS web­site ) and now .
As far as I can tell , no one else has noted the appear­ance or sig­nif­i­cance of the Bolivia documents .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - New U.S. claims for jobless benefits climbed more steeply than anticipated last week , according to a Labor Department report on Thursday that further underlined the drag on economic activity from persistently weak job markets .
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 464,000 in the week ended July 17 , the department said , more than erasing a decline in the prior week that included the Independence Day holiday .
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 445,000 from the previously reported 429,000 in the July 10 week , which was revised slightly down to 427,000 in Thursday ’s report .
The report covered the survey week for government ’s closely monitored employment report for July , which is scheduled for release early next month .
A Labor Department official said there were no special factors affecting the numbers , but noted that the Independence Day holiday could have caused a backlog in processing applications .

New research shows that the insect - repelling chemical deet actually functions in the same way as deadly nerve gases and dangerous pesticides , by attacking the nervous systems of both insects and mammals .
" These findings question the safety of deet , particularly in combination with other chemicals , " said researcher Vincent Corbel of Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement in Montpellier .
The chemical known as deet ( for N , N - diethyl - meta - toluamide ) is found in nearly every commonly used mosquito repellent in the world , and eight billion doses have been applied since its introduction to the consumer market in 1957 .
The chemical was originally developed as an insect repellent by the U.S. Army in 1946 , following experience with jungle warfare in World War II .
Deet 's popularity comes largely from its effectiveness in repelling a variety of medically significant insects over longer periods of time than more natural repellents ( such as certain vegetable - based oils ) , and the fact that it can be incorporated into sprays , liquids or lotions .
Yet although researchers have long insisted that the chemical is safe , they still recommend that consumers use the minimum amount of repellent necessary to cover exposed skin or clothing , and that deet repellents not be applied directly to any irritated or injured skin .
While the United States allows the sale of 100 percent deet repellents , many other countries limit maximum concentrations of the chemical to 30 or 50 percent .
In spite of the chemical 's long use , researchers are unsure exactly how deet functions to repel mosquitoes .
It has long been believed to affect mosquito behavior without harming the insects , probably by interfering with their sense of smell and their ability to find human prey .
Yet the new study , published in the journal , suggests that deet may function by interfering directly with insects ' nervous systems .
"
We 've found that deet is not simply a behavior - modifying chemical but also inhibits the activity of a key central nervous system enzyme , acetylcholinesterase , in both insects and mammals , " the researchers said .
In experiments performed in cockroaches and rats , the researchers found that deet blocked the action of the neurological enzyme acetylcholinesterase .
This is the same mechanism that causes the toxic effects of popular carbamate and organophosphate pesticides , as well as chemical weapons such as sarin and VX nerve gas .
This may mean that deet repellants are actually insecticides and could damage the human nervous system .
Organophosphates are among the pesticides most commonly implicated in pesticide poisoning worldwide , and are also a commonly used suicide method in agricultural areas .
Like nerve gases , organophosphates irreversibly inactivate acetylcholinesterase , leading to excessive salivation and eye watering at low doses , and muscle spasms or death at higher doses .
Although carbamates are not as toxic as organophosphates , their effects can be just as severe at high enough doses .
Strong evidence also links these pesticides to dangerous health effects caused by long - term exposure even at low doses .
Previous studies have implicated deet in causing seizures in children , but the current study is the first to uncover how the chemical acts directly on the nervous system .
The researchers also found that the effects of deet were enhanced when it was used in combination with organophosphates or carbamates , as in mixed repellent - insecticide products .
Bahie Abou -Donia of the Duke University Medical Center said that the new findings are consistent with previous research into the risks of deet .
" Deet is a good chemical for protection against insects , " Abou - Donia said .
" But prolonged exposure results in neurological damage , and this is enhanced by other chemicals and medications .
" The researchers in the new study suggested that pregnant women and children under the age of six avoid using deet - containing mosquito repellents .
Abou - Donia went farther , calling for such products to carry warning labels about deet 's potential to cause neurological harm .
The Environmental Protection Agency has a review of deet 's safety planned for 2012 .

GOP Congressman : BP Escrow Fund Is Just Like Hitler
Doug Mataconis · · 15 comments
Following up on James Joyner ’s post earlier this week about the odd correlation of the BP escrow fund and Naziism , we know have Texas Congressman Louis Gohmert saying this :
I hereby request a moratorium on any political argument that involves invoking Nazis , Hitler , Mussolini , Mao , or Soviet Communism .
“ We are looking beyond Afghanistan in terms of the provision of some of the more sophisticated components and the provision of finance , ” he said .
“ There is evidence that something is coming in from Iran , something is coming in from Pakistan . ”

The Pentagon 's ultimate team of technologists is looking to looking to bridgethe cultural divide in Afghanistan – with storytelling , pantomime and the Wizard of Oz .
After nine years of conflict , the U.S. military is still having trouble finding common ground with warzone locals .
One way to fill that breach , Darpa figures , is through " interactive stories . "
Counterinsurgency , in many ways , is a series of negotiations – over economic development , over security , over political power .
And " negotiation , " Darpa explains in a new request for information , " is best served by a culturally - specific narrative that explains why we hold a position , how it relates to other parties , and how it affects all parties both positively and negatively . "
Darpa 's tales are part of a larger Defense Department push to get smarter about the battlefield 's " human terrain . "
Teams of social scientists are now embedding with combat units ; Pentagon - funded researchers are building computer models of how the societies of Afghanistan and Iraq work ; military pollsters are trying to tap public opinion in the conflict zones .
To come up with its storytelling tools , Darpa 's Information Processing Technologies Office is hoping to go beyond its usual cadre of neuroscientists , artificial intelligence specialists , and gadgeteers .
The agency also wants contributions from " art , literature , film , dance , games development , advertising and public relations , advertising , grass roots organizing , collective decision making or any other discipline for which the respondent can make an argument that the approach bears on this task . "
There will be some technology involved – this is Darpa , after all .
But the agency is encouraging " very non-traditional approaches to this problem ( e.g. , a virtual tribal storyteller interacts with a human mime to produce a silent theater improvisation with audience participation ) . "
The " Negotiate Across Cultures " project will kick off with a two - day workshop .
There , Darpa will hold a " mock competition " of potential researchers .
But this wo n't be a gizmo demo .
Instead , the " participants will use a ' Wizard of Oz ' approach to illustrate how each approach , if implemented , would operate on selected negotiation problems within specific socio-cultural environments .
In the ' Wizard of Oz ' approach , one or two human representatives of each participant team will listen to a problem description and manually act out the operation and structure of the tool using props they bring to the event . "
Get your props ready ; the workshop is planned for late July or early August .

Taliban rule out talks with Nato : ' Why should we when we 're winning and foreign troops are withdrawing ? '
The Taliban in Afghanistan have declared there is no question of them entering into negotiations with Nato forces .
The news came in a defiant statement , which added that they believe they are winning the war .
The statement , released to the BBC ’s John Simpson , said : ‘ We do not want to talk to anyone - not to [ President Hamid ] Karzai , nor to any foreigners - till the foreign forces withdraw from Afghanistan .
The defiant message from the Taliban comes as Nato forces suffered their deadliest month yet in Afghanistan , with 102 deaths .
Pictured are soldiers from 1st Battalion the Royal Gurkha Rifles during a patrol in Nahr e Saraj , Helmand
‘ We are certain that we are winning .
Why should we talk if we have the upper hand , and the foreign troops are considering withdrawal , and there are differences in the ranks of our enemies ? ’
It comes as Nato forces suffered their biggest loss in the country so far , with 102 deaths in the month of June .
Withdrawal strategies have been announced with British troops to be among the last to leave Afghanistan , Defence Secretary Liam Fox announced this week .
In a major speech in Washington , Dr Fox said Prime Minister David Cameron and U.S. President Barack Obama must ' see the job through ' and resist succumbing to a ' natural impatience ' to get the troops home .
In an interview he then conceded that the British armed forces would be among the last home , because they are stationed in a ' difficult ' area that is likely to be ' one of the last parts to transition to Afghan security ' .
Defence Secretary Liam Fox ( left ) has announced that British troops will be among the last to leave Afghanistan , while General David Petraeus ( right ) has warned that the fighting is likely to escalate
American ’s new commander for Afghanistan has warned that the fighting will continue and even escalate as it prepares its own withdrawal plans .
General David Petraeus said the ' industrial strength insurgency ' would intensify in the coming months and admitted a previously agreed date to get out by July 2011 represented only the ' beginning of the process ' .
His comments to a Senate committee in Washington came days after he replaced General Stanley McChrystal , who was fired last week over disparaging remarks he made about President Barack Obama and his advisers in the magazine Rolling Stone .
Gen Petraeus said he backed Mr Obama 's policy to put 30,000 more US troops into Afghanistan and begin a withdrawal next summer , but any pull - outs would be based on how the war was going .
General Sir David Richards had hoped to negotiate with the Taliban
' It 's not a date when the U.S. heads to the exits , ' he told the Senate Armed Services Committee , which must confirm his appointment .
' We 'll need to provide assistance to Afghanistan for a long time to come , ' he said .
The President expressed frustration recently with the ‘ obsession ’ with the withdrawal date for US troops .
He said : ‘ I do n’t have a crystal ball .
' I think that right now the debate surrounding Afghanistan is presented as either we get up and leave immediately because there 's no chance at a positive outcome , or we stay basically indefinitely and do quote unquote whatever it takes for as long as it takes . '
He reiterated that a July 2011 date to begin withdrawing troops does not mean the U.S. will ' suddenly turn off the lights and let the door close behind us . '
The Taliban ’s refusal to entertain any dialogue with Nato will come as a blow to Britain after the head of the Army expressed hopes of negotiating with them just days ago .
General Sir David Richards said that despite the enemy 's deadly attacks on his own troops he could see ' no reason ' why negotiations should not be opened .
And he suggested that talks with Taliban leaders could begin ' pretty soon ' .
His comments put him at odds with the Defence Secretary , who has previously ruled out negotiations until Taliban fighters lay down their weapons .
U.S. General McChrystal had called for negotiations with elements of the Taliban who are fighting for money rather than ideology .

A FORMER special forces soldier in his 50s has told how he fought off an intruder half his age during a home invasion .
No points for guessing who won the day
Fifty - six - year - old Rudi , who declined to give his last name , said he was " scared " when he and his wife were woken by the sound of breaking glass , then found a man standing outside the bedroom door of their Klemzig home about 11 o'clock on Friday night .
But instinct kicked in and the former Hungarian soldier , now a furniture removalist , tackled the stranger to the ground - only to discover it was someone known to him .
" The house was dark and he was wearing a beanie and had something in his hand , " Rudi said yesterday .
" Of course I was scared , but I 'd had military training in Hungary so I grabbed him around the throat and threw him to the floor then took his beanie off . "
The man , a 27 - year - old who police said appeared intoxicated , was bleeding profusely from cuts he suffered after smashing his way through the glass front door of the Whitbread Ave house .
Rudi , who still does weight training , said he asked the man : " What are you doing " before telling him to " cool down " .
" He then said , ` All right ... I 'm sorry ' . "
Rudi released his grip on the man who asked to wash the blood from his face in the bathroom .
" I told him not to make any more trouble , but after washing his face he targeted me again and tried to grab me , " Rudi said .
" So I pushed him off and he ran to the lounge .
" My wife was desperately phoning police for help and he grabbed her and they both fell down , so I grabbed him off her and held him down . "
Despite the threat to his wife , Rudi said he remained calm and focused .
" He was throwing punches at me so I used a self - defence technique that I had learned in the army , " he said .
" I put my elbow on the back of his neck and forced him down to the ground ( face first ) .
He had a lot of energy because of the adrenalin and tried to resist .
" He was kicking a bit but I managed to keep him down until the police arrived about eight minutes later .
" I was defending my house and defending my wife , and if the police did n't come I could have killed him . "
Rudi described the intruder as " very skinny " .
The series of struggles across the house left blood splattered in the bathroom , passage and on the lounge rug , sofa and the walls .
Rudi , who fled the communist regime in Hungary in 1978 , said the man had worked for him on a casual basis for about four years .
With removal work coming in on an irregular basis , Rudi said he kept in shape by working out on his home weights gym .
Police arrested the man and have charged him with breaking into the house and assault .
He was refused bail and will appear in the Holden Hill Magistrates Court on Tuesday .
He was treated at the Royal Adelaide Hospital for lacerations .
Rudi and his wife were not injured .
He said the bill for damage to the glass front door and side panels was estimated at between $ 400 and $ 500 .

THE lethal mishandling of Israel 's attack on a ship carrying humanitarian supplies that was trying to break the blockade of Gaza was bound to provoke outrage — and rightly so .
The circumstances of the raid are murky and may well remain that way despite an inquiry ( see article ) .
But the impression received yet again by the watching world is that Israel resorts to violence too readily .
More worryingly for Israel , the episode is accelerating a slide towards its own isolation .
Once admired as a plucky David facing down an array of Arab Goliaths , Israel is now seen as the clumsy bully on the block .
Israel 's desire to stop the flotilla reaching Gaza was understandable , given its determination to maintain the blockade .
Yet the Israelis also had a responsibility to conduct the operation safely .
The campaigners knew that either way they would win .
If they had got through , it would have been a triumphant breaching of the blockade .
If forcibly stopped , with their cargo of medical equipment and humanitarian aid , they would be portrayed as victims — even if some , as the Israelis contend , brought clubs , knives and poles .
As it was , disastrous planning by Israel 's soldiers led to a needless loss of life .
For anyone who cares about Israel , this tragedy should be the starting point for deeper questions — about the blockade , about the Jewish state 's increasing loneliness and the route to peace .
A policy of trying to imprison the Palestinians has left their jailer strangely besieged .
Losing friends , strengthening Hamas
The blockade of Gaza is cruel and has failed .
The Gazans have suffered sorely but have not been starved into submission .
Hamas has not been throttled and overthrown , as Israeli governments ( and many others ) have wished .
Gilad Shalit , an Israeli soldier taken hostage , has not been freed .
Weapons and missiles can still be smuggled in through tunnels from Egypt .
Just as bad , from Israel 's point of view , it helps feed antipathy towards Israel , not just in the Arab and Muslim worlds , but in Europe too .
Israel once had warm relations with a ring of non-Arab countries in the vicinity , including Iran and Turkey .
The deterioration of Israel 's relations with Turkey , whose citizens were among the nine dead , is depriving Israel of a rare Muslim ally and mediator .
It is startling how , in its bungled effort to isolate Gaza , democratic Israel has come off worse than Hamas , which used to send suicide - bombers into restaurants .
Most telling of all are the stirrings of disquiet in America , Israel 's most steadfast ally .
Americans are still vastly more sympathetic to the Israelis than to the Palestinians .
But a growing number , especially Democrats , including many liberal Jews , are getting queasier about what they see as America 's too robotic support for Israel , especially when its government is as hawkish as Binyamin Netanyahu's .
A gap in sympathy for Israel has widened between Democrats and Republicans .
Conservatives still tend to back Israel through hell and the high seas .
Barack Obama is more conscious that the Palestinians ' failure to get a state is helping to spread anti-American poison across the Muslim world , making it harder for him to deal with Iran , Iraq and Afghanistan .
His generals have strenuously made that point .
None other than the head of Israel 's Mossad , its foreign intelligence service , declared this week that America has begun to see Israel more as a burden than an asset .
That has led to the charge by hawkish American Republicans , as well as many Israelis , that Mr Obama is bent on betraying Israel .
In fact , he is motivated by a harder - nosed appreciation of the pros and cons of America 's cosiness with Israel , and is thus all the keener to prod the Jewish state towards giving the Palestinians a fair deal .
He has condemned the building of Jewish settlements on Palestinian territory more bluntly than his predecessors did , because he rightly thinks they make it harder to negotiate a peace deal .
Mr Obama 's greater sternness towards Israel is for the general good — including Israel's .
Harmony is not just a dream
Israel is caught in a vicious circle .
The more its hawks think the outside world will always hate it , the more it tends to shoot opponents first and ask questions later , and the more it finds that the world is indeed full of enemies .
Though Mr Netanyahu has reluctantly agreed to freeze settlement - building and is negotiating indirectly with Palestinians , he does not give the impression of being willing to give ground in the interests of peace .
Yet the prospect of a deal between Palestinians and Israelis still beckons .
The contours of a two - state solution remain crystal - clear : an adjusted border , with Israel keeping some of the biggest settlements while Palestine gets equal swaps of land ; Jerusalem shared as a capital , with special provisions for the holy places ; and an admission by Palestinians that they cannot return to their old homes in what became Israel in 1948 , with some theoretical right of return acknowledged by Israel and a small number of refugees let back without threatening the demographic preponderance of Jewish Israelis .
And what about Hamas , if Israel is to lift the siege of Gaza ?
How should Israel handle an authoritarian movement that refuses to recognise it and has in the past readily used terror ?
One answer is to ask the UN to oversee the flow of goods and people going in and out of Gaza .
That is hardly a cure - all , but Hamas would become the world 's problem neighbour , not just Israel's .
The Arab world must do more , pressing Hamas to disavow violence , publicly pledge not to resume the firing of rockets at Israeli civilians and revoke its anti-Semitic charter .
The West , led by Mr Obama , should call for Hamas to be drawn into negotiations , both with its rival Palestinians on the West Bank as well as with Israel , even if it does not immediately recognise the Jewish state .
It is still the party the Palestinians elected in 2006 to represent all of them .
None of this will be easy .
But the present stalemate is bloodily leading nowhere .
Israel is a regional hub of science , business and culture .
Despite its harsh treatment of Palestinians in the land it occupies , it remains a vibrant democracy .
But its loneliness , partly self - inflicted , is making it a worse place , not just for the Palestinians but also for its own people .
If only it can replenish its stock of idealism and common sense before it is too late .
Visualizing a function can give a mathematician enormous insight into the function 's algebraic and geometrical properties .
The easiest way to see what a function looks like is to use a computer as a graphing tool .
At times , this technique is the most useful , but drawing the function yourself is always the best way to get a feeling for why the function looks the way it does when graphed .
All of you are by now familiar with graphing one - variable functions in the plane and hopefully can easily predict the shape of any fairly simple 2D function just by analyzing its equation .
This knowledge came from graphing similar functions over and over again to get a feel for their general shape and critical points .
The purpose of this tutorial is to quickly revisit these 2D examples and then to move on to drawing functions situated in 3D and even 4D space .
Climate science 's winter of discontent has not made a large impact on the British public 's attitudes to global warming , according to poll of over 1,800 people .
The poll , by researchers at the University of Cardiff , showed a small drop in public acceptance of climate change but not the major falls that some observers had predicted after a series of media controversies over the actions of climate scientists , combined with the failure of the Copenhagen summit and the record - breaking cold temperatures .
" By no means has there been a collapse in confidence in climate science , " said Professor Nick Pidgeon , who led the study .
" If I was in policy circles I would not be complacent , but reassured that it has not been as serious as many thought it would be . "
The survey showed that almost three - quarters ( 71 % ) of Britons are concerned about climate change .
Some 78 % think the climate is changing , which is down from 91 % who said it was in a similar poll in 2005 .
Pidgeon said there were a number of possible explanations for the decline , including the economic crisis .
" There is a theory that there is a finite pool of worry that anyone has . "
The poll , carried out with Ipsos Mori , surveyed 1,822 people across England , Scotland and Wales .
It took place from January to March this year , following the high - profile release of emails from climate scientists at the University of East Anglia , which critics claimed showed collusion and conspiracy among researchers , and the discovery of a mistake in the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Green campaigners said the controversy of the UEA emails had set back efforts to tackle global warming by 20 years , while media commentators blamed it as the issue fell down the political agenda post -Copenhagen .
Pidgeon said it was difficult to examine the reasons for people 's attitudes in quantitative surveys such as this .
But he said unpublished work from a series of parallel focus groups with people in Bristol showed that many thought the media had exaggerated the seriousness of the email scandal .
The most likely effect of the release of the emails would have been to reinforce people 's existing attitudes to the issue , he said .
The poll showed that most people ( 71 % ) remain fairly or very concerned about climate change , compared to 82 % in 2005 .
Some 40 % said that the seriousness of climate change is exaggerated , while 42 % disagreed .
Just 20 % thought there was serious disagreement among scientists about whether climate change is caused by humans , despite efforts by climate sceptics to undermine the consensus that greenhouse gas emissions drive global warming .
Some 70 % of people said it was their responsibility to act on climate change , while 63 % thought they could change their behaviour to help .
More than two - thirds ( 68 % ) said they would vote in favour of spending taxpayers money on British projects to tackle climate change .
The poll also examined people 's attitudes to nuclear power and found it had become slightly more acceptable to the public , in particular as part of efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
But there was still " no ringing endorsement " for expanding nuclear , Pidgeon said .
The results come as a similar survey in the US shows that public concern about global warming is on the rise .
The research , from experts at Yale and George Mason universities , showed that belief among the US public that global warming is happening has risen 4 % since January , to 61 % .
Those who accept it is caused by human activity rose 3 % to 50 % .
And the number of US citizens who said that the issue is personally important to them rose 5 % , to 63 % .
" The stabilisation and slight rebound in public opinion is occurring amid signs the economy is starting to recover , along with consumer confidence , and as memories of unusual snowstorms and scientific scandals recede , " said Anthony Leiserowitz , director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication .
" The BP oil disaster is also reminding the public of the dark side of dependence on fossil fuels , which may be increasing support for clean energy policies . "
ROME ( Reuters ) -
It was n’t exactly pennies from heaven but it was perhaps the next best thing : a truck carrying 2.5 million euros in coins overturned on a highway in southern Italy and motorists picked up the money like mushrooms .
In the accident , the truck ’s rear door popped open and what followed must have seemed like a massive slot machine win .
Before police arrived , motorists stopped their cars and made off with about 10,000 euros in one and two euro coins being transported from the Italian mint to local banks .
The story and pictures made the front page of many Italian papers on Tuesday alongside grim articles about the coming austerity budget that will force many to make sacrifices .
One called it “ The miracle of the coins . ”
There are two main schools of debugging in my experience - " give me an interactive debugger and let me play " and " you can have printf when you pry it from my cold , dead fingers " .
Smalltalk people are almost always of the first class since they have a better debugger than , well , everybody ; I am , I suppose inevitably given my tendencies towards minimalist development toolsets , very definitely of the second .
Now , the most common tool for doing this with perl is Data : : Dumper , which allows you to simply write :
use Data :: Dumper ; print Dumper ( $var ) ;
However , the default output leaves a little to be desired - it sticks ' $ VAR1 =' on the front and indents things massively and produces hash keys in random order .
Fortunately , you can configure Data : : Dumper , either by creating an object or by setting package variables :
my $ dd = Data:: Dumper ->new ( [ ] ) -> Sortkeys ( 1 ) ; $ Data : : Dumper :: Sortkeys = 1 ;
However , the former gets kind of long winded , and the latter is nastily global .
Of course , you can turn it on only for the currently executing code by using :
{ local $ Data : : Dumper : : Sortkeys = 1 ; ... # code that uses Dumper goes here }
This does n't help with the fact that there 's quite a few options you usually set though , and it does n't help the fact you find yourself copypasting or recreating the option set every time you touch a new piece of code .
So having got bored of this , I wrote up Data : : Dumper : : Concise : : Sugar so that :
use Data:: Dumper :: Concise ; warn Dumper ( $var ) ;
is equivalent to :
use Data :: Dumper ; { local $ Data : : Dumper : : Terse = 1 ; local $ Data : : Dumper : : Indent = 1 ; local $ Data : : Dumper : : Useqq = 1 ; local $ Data : : Dumper : : Deparse = 1 ; local $ Data : : Dumper : : Quotekeys = 0 ; local $ Data : : Dumper :: Sortkeys = 1 ; warn Dumper ( $var ) ; }
This simplifies things quite a bit - and for added bonus points , with an empty argument list we return the dumper object for you to use :
my $dd = Dumper ;
This made life substantially nicer - DBIx :: Class now uses it to format debug output by default , since it turned out my usual options were a subset of what the DBIC code had ended up with and I was able to merge them .
Unfortunately , having this available made me far more conscious of the other faffing I had to do when adding debug logging - notably , changing :
return ( $ foo , $ bar , $ baz ) ;
to
my @ret = ( $ foo , $ baz , $ baz ) ; return @ret ;
all the time started to be excessively annoying .
And so was born Data : : Dumper : : Concise :: Sugar which provides two functions , Dwarn and DwarnS , that warn +
Dumper 's their arguments and then return them - the former operating in list context and the latter in scalar .
That allows you to write :
return Dwarn ( $ foo , $ baz , $ baz ) ; return DwarnS $x ;
and get suitable results .
We even added a shorter alias for it , Devel : : Dwarn to save typing when adding it to test code .
When using it in the middle of method chains , I found myself writing :
$ obj -> foo -> bar ->$ {\sub { DwarnS $ _ [ 0 ] }} -> baz
which while working is n't brilliantly legible or particularly easy to type - so we made Devel : : Dwarn import Data :: Dumper :: Concise :: Sugar into itself as well as providing the exports , which means you can now write :
$ obj -> foo -> bar ->
Devel : : Dwarn :: Dwarn -> baz
which is rather clearer , on the whole .
This post documents the features as of version 1.200 - if you get a subsequent release do check the Changes file since we 're planning on adding a few more convenience features over time once we 've played with them thoroughly in our own code .

Finding your new favorite music is about to get easier than ever on Pandora .
The data - loving streaming service has long ranked as one of the best platforms on the web when it comes to recommending great new tunes to listeners , but it ’s now providing even more unique listening opportunities .
Now listeners have a choice of something Pandora calls Modes , but which are essentially specialized algorithms to recommend new music based on user - designated parameters .
There are six new modes that users can pick between :
Crowd Faves gives preference to songs that have the most thumbs up by other listeners on a given station .
Deep Cuts offers less - listened - to songs by an artist or in a set genre .
Discovery provides more artists that do n’t usually appear on that station .
Newly Released picks the latest songs for a given station .
Artist
Only will stick to a single artist ’s catalog .
Finally , there ’s My Station , which is the company ’s original algorithm .
The new modes feature is already available to both paid and free users of the streaming service and should do well to provide even more Pandora listeners with exactly what they want to hear with as little moment - to - moment input as possible .
We ’re big fans of the new feature and wish that companies like Spotify , which offers listeners its custom Discover Weekly and Release Radar playlists weekly , would follow suit .
After all , being able to pick a favorite genre and tell the streaming service that you just want to hear new songs , or less popular songs , or whatever fringe jams you might not usually hear on a Pandora station , is a pretty cool feature .
One thing is for sure , even before the change , Pandora offered listeners one of the most advanced music discovery algorithms on the web , having pioneered the technology for over a decade .
For its part , the company says that the new experience is designed to get users excited about picking their own music on a more granular level , which is something that Pandora has not necessarily been known for throughout its history .
In the on - demand music streaming era , many people think of Pandora as a product akin to internet radio .
Now , the company is clearly looking to change that .

Sabbar Kashur wanted to be a person , a person like everybody else .
But as luck would have it , he was born Palestinian .
It happens .
His chances of being accepted as a human being in Israel are nil .
Married and a father of two , he wanted to work in Jerusalem , his city , and maybe also have an affair or a quickie on the side .
That happens too .
He knew that he had no chance with the Jews , so he adopted another name for himself , Dudu .
He did n't have curly hair , but he went by Dudu just the same .
That 's how everyone knew him .
That 's how you know a few other Arabs too : the car - wash guy you call Rafi , the stairwell cleaner who goes by Yossi , the supermarket deliveryman you know as Moshe .
What 's wrong ?
Is it only fearsome Shin Bet interrogators like " Capt. George " and " Abu Faraj " who are allowed to adopt names from other peoples ?
Are only Israelis who emigrate allowed to invent new identities ?
Only the Yossi from Hadera who became Joe in Miami , the Avraham from Bat Yam who became Abe in Los Angeles ?
Open gallery view Palestinian Sabbar Kashur , who was convicted of raping a woman after impersonating a Jew Credit : Emil Salman
No longer a youth , Sabbar / Dudu worked as a deliveryman for a lawyer 's office , rode his scooter around Jerusalem and delivered documents , affidavits and sworn testimonies , swearing to everyone that he was Dudu .
Two years ago he met a woman by chance .
Nice to meet you , my name is Dudu .
He claims that she came on to him , but let 's leave the details aside .
Soon enough they went where they went and what happened happened , all by consent of the parties concerned .
One fine day , a month and a half after an afternoon quickie , he was summoned to the police on suspicion of rape .
His temporary lover discovered that her Dudu was n't a Dudu after all , that the Jew is ( gasp ! ) an Arab , and so she filed a complaint against the impostor .
Her body was violated by an Arab .
From then on Kashur was placed under house arrest for two years , an electronic cuff on his ankle .
This week his sentence was pronounced : 18 months in jail .
Judge Zvi Segal waxed dramatic to the point of absurdity : " It is incumbent on the court to protect the public interest from sophisticated , smooth , sweet - talking offenders who can mislead naive victims into paying an unbearable price : the sanctity of their bodies and souls . "
Sophisticated offenders ?
It is doubtful that Dudu even knew he was one .
Sweet talk ?
He says that even his wife calls him Dudu .
The court relied , as usual , on precedents : the man who posed as a senior Housing Ministry official and promised his lover an apartment and an increased National Insurance pension , and the man who posed as a wealthy neurosurgeon who promised free medical care and other perks .
Dudu had nothing to offer but his good name , Dudu , and still his fate was sealed , just like those who promise apartments and perks .
Not only fraud , but rape , almost like the convicted serial rapist Benny Sela .
Supreme Court Justice Elyakim Rubinstein had , after all , defined the test of conviction for rape on " false pretenses " : " if in the view of an ordinary person this woman would have agreed to have sexual relations with a man who did not have the identity he invented . "
In tune with the public , Kashur 's judges assumed , rightly , that the woman would not have gotten into bed with Dudu were it not for the identity he invented .
She also might not have gotten into bed with him if he had told her in vain that he was available , that he was younger than he really is or even that he is madly in love with her .
But people are not prosecuted for that , certainly not on rape charges .
Now the respected judges have to be asked :
If the man was really Dudu posing as Sabbar , a Jew pretending to be an Arab so he could sleep with an Arab woman , would he then be convicted of rape ?
And do the eminent judges understand the social and racist meaning of their florid verdict ?
Do n't they realize that their verdict has the uncomfortable smell of racial purity , of " do n't touch our daughters " ?
That it expresses the yearning of the extensive segments of society that would like to ban sexual relations between Arabs and Jews ?
It was no coincidence that this verdict attracted the attention of foreign correspondents in Israel , temporary visitors who see every blemish .
Yes , in German or Afrikaans this disgraceful verdict would have sounded much worse .
PHILADELPHIA – The Jobs with Justice chapter here has been busy during the past year .
It actively supported the security guards at the prestigious Philadelphia Museum of Art in their protracted struggle to win union recognition , a fight the guards won this past spring .
It mobilized support for the Employee Free Choice Act , organized for the big jobs rally called by the AFL - CIO in March and supported the nurses and technical staff during their four - week strike at Temple University Hospital .
So it was appropriate for JwJ to want to celebrate after a tough year .
On May 26 a standing - room - only crowd of over 200 people packed the Ethical Society on Rittenhouse Square for JwJ ’s annual Solidarity Reception .
The list of honorees was headed by Wendell Young III , president emeritus of 20,000 - member United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776 and a legend in the city ’s labor movement .
In introducing Young , UFCW staffer John Meyerson emphasized that , while Young ’s numerous achievements include holding leadership positions in the labor movement , participation at national Democratic Party conventions , service on panels sponsored by the International Labor Organization and teaching college courses , Young has also been a consistent voice for world peace , going all the way back to the Vietnam War .
The spirited gathering also heard lively remarks from the other honorees .
Gary Kapanowski , former longtime president of AFSCME Local 1723 ; Kati Sipp , executive vice president of SEIU Healthcare PA ; and the Rev. Jesse Brown , community activist and a founder of Casino - Free Philadelphia .
The event also honored four organizations whose struggles had inspired labor and community support during the past year .
The Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals ( PASNAP ) succeeded in turning back an intense anti-union campaign by the Temple University Hospital Administration during their strike this past April .
Transport Workers Union Local 234 did the same in their week - long strike against the Southeastern PA Transportation Authority ( SEPTA ) last fall .
The Philadelphia Federation of Teachers ( PFT ) managed to win a surprisingly good contract without a strike after months of negotiations as school districts across the nation wrestle with budget cuts .
Patricia Eakin , PASNAP president , and Jerry Jordan , PFT president , attended to receive the awards on behalf of their members .
And one of the biggest stories in the labor movement here was the Philadelphia Museum of Art security guards .
They have been without a union since being privatized by the city in 1993 , but this spring , after a two - year campaign with the active support of Jobs with Justice and the Student Labor Action Project , the 140 members of the Philadelphia Security Officers Union , won a National Labor Relations Board election and got their union .
Their effort showed the complex forces confronting workers in today ’s environment .
They work for Allied Barton Security , a firm which employs some 15,000 guards in the city and contracts with the museum for its services .

The nextmight not be a solely single - player experience .
A new job posting on Linked In suggests that the series is taking a turn toward multiplayer .
Maybe " suggests " is too weak a verb - the BioWare Montreal opening ( picture below ) is for a " Multiplayer Programmer ( Mass Effect Franchise ) . "
Not much room for interpretation , there .
The ideal candidate will have to come up with " solutions to deal with network latency , de-synchronization of data between networked machines / players , packet compression , cheating , and interrupted connections . "
They 'll also have to " work with databases that allow for chat rooms , client / server games , player matching , player stats , etc .
" One other tidbit , from the position summary : " [ Multiplayer Programmers ] work with both the front and back ends to take existing single player user experiences and make them multiplayer safe . "
I guess you could argue that means co-op .
However , in a way all online play is just a translation of the single - player experience ; both have the same basic mechanics , after all .
Back in February , EA chief operating officer John Schappert said something " far - reaching " would be coming for .
Maybe this is what they meant ?
If you are a professed Atheist , I ask you the question :
Do you believe in aliens ?
Could not God be an alien ?
Yes ,
He most certainly is an alien .
The dictionary defines the word “ alien ” as : “ coming from or existing outside the earth or its atmosphere . ”
God is not of this world .
The Bible teaches that God created the universe , which means that His presence transcends this universe .
It is contradictory for any Atheist to profess a belief in the existence of alien life ( or at least the possibility thereof ) ; while simultaneously denying the existence of God .
If you believe that aliens may exist , then you certainly must concede that one of those aliens may be God .
Some people believe that the Pyramids of Egypt were built by aliens ; but the Bible teaches that slave Israelites built the treasure cities of Pithom and Raamses for Pharaoh ( Exodus 1:11 ) .
Evidence shows that it was mankind , and not aliens , that built the Pyramids of Egypt .
Perhaps you do not believe in alien life at all ; but that would be speculation at best , because neither you nor anyone else can make such a claim with any confidence .
How do you know that there is no alien life ?
So whether an Atheist believes in alien life or not is irrelevant to the fact that no one can say with any certainty that God does not exist .
This logical reasoning proves that there is no such thing as a TRUE Atheist , only those who choose to reside in their ignorance of something they do not know for certain .
Any honest person must admit that there could be a God .
The fact that Atheists refuse to even consider the possibility that God exists is self - incriminating evidence against them , because they are willingly ignorant of the possibility that alien life may exist in the universe or beyond .
Clearly , Atheists are biased against the Truth of God ’s Word , without any logical reason or justification for their prejudice .
Logic dictates that alien life certainly may exist , and that means God. You Need HIS Righteousness !
Government officials cleared the speech by Britain 's top counter - terrorism officer that warned that budget cuts could imperil national security .
The revelation raises questions about a senior government minister 's angry and direct attack on John Yates , Scotland Yard 's counter - terrorism chief .
On Thursday Yates told a private gathering of police chiefs " eyewatering " cuts of £ 150 m to the budget to fight terrorism would endanger the public , triggering a political row after his claim was leaked .
That led Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude to slap down Yates , saying that public servants had to be " damn sure " they had cut out waste , warning they should avoid " shroud waving " and claims of dire consequences that would " alarm the public " .
Former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson backed the top officer 's assessment .
Yates was speaking at a private session of top officers and police authorities at the Association of Chief Police Officers ' conference .
Home Office officials saw Yates 's speech before it was delivered , and raised no objections .
The procedure was standard because a top Whitehall counter - terrorism official was also due to address the private session , but had to cancel .
More details emerged of Yates 's speech .
Sources told the Guardian that Yates had said the cuts would mean the public and government would have to " accept a higher level of risk " of a terrorist attack .
Yates also said the threat of an al - Qaida inspired attack remained severe , with extremists having plotted to attack a prominent individual within the last two months , in a change of terrorist tactics .
Yates told the meeting his warning was " not shroud waving " but that he , regional counter terrorism squads plus the police authorities who fund them have to face the full reality of what the cuts could mean .
Delegates heard that officers seconded to counter terrorism face being sent back to their home forces , who would have to deal with the extra costs of their return .
Later , at an open session at the Acpo conference Yates , despite several opportunities , did not repeat his private warning about the potentially dangerous effect of the cuts .
But in a BBC interview Maude attacked the officer 's remarks .
It was a rare assault by a minister on a serving senior police officer .
Maude said : " The obligation that rests on all of us is to make damn sure that we take the cost out to the maximum extent possible out of our internal processes , [ and ] not alarm the public with that kind of talk . "
" I 'd like to avoid public servants doing this kind of shroud waving in public .
There is a special responsibility on all public servants to be really careful what we say and what we do .
" It 's going to be pretty important for people who are managing big public services like police forces to focus on cutting out unnecessary costs , driving down costs , being as efficient as they possibly can before they even begin to contemplate talking about alarming the public in this kind of way . "
Johnson said the government 's failure to ring fence budgets for policing and counter terrorism would " seriously affect " the fight to thwart al - Qaida attacks on Britain .
Scotland Yard 's counter - terrorism unit has already suffered a £ 5 m cut this year with another an estimated £ 87 m to come in the next four years , with regional counter - terrorism squads facing a £ 62 m cut in the next four years .
The total counter - terrorism budget is £ 600 m and some in the police believe it is too well resourced given the cuts facing the service overall .
Yates is no stranger to the anger of politicians .
He was criticised by Labour when he led the cash - for - peerages investigation .
At an open session Yates made his case as to why counter - terrorism was a special case when questioned by a senior colleague .
Yates said that while areas such as fighting serious and organised crime were about reducing harm , he said " counter - terrorism is about zero tolerance , " a reference to the fact that police feel the public and government demand a " 100 % success rate " in stopping attempts by terrorists to cause mass murder on British soil .
This Wednesday sees the fifth anniversary of the 7 July terrorist attacks on London in 2005 , which killed 52 people and injured 750 .
Scotland Yard declined to comment .
The Home Office said : " National security is the first duty of government .
" Future police grants will not be set until later this year after the Spending Review . "

This spectacular image of sunset on the Indian Ocean was taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
The image presents an edge - on , or limb view , of the Earth ’s atmosphere as seen from orbit .
The Earth ’s curvature is visible along the horizon line , or limb , that extends across the image from center left to lower right .
Above the darkened surface of the Earth , a brilliant sequence of colors roughly denotes several layers of the atmosphere .
Deep oranges and yellows appear in the troposphere , which extends from the Earth ’s surface to 6 – 20 km high .
This layer contains over 80 percent of the mass of the atmosphere and almost all of the water vapor , clouds , and precipitation .
Several dark cloud layers are visible within this layer .
Variations in the colors are due mainly to varying concentrations of either clouds or aerosols ( airborne particles or droplets ) .
The pink to white region above the clouds appears to be the lower stratosphere ; this atmospheric layer generally has few or no clouds , and it extends up to approximately 50 kilometers above the Earth ’s surface .
Above the stratosphere , blue layers likely mark the transition between the middle and upper atmosphere as it gradually fades into the blackness of outer space .
The ISS was located over the southern Indian Ocean when this picture was taken , with the astronaut looking towards the west .
Astronauts aboard the ISS see 16 sunrises and sunsets per day due to their high orbital velocity ( greater than 28,000 km per hour ) .
The multiple chances for photography are fortunate because at that speed , each sunrise or sunset only lasts a few seconds !
Astronaut photograph ISS023 - E-57948 was acquired on May 25 , 2010 with a Nikon D3 digital camera , and is provided by the ISS Crew Earth Observations experiment and Image Science & Analysis Laboratory , Johnson Space Center .
The image was taken by the Expedition 23 crew .
The image in this article has been cropped and enhanced to improve contrast .
Lens artifacts have been removed .
The International Space Station Program supports the laboratory as part of the ISS National Lab to help astronauts take pictures of Earth that will be of the greatest value to scientists and the public , and to make those images freely available on the Internet .

It ’s pretty well accepted that one way to gauge something ’s value is to see how it retains said value .
One example would be , say , a BMW vs. a Ford Expedition :
You can get into either one for around $ 35 K , but after a year what will they be worth ?
The same goes for the mobile device market .
I just sold my iPhone 3GS on eBay for $ 300 – in four minutes .
The interesting part is that ’s how much I paid for my iPhone 4 , and this is the third time in a row that I ’ve done the exact same thing .
In other words , since camping for my first iPhone I ’ve either broke even or made money selling my previous one–even though it was a used , previous - year model .
That ’s extraordinary .
So my point is simple : we have another data point in the quality / demand debate between iPhone and Android : their re-sale values .
Let ’s check some rough numbers on a top - google - hit - site that buys used phones : cellforcash.com
Android Phones
i Phones
Granted , this is just one site I picked from the top of Google , but I am willing to bet it ’s representative .
And look at the numbers : the top Android phones that just came out are n’t even worth what last year ’s ( or the previous year ’s ) iPhone .
DROID Incredible : $ 69
EVO 4G : $ 81
The absolute latest models , mind you .
And the iPhone ?
i Phone 3 : $ 114
That ’s not even the 3GS – that ’s two generations back , and still more than the EVO 4G .
Last year ’s model ( the 3GS ) goes for $ 240 – almost 3 x Sprint ’s iPhone killer that came out like 20 minutes ago .
Yeah , pretty compelling … ::
A bug-eyed Chinese crested hairless pooch who was officially crowned the World 's Ugliest Dog has died at age 17 .
The lovable Miss Ellie , whose lopsided tongue always stuck out of the side of her mouth , died on Tuesday in her Tennessee home , the local Mountain Press daily newspaper said .
Rescued by owner Dawn Goehring when she was seven years old , Miss Ellie , who drew smiles with the shock of blonde hair above her eyes , had helped raise more than $ US100,000 for the Humane Society of the Tennessee Valley .
Despite being blind in her final years , she won Animal Planet 's World 's Ugliest Dog award last year .
She was also featured in numerous commercials and television programs .
Miss Ellie had been set to travel to California this month to defend her title .
She was part of a troupe of dogs that Ms Goehring trained and which performed regularly at the Comedy Barn in Pigeon Forge .
Ms Goehring says she is now planning on raising money to open a new animal shelter .
" I am going to make that my driven goal to do in her honour , " she told the Mountain Press .

Q : We had a beloved cat cremated recently .
We now have a bag that is smaller than a sandwich bag containing his ashes , and I had planned to mix them into the soil outside his favorite window – unless it would make the soil harmful to the flowers .
I realize this is an odd request , but I ’d be interested in an opinion .
A : I ’m not aware of anything that would be harmful to plants or soil in the ashes -- especially that small amount and especially if mixed into the soil where it would be diluted .
If anything , it should add nutrition .
NEWPORT , RI — Audience members at the Newport Rock Festival were " outraged " Monday when rock icon Bob Dylan followed up such classic hits as " Like A Rolling Stone " and " Maggie 's Farm " with an electronica set composed of atonal drones , hyperactive drumbeats , and the repeated mechanized lyric " Dance to the club life ! "
" We came here to see the authentic Dylan , the one with the Stratocaster guitar and signature wild blues - rock band behind him , " audience member Robert Hochschild said .
" Then he walks out with these puffy headphones , some turntables , and a laptop ?
The guy 's a Judas . "
When asked later about his musical transformation by reporters , Dylan said he had nothing to say about the beats he programs , he just programs them .

No matter how hard Sharron Angle tries , she can't shake the fact of her radical associations and ideas away so easily .
In her own words :
" If this Congress keeps going the way it is , people are going to start looking for second amendment remedies ... "
Which she then follows up with this :
" The first thing we need to do is take Harry Reid out . "
In the span of about a minute or so , Angle advocates for armed insurrection , ' taking out ' a duly elected Senator of the United States , and curing Congress ' problems with a ' Second Amendment solution ' .
Would this be before or after she repeals Social Security , ends unemployment insurance , outlaws alcohol and terminates Medicare ?
I suppose she would say it 's just one of those oaths she keeps , right ?
Because she 's not an Oath Keeper , but a ' keeper of oaths ' .
So that 's how they do that .
Also , let 's not forget about her long association with the Independent Right Party , a group so far fringe most of us have n't peeked far enough under the covers to look at them , but we probably should , since they seem to have written some of the current right - wing dialogue :
Hansen 's brother , the late Daniel Hansen , founded the Independent American Party in 1967 " after realizing that the Republican Party was growing too corrupt and socialistic , " according to the party website .
The party lost its ballot position in the late 1970s and did n't get back on until a push by Hansen in 1992 .
That year , Angle signed the petition to get the Independent American Party back on the ballot , according to multiple party members and news reports .
That was a heady time for the reborn party .
A 1992 Los Angeles Times article ( via Nexis ) describes Hansen at a political rally wearing a Stetson hat and bearing a sign that read , " If Guns Are Outlawed , How Can We Shoot the Liberals ? "
His rhetoric would not be out of place at a 2010 tea party .
" Do n't give up your guns , folks , " he told a crowd .
" That 's all we 've got to protect us against the advance of socialism .
America is in a survival phase . " ( via TalkingPointsMemo )
I do n't think even Frank Luntz can fix this one .

Hunting a high - quality meal
Common dolphins prefer to eat high - energy fish , say scientists .
Researchers studying dolphins in the Atlantic Ocean have found that , contrary to expectation , dolphins are not opportunistic feeders that take whatever prey is available .
Instead , they carefully select which fish to consume , preferring to eat energy - rich lantern fish while ignoring other lower quality fish species .
Cold - blooded ocean predators such as sharks make no such distinction .
Details of the discovery are published in the Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology .
Distinct palate
Marine mammals have evolved a diverse range of feeding strategies .
Some orcas ( killer whales ) specialise in eating seals rich in fatty blubber , while the more sedentary dugong is herbivorous , surviving on a low - energy diet of seagrass .
But many smaller whale and seal or sea-lion species are often described as being opportunistic feeders , taking whatever food is available .
However , few have actually been studied in enough detail to know if they select which prey to eat .
So Dr Jerome Spitz and colleagues at the University of Rochelle in France studied the diet of short - beaked common dolphins ( Delphinus delphis ) , the most abundant species of dolphin living in the warm off - shore waters of the Atlantic .
They compared the range of fish species found in the stomachs of dolphins accidentally caught in tuna drift nets off the Bay of Biscay , with the abundance of fish species in the sea , measured by trawling surveys .
The scientists found that the dolphins have a distinct palate .
Instead of eating more of the most common species , which would be expected if dolphins feed opportunistically , the dolphins carefully selected which fish to consume .
For example , the dolphins regularly ignored fish that contained less than 5 kJ per gram of energy .
These included the most abundant fish , a alepocephalid scientifcally named Xenodermichtys copei , which has 2.2 kJ per gram of energy , and fish such as the Bean 's sawtooth eel ( Serrivomer beanii ) which contains 2.1 kJ per gram , and the Boa dragonfish ( Stomias boa ferox ) which has 2.8 kJ per gram .

The dolphins mostly ate two species of less common lantern fish , the Kroyer 's lanternfish ( Notoscopelus kroeyeri ) which contained 7.9 kJ per gram and the Glacier lanternfish ( Benthosema glaciale ) which has 5.9 kJ per gram .
Other research backs this finding , suggesting that striped dolphins ( Stena coeruleoalba ) also appear to prey on high quality Kroyer 's lanternfish more often than other species .
Cold - blooded menu
Dolphins probably need to feed on high - energy fish to fuel their own energetic lifestyle , as warm - blooded social animals that range widely and can swim at high speeds .
Other large cold - blooded ocean predators , such as blue sharks ( Prionace glauca ) or swordfish ( Xiphias gladius ) rarely appear to take high - quality fish , preferring to dine on larger , leaner prey .

When it comes to bulls meeting an untimely and torturous end in the arena , Ricky Gervais is sickened .
The comedian has teamed up with the World Society for the Protection of Animals ( WSPA ) to call for an end to the cruel practice of bullfighting , and urge tourists to stop supporting such brutality on their travels .
“ Sometimes the worst kind of cruelty is done in the name of entertainment .
It sickens me to know that people still pay money to see an animal tortured to death .
Cultural heritage is no excuse for inflicting such pain on a frightened and confused animal , ” Gervais says in a new PSA for the org .
“ My first love was nature and wildlife , and , in particular , animals , ” he added in an interview .
“ I think animals are all unconditionally perfect , and beautiful .
Animals really matter to me , and WSPA is trying to stop needless acts of animal cruelty all over the world .
One of their campaigns is against bullfighting .
It sickens me to know that in this day and age , people are still paying money to see an animal suffering in such a horrific way . ”
The new campaign by WSPA comes as the Catalonian Government in Spain is preparing to make a historic vote on a proposal to ban bullfighting .

Republicans are entitled to their own opinions , but they 're not entitled to their own separate reality .
When Republican Sen. Jon Kyl said on Fox News that tax cuts had no impact on the deficit , that was bad enough .
But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell grabs the wacko baton and sprints ahead when he tells TPMDC's Brian Beutler that " there 's no evidence whatsoever that the Bush tax cuts actually diminished revenue .
They increased revenue because of the vibrancy of these tax cuts in the economy . "
Sen .
McConnell might not believe the evidence provided by the Congressional Budget Office , the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget , the Joint Tax Committee , or the Brookings Institution , all of which concludes that the Bush tax cuts added to the deficit .
But surely he should believe President George W. Bush 's own Ph.D- wielding economists .
Many of them have gone on the record to say that while they supported the tax cuts , they did n't for one second believe they raised government revenue .
1) The Council of Economic Advisers ' Report to the President , 2003 : " Although the economy grows in response to tax reductions ( because of higher consumption in the short run and improved incentives in the long run ) , it is unlikely to grow so much that lost tax revenue is completely recovered by the higher level of economic activity . "

The UN secretary general called today for a multinational investigation of Israel 's raid on the Gaza - bound aid flotilla that left nine dead but the proposal was swiftly rejected by the Israelis .
Ban Ki-moon proposed that the inquiry be headed by the former New Zealand prime minister Geoffrey Palmer and include representatives from Turkey – under whose flag many of the ships in the aid convoy sailed – Israel and the US , an official from Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu 's office said .
But Michael Oren , Israel 's ambassador to Washington , told Fox News : " We are rejecting an international commission .
We are discussing with the Obama administration a way in which our inquiry will take place . "
Netanyahu discussed the proposal for a multinational panel with Ban in a telephone call yesterday but told cabinet ministers from his rightwing Likud party today that Israel was exploring other options , political sources said .
Ban 's proposal came after Israel risked a fresh wave of international condemnation yesterday by detaining a boat carrying humanitarian aid attempting to break the blockade of Gaza and forcibly diverting it to the port of Ashdod .
Israel has said that most of those aboard the MV Rachel Corrie will be deported today .
Israeli leaders have spoken publicly about setting up an internal inquiry with foreign observers into the interception of the Turkish - flagged Mavi Marmara last week .
A statement on the UN's website said Ban held telephone discussions with the prime ministers of Turkey and Israel on " options for moving forward with the investigation called for by the United Nations security council " .
Last week , the council called for a " prompt , impartial , credible and transparent investigation " .
Five days after the botched assault on a six - boat flotilla ended with Israeli troops shooting dead eight Turkish activists and one US citizen , naval commandos boarded the MV Rachel Corrie in international waters about 20 miles from the coast of Gaza .
Yesterday 's operation was mounted despite growing calls for Israel to ease significantly its siege of Gaza .
The US , Israel 's staunchest ally , pointedly repeated that the blockade was " unsustainable and must be changed " – a call Netanyahu again rejected .
Israel said it had met no resistance in stopping the 1,200 - tonne Rachel Corrie .
However , Greta Berlin of the Free Gaza Movement , an organisation behind the flotilla , said passengers and crew had four times refused to accede to Israeli demands to voluntarily divert to Ashdod , resulting in the raid .
" There 's no way that 20 people are going to resist a fully armed force , " she said .
" The fact that Israel boarded a civilian boat in international waters is a violent act . "
She expected that the 11 passengers – including the Nobel peace laureate Máiread Corrigan – and nine crew would be treated " with kid gloves .
The world is watching " .
There had been no contact with the boat since early yesterday , she added .
Tomorrow , Britain will say £ 19 m in aid will be given to refugees in Gaza .
The money , to be spent on healthcare , education and other services , will be announced by the international development secretary , Andrew Mitchell .
It will go to the UN Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , on which about 70 % of Gazans rely to meet their basic needs .
The support comes amid heightened international concern about Israel 's blockade .
The latest detention of a ship bound for Gaza came as the last of the Turkish citizens wounded in last week 's assault on the Mavi Marmara was repatriated .
It coincided with a warning from the UN 's commissioner for human rights , Navi Pillay , that Israel 's embargo was illegal .
" International humanitarian law prohibits starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and it is also prohibited to impose collective punishment on civilians , " Pillay said .
According to Israeli military accounts , commandos boarded the Rachel Corrie – named after an activist crushed to death by an Israeli bulldozer in Gaza in 2003 – from naval vessels alongside rather than winching troops from helicopters as happened in Monday 's operation .
The boat , carrying medical supplies and construction materials , was towed into Ashdod .
Israel said it would unload the aid and transfer it to Gaza .
The passengers – from Ireland and Malaysia – would be immediately deported , Ygal Palmor , spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry , said .
Israel has spent the past five days struggling to contain a diplomatic crisis .
Relations with its regional ally Turkey have sunk to an unprecedented low .
Autopsy reports on the dead activists yesterday revealed that five had gunshot wounds to the head .
The US joined the growing international chorus for the siege to be eased .
Yesterday the Free Gaza Movement said it was planning another flotilla .
" We will continue until we break the siege of Gaza , " Berlin said .

The adult brain , long considered to be fixed in its wiring , is in fact remarkably dynamic .
Neuroscientists once thought that the brain 's wiring was fixed early in life , during a critical period beyond which changes were impossible .
Recent discoveries have challenged that view , and now , research by scientists at Rockefeller University suggests that circuits in the adult brain are continually modified by experience .
The researchers , led by Charles D. Gilbert , Arthur and Janet Ross Professor and head of the Laboratory of Neurobiology , observed how neurons responsible for receiving input from a mouse 's whiskers shift their relationships with one another after single whiskers are removed .
The experiments explain how the circuitry of a region of the mouse brain called the somatosensory cortex , which processes input from the various systems in the body that respond to the sense of touch , can change .
The findings will be published next week in the online , open access journal PLoS Biology .
The Gilbert lab has been studying changing neuronal connections for several years .
Their approach , in which the scientists use a viral labeling system to attach fluorescent proteins to individual neurons and then image individual synapses in an intact , living brain with a high - resolution two - photon microscope , has provided several important clues to understanding the dynamics of the brain 's wiring .
Students in the Gilbert lab , Dan Stettler and Homare ( Matias ) Yamahachi , in collaboration with Winfried Denk at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg , previously followed the same neurons week after week in the primary visual cortex of adult monkeys .
They found that the circuits of the visual cortex are highly dynamic , turning over synapses at a rate of seven percent per week .
These changes occurred without any learning regimen or physical manipulations to the neurons .
Last year , Yamahachi , together with Sally Marik and Justin McManus , showed that when sensory experience is altered , even more dramatic changes in cortical circuits occur , with very rapid alterations in circuitry involving an exuberant growth of new connections paralleled by a pruning of old connections .
These studies and others by the Gilbert lab have begun to show that there are underlying dynamics in the sensory cortex and it's not a fixed system , as has long been believed .
In the new study , Marik and other members of the Gilbert lab looked at excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the mouse cortex during periods of sensory deprivation to determine how experience shapes different components of cortical circuitry .
For this study they used the whisker - barrel system in adult mice .
The barrel cortex , part of the somatosensory cortex , receives sensory input from the animal 's whiskers .
Scientists have shown that after a row of whiskers is removed , barrels shift their representation to adjacent intact whiskers .
Marik , together with Yamahachi and McManus , found that after a whisker was plucked excitatory connections projecting into the deprived barrels underwent exuberant and rapid axonal sprouting .
This axonal restructuring occurred rapidly -- within minutes or hours after whiskers were plucked -- and continued over the course of several weeks .
At the same time that excitatory connections were invading the deprived columns , there was a reciprocal outgrowth of the axons of inhibitory neurons from the deprived to the non-deprived barrels .
This suggests that the process of reshaping cortical circuits maintains the balance between excitation and inhibition that exists in the normal cortex .
" Previously we showed changes only in excitatory connections , " Gilbert says .
" We 've now demonstrated a parallel involvement of inhibitory connections , and we think that inhibition may play a role equal in importance to excitation in inducing changes in cortical functional maps . "
The new study also showed that changes in the inhibitory circuits preceded those seen in the excitatory connections , suggesting that the inhibitory changes may mediate the excitatory ones .
This process , Gilbert says , mimics what happens in the brain during early postnatal development .
" It 's surprising that the primary visual or somatosensory cortices are involved in plasticity and capable of establishing new memories , which previously had been considered to be a specialized function of higher brain centers , " Gilbert says .
" We are just beginning to tease apart the mechanisms of adult cortical plasticity .
We hope to determine whether the circuit changes associated with recovery of function following lesions to the central and peripheral nervous systems also occur under normal conditions of perceptual learning . "

Mellom 35.000 og 40.000 mennesker samlet seg tirsdag til protest mot den danske regjeringens plan for kutt i offentlige utgifter .
Demonstrantene retter misnøyen spesielt mot den planlagte halveringen av perioden danske arbeidsledige kan heve dagpenger , fra fire til to år .
" Stopp tyven ! " og " Rødt kort til pakken ! " var teksten på to av parolene for dagen .
Lederne for de danske sosialdemokratene og Socialistisk Folkeparti , Helle Thorning - Schmidt og Villy Søvndal , deltok også på protestmøtet , men tvilte på om regjeringen vil lytte til protestene .
– De har ikke for vane å lytte til hva folk sier , sier Søvndal .
– Men jeg tror derimot at det får politisk betydning framover .

Google has won a “ motion for summary judgment ” in its bitterly fought lawsuit with Viacom over YouTube .
This ruling effectively ends the case .
Google has won , at least in this court .
Viacom vows to appeal .
Viacom had sued YouTube / Google for copyright infringement surrounding the posting of scores of clips of Viacom - owned programming ( e.g. , Jon Stewart ) on YouTube .
Viacom had sought damages for infringement that might have run more than a billion dollars .
This is a major victory for Google , which can still be appealed by Viacom .
Reportedly Viacom will appeal ; however it ’s unlikely the company will succeed .
Here ’s Viacom ’s statement about today ’s ruling :
We believe that this ruling by the lower court is fundamentally flawed and contrary to the language of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , the intent of Congress , and the views of the Supreme Court as expressed in its most recent decisions .
We intend to seek to have these issues before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as soon as possible .
After years of delay , this decision gives us the opportunity to have the Appellate Court address these critical issues on an accelerated basis .
We look forward to the next stage of the process .
The granting of the motion means that even if all the facts were as Viacom has alleged in its complaint and as presented to the court that it would still not be entitled to a finding of liability and damages against Google .
Here ’s how Google described the ruling :
Today , the court granted our motion for summary judgment in Viacom ’s lawsuit with YouTube .
This means that the court has decided that YouTube is protected by the safe harbor of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) against claims of copyright infringement .
The decision follows established judicial consensus that online services like YouTube are protected when they work cooperatively with copyright holders to help them manage their rights online .
Google characterized it as not just victory for Mountain View but “ also for the billions of people around the world who use the web to communicate and share experiences with each other . ”
Google defended the case and moved for summary judgment under the “ safe harbor ” provision Digital Millennium Copyright Act , 17 U.S.C. § 512 ( c ) , which protects service providers ( e.g. , webhosts / ISPs ) against liability for copyright infringement if certain conditions are met .
Read the court ’s full 30 - page opinion ( . pdf ) — if you dare .
Postscript : Gary Price alerted us to a long statement / editorial about the ruling penned by Viacom chief counsel Michael Fricklas :
We are disappointed with the judge ’s ruling , but confident we will win on appeal . . .
This case has always been about whether intentional theft of copyrighted works is permitted under existing law and we always knew that the critical underlying issue would need to be addressed by courts at the appellate levels .
Today ’s decision accelerates our opportunity to do so .
If Viacom is trying to make law that bolsters copyright perhaps this loss is an ironic opportunity to do so .
Another loss at the appellate level could result in a trip to the US Supreme Court , which can refuse to take cases .
The big irony of the case is that Viacom was arguably not damaged by its shows ’ unauthorized exposures on YouTube but benefited from them .
There ’s also evidence that Viacom executives knew what was going on and were pleased about it .
Still the copyright owner should be allowed to control the distribution of his / her / its content .
Striking the right balance between copyright control and “ fair use ” in the digital age is a tricky one that the law has arguably not yet been able to strike .

Copyright : HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN : Copyright : Mike Sillett Contents : 1 . Intro
2. Tools
3. Materials
4. Kitchen Equipment
5. Procedure 1 . Intro Staghorn Sumac grows almost everywhere .
It is one of my top ten edible wild food items that I forage for each year .
I love foraging for wild edibles and especially love the fact that these pods of sumac are not only delicious but free .
Disclaimer : Like any food products , either commercially grown or gathered from the wild , one should ascertain whether they are allergic to that particular food product .
Some individuals can not tolerate regular milk , shellfish , etc .
Some have terrible reactions to peanuts or peanut based products , and these are commercial foods my goodness .
Sumac is not a commercially grown food product so trying this for the first time may or may not present a digestive or allergy problem .
Try a small amount first and wait a day or two .
Then a larger amount next time .
Having said that , I drink this all summer long .
Huge glasses regularly .
It 's not exactly like lemonaide but it is mighty close .
My systems love it , my digestive system and my financial system that is .
If I bought the amount of lemons it would take to make an equivalent amount of sumac ' Pink Lemonaide ' there would be plenty of dollars spent .
This is FREE !
I love FREE stuff !
This method is reasonably easy if the equipment is on hand .
The Sumac is free for the taking .
2 . Tools Pruning shears
Gloves ( optional )
Gathering the pods can make your hands all sticky from the juice that will be expended in handling the softer berries .
The gloves will help .
3 . Materials Sumac pods - about 20 nicer sized ones
Here are a few of the 20 pods I used to make almost a gallon of concentrated juice .
3 . Kitchen Equipment Blender ,
Strainer ,
Muslin Bag ( a white sheet made into a bag or a pillowcase will do ) 4 . Procedure Gather the Sumac pods in late summer , early fall .
If there is not a lot of rain in the fall you can even gather them all through the winter .
The important thing is to gather the Sumac pods from trees in areas not near heavily traveled roads or highways .
You want to get clean pods from trees in some of the more out - of - the - way areas .
You will NOT be washing these so it 's essential to start with clean pods .
The muslin bag straining at the end of it all will remove any dirt , grit , seed , stem and / or vermin residue .
Here 's a close - up of what the berries look like after separated from the bracts .
These are the ones you will be using for making the juice .
Berries separated from the bracts .
You can see the bracts on the left .
Put the berries in the blender vessel so that they are reasonably compacted and about four inches from the top of the vessel
( the berries will float when water is added .
You will need headroom ) .
Now look at the vessel and pick a spot that is about half way up to the level of the top of the berries - NOT half way to the top of the vessel or you will have used too much water .
If you use this 'gauging ' method you will always make it at the same concentration no matter how high the berry level is in the blender on each occasion .
Add COLD water , not hot .
From the tap is fine .
There 's a lot of vitamin C in Sumac , that 's what makes it acidic and nutritious like lemons , and you 'll lose most of it with hot water .
In addition , hot water will leach out some of the bitterness from the stems and seeds that were mangled / abused by the blender blades .
Filling the blender vessel .
After letting the blender run a bit , couple of minutes maybe , shake it up , change settings , play with the buttons , etc .
After a bit the berries will be good and liquified .
Pour the contents into a fine strainer / colander and let strain into a bowl .
The photo shows two strainers / colanders but that 's not necessary .
The ' finer ' strainer IS necessary .
Let it strain ' on it 's own ' .
Do n't force the mixture through the strainer , you 'll just need to strain again .
Use the fine strainer to separate the bits and pieces from the juice .
You can strain the juice with the strainer a couple of times if you want to but it 's not necessary .
I usually do it twice then rely on the muslin bag for the final filtering .
Now we use the muslin bag ( a clean white pillowcase will work fine , albeit a bit to big in my opinion ) .
You need to wet the muslin bag first and squeeze out all the water .
It filters best when wet .
Pour the juice into a muslin bag or clean piece of sheet , the bottom of which is setting in a bowl .
The juice being strained through a muslin sheet piece .
Juice will have a rich burgundy wine color , sort of like cranberry juice .
Pick up the bag and let drip into bowl .
Do n't force the juice throuh the muslin fabric .
Just pick it up and let it drain into the bowl on it's own .
It filters best when you do n't force things through the fabric that would not go through on it's own .
Here is a final product .
The juice will have a rich burgundy wine color , sort of like cranberry juice .
The consistancy will also be like cranberry juice .
The final juice will be about the color and consistency of cranberry juice , maybe just a bit thicker .
It will be sour , just like lemon juice .
Keep the concentrate in an juice jug in the refrigerator .
It will keep for several weeks .
The way to use this concentrated juice is to cut it at a ratio of 1:1 , that is , when you 're ready to drink some pour half a cup of juice and half a cup of water in a glass , sweeten to taste ( remember it 's like lemonaide so it will take a bit of sweetening ) , stir and add ice .
ENJOY .
I use Splenda .
That way I can drink as much as i want without worrying about the calories .
And I do drink a lot of it .
Do n't expect it to taste just like lemonaide however .
This is Sumac and tastes like Sumac .
Just like oranges do n't taste like tangerines you have to appreciate that Sumac will have it's own unique and distinctive taste .
After a few helpings you will like it 's unique , lemony / tart flavor , it 's refreshing nature , the pleasure of the gathering and especially the fact that it is FREE .
OR you wo n't , not everyone loves the same thing .
Extra Sumac seeds .
About one pound and ready for the freezer .
DON'T WASH Sumac seeds will keep a long time in the freezer .
Do n't was them .
Put in a freezer bag and work the bag while closing to get out all the air you can .
I have used bags that were at least two years in the freezer .
You can even use the unsweetened concentrate to pour over fruit to preserve freshness , just like you would use lemon juice or Fruitfresh , use it for salad dressings , and for making Sumac meringue pie ( substitute Sumac juice for lemon juice ) .
Cumbria police confirmed today that Derrick Bird , who went on the rampage in the UK's worst shooting incident since the Dunblane massacre , had been a licensed gun holder for 20 years .
Twelve people were confirmed dead and three were fighting for their lives after the taxi driver went on the apparently indiscriminate shooting spree across a swath of Cumbrian countryside .
Bird , 52 , shot dead his twin brother and at least one colleague before driving through rural west Cumbria firing seemingly at random at people in towns , villages and on country roads and then killing himself .
More than 100 detectives are beginning to piece together the full sequence of events and trying to establish the gunman 's motive .
Eleven people were injured , three critically , during the three - and - a - half hour shooting spree which paralysed the county as police , hunting him on the ground and by air , ordered a lockdown .
Cumbria police said they might never completely uncover the reason for what they described as the " most exceptional and challenging incident " the small force had ever dealt with .
Last night , they were examining 30 crime scenes .
The alarm was raised in the harbour town of Whitehaven at 10.30 am .
By then , it is believed , Bird 's twin brother , David , and the family solicitor , Kevin Commons , were already dead .
It ended only when the gunman 's body was found in a copse outside the hamlet of Boot at 1.40 pm .
Two guns were recovered by police , a .22 rifle with a telescopic sight and a shotgun .
The deputy chief constable of Cumbria constabulary , Stuart Hyde , confirmed this morning that Bird was licensed to carry weapons .
Speaking in Whitehaven , Hyde said : " He had a shotgun certificate and a firearms licence for weapons , but we do not know at this stage whether the weapons that we recovered are those he was licensed for .
A detailed ballistic examination is being undertaken to confirm this . "
He confirmed that a local solicitor , Kevin Commons , aged 60 , who worked for KJ Common solicitors , was among the 12 victims .
The home secretary , Theresa May , is due to make a statement on the killings in the House of Commons later today .
There were unconfirmed reports that Bird , from Rowrah , near Frizington , who was divorced with two sons and had recently become a grandfather , had argued with colleagues on the taxi rank the previous night .
One friend , Peter Leder , told CNN Bird had said to him : " You wo n't see me again . "
According to one woman in Whitehaven , Bird " shook them [ his colleagues ] by the hands one by one and said there 's going to be a rampage in this town tomorrow and it's going to start with my mother ...
They just laughed and did n't take him seriously " .
Others spoke of a reported family row over the will of Bird 's seriously ill mother , involving Commons .
Commons 's home was last night cordoned off by police , and letters from his law firm were visible on a windowsill of Bird 's home .
It is thought that after killing his brother and Commons , Bird headed to Whitehaven and shot a fellow taxi driver named locally as Darren Rewcastle .
Witnesses said Bird then drove through the town with a gun hanging out of his car window .
Police released a map showing Bird 's progress south to Egremont , Gosforth and Seascale , where the killings continued .
One witness , Barrie Moss , said he was cycling through Egremont when he came face to face with the killer , who had just got out of his car .
Bird , carrying " this absolutely huge sniper rifle " , stared at him before driving away , Moss said .
He then saw that an older woman carrying bags of shopping had been shot .
Moss described how he and another man cradled the woman as she died : " He must have seen her , stopped , got out and shot her point blank in the back of the head .
I do n't think anybody could have done anything . "
Further south , in Seascale , another witness , John Reeves , said he was loading his car when he heard two gunshots and ran out of his house .
" As I turned the corner there was this poor chap on a bike and he had been shot , he was turned to the wall and this car had sped off .
A few of us tried to help this poor man , but he was gone . "
As the shootings progressed a police lockdown of the area saw shops , offices and even the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant close their doors .
Helicopters and armed officers from other police forces were brought in to help in the hunt .
Cumbria 's deputy chief constable , Stuart Hyde , said police had yet to establish whether it was a premeditated or random attack .
" This has shocked the people of Cumbria and around the country to the core , " he said .
It was a " terrifying and horrific incident " , he said .
" Our thoughts go out to all the family and friends and colleagues of those killed or injured in this tragedy . "
Jamie Reed , the Copeland MP , said : " We will be doing everything we can now as a community , coming together to help the families of the victims , to help everyone that has been affected by this .
That is our priority . "
The Queen said she was " deeply shocked by the appalling news " and expressed sympathy to those affected .
David Cameron pledged to assist communities " shattered " by the killings .
" The government will do everything it possibly can to help the local community and those affected , " he told MPs .
Theresa
May said the events were " very serious and tragic " .
" Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims of these shootings .
" It 's a terrible incident that has taken place in Cumbria today , but I would like to pay tribute to the way in which the police and emergency services have worked very closely together to deal with this incident .
It is the third tragedy to hit west Cumbria in six months , following the devastating floods last year and the deaths of three people , including two schoolchildren , in a coach crash on the A66 last week . "
Many among the injured were taken to West Cumberland hospital in Whitehaven , where a major incident was declared and routine operations cancelled , and to hospitals in Carlisle and Newcastle - upon - Tyne .
Bird 's spree is the biggest mass shooting since Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and an adult at Dunblane primary school in March 1996 , before killing himself .
Call me Mr. Gatto , please .
Twenty - six years ago , having nothing better to do , I tried my hand at schoolteaching .
My license certifies me as an instructor of English language and literature , but that is n’t what I do at all .
What I teach is school , and I win awards doing it .
Teaching means many different things , but six lessons are common to schoolteaching from Harlem to Hollywood .
You pay for these lessons in more ways than you can imagine , so you might as well know what they are :
The first lesson I teach is : " Stay in the class where you belong . "
I do n’t know who decides that my kids belong there but that ’s not my business .
The children are numbered so that if any get away they can be returned to the right class .
Over the years the variety of ways children are numbered has increased dramatically , until it is hard to see the human being under the burden of the numbers each carries .
Numbering children is a big and very profitable business , though what the business is designed to accomplish is elusive .
In any case , again , that ’s not my business .
My job is to make the kids like it  being locked in together , I mean  or at the minimum , endure it .
If things go well , the kids ca n’t imagine themselves anywhere else ; they envy and fear the better classes and have contempt for the dumber classes .
So the class mostly keeps itself in good marching order .
That ’s the real lesson of any rigged competition like school .
You come to know your place .
Nevertheless , in spite of the overall blueprint , I make an effort to urge children to higher levels of test success , promising eventual transfer from the lower - level class as a reward .
I insinuate that the day will come when an employer will hire them on the basis of test scores , even though my own experience is that employers are ( rightly ) indifferent to such things .
I never lie outright , but I ’ve come to see that truth and [ school ] teaching are incompatible .
The lesson of numbered classes is that there is no way out of your class except by magic .
Until that happens you must stay where you are put .

The second lesson I teach kids is to turn on and off like a light switch .
I demand that they become totally involved in my lessons , jumping up and down in their seats with anticipation , competing vigorously with each other for my favor .
But when the bell rings I insist that they drop the work at once and proceed quickly to the next work station .
Nothing important is ever finished in my class , nor in any other class I know of .
The lesson of bells is that no work is worth finishing , so why care too deeply about anything ?
Bells are the secret logic of schooltime ; their argument is inexorable ; bells destroy past and future , converting every interval into a sameness , as an abstract map makes every living mountain and river the same even though they are not .
Bells inoculate each undertaking with indifference .
The third lesson I teach you is to surrender your will to a predestined chain of command .
Rights may be granted or withheld , by authority , without appeal .
As a schoolteacher I intervene in many personal decisions , issuing a Pass for those I deem legitimate , or initiating a disciplinary confrontation for behavior that threatens my control .
My judgments come thick and fast , because individuality is trying constantly to assert itself in my classroom .
Individuality is a curse to all systems of classification , a contradiction of class theory .
Here are some common ways it shows up : children sneak away for a private moment in the toilet on the pretext of moving their bowels ; they trick me out of a private instant in the hallway on the grounds that they need water .
Sometimes free will appears right in front of me in children angry , depressed or exhilarated by things outside my ken .
Rights in such things cannot exist for schoolteachers ; only privileges , which can be withdrawn , exist .
The fourth lesson I teach is that only I determine what curriculum you will study .
( Rather , I enforce decisions transmitted by the people who pay me . )
This power lets me separate good kids from bad kids instantly .
Good kids do the tasks I appoint with a minimum of conflict and a decent show of enthusiasm .
Of the millions of things of value to learn , I decide what few we have time for .
The choices are mine .
Curiosity has no important place in my work , only conformity .
Bad kids fight against this , of course , trying openly or covertly to make decisions for themselves about what they will learn .
How can we allow that and survive as schoolteachers ?
Fortunately there are procedures to break the will of those who resist .
Dumbing Us Down : The H... Gatto , John Taylor Best Price : $ 1.48 Buy New $ 15.59 ( as of 03:50 EST - Details )
This is another way I teach the lesson of dependency .
Good people wait for a teacher to tell them what to do .
This is the most important lesson of all , that we must wait for other people , better trained than ourselves , to make the meanings of our lives .
It is no exaggeration to say that our entire economy depends upon this lesson being learned .
Think of what would fall apart if kids were n’t trained in the dependency lesson :
The social - service businesses could hardly survive , including the fast - growing counseling industry ; commercial entertainment of all sorts , along with television , would wither if people remembered how to make their own fun ; the food services , restaurants and prepared - food warehouses would shrink if people returned to making their own meals rather than depending on strangers to cook for them .
Much of modern law , medicine , and engineering would go too  the clothing business as well  unless a guaranteed supply of helpless people poured out of our schools each year .
We ’ve built a way of life that depends on people doing what they are told because they do n’t know any other way .
For God ’s sake , let ’s not rock that boat !
In lesson five I teach that your self - respect should depend on an observer ’s measure of your worth .
My kids are constantly evaluated and judged .
A monthly report , impressive in its precision , is sent into students ’ homes to spread approval or to mark exactly  down to a single percentage point  how dissatisfied with their children parents should be .
Although some people might be surprised how little time or reflection goes into making up these records , the cumulative weight of the objective - seeming documents establishes a profile of defect which compels a child to arrive at a certain decisions about himself and his future based on the casual judgment of strangers .
Self - evaluation  the staple of every major philosophical system that ever appeared on the planet  is never a factor in these things .
The lesson of report cards , grades , and tests is that children should not trust themselves or their parents , but must rely on the evaluation of certified officials .
People need to be told what they are worth .
In lesson six I teach children that they are being watched .
I keep each student under constant surveillance and so do my colleagues .
There are no private spaces for children ; there is no private time .
Class change lasts 300 seconds to keep promiscuous fraternization at low levels .
Students are encouraged to tattle on each other , even to tattle on their parents .
Of course I encourage parents to file their own child ’s waywardness , too .
I assign " homework " so that this surveillance extends into the household , where students might otherwise use the time to learn something unauthorized , perhaps from a father or mother , or by apprenticing to some wiser person in the neighborhood .

The lesson of constant surveillance is that no one can be trusted , that privacy is not legitimate .
Surveillance is an ancient urgency among certain influential thinkers ; it was a central prescription set down by Calvin in the Institutes , by Plato in the Republic , by Hobbes , by Comte , by Francis Bacon .
All these childless men discovered the same thing : Children must be closely watched if you want to keep a society under central control .
It is the great triumph of schooling that among even the best of my fellow teachers , and among even the best parents , there is only a small number who can imagine a different way to do things .
Yet only a very few lifetimes ago things were different in the United States : originality and variety were common currency ; our freedom from regimentation made us the miracle of the world ; social class boundaries were relatively easy to cross ; our citizenry was marvelously confident , inventive , and able to do many things independently , to think for themselves .
We were something , all by ourselves , as individuals .
It only takes about 50 contact hours to transmit basic literacy and math skills well enough that kids can be self - teachers from then on .
The cry for " basic skills " practice is a smokescreen behind which schools pre-empt the time of children for twelve years and teach them the six lessons I ’ve just taught you .
We ’ve had a society increasingly under central control in the United States since just before the Civil War : the lives we lead , the clothes we wear , the food we eat , and the green highway signs we drive by from coast to coast are the products of this central control .
So , too , I think , are the epidemics of drugs , suicide , divorce , violence , cruelty , and the hardening of class into caste in the U.S. , products of the dehumanization of our lives , the lessening of individual and family importance that central control imposes .
Without a fully active role in community life you cannot develop into a complete human being .
Aristotle taught that .
Surely he was right ; look around you or look in the mirror : that is the demonstration .
" School " is an essential support system for a vision of social engineering that condemns most people to be subordinate stones in a pyramid that narrows to a control point as it ascends .
" School " is an artifice which makes such a pyramidal social order seem inevitable ( although such a premise is a fundamental betrayal of the American Revolution ) .
In colonial days and through the period of the early Republic we had no schools to speak of .
And yet the promise of democracy was beginning to be realized .
We turned our backs on this promise by bringing to life the ancient dream of Egypt : compulsory training in subordination for everybody .
Compulsory schooling was the secret Plato reluctantly transmitted in the Republic when he laid down the plans for total state control of human life .

The current debate about whether we should have a national curriculum is phony ; we already have one , locked up in the six lessons I ’ve told you about and a few more I ’ve spared you .
This curriculum produces moral and intellectual paralysis , and no curriculum of content will be sufficient to reverse its bad effects .
What is under discussion is a great irrelevancy .
None of this is inevitable , you know .
None of it is impregnable to change .
We do have a choice in how we bring up young people ; there is no right way .
There is no " international competition " that compels our existence , difficult as it is to even think about in the face of a constant media barrage of myth to the contrary .
In every important material respect our nation is self - sufficient .
If we gained a non-material philosophy that found meaning where it is genuinely located  in families , friends , the passage of seasons , in nature , in simple ceremonies and rituals , in curiosity , generosity , compassion , and service to others , in a decent independence and privacy  then we would be truly self - sufficient .
How did these awful places , these " schools , " come about ?
As we know them , they are a product of the two " Red Scares " of 1848 and 1919 , when powerful interests feared a revolution among our industrial poor , and partly they are the result of the revulsion with which old - line families regarded the waves of Celtic , Slavic , and Latin immigration  and the Catholic religion  after 1845 .
And certainly a third contributing cause can be found in the revulsion with which these same families regarded the free movement of Africans through the society after the Civil War .
Look again at the six lessons of school .
This is training for permanent underclasses , people who are to be deprived forever of finding the center of their own special genius .
And it is training shaken loose from its original logic : to regulate the poor .
Since the 1920s the growth of the well - articulated school bureaucracy , and the less visible growth of a horde of industries that profit from schooling exactly as it is , have enlarged schooling ’s original grasp to seize the sons and daughters of the middle class .
Is it any wonder Socrates was outraged at the accusation that he took money to teach ?
Even then , philosophers saw clearly the inevitable direction the professionalization of teaching would take , pre-empting the teaching function that belongs to all in a healthy community ; belongs , indeed , most clearly to yourself , since nobody else cares as much about your destiny .
Professional teaching tends to another serious error .
It makes things that are inherently easy to learn , like reading , writing , and arithmetic , difficult  by insisting they be taught by pedagogical procedures .
With lessons like the ones I teach day after day , is it any wonder we have the national crisis we face today ?
Young people indifferent to the adult world and to the future ; indifferent to almost everything except the diversion of toys and violence ?
Rich or poor , schoolchildren cannot concentrate on anything for very long .
They have a poor sense of time past and to come ; they are mistrustful of intimacy ( like the children of divorce they really are ) ; they hate solitude , are cruel , materialistic , dependent , passive , violent , timid in the face of the unexpected , addicted to distraction .
All the peripheral tendencies of childhood are magnified to a grotesque extent by schooling , whose hidden curriculum prevents effective personality development .
Indeed , without exploiting the fearfulness , selfishness , and inexperience of children our schools could not survive at all , nor could I as a certified schoolteacher .
" Critical thinking " is a term we hear frequently these days as a form of training which will herald a new day in mass schooling .
It certainly will , if it ever happens .
No common school that actually dared teach the use of dialectic , heuristic , and other tools of free minds could last a year without being torn to pieces .

Institutional schoolteachers are destructive to children ’s development .
Nobody survives the Six -Lesson Curriculum unscathed , not even the instructors .
The method is deeply and profoundly anti-educational .
No tinkering will fix it .
In one of the great ironies of human affairs , the massive rethinking that schools require would cost so much less than we are spending now that it is not likely to happen .
First and foremost , the business I am in is a jobs project and a contract - letting agency .
We cannot afford to save money , not even to help children .
At the pass we ’ve come to historically , and after 26 years of teaching , I must conclude that one of the only alternatives on the horizon for most families is to teach their own children at home .
Small , de- institutionalized schools are another .
Some form of free - market system for public schooling is the likeliest place to look for answers .
But the near impossibility of these things for the shattered families of the poor , and for too many on the fringes of the economic middle class , foretell that the disaster of Six - Lesson Schools is likely to continue .
After an adult lifetime spent in teaching school I believe the method of schooling is the only real content it has .
Do n’t be fooled into thinking that good curricula or good equipment or good teachers are the critical determinants of your son and daughter ’s schooltime .
All the pathologies we ’ve considered come about in large measure because the lessons of school prevent children from keeping important appointments with themselves and their families , to learn lessons in self - motivation , perseverance , self - reliance , courage , dignity and love  and , of course , lessons in service to others , which are among the key lessons of home life .
Thirty years ago these things could still be learned in the time left after school .
But television has eaten most of that time , and a combination of television and the stresses peculiar to two - income or single - parent families have swallowed up most of what used to be family time .
Our kids have no time left to grow up fully human , and only thin - soil wastelands to do it in .
A future is rushing down upon our culture which will insist that all of us learn the wisdom of non-material experience ; this future will demand , as the price of survival , that we follow a pace of natural life economical in material cost .
These lessons cannot be learned in schools as they are .
School is like starting life with a 12 - year jail sentence in which bad habits are the only curriculum truly learned .
I teach school and win awards doing it .
I should know .

Obama Blocked Clean Up of BP Oil Spill by Friendly Countries ; International Assistance Blocked by Regulations Obama Had The Authority To Waive
Crucial offers to help clean up BP ’s oil spill “ have come from Belgian , Dutch , and Norwegian firms that . . . possess some of the world ’s most advanced oil skimming ships . ”
But the Obama administration would n’t accept the help , because doing so would require it to do something past presidents have routinely done : waive rules imposed by the Jones Act , a law backed by unions .
“ The BP clean - up effort in the Gulf of Mexico is hampered by the Jones Act .
This is a piece of 1920s protectionist legislation , that requires all vessels working in U.S. waters to be American - built , and American - crewed .
So . . . the U.S. Coast Guard . . . ca n’t accept , and therefore do n’t ask for , the assistance of high - tech European vessels specifically designed for the task in hand . ”
The law itself permits the president to waive these requirements , and such waivers were “ granted , promptly , by the Bush administration , ” in the aftermath of hurricanes and other emergencies .
But Obama has refused to do so , notes David Warren in the Ottawa Citizen .
Instead , Obama rejected a Dutch offer to help clean up the spill , noted Voice of America News :
“ The Obama administration declined the Dutch offer partly because of the Jones Act , which restricts foreign ships from certain activities in U.S. waters .
During the Hurricane Katrina crisis five years ago , the Bush administration waived the Jones Act in order to facilitate some foreign assistance , but such a waiver was not given in this case . ”
“ After the Obama administration refused help from the Netherlands , Geert Visser , the consul general for the Netherlands in Houston , told Loren Steffy : ‘ Let ’s forget about politics ; let ’s get it done . ’”
But for Obama , politics always comes first : “ The explanation of Obama ’s reluctance to seek this remedy is his cozy relationship with labor unions .
. .
‘ The unions see it [ not waiving the act ] as … protecting jobs .
They hate when the Jones Act gets waived . ’”
Ironically , even the staunchest supporters of the Jones Act are now distancing themselves from refusals to accept foreign help , saying they have “ not and will not stand in the way of the use of these well - established waiver procedures to address this crisis . ”
Obama is being more intransigently pro-union than the unions themselves .
One can only hope Obama will change his mind now , given that “ each day our European allies are prevented from helping us speed up the clean up is another day that Gulf fishing and tourism jobs die . ”
( The Obama administration has belatedly accepted some foreign equipment for use in fighting the spill , although it still blocks ships with foreign crews .
As Voice of America notes , although “ the Netherlands offered help in April , ” such as providing “ sophisticated ” oil “ skimmers and dredging devices , ” the Obama administration blocked their crews from working in U.S. waters , and as a result , this crucial “ operation was delayed until U.S. crews could be trained ” in June .
“ The Dutch also offered assistance with building sand berms ( barriers ) along the coast of Louisiana to protect sensitive marshlands , but that offer was also rejected , even though Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal had been requesting such protective barriers . ” )
In April 2009 , the Obama administration granted BP , a big supporter of Obama , a waiver of environmental regulations .
But after the oil spill , it blocked Louisiana from protecting its coastline against the oil spill by delaying rather than expediting regulatory approval of essential protective measures .
It has also chosen not to use what has been described as “ the most effective method ” of fighting the spill , a method successfully used in other oil spills .
Democratic strategist James Carville called Obama ’s handling of the oil spill “ lackadaisical ” and “ unbelievable ” in its “ stupidity . ”
Obama is now using BP ’s oil spill to push the global - warming legislation that BP had lobbied for .
Obama ’s global warming legislation expands ethanol subsidies , which cause famine , starvation , and food riots in poor countries by shrinking the food supply .
Ethanol makes gasoline costlier and dirtier , increases ozone pollution , and increases the death toll from smog and air pollution .
Ethanol production also results in deforestation , soil erosion , and water pollution .
Subsidies for biofuels like ethanol are a big source of corporate welfare : “ BP has lobbied for and profited from subsidies for biofuels . . . that cannot break even without government support . ”
The $ 800 billion stimulus package is also using taxpayer subsidies to replace U.S. jobs with foreign green jobs .
And its regulations destroy jobs in America ’s export sector .
Yesterday I wrote an article about a woman that has downsized her life to the point that she is living in a house that is only 84 square feet .
That was pretty crazy , in a cool kinda way , but now I have something else even more bizarrely cool to share with you .
This story originally came out in 2009 , but for some reason , it ’s getting a huge resurgence on the Internet .
Award - winning Hong Kong architect , Gary Chang lives in a 344 square foot apartment .
It ’s the same apartment that he lived in as a child with his parents , three sisters and a tenant .
Here is the crazy part – using a futuristic sliding wall system , Gary has configured 24 rooms into that space including a living room , spa , bathroom , guest bedroom , master bedroom , kitchen , laundry room , wet bar and home cinema !
As you see , there is beautiful natural lighting everywhere .

His architectural tricks have inspired people all over the world to stop complaining and get creative with their small living spaces .

And though he kept his campaign promise to oppose the big health care legislation , and has voted with the Republican leadership in the overwhelming majority of cases , he has also sided with Democrats on some important issues .
Most notably , he voted in favor of the financial regulatory bill even though the Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , and the rest of the conference leadership , voted no and denounced the measure as overly expanding the government .
“ Listen , I have always said I do n’t work for Mitch McConnell and I do n’t work for Harry Reid , I work for the people of Massachusetts , ” Mr. Brown said in an interview .
“ I am not quite sure what all the surprise is , and people wondering kind of like , ‘ wow , he ’s independent . ’
I have always been this way .
I am going to look at each and every bill and look at the merits of it . ”
But his willingness to team up with Democrats is already raising eyebrows and ire among some voters in Massachusetts who backed his candidacy .
They say he is betraying some of the conservative ideals that he espoused during the campaign  especially in his vote on the financial regulation bill .
“ People are disappointed in this vote , because we see it as contrary to limited government and supporting free markets , ” said Christen Varley , the leader of the Greater Boston Tea Party .
“ I think people are realizing that in some situations Senator Brown will be an ally and in some he will not .
Some people are angry .
Some people are disappointed but willing to wait and see what happens with the next votes . ”
Ms. Varley said she was urging Tea Party members to contact the senator ’s office and express their disappointment but also counseling them to develop a healthy sense of pragmatism , especially in a state as traditionally liberal as Massachusetts .
All his life Jasper Lawrence suffered horrendous allergies and asthma .
On some days he could feel his eyes literally squeaking in their sockets from inflammation .

The bad news was that the only way to get hookworms was through contact with human faeces in a developing country .
So Jasper set out to infect himself by walking through open air latrines in Cameroon .

Bottles of vodka move along a conveyor belt at The Mazovian Distillery Polmos S.A. in Jozefow , near Warsaw June 21 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Kacper Pempel
ST PETERSBURG , Russia ( Reuters ) - Russia on Thursday called time on vodka drinkers at its top economic conference , outlawing the national tipple from normally well lubricated stands at the St Petersburg Economic Forum .
The ban comes as President Dmitry Medvedev , the keynote speaker , spearheads a campaign against alcohol abuse which includes higher taxes and a minimum price on vodka , and may yet lead to limited sales hours .
“ On the territory ( of the forum ) , only beverages no stronger than wine can be drunk , ” said Stanislav Voskresensky , a deputy economy minister .
Financial information company Bloomberg covered up a Russian Standard vodka logo on its stand with white paint hours before the forum opened , while a chess lounge favored by government officials moved screens in front of displays of cognac .
Alcohol abuse is a major problem in Russia where , according to Medvedev , the average Russian drinks 18 liters ( 38 pints ) of pure alcohol each year .
Successive anti-alcohol campaigns by Soviet leaders all failed to solve the problem .
Half a year ago , I got this crazy idea to build a site where people could log and record all the things they wanted to accomplish before they died .
But more than just simple list - making , I wanted to make it easy for people to tell stories about their goals , and to add images and video .
I wanted to let people “ follow ” other people ’s lists , to receive email when their friends accomplished their goals , to start discussions about getting the most out of life .
I wanted it to be a place where people could get inspired by the goals of others , and to easily make copies of those goals in their own bucketlists .
The result is bucketlist.org .
I had a pre-existing love affair with the Python - based Django framework – there was never a question of what platform to build on .
But no matter how good the platform , the devil ’s in the details .
Data Modeling
While the basic concept was pretty simple , some of the implementation details became challenges .
First , there was abstract stuff , like how to do the data modeling and logic for items copied from one list into another .
If we wanted to have views like “ most copied items , ” it was important that people not be able to edit the copied items ( if they did , the copy would no longer be a copy ) .
But if copied items were n’t editable , no one would want to use the feature .
Should a copied item have a foreign - key relationship to the original , or be a free - standing record ?
And what about copies of copies ?
Would we track them in the aggregate by traversing a relationship chain , or by counting references to a single original ?
Wrangling data can be a brain buzz .
After trying several approaches , I decided it would be most performant to make copies into free - standing records , but with a “ copied_from ” relationship field .
Users would be allowed to edit the details of the item , but not the title .
That protected the integrity of the relationship but still allowed enough freedom to keep the feature useful .
User Registration
Handling user registration and profiles is something nearly every site needs , and the magic pairing of django - registration and django - profiles covers all the bases , keying off Django ’s built - in base User object with a lot of implementation flexibility .
But the documentation for them is written for rocket scientists , and customization can be a chore if you do n’t have a CS background .
In fact , the “ Missing Manual ” I wrote for django - registration a year ago has been one of the most popular items on Birdhouse since it went up .
During the Bucketlist soft - launch period , I began to realize how different user expectations can be from the assumptions you make during build .
For example , a lot of people now expect to be able to use email addresses as usernames when signing up for a site .
But I ’m using the username as part of the user ’s bucketlist URL , and personal email addresses change .
No go on that .
Ironically , Django 1.2 started supporting email addresses as usernames , so I had to figure out a way to disable the new feature .
I ’m no fan of anonymity on the internet .
One of the few things Facebook ( which I generally dislike ) really gets right is that it strongly encourages users to use their real names .
So my signup form initially required First and Last names , and bucketlist pages were clearly labeled as such .
But within days of the soft launch , I had several users trying to find ways to work around the last name requirement .
Who am I to judge ?
Backed off and made last name optional , and found conditional ways to represent the user ’s name depending on how much info they were willing to give .
Also had to figure out things like how to modify the base User object when fields in the linked Profile object is changed .
Rich Text Editor
Because they ’re difficult to do securely , rich text editors in form fields are most commonly found on the back - end of content management systems , not on public facing pages .
Since a user can bypass the options provided by the rich text editor simply by turning off JavaScript , input has to be carefully inspected and post - processed on the back end as well .
To get around this problem , my first versions of the site used Markdown to allow fancy formatting , but I was never happy with that approach .
Developers may think Markdown is “ user friendly , ” but trust me — it is n’t .
And because it requires a unique syntax , you always need a helper guide to go with it , which is just not user friendly .
I really wanted a proper rich text editor , but needed it to be secure .
Took a lot of trial and error , but I documented the solution I finally came up with : Allowing Secure User Input With Django .
I ’m happy with the results .
Handling Media
From the start , I wanted to make it easy to for users to add images and video to their stories .
But I did n’t want to get into the business of storing huge amounts of media – people already have accounts at Flickr and YouTube and Vimeo , and there ’s a wealth of freely embeddable content at those sites ready to be re-used ( Bucketlist users are encouraged to add media created by other people if they do n’t have their own ) .
At the same time , I was n’t willing to allow users to paste embed code from those sites – that ’s a security nightmare waiting to happen ( even WordPress only lets site administrators paste embed code – not normal authors or end users ) .
My first stab at a solution was to build some kind of shortcode solution , where users could type something like :
[ youtube 83kx78y ]
and have that string auto - replaced with proper embed code .
There ’s already a django - shortcodes project out there , and I figured I ’d build on that .
But after spending a few evenings working with APIs of various providers and realizing how many more I had to create , decided that was a fool ’s errand ( I even submitted patches to the python - flickr API interface tool along the way ) .
Then I learned about the awesome oembed system .
Oembed is a standard that lets you hand a media ID to a supporting provider , and they pass back all of the metadata for that piece of media .
So a site can implement a tool that parses user - submitted text for URLs of supporting sites ( like Flickr or Vimeo ) , extracts the media ID , and uses the returned metadata in json format to reconstruct a known - safe embed code block .
Thus , users need only paste media URLs into the rich text field and the rest happens automagically .
Started off with the various forks of django - oembed , with mixed results .
The codebase was really large ( for what it did ) , and the results were buggy .
URL fragments would be left in the text , and some providers simply failed to resolve ( that part turned out to be a problem with the ooembed endpoint , which I was able to fix by switching to embed.ly .
After trying and failing to fix django - oembed , switched to jquery - oembed , which did a cleaner job with half the lines of code .
I ’d rather not rely on Javascript for this functionality , but will wait until someone writes a leaner , cleaner oembed implementation for Django .
Twitter API
From the start , I had planned to let users
Tweet their new goals directly from the site .
Found a nice Python library for working with the Twitter API , but posting content without sending passwords around meant learning all about the OAuth dance – a little tarantella that involves passing request tokens and auth keys back and forth .
In retrospect , it does n’t look too nasty , but it took several evenings to get it just right .
It ’ll be easier next time :)
I did n’t implement Facebook ’s posting tools into this version of the site – in part because of all the politics and privacy concerns swirling around them right now , and in part because I understand they ’re moving everything to OAuth2 .
Will wait for the dust to settle on that a bit .
Of course posting to Twitter meant I needed shortened versions of Bucketlist URLs , so I got to play with the bit.ly API too .
That part was a cakewalk – no tarantella required .
And of course I needed a character counter in the Tweet field .
Found a nice JQuery plugin for that .
Design
I ’m more of a developer than a designer .
I know good design when I see it , and even teach a lecture to visiting journalists on Web Design Principles .
But when it comes to conceptualizing original designs , I kind of freeze up .
Also , I wanted to keep on trucking with the 960 Grid system I use elsewhere — 960gs makes it trivial to manipulate columns in complex layouts .
Unfortunately , there are few freely available designs based on 960gs – you ’re still on your own to come up with look and feel .
What I ended up with is n’t ideal , but it ’s not bad either .
Rather than designing the whole thing in advance , I just started filling out the grid as I went along – it evolved through chipping and plucking away over time .
If the site does well , I may hire a real designer at some point .
Comments
Getting the Comments system working the way I wanted them to was fun too .
Django ’s native commenting framework works well out of the box , but when implemented per the docs , always presents a name and email field to the user .
But I only want to take comments from authenticated users , making those fields redundant and annoying .
Ultimately did find a way to get this working , and decided to contribute documentation to save future users the same hassles .
The ticket was accepted , but the patch was never committed ( got lost in the ramp - up to Django 1.2 , I think ) .
A common problem with open source projects — to make it worth the while for the public to submit patches , those patches need to be handled in a timely way .
Deployment , DVCS
Along the way , also learned pip and the virtualenvwrapper , using requirements .
txt for tracking dependencies rather than doing it all manually .
And switched from svn to git for version control .
Lots of learning steps through all that , including a fun version incompatibility between dev and production that yielded awesomely dadaistic error messages like :
fatal : fetch - pack : unable to fork off sideband demultiplexer
But nothing I could n’t work through .
Overall , really happy to have made the changes .
Deployment onto new development machines , and onto the server , is almost trivial now .
Birdhouse runs on cPanel and cPanel does n’t yet support Django natively – admins have to jump through quite a few hoops to get Django sites running .
I ’ve filed an official feature request for cPanel to support Django like it does Ruby on Rails , and it ’s getting a fair number of votes , but it needs more .
If you ’re a cPanel admin , please add your voice !
For now , my Django - on - cPanel process looks something like this .
Avatars
Thumbnails for profile avatars are provided through two mechanisms : User ’s choice of Gravatar or an uploaded image .
If the user does not upload an avatar , and if their registered email address matches an account at gravatar.com , their Gravatar is automatically presented via the django - gravatar template tag .
If they do upload an avatar , we verify and resize it with the sorl - thumbnails library … which unfortunately appears to have been recently abandoned .
Still , sorl is n’t going to break anytime soon , and I ’m not seeing anything out there that looks like a great replacement , so went with it .
sorl - thumbnail depends on the ubiquitous Python Imaging Library .
Which is fine , except that I got dragged through the trenches trying to get PiL working on Snow Leopard .
Little obstacles every step of the way add up .
Bits and Pieces
The dynamic list reordering ( see the bottom of your own list ) came from some Ajaxy bits I assembled from various sources when building django - todo last year – that code ported over pretty clean .
The slippy slidey two - pane views that let you toggle / slide between incomplete and completed items came from a JQuery plugin by Gaya Design ( original concept here ) .
All of the various RSS views were assembled pretty much according to the docs on Django ’s syndication framework .
The “ Featured Items ” ( best items rotating randomly in the banner ) are selected ( by me ) with a custom admin action which was trivial to write .
The resulting queryset is randomized with the little - known “ ? ” syntax on order_by in a global context_processor :
def featured_items ( request ) : return {' featured ' : Item.objects.filter(featured=True).order_by ( ' ? ' ) [ : 4 ] }
I ’ve heard that using “ ? ” is n’t very performant with large querysets , but this query will never return a large recordset , so it should be fine .
Tagging of course comes via the awesome django - tagging package .
Overall , the project took six months of intermittent nights and weekends .
And despite the many hassles , it was a fantastic learning experience , and a gas to build .
Now that summer is pretty much here , it ’s harder to stay indoors and hack .
Time to get out and actually do some of the things on my bucketlist :)
UPDATED 1 pm : The Sunday Times carried a rather large " correction " yesterday that , once read alongside the original offending article , amounted to a complete retraction .
In fact , it was a giant climbdown .
In The Sunday Times and the IPCC : Correction , the paper refers to a news page story on 31 January headlined " UN climate panel shamed by bogus rainforest claim " ( removed from the Sunday Times site , but available , disgracefully , on this site ) .
The article stated that the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) report had included an " unsubstantiated claim " that up to 40 % of the Amazon rainforest could be sensitive to future changes in rainfall .
The IPCC had referenced the claim to a report prepared for the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) by Andrew Rowell and Peter Moore , who were described as " green campaigners " with " little scientific expertise . "
The Sunday Times article also stated that the authors ' research had been based on a scientific paper that dealt with the impact of human activity rather than climate change .
In fact , as the paper now concedes , the IPCC's Amazon statement was supported by peer - reviewed scientific evidence .
In the case of the WWF report , the figure had , in error , not been referenced , but was based on research by the respected Amazon Environmental Research Institute ( IPAM ) which did relate to the impact of climate change .
The " correction " added : " We also understand and accept that Mr Rowell is an experienced environmental journalist and that Dr Moore is an expert in forest management , and apologise for any suggestion to the contrary . "
But there was more humble pie to eat , because the article also quoted criticism of the IPCC 's use of the WWF report by Dr Simon Lewis , a Royal Society research fellow at the University of Leeds and a leading specialist in tropical forest ecology .
He made no such criticism .
So the paper had to retract its remarks about him too .
" We accept that , in his quoted remarks , Dr Lewis was making the general point that both the IPCC and WWF should have cited the appropriate peer - reviewed scientific research literature .
" As he made clear to us at the time , including by sending us some of the research literature , Dr Lewis does not dispute the scientific basis for both the IPCC and the WWF reports ' statements on the potential vulnerability of the Amazon rainforest to droughts caused by climate change . "
And there was yet more because this wholly misconceived article had also stated that Dr Lewis 's concern at the IPCC 's use of reports by environmental campaign groups related to the prospect of those reports being biased in their conclusions .
Therefore the Sunday Times added : " We accept that Dr Lewis holds no such view – rather , he was concerned that the use of non-peer - reviewed sources risks creating the perception of bias and unnecessary controversy , which is unhelpful in advancing the public 's understanding of the science of climate change .
" A version of our article that had been checked with Dr Lewis underwent significant late editing and so did not give a fair or accurate account of his views on these points .
We apologise for this . "
UPDATED PAR : I think that sets the gold standard in " corrections " .
Its publication was brokered by the Press Complaints Commission , and I understand from the PCC that there were good reasons for the four - and - a - half - month gap between the article apparing and the settlement .
But why did it take so long for the paper to admit it had got the whole thing wrong .
And why did n't its headline simply say : " Sorry , our reporter screwed up and we got it wrong " ?
Readers would like that candour and regard it as more credible because it had the guts to own up to its mistake .

It ’s hard to believe we ever lived in a pre-Tim and Eric world , because in the six years they ’ve been on Cartoon Network ’s Adult Swim lineup , their squirm - inducing quasi- anti - comedy ’s influence is now virtually inescapable .
Of course , their spreading sway has n’t been completely limited to Tom Goes To The Mayor and the more sketch - based Tim And Eric Awesome Show , Great Job ! , but for every music video Eric Wareheim directs , there are many more guest - star big - name actors ( and diva - esque small - name or local - access actors ) attracting attention to what Tim and Eric have been doing .
Paul Rudd shows up to use a computer , and it ’s funnier than it deserves to be .
Fred Willard hosts a cooking show , and it ’s both unsettling and goofy .
But none of the guest stars even remotely hold a candle to John C. Reilly , who ’s carved out an entire new identity for himself as Dr. Steve Brule , a perpetually uneasy physician whose credentials are both suspect and unclear .
Two years ago , Tim and Eric announced that Dr. Steve Brule would be getting his own spinoff , and it was exciting not only because Brule is easily one of their best creations , but also because Brule is also the poster child for their mission on Adult Swim : Putting things on TV that have no business being on TV .
But until after tonight ’s episode , I really had no idea what to expect .
It was exhilarating in a way , because I remember puzzling over Awesome Show teasers with friends a couple years back .
They gave no indication whatsoever about what that show would be , other than completely insane .
Check It Out ! was supposed to premiere last year , but it was pushed back , and concrete details about it remained virtually non-existent .
Adult Swim coyly sent me an e-mail last month telling me Brule ’s show is “ his version of a newsmagazine - style program . ”
That ’s a pretty fair assessment , because Check It Out !
feels very much like something Brule spent many sleepless nights editing together while thoughtfully gnawing on his glasses .
Advertisement
Tonight ’s episode , as its title suggests , is all about food .
As is typical with Tim and Eric ’s sense of humor , it does n’t really matter what happens onscreen :
It ’s how things happen .
All the same , it ’s an auspicious start for what ’s hopefully going to be a six - episode run that ’s as strong as this debut .
Check It Out ! is n’t so much about the topics Brule is covering , but it ’s actually quite legitimately a character study about the good doctor .
He and his behind - the - camera buddy Denny have decided to tackle the issues that they think matter more than anything else .
And really , what could be more important than food ?
You need it to live , dummy .
From the outset , Check It Out ! is just remarkably odd .
The colors look slightly wrong .
And from the looks of it , Brule has gussied up a local - access station ’s studio to make a junior - high - school ’s same setup look only slightly better by comparison .
He takes his responsibility just as seriously as a seventh grader would , making sure he syncs his swivel around on his non-swiveling stool precisely at the top of the show so he can greet the camera exactly when the intro music ends .
After opening with a nonsensical poem about nutrition , Brule clumsily segues into the show ’s first field piece :
Going to a restaurant , an experience he describes being “ like stumbling into a cave of food . ”
Advertisement
It ’s at Toad ’s Family Restaurant that he falls into “ a lover ’s trance ” with unknowing waitress Sunshine — another is - she - a - real - actor - or - just - some - person - they - found - in - the - parking - lot ?
actor — who ’s too busy carefully reading the specials from her pad directly into the camera to notice .
We ’ve only really seen Brule interact with Tim or Eric , so somehow just the simple premise of him engaging new characters alone is pretty funny .
One of the biggest gross - out laughs comes here when Brule heroically orders all the food in the restaurant so the viewers at home can see it , and then demonstrating a great safety tip to cool off food that ’s too hot :
Spit cold milk all over it .
After that display of resourcefulness , Brule invites Sunshine back to the studio to talk further about food , but he quickly falls out of love with her when he finds out they ’re cousins .
Instead of being repulsed , Dr. Steve just gets underwhelmed , moving on with a matter - of - fact “ big deal ! ”
After covering the kinds of foods you might encounter outside your cupboard and local diner , Brule trips and falls into a cake on a pedestal , then declares it ’s time we investigate weird foods like sushi .
A polite sushi chef winds up being just another onscreen prop for Brule , who instead ingests a dangerous amount of wasabi and wonders aloud about ginger , which he mistakes for peaches .
Brule again dispenses with this segment by basically undercutting it with some more wisdom : “ Do n’t let other people from other countries talk to you . ”
Advertisement
Finally , Brule invites special guest — and real - life weight - loss coach / nutrionist — Dr. Jonny Bowden on for what I hope will be a recurring segment called “ Doctor On Doctor . ”
When Bowden begins to second - guess Brule ’s knowledge of the food pyramid ( which includes dog foods ) , there ’s a prolonged period of intense and awkward silence , until Brule basically admits he does n’t care what Bowden thinks — he ’s a doctor , too .
Until writing about tonight ’s episode , I did n’t even realize that the show ’s segments basically all ended with Brule dismissing them .
It does n’t make them feel like a waste of time — far from it — but I think is just an extension of how flighty Brule is .
When he was on the Channel 5 News dishing out health tips , those handfuls of seconds were probably the longest he was able to be coherent .
So , no wonder his show zigs and zags like a hummingbird .
Where Tim and Eric ’s bargain - bin production tricks and have become somewhat commonplace , Check It Out mines a lot of its brain - hurting laughs sheerly from character .
Which in itself is pretty funny , because Tim and Eric have been called a lot of things , but patient and character - based has n’t been one of them .
Mind you , Check It Out is far from a traditional show , but it feels refreshingly different for the Adult Swim lineup .
Hell , it feels different from everything else Tim and Eric have done before , but still feeling somehow familiar .
If Awesome Show is anti-comedy , then Check It Out is post - comedy : something that ’s funny without even trying .

Stray observations :
· Is John C. Reilly wearing a bald cap , and also a wig modeled after the original Brule hair ?
Does anyone know ?
Advertisement
· Tim Heidecker has said in interviews that Reilly actually can’t see through the glasses Brule wears .
Because he ’s doing much more with the character now , is that why he ’s introduced a new crosseyed dramatic stare to his repertoire ?
· “ I brought a real sushi lady in to make real sushi sandwiches for us . ”
· Terry Bruge - Hiplo .
Sherriff Ramb .
If Tim and Eric made a TV show just of their strange made - up names shooting across the screen , people would still watch it .

· “ Food is bad for your health , if you eat too many kinds of food at once . ”
· The food pyramid , as Dr. Steve Brule understands it : “ sugar , salt , nachos , hot dogs , corn dogs , all the dog foods , and the white foods : milk and rice . ”

See this slide show to see what happens when modern manufacturing processes and shark finning collide .
No time or patience to sit through an entire slide show on industrial shark - finning , ( which has ambient audio , image captions and full screen capabilty ) ?
Here 's a selection of the best photos from Kesen - numa City , Japan .
And here 's a YouTube video of the industrial shark finning in Kesen - numa City that I shot with my iPhone .
KESEN - NUMA CITY , JAPAN -
It 's 5 am on the the north eastern tip of Japan 's main island of Honshu , and 75 tons of dead shark is being meticulously arranged into a neat grid of tidy piles , of twenty sharks per pile .
If you thought shark finning was exclusively a Chinese problem , think again .
Welcome to Kesen - numa City , Japan 's shark fin capital .
Here , six days a week , small teams of Japanese workers go about the hushed business of industrial shark - finning .
By 6.30 am , with piles arranged , the sharks are disemboweled first .
Hearts are ripped efficiently from their bodies by men wearing brightly coloured rubber boots and aprons .
At 7 am , the shark corpses are cleaned of their blood by workers wielding water hoses .
And by 8 am , small teams are silently moving up and down aisles and rows like robots in a Japanese car factory , quickly slicing off every dorsal , pectoral and tail fin from the lifeless , grey lumps .
Big hungry black crows squawk in the shadows , looking for bloody morsels .
And shark fins plop with regularity into small yellow plastic baskets .
The baskets fill up fast , are then weighed , and finally carried to a nearby truck , where a man with a notepad strikes a deal .
At 9.30 am , it 's all over for another day .
Fork lift trucks scoop up tons of limbless carcasses , then dump them into a high - sided truck .
The process is a brutal sight to behold , and not for the faint - hearted .
The fishing port of Kesen - numa City is located in Miyagi Prefecture in North East Japan , and is the country 's only port dedicated to catching sharks .
Over two days in early July 2010 , I saw 119 tons of blue shark ( Prionace glaucaof ) , ten tons of salmon shark ( Lamna ditropis ) , and three tons of short fin mako shark ( Isurus oxyrinchus ) landed on the dock at Kesen - numa .
Not to mention several tons of endangered bluefin tuna , ( Thunnus thynnus ) , but that 's a whole other story .
Taking government transparency to another level , landed shark tonnage numbers are provided daily by the port of Kesen - numa 's Japanese only website , which is publicly , ( and apparently unashamedly ) , available .
According to the most recent data available , a Kesen - numa Municipal Fisheries report , the gross tonnage of blue sharks landed in the small fishing port dropped from 9,722 tons in 2007 to 8,200 tons in 2008 , a decline of 18.6 % .
Only a small portion of shark fin prepared in Kesen - numa is destined for export , mostly to Hong Kong and Shanghai , where Japanese shark fin is seen as a premium brand by the new wealthy elite of China .
For wealthy Chinese , shark fin from Kesen - numa is seen as a premium , or luxury , brand .
Mr Hatakeyama , 45 , a shark fin processor from Kesen - numa , said , " Quite a bit of shark fin is sent to Shanghai from here as there are many rich people there .
Our shark fin here can command higher prices than Chinese shark fin sourced from elsewhere in Asia , the Middle East or Africa .
Even though the Chinese have their own shark fin , they prefer Japanese brands " .
Given the delicacy 's roots , this is hardly surprising , but what is more unexpected is that the majority of shark fin processed in Kesen - numa is for domestic consumption as shark fin soup at Chinese restaurants and expensive hotels in Japan .
Like in China , shark fin soup is common place at weddings , company banquets and all sorts of other special occasions where the paying host wants to show off their wealth .
And much of the shark fin produced at small food factories dotted around the city ends up bound for Chinese restaurants in Japan , of which there are many .
The rest is sold to hotels to include on their menus for newly weds and for corporate banquets .
In olden times , shark fin was sometimes used as a substitute for gold when Japanese merchants traded with China .
Understandably , and for this same reason , the exact location for fin drying in Japan remains a closely guarded secret .
And a significant amount is shipped to China for sun-drying , although the exact drying location in China is an even bigger secret .
These days , the port of Kesen - numa feels like a town down on it's luck .
Once thriving , today there is a sense of decay in the air .
Overgrown and rusty .
Similarly , attitudes have yet to move with the times .
As public sentiment slowly turns against shark fin soup in Hong Kong , what was once an ancient tradition in this forgotten corner of Japan , is , according to conservationists , wreaking havoc on shark populations worldwide .
Small fishing boats used catch sharks as part of the city 's ancient tradition .
But this tradition , coupled with modern fishing methods like the advent of strong and long fishing lines , and boats that can go further and stay out of port for longer , is a recipe for disaster for the sharks .
According to the Japan Fisheries Agency , the nation 's national shark fin catch nearly halved since the late 1960's .
In 1969 , the total number of sharks caught and landed in Japan was around 65,000 tons .
Last year 's total was around 35,000 tons , and Kesen - numa accounts for around 90 % of all sharks caught nationally .
Whether the global marine ecosystems can suffer such an onslaught is debatable .
The arguments against shark - finning are , by now , well known in Hong Kong .
It is said that sharks take decades to reach adulthood , and by ripping them out of the oceans at such an unprecedented rate , we are depriving them of them of the chance to reproduce , and thus repopulate their decimated numbers .
As sharks are apex predators at the top of the food chain , they are naturally predisposed to exist in smaller numbers than their prey and this , combined with their low reproductive rates , makes them naturally vulnerable to over - fishing .
Cruelty may be the issue at stake for those who see the wasteful practice of slicing the fins off the shark at sea and tossing them back over the side of the boat , but in Kesen - numa the whole shark is landed .
It is said that every part of every shark landed at Kesen - numa is processed there and then consumed .
Even it 's heart .
For the people of Kesen - numa are seen as a little strange by ordinary Japanese .
Locals can ill afford the shark fin soup available at many of the town 's small side street restaurants , but the locals have developed a peculiar , if bloodthirsty , fondness for raw salmon shark heart sashimi .
An exotic ' delicacy ' , which , according to local people , is consumed nowhere else in Japan .
It is left up to the tourists who visit Kesen - numa to order the city 's famous speciality , shark fin soup .
And tourists do come .
Some are attracted to the splendid hiking along Miyagi Prefecture 's rugged coastline , whilst others are seafood aficionados , looking for their next hit of sublime ultra - fresh exotic seafood .
Early risers among them will inevitably make their way to the dock , where they are confronted with one of the most bloody spectacles they are likely ever to witness in their lives - Kesen - numa 's very own industrial shark - finning show .
A quick walk around the town , reveals a parallel universe , where even the most basic concepts of marine conservation do not exist .
Just a stone 's throw from the dock , is the ' Kesen - numa Rias Shark Museum ' , which visitors enter through a giant set of shark jaws .
Once inside , tourists are first confronted by real copies of faded front pages of tabloid newspapers from around the world that sensationalize shark attacks on swimmers .
Make no mistake , sharks are bad , evil , a threat to humanity and they should be erdaicated from the face of the earth , the headlines , and so it seems the museum 's message screams at us .
This despite the fact that humans are statistically far more likely to die from crossing the road , than from an attack by a shark .
After passing exhibits relating to the natural history of sharks at the half way mark , visitors leaving the museum pass a glass display box filled with all kinds of products one can make from shark ; shark fin soup in a can , shark cartillage pills which are supposedly good for joint pain , and hand - crafted handbags made from shark leather .
But not a word about conservation and the critical situation facing global shark stocks due to over - fishing .
Could a new battle between marine conservationists battling to save the sharks and the Japanese fishing lobby be on the horizon ?
First there was the annual showdown in the Southern Ocean between the Japanese whaling fleet and the environmental groups Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd to save the whale .
Then there was the runaway success of the Oscar - winning documentary ' The Cove ' which exposed the brutal Japanese trade in captive dolphins .
One would think the tide is slowly turning .
Is n't it time Kesen - numa City , Japan 's dirty little shark secret , was shut down too ?

Looks like we are getting treated to at least some more eye candy today …
If you ’ve seen the latest update to BioWare ’s “ The Old Republic @ E3 2010 ” post then you ’ll have noticed the following :
The Old Republic Live on G4 !
Make sure to check out G4 ’s half - hour blowout on Star Wars : The Old Republic starting at 2 pm PT !
Adam Sessler , X - Play host and G4’s Editor - In - Chief of Games , plans to deliver a 30 - minute all - access coverage of The Old Republic including live game - play .
“ Never before have we granted so much time to one game at E3 , ” said Adam Sessler .
“ Star Wars : Old Republic is a game of such breadth that the excitement around it and the time we are dedicating to it will have a huge pay - off for the viewers . ”
Want to see what the press are seeing ?
Then do n’t miss a minute of it !
Below are embeds of the Bounty Hunter Armor Progression video , the Bounty Hunter / Imperial Agent combat video , and the Player Ships video !
Here you see a trooper and smuggler work together for the Republic on a quest :
Sith Warrior and Sith Inquisitor engage in combat on a quest :
This video shows the Bounty Hunter in combat and upgrading its armour .
You can see that the armour can be indeed customised to suit your tastes :
They have n’t talked much about space or even player ships but it looks like Player ships ARE coming to Star Wars : The Old Republic :
It seems that Massively had a sitdown at a BioWare presentation where they talked about including player ships , group play , PvP , crafting and customization .
It ’s not a terribly long article , but here ’s an excerpt :
Borrowing ideas from other well - established titles , Bioware went on to discuss the game ’s crafting and PvP systems .
Crafting will be “ unique but WoW - like ” , though no specific details have yet been published on it .
For PvP , the game will feature some large open PvP areas in addition to instanced warzones .
These are intended to act like World of Warcraft ’s battlegrounds , pitting teams against each other in instanced matches .
Transitioning from the game world into an instance is smooth , with absolutely no load time .

A PREFACE
OR , BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE PUBLISHING THIS WORK .
WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR THEREOF , AND DEDICATED TO THOSE WHOM GOD HATH COUNTED HIM WORTHY TO BEGET TO FAITH , BY HIS MINISTRY IN THE WORD
Children , Grace be with you .
Amen .
I being taken from you in presence , and so tied up that I cannot perform that duty , that from God doth lie upon me to you ward , for your farther edifying and building up in faith and holiness , etc. , yet that you may see my soul hath fatherly care and desire after your spiritual and everlasting welfare , I now once again , as before , from the top of Shenir and Hermon , so now from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the leopards ( Song iv. 8 ) , do look yet after you all , greatly longing to see your safe arrival into THE desired Haven .
I thank God upon every remembrance of you ; and rejoice , even while I stick between the teeth of the lion in the wilderness , that the grace and mercy , and knowledge of Christ our Saviour , which God hath bestowed upon you , with abundance of faith and love ; your hungerings and thirstings after farther acquaintance with the Father , in the Son ; your tenderness of heart , your trembling at sin , your sober and holy deportment also , before both God and men , is a great refreshment to me ;
For ye are our glory and joy .
1 Thess . ii. 20 .
I have sent you here enclosed , a drop of that honey that I have taken out of the carcase of a lion .
Judg . xiv. 5 8 . I have eaten thereof myself , and am much refreshed thereby .
( Temptations , when we meet them at first , are as the lion that roared upon Samson ; but if we overcome them , the next time we see them , we shall find a nest of honey within them . )
The Philistines understand me not .
It is something of a relation of the work of God upon my soul , even from the very first , till now , wherein you may perceive my castings down , and risings up : for He woundeth , and His hands make whole .
It is written in the Scripture , Isa. xxxviii .
19 , The father to the children shall make known
Thy truth .
Yea , it was for this reason I lay so long at Sinai , Lev. iv. 10 , 11 , to see the fire , and the cloud , and the darkness , that I might fear the Lord all the days of my life upon earth , and tell of His wondrous works to my children .

Thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness , to humble thee , and to prove thee , and to know what was in thine heart , whether thou wouldst keep His commandments , or no .
Deut. viii .
2 . Wherefore this I have endeavoured to do ; and not only so , but to publish it also ; that , if God will , others may be put in remembrance of what He hath done for their souls , by reading His work upon me .
It is profitable for Christians to be often calling to mind the very beginnings of grace with their souls .
It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord , for bringing them out from the land of Egypt .
This is that night of the Lord to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations .

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made some news recently by announcing a RICO class action lawsuit against BP .
In my opinion , his case will be a test of the judicial system — and not BP — as it moves forward .
But I want to focus on something else he said during his Thursday interview with Keith Olbermann .
In doing this , I ’m setting something up , something I want to talk about later .
Nevertheless , this information stands alone ; it ’s worth considering on its own right .
The whole segment is good , very good in fact .
But pay attention to this point ( my emphasis ) :
BP has huge economic dis-incentives to actually deploying the kind of resources it ought to deploy to clean up the site .
Let ’s not forget that BP , like all inhuman corporate “ persons , ” operates on only one principle — make more money now .
I ’ll look at the BP–related implications of that later .
A second point while we ’re watching Keith — whom do the cops work for ?
( And whom do the Whack - a - Nut cops work for ? )
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32545640
You wo n’t make sense of this unfolding story if you do n’t understand BP ’s incentives .
This is just a newsy taste .
Stay tuned .

Islamabad , Pakistan -- Gary Faulkner , the Colorado man arrested in Pakistan while hunting for Osama bin Laden , has been moved to Islamabad by the Pakistani government , his brother said Wednesday .
Dr. Scott Faulkner said Jim Flowers from the U.S. consulate in Peshawar , Pakistan , told him the Pakistani government is still questioning Gary Faulkner and that he has not been charged with anything .
Gary Faulkner , 50 , was stopped near the border with Afghanistan 's Nuristan province , Pakistani police announced Tuesday .
He was carrying a pistol , a sword , night - vision equipment and Christian religious books , said Mumtaz Ahmed , a police chief in the area .
Faulkner told police that he had been looking for bin Laden since al Qaeda 's September 11 , 2001 , and had traveled to the area several times before , Ahmed said .
Faulkner said he had no intention of killing bin Laden , but because of the weapons he was carrying , police did not believe him , Ahmed said .
Faulkner underwent a medical exam Wednesday .
A Pakistani doctor determined that he has psychological problems and has been undergoing dialysis every 20 days , said a senior Pakistani intelligence official , who is not identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media .
A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Embassy personnel still have not had access to Gary Faulkner and were not aware of the doctor 's examination .
Faulkner 's brother , Dr. Scott Faulkner , said Tuesday that Gary Faulkner does not have mental problems .
" He does n't meet any of the DSM -- that 's the psychiatric manual -- he does n't meet any criteria for psychosis .
He is not schizophrenic .
He does n't have schizophrenia .
He does n't hear voices .
God is n't telling him , ' Oh , Gary , go get him , go get him . '
He 's a normal person .
He handles himself in society , " Scott Faulkner said .
" My brother is not crazy .
He is highly intelligent and loves his country and he has not forgotten what Osama has done to this country , " Scott Faulkner said .
A reward of up to $ 25 million is being offered by the U.S. State Department in return for information leading directly to bin Laden 's arrest .
Gary Faulkner is a California - born independent contractor who has lived in Colorado since 1968 , his brother said .
Colorado Bureau of Investigation records show that a Gary Faulkner has a lengthy criminal record of minor offenses that dates to the early 1980s .
He served jail time on three separate occasions for various charges that included second - degree burglary , and was arrested as recently as 2006 for a traffic violation .
More recently , Scott Faulkner said , his brother felt the U.S. government was not doing enough to bring bin Laden to justice , " and he felt that he was , as a Christian , not afraid -- that he could boldly step out and that doors would be opened for him . "
" And I agree with him , " Scott Faulkner said .
" The fact that he 's been over there six times and has not received a scratch tells me that somebody 's looking after him . "
Scott Faulkner said his brother " could blend in with the local population and go places that our military cannot go . "
" We have relationships with the Pakistani government : ' OK .
You can go in this region or you can't go in that region , ' whereas my brother could go about willy - nilly , " he said .
" He had a long beard .
He looked like Taliban .
When he
wore his robe , he looked like Taliban .
The only way you could tell he was not was when he spoke . "
In Washington , Tuesday , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said the Pakistanis informed the U.S. government about the arrest , but he could n't discuss details .
" We want to talk to him , figure out who he is , what brought him to Pakistan , and we 'll take it from there , " Crowley said .
CNN 's Samson Desta , Melanie Whitley and Jim Spellman contributed to this report .
Will the pope continue his attack on gay rights while in UK ?
The pope has been invited , during his September visit , to lecture the British people about “ the family ” – which , in Vatican - speak will mean another attack on gay rights .
The Tablet magazine reveals that Lord Patten — who has been put in charge of trying to get the chaotic visit back on track — is “ enthused ” about it all .
Referring to speeches that the Pope is going to make while in this country — including one to ‘ civil society ’ in Westminster Hall — Lord Patten said : “ Education is going to play a part as will what the Government has said about the Big Society and its connections with Catholic Social Teaching themes such as solidarity and subsidiarity .
And there will be another addition too :
The role of the family .
I am absolutely sure of that . ”
But exactly what business does a foreign head of state have coming to this country telling us how to run our affairs ?
Or perhaps , in that context , he is not a “ head of state ” but a “ religious leader ” ?
It seems he can transmogrify from one role to the other whenever it suits his purpose .
He ’s a “ head of state ” when there is any prospect of his having to pay his own way ( or maybe get arrested for covering up child abuse ) , and he ’s a “ religious leader ” when he wants to try and inflict his dogmas on to an unwilling society .
When the Vatican talks of “ the family ” it is , at least partly , code for homophobic prejudice .
Wherever he goes the Pope attacks gay people and tries to persuade governments to deny or remove their rights .
He did it in Portugal recently and in Spain before that .
He has done it in Italy .
It is sickening that we are paying hundreds of millions for him to come and do the same to gay people here .
Lord Patten says : “ Nobody expects a total meeting of minds . ”
He can say that again .
The Tablet also reports :
Thus far , the Bishops ’ Conference of England and Wales has received a total of £ 1.4 m towards the visit from the insurance company , National Catholic Mutual , and other diocesan insurers .
A further £ 1 m has been pledged by individual benefactors and at least another £ 1 m is expected from the Pentecost Sunday national collection .
Wealthy benefactors who attended an Archbishop ’s House reception earlier in the year were told that the original plan for the Newman beatification would cost £ 1.3 m and a Hyde Park prayer vigil £ 1.5 m .
In a recent interview , Mgr Summersgill cautioned Catholics not to be too optimistic about their chances of attending the pastoral gatherings .
He has suggested some could see the Pope from the roadside while he hoped that huge numbers would participate “ virtually ” with the live coverage on television and online .
This kind of attitude does not go down well in Rome , with one Vatican source saying : “ That will be seen as provincialism .
The Pope travels to be seen by as many people as possible , not to be watched on TV .
If that were the aim , he might as well stay in Rome . ”
Then there is the issue of conviction .
If there are problems raising money , has the Church “ sold ” the visit to the faithful ?
In many parishes , the national collection that was held on Pentecost Sunday went ahead without the planned gift - aid envelopes , prayer cards and posters being distributed on time .
The visit was n’t explained to churchgoers , even though 330,000 Q - and - A leaflets are being printed .
But they wo n’t be distributed until late June , weeks after the collection . ”
Responding to the Catholic Church in England propaganda leaflet published last week entitled Heart Speaks unto Heart purporting to explain why the Pope is visiting the UK , even enthusiastic Catholics dismissed it as “ an embarrassment ” and “ guff ”
In a couple of sentences it blithely skates over the fact that England has been at war with the Vatican on more than one occasion and that there are still constitutional prohibitions on the participation of Catholics in public life – such as the Act of Settlement .
It tells us that the Pope is an “ ecumenist ” who respects all religions .
This is despite his 2007 declaration of the Catholic Church to be the only authentic faith and everything else was illegitimate and untrue .
The different faiths will pray together in Westminster Abbey in an effort to “ overcome their divisions ” while in the real world , religion will continue to be an excuse for people to kill , maim and persecute each other .
See here and here and here .
Read the leaflet
Meanwhile , the Archbishop of Westminster , Vincent Nichols , said this week that the pope must not be greeted with noise from vuvuzelas , the plastic horns that have become a craze at the World Cup in South Africa .
You can buy your vuvuzela here

Top Iranian ayatollah denounces friendship with dogs as un-Islamic

After I finish this we are going for a walk in the woods .
They suspect the ayatollah is just giving religious cover to national custom .
They also think he probably is a damn cat lover .

He built a program that is truly outstanding and has done it with such character and myeyes fill with tears , when I think of the news conference and more importantly that Tom Izzo is staying .
Last year at a wedding , he readily agereed to have his picture taken with my daughter and her fiance .
I have a dear friend at Dobie Road Nursing Home and I watched , as Lupe visited her father with such love .
I can not even begin to think of all the charities that he has supported .
As a teacher , I have watched , as he developed his young players basketball talents but more importantly how he taught them the lessons of life .
He is not only man , who makes MSU proud but he does the same for the whole state of Michigan .

Just a gracious , good man .
Echoing what many others have said , I had a chance meeting with Coach Izzo just awhile ago and he was simply kind and sincere , no more , no less .
Clearly , a man unaffected by fame .
Who can begrudge him the opportunity to coach one of the potentially greatest players that basketball has ever known , and possibly attain a professional basketball championship ?
He owed it to himself , his family , and his close friends , confidants and mentors to look at the opportunity .
Would we have held it against Magic to leave MSU early to join Kareem , et.al. , and the Lakers ?
Even Jud could n't do that ( as he 's said ) .
While he never would have really left , we 're forever grateful that Coach Izzo continues as basketball coach and one of the leaders of the Michigan State family .

He is so centered , that he can think on his feet .

It was March 1999 , my son was born early , and he had to spend some time in the ICU .
We brought him home the day before we played KY to get to the Final Four .
It was an emotional time .
When we beat KY to get to the Final Four , I cried , a combo of the emotional roller coaster I had been on , and realizing MSU hoops had arrived .
I still tell my son about that weekend , I will never forget it .
When we played FL for the 2000 NC , I went out with friends to watch the game .
When I got home that night , I picked my son out of his crib , and sat in the rocking chair with him and sung him the MSU Fight Song repeatedly .
It 's a memory he does n't have I will cherish forever .
It 's been an awesome ride since .

Lynn Henning is a real piece of work .
Get this :
In the ABSENCE of information , he chooses to write an article than is derrogatory to the spirit of honesty and fairness !
Now that may be his PERSONAL opinion , and he is entitled to that , but that is pretty messed up journalistic integrity if you ask me .
My sense is that he was miffed because he could not get infornmation and his EGO got involved big - time so he chose the LOW ROAD .
Other reasons he may have selected this approach ?
I know for a FACT that his visits to the university of michigan have been several multiples of the time he has spent covering Michigan State in person .
Knowing the class act that Coach Izzo is , he will give him some personal time to straighten things out , but knowing how I feel , I am never reading the Detroit News again .
Period .

I 'm sure if the press had reported nothing , people would be mad about that , too .
In retrospect , while very important to our immediate community , this decision is far less important that the two wars being fought and what is happening in the Gulf .
As Coach , himself said , everyone has a job to do ... but all 's well that ends well !
Coach is staying !!!
And Spartans everywhere are happy again !

Beer
06.28.2010
Each year for the past eight years , Zymurgy Magazine has asked its readers to submit a list of their top 20 favorite beers that are commercially available somewhere in the U.S.
The competition is not limited to American beers and votes for imported beers are accepted as long as those beers are available commercially in the States .
The turnout this year was at a record high with a total of 1,192 votes .
Of the 450 different commercial breweries that received votes , only 27 breweries made the 50 top - ranked beers list .
One interesting note is that , although many different styles of beers were represented in the poll , the first five of the six top - ranked beers were of the IPA style .
It seems as if Americans still love their hoppy beers , despite the latest sour beer craze in the country .
The winner came down to a mere two votes : Russian River Brewing Company ’s Pliny The Elder was able to just barely slide by Bell ’s Two - Hearted and claim the win .
The official list is included below .

About Zymurgy Magazine
Zymurgy is published by the American Homebrewers Association , a division of the Brewers Association , a not - for - profit organization located in Boulder , CO .
Since 1978 , Zymurgy magazine has been the leading light for amateur brewers in North America and around the world .
It features innovative and award - winning recipes , articles on do - it - yourself equipment building , explanations of brewing science , and presentations of brewing techniques in addition to a healthy dose of beer culture .
SOME technologies seem a long time coming .
Their story has a familiar script : a breakthrough is hailed ; overblown expectations are aroused ; disappointment follows .
Away from the public 's impatient gaze , however , tinkering scientists turn out incremental improvements , furtively catching up with the revolutionary rhetoric of yore .
This appears to have been the case with the sequencing of the human genome .
It also illustrates the recent history of quantum computing .
An ordinary computer stores and processes information using bits , which take the value of either one or zero ( physically represented by different voltages of electric current ) .
In the bizarre world of quantum mechanics , however , subatomic particles can exist in several states at once .
Such “ superposition ” means , for instance , that the property of an electron known as its spin can be not only “ up ” ( representing , say , one ) or “ down ” ( representing zero ) but also some combination of the two .
In quantum computing , such superposed values are named qubits .
Additional qubits can be added by a process called entanglement .
Each extra entangled qubit doubles the number of parallel operations that can be carried out .
A three - qubit device could run eight operations , a four - qubit system 16 , and so on .
At least in theory .
In practice the results so far have been disappointing .
Experimental quantum computers require exotic materials and work only at a tad above absolute zero .
But the latest incremental improvement may help lift the field out of the slough of despond .
First , it does its computing in silicon — the workhorse of more familiar computers .
Second , it does it at the balmy temperature of - 269˚C , or four degrees above absolute zero .
The magicians who have pulled off this double trick are Thornton Greenland of University College , London , and his colleagues .
As they describe in this week 's Nature , they first doped the silicon with phosphorus atoms .
They then used a short , high - intensity pulse from a fancy laser to jolt electrons orbiting those phosphorus atoms into what is known as a Rydberg state .
In this state , each atom 's quantum wave - function — its effective size — extends several billionths of a metre from its nucleus .
That is huge in atomic terms , and permits the entanglement of atoms that would normally be too far apart to interact .
This , in turn , means they can become collaborative qubits .
Once their wave - functions had been expanded , the atoms were zapped again , inducing them to emit a controlled burst of light called a photon echo .
This would be used to read out the result of any calculation the system had performed .
Magical mystery tour
The result is something that could , in principle , do calculations and spit out the answers — and which could be made industrially using the sort of equipment that turns out conventional chips .
That it works at four degrees above absolute zero is a bonus .
It might sound pretty chilly , but it is a temperature that can be maintained fairly easily using liquid helium , which boils at 4.22 degrees above absolute zero .
Dr Greenland 's discovery , then , brings practical quantum calculation closer .
And a second paper in Nature , by Morgan Hedges , of the Australian National University in Canberra , and his colleagues , has advanced another aspect of the field by describing a type of quantum memory that uses light .
Atoms and electrons are not the only particles that can get entangled .
Photons , the particles of light , are also susceptible .
If they could be integrated into the world of quantum computing , that would help with the transfer of qubits from place to place .
The problem with light , though , is its speed .
However handy its high velocity is for whizzing information over great distances through optical fibres , it is unhelpful if any calculating has to be done .
For that to happen light needs to be pinned down .
In 2008 Hugues de Riedmatten of the University of Geneva and his team managed to do that .
They built what was , in essence , an echo chamber on a chip and held a single photon there for a microsecond ( a period when that photon would normally have expected to cover about 300 metres ) .
Dr Hedges 's echo chamber did considerably better than that .
By using such exotic materials as yttrium orthosilicate crystals and praseodymium ions it trapped photons in bunches of as many as 500 at a time .
It was also good at preserving entanglement , increasing the amount of quantum information it could hold without being corrupted or destroyed to a level that might be practically useful .
Sadly , the developments of Dr Greenland and Dr Hedges do not spell supermarket shelves stacked with quantum PCs any time soon .
They do mean , though , that the tinkerers have more to tinker with — and that , ultimately , is how new technologies really develop .
2nd bill to restrict sexualized , " depicted youths " in manga , anime also defeated
The General Affairs Committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly has voted down the bill to regulate sexualized depictions of " nonexistent youths . "
The bill would prohibit sexualized depictions of " nonexistent youths " — such as in manga , anime , games , and other materials — from being sold to minors .
Committee members from the Democratic Party of Japan ( the largest faction in the assembly ) , the Japanese Communist Party , and the Tokyo Seikatsusha Network party voted against the bill .
According to the Asahi Shimbun paper , the bill also faces defeat before the entire assembly on Wednesday .
The bill is supported by the Liberal Democratic Party , which is the second largest faction in the assembly and the party of Tokyo's current governor , Shintarō Ishihara .
The LDP and its New Komeito Party ally introduced a second version of the bill that attempted to clarify its vague , convoluted language .
Among other changes , the second version replaced the newly invented term " nonexistent youth " with " depicted youth " ; Governor Ishihara himself said in May that the term " nonexistent youth " makes people wonder , " Are they talking about ghosts or something ? "
However , the second version of the bill was also voted down in committee .
The last time that a bill presented by any Tokyo governor was defeated in the assembly was in 1988 .
The Tokyo Metropolian Government 's Office for Youth Affairs and Public Safety aims to revise and re-introduce the bill in the assembly 's September session .
The Democratic Party of Japan , Japanese Communist Party , and Tokyo Seikatsusha Network have 53 , 8 , and 3 assembly seats , respectively — enough for a slim majority out of 127 seats to defeat the current bill .
The lone member of the Jichi Shimin ' 93 faction also opposes the bill .
By contrast , the Liberal Democratic Party and New Komeito Party have 38 and 23 seats , respectively .
Like most prefecture - level governments in Japan , Tokyo already has an existing Youth Healthy Development Ordinance to prohibit the sale of " harmful publications " to minors .
The Tokyo Metropolian Government 's bill would specify that such " harmful publications " would include sexualized yet non-explicit materials that do not involve actual people .
1,421 manga creators , 10 publishing companies , the Japan Pen Club , the Japan Cartoonists Association , and the Writers Guild of Japan voiced their opposition to the bill .
On June 4 , Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki issued a statement about the bill on the studio's official blog .
Suzuki declared that regardless of the outcome of the revision bill , Studio Ghibli will continue to create works based on what it believes in .

But if you ’re interested in my personal experience with these tools , then read on .
You may also want to check out the following Smashing Magazine articles :
Probably the most important metric of these services is the capture delay , which I measured for the URL stackoverflow , with the following browsers enabled : Firefox , IE , Chrome and Safari .
BrowserShots
BrowserShots is the oldest and best known free online multi-browser screenshot service .
It supports the largest number of browsers : a total of 61 different browser versions and operating systems , which is great , but I can hardly imagine anyone wanting to test their website under Kazahakase 0.5 running on BSD Unix .
Feature - wise , it allows you to enable and disable Javascript , Java and Flash and change the screen size .
I find the latter very useful , especially nowadays when one has to take into account smartphone browsers with non-standard resolutions .
The interface is not very user - friendly .
Selecting the browsers and options you want takes time , and because it is a Web service you have to do it over every time you want to take a screenshot .
When ( and if ) you finally get your screenshots , there is no easy way to compare different captures in order to find rendering inconsistencies .
HTTP redirect is not fully automated : BrowserShots displays the URL you are being redirected to , but you have to start the screenshot again manually .
The biggest disadvantage of BrowserShots — which , in my opinion , makes it practically unusable for a professional developer — is the response time .
In our test scenario , it was more than 45 minutes .
Note that a screenshot expires in 30 minutes , unless you manually extend it .
As you can see from the shot below , BrowserShots has serious bugs with scrolling ( see MSIE 8.0 screenshot ) and at least one browser screenshot failed , even though it said the operation was successful .
Conclusion
Unless you need only a single test on a particular browser , this service is not for you .
Even then , by the way , it would probably take less time to install that browser , test the page and then uninstall it .
Unique features : None .
Disadvantages : Painfully slow .
BrowserCam
BrowserCam is another well - known screenshot service .
Unlike BrowserShots , this is a commercial service .
The cheapest plan cost $ 159.80 a year and provides access for five users .
The interface is nice .
It allows you to create a project and specify the URL and browsers you want to capture , so that you do not have to do it all over again to re-test the page .
But because it is a non-AJAX Web - based interface , its response time is not comparable to that of a native application , which is a bit annoying .
Browser support is slightly more limited than that of BrowserShots , but it is good enough for practical purposes ; it supports multiple versions of IE , Firefox , Safari , Opera and Chrome , as well as some older browsers on OS X , Linux and multiple versions of Windows .
Capture speed is decent : it took about two minutes to take a screenshot of our test scenario .
BrowserCam supports multiple resolutions and has window and full - page capture , which means scroll bar support .
Another nice feature is mobile device capture : it supports Blackberry , iPhone , Android and Windows Mobile devices .
Note that mobile capture support is not part of the browser capture plan and costs $ 999.95 extra annually .
It also has an email capture service , which in my opinion is of limited use , and remote access , which can be useful for troubleshooting rendering inconsistencies that are detected from a screen capture .
Both services cost extra .
The screenshot below is of a BrowserCam results window .
Remote access packages allow you to connect using VNC to your choice of Linux , Windows and Mac machines with different browser versions .
This can be a good option for debugging on hardware that you do not have , such as Mac .
But the price of $ 499.95 a year is not far from the price of Mac mini , and because the VNC protocol is not terribly efficient , extensive remote debugging via VNC can be daunting .
Conclusion
A very good professional service with advanced features and thoughtful interface .
Unique features : Mobile device support , remote access .
Disadvantages : Expensive .
Adobe BrowserLab
BrowserLab is a new offering from Adobe and was previously known as Meer - Meer .
It is written in Flash and as such has the advantage of being cross- platform compatible and of having the look , feel and ( most importantly ) response time of an application .
It is currently offered free of charge in preview mode while Adobe “ is monitoring the performance . ”
Because it will monitor it for more than one year , one wonders whether it has other reasons for this .
According to Adobe , it will charge $ 10 to $ 20 per month for this service starting in 2011 .
The interface is attractive , polished and easy to use , as you can see from the screenshot below .
You can inspect captures one by one or view two captures side by side , which is more useful .
The much lauded “ onion skin ” option is not very practical : most of the time , browsers will not render a page identically pixel by pixel , but the page might still look the same .
Browser support is modest compared to the competition .
At the time of writing , BrowserLab supports only Chrome , Firefox , IE and Safari : a total of 12 browsers and OS version combinations .
But it looks like the quality of the product is still at beta level ; in two captures , it actually cut the image horizontally .
Scroll bar support is buggy , too .
Screenshot speed is very good .
Our test scenario did it in less than one minute .
Conclusion
A very nice interface , and free till the end of 2010 .
Unique features : None .
Disadvantages : Modest browser support , minor bugs .
Microsoft Expression Web SuperPreview
SuperPreview is a new addition to Microsoft ’s Expression Web WYSIWYG development environment .
This is the standalone version , limited to Internet Explorer and available for download free of charge .
Browser support is limited .
The standalone version supports only IE 6 , 7 and 8 , while the full version has support for Firefox and Safari .
The user experience , on the other hand , is very impressive .
Because it is an application that runs on your PC , the response time and screenshot delay are among the best in class .
In our test scenario , it loaded the website in a matter of seconds .
Please note , though , that because SuperPreview works with only two browsers at a time and does not support Chrome , this test was not identical to that of other services .
SuperPreview cannot be purchased without the Expression Web , whose retail price is $ 149 .
Conclusion
The interface is extremely easy to use , and the speed is incredible .
But browser support is very limited , and being part of the Expression Web package , it ’s almost unusable .
Unique features : None .
Disadvantages : Limited browser support , expensive .
BrowserSeal
BrowserSeal is a new tool .
Similar to SuperPreview , it is an application rather than a Web service , and as such its capture speed is very good .
BrowserSeal finished our test case in less than one minute .
Browser support is quite broad .
With multiple versions of IE , Firefox , Safari , Opera and Chrome , it pretty much covers every browser anyone would want to test .
It has two good features that set it apart from the competition : standalone browser support and a command - line interface for automation scripting .
All browsers supported by BrowserSeal can be launched manually , which means that once you ’ve found a rendering inconsistency in a browser , you can actually run the problem browser and troubleshoot the issue .
This is something most other services do not offer .
The price is very competitive , too : the standard version sells for $ 49 .
There is also an automation version with a command - line interface that lets you capture multiple URLs from a script or batch file .
The interface is attractive and easy to use .
The optional tabbed interface makes it easy to spot even the slightest rendering difference when switching from one capture to another .
Conclusion
A very nice tool , with comprehensive browser support .
The interface is easy to use , the capture speed is great , and the price is competitive .
Unique features : : Comes with standalone versions for all major browsers ; has command - line mode for automation scripts .
Disadvantages : : Runs on Windows only .
Litmus
Litmus is another Web - based screenshot service .
Its browser support is impressive , with 23 browser versions and operating system combinations , including IE , Firefox , Chrome , Safari , Opera , Flock , Camino , SeaMonkey and Netscape .
Capture speed is okay but not comparable to that of native applications : our test took five minutes .
The interface is clear and simple but lacks some features .
For instance , there is no easy way to compare capture results .
All you can do is view them one by one or download them to your PC .
The app , though , does support projects , so you do n’t have to enter URLs and change browser settings every time you want to take a screenshot , but this is pretty much all it does .
Litmus does not support scrolling ; that is , it captures only the top of long pages , which is a major drawback .
The price is a bit high for a service that has such basic features : a single - user license costs $ 588 annually .
Conclusion
Good browser support , and average capture speed , which is probably good enough for most users .
But very few features .
Unique features : : None .
Disadvantages :
Does not support scrolling , and lacks other standard features found in competing products .
Multi-Browser Viewer
Multi-Browser Viewer is an application but relies on a server farm for browser rendering ; in other words , the application is just a graphical interface , so it is as easy to use as an application but suffers the delays of a typical Web - based service .
One interesting feature is that it comes with standalone browsers that can be used for debugging .
But note that these are not the same browsers used for screen capture .
Multi-Browser Viewer has standalone browsers that can be used for debugging , and it has a rendering farm with many more browsers that can be used for screen capture .
Browser support is impressive , with 54 browser and OS version combinations ( out of which 17 are available in standalone versions ) , including IE , Firefox , Chrome , Opera , Safari , Camino , Konqueror .
The price is reasonable : a single - user license costs $ 129.95 annually .
Feature - wise , it does lag significantly behind the competition : there is no support for authentication or capture delay .
Scroll bar support is buggy ; in our test case , it worked for IE , Firefox and Safari , but not for Opera .
Conclusion
A good interface and impressive browser support .
Unique features : Standalone versions of some ( but not all ) browsers .
Disadvantages : Lacks many features of competing products , buggy scroll bar support , runs on Windows only .
Browsera
Browsera is a Web - based screenshot service .
Browser support is limited compared to that of most competitors : only IE , Firefox and Safari are supported .
The standard plan costs $ 588 annually .
The interface is attractive , fast and clean .
You can conveniently organize your screenshot sessions into projects .
Browsera supports authentication , scroll bars and page crawling ( i.e. you can ask Browsera to crawl your website recursively and take a screenshot of every page ) .
The screenshot response time is very fast for a Web - based service ; it completed our test in three minutes .
Conclusion
A professional service with a good interface and interesting features , but limited browser support .
Unique features : Recursive website crawling .
Disadvantages : Limited browser support , expensive .
Browser Packs
If all you need is to test your website in specific browsers with and you are willing to perform the tests manually , there are a few free services and applications that could help :
At first glance , Spoon looks convenient because it is a Web service , which relieves you from having to install many browsers locally .
But I had some stability problems with this service .
Meanwhile , both the IE Collection and BrowserSeal .
BrowserPack ( offered free of charge , separate from the BrowserSeal commercial screenshot service ) work very reliably .
I did not have any issues with browsers installed by these packs .
The IE Collection has every IE version you could think of .
BrowserSeal .
BrowserPack , which relies on the IE Collection for IE support , also supports two Firefox , three Opera and two Safari versions .
Conclusion
The following table summarizes services that were tested and analyzed in the article .
You can use the separate page for the full table for a better overview .
I have included some metrics for each service to make it easier for you to choose the best one based on price , features and performance trade - offs .
Supported Browsers Capture speed Price ( 1 year ) Interface Authentication Capture delay Scroll bars Special features BrowserShots IE , Firefox , Chrome , Opera , Safari , Dilo , SeaMonkey , Minefield , Epiphany , Flock , Galeon , Konqueror , K - Meleon , Avant , Netscape , Shireteko , Kazehakase , Iceweasel 45 mins Free Bad No No No None BrowserCam IE , Firefox , Chrome , Opera , Safari , Konqueror , Camino , Netscape , AOL 2 mins $ 999.95 Good Yes Yes Yes Mobile browsers support , remote access service BrowserLab IE , Firefox , Chrome and Safari 1 min Free ( till end of 2010 ) Good No Yes Buggy None SuperPreview IE , Firefox and Safari 1 min $ 149 Good No No Yes None BrowserSeal IE , Firefox , Chrome , Opera and Safari 1 min $ 49 Good Yes Yes Yes Standalone browser versions , support for automation scripts Litmus IE , Firefox , Chrome , Opera , Safari , Flock , Camino , SeaMonkey , Netscape 5 mins $ 588 Basic Yes No No None Multi Browser Viewer IE , Firefox , Chrome , Opera , Safari , Flock , SeaMonkey , Netscape , K - Meleon , Camino , Konqueror , Epiphany , Kazehakase 2 mins $ 129.95 Good No No Buggy Standalone browser versions Browsera IE , Firefox , Safari 3 mins $ 588 Good Yes No Yes Recursive crawling
Obviously , we have no clear winner .
Each service has its advantages and disadvantages , and you are left to decide what is the best trade - off for your case .
Professional developers would likely not use BrowserShots because of the unreasonably long response time .
SuperPreview and Browsera are probably also impractical because of their very limited browser support .
BrowserLab will probably remain popular as long as it is free .
Once Adobe starts charging about $ 20 per month for it , one would hardly have reason to use it , unless you worked in Dreamweaver , which has a BrowserLab extension , because there are much better alternatives .
When choosing a tool , one of the most important factors in your decision will be whether to use a Web service or application .
Some people prefer
Web - based tools because they do not require installation .
Personally , I prefer applications , at least for the development tools that I use frequently .
They generally have a better interface and faster response time ; they never have outages , and they can be used to debug locally ( i.e. on my hard drive or company intranet — although some Web - based services offer a workaround for this issue ) .
BrowserCam , BrowserSeal , Litmus and Multi-Browser Viewer are all very good choices .
But they do vary significantly in price .
If you need to test mobile browsers , BrowserCam is probably your only option .
For everyone else , I would recommend either BrowserSeal or Multi-Browser Viewer ; both come with standalone browser versions that are extremely important for testing .
Unfortunately , both of them are Windows only , so Mac users will probably have to go with BrowserLab or BrowserCam .
If automatic testing is important to you , then the BrowserSeal automation edition is your best bet .
Adobe launched an ad campaign Thursday that pushes back against Apple 's decision to outlaw most third - party compilers from creating iPhone OS apps .
The ad , spotted running on Ars as well as other sites , says " We [ heart ] Apple , " before flipping over to say that the company does n't support " taking away your freedom to choose what you create , how you create it , and what you experience on the web . "
Clicking through on the ad takes you to a page on Adobe 's site with a statement from Adobe on the value of choice , highlighting its support for HTML5 , CSS , and H.264 " in addition to our own technologies . "
There is also an open letter from Adobe 's founders , Chuck Geschke and John Warnock .
The two state that they believe in the value of open markets as well as the freedom of choice .
" No company — no matter how big or how creative — should dictate what you can create , how you create it , or what you can experience on the web , " reads the letter .
" We believe that Apple , by taking the opposite approach , has taken a step that could undermine this next chapter of the web — the chapter in which mobile devices outnumber computers , any individual can be a publisher , and content is accessed anywhere and at any time . "
It 's clear why Adobe decided to move forward with this fairly aggressive campaign .
Adobe has been on the wrong end of some beatdowns lately from both Apple and the Apple - using community , which came to a head two weeks ago when Apple CEO Steve Jobs published his own open letter on Flash .
In the letter , Jobs waxed eloquent about Flash 's performance on mobile devices , Flash being a closed platform itself , and the evils of cross - platform development tools .
A full 50 percent of Ars readers seemed to agree that most of Jobs ' points were valid , though there were plenty who said they were n't fully on board with Apple 's latest approach .
Even users who recognize Flash 's downsides are left with a bad taste in their mouths over Apple 's ban on cross - platform tools — after all , there are plenty other tools out there besides Flash .
One thing is sure : if Adobe is willing to drop big money on an ad campaign to defend itself , it 's beginning to feel threatened .

Earlier this week Reuters reported on a massive amount of methane discovered in the Gulf of Mexico .
Texas A&M University oceanography professor John Kessler said methane gas levels in some areas are “ astonishingly high . ”
Kessler recently returned from a 10 - day research expedition near the BP oil gusher .
Kessler ’s team measured both surface and deep water within a 5 - mile ( 8 kilometer ) radius of BP ’s destroyed wellhead .
“ There is an incredible amount of methane in there , ” Kessler told reporters .
He said the level may be as much as one million times the normal level .
BP admits methane makes up about 40 percent of the leaking crude by mass .
In late May BP said methane makes up about 40 percent of the leaking crude by mass .
In addition to methane , large mounts of toxic hydrogen sulfide , benzene and methylene chloride are leaking into the Gulf according to the EPA and others .
Lindsay Williams , a former Alaskan pipeline chaplain with high - level oil industry connections , told the Alex Jones Show on June 10 that deadly gases are indeed escaping from the breached wellhead .
Investigative journalist Wayne Madson , writing for Oil Price , states that his sources inside the federal government , FEMA , and the US Army Corps of Engineers are dealing with a prospective “ dead zone ” created by the escaping methane within a 200 mile radius from the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
In addition , Madsen reports , Corexit 9500 , the oil dispersant used by BP , is viewed by FEMA sources as mixing with evaporated water from the Gulf .
This deadly mixture is then absorbed by rain clouds and produces toxic precipitation that threatens to continue killing marine and land animals , plant life , and humans within a 200 - mile radius of the Deepwater Horizon disaster site in the Gulf .
The “ dead zone ” created by a combination of methane gas and Corexit toxic rain , Madsen continues , will ultimately result in the evacuation and long - term abandonment of cities and towns within the 200 - mile radius of the oil gusher .
“ Plans are being put in place for the mandatory evacuation of New Orleans , Baton Rouge , Mandeville , Hammond , Houma , Belle Chase , Chalmette , Slidell , Biloxi , Gulfport , Pensacola , Hattiesburg , Mobile , Bay Minette , Fort Walton Beach , Panama City , Crestview , and Pascagoula , ” Madsen writes .
On June 13 , SoCal Martial Law Alerts ( SCMLA ) predicted that Gulf states would be evacuated .
“ Greg Evensen , a retired Kansas Highway Patrolman , estimates that 30 - 40 million people would need to be evacuated away from the Gulf ’s coastline ( i.e. at least 200 miles inland ) , ” SCMLA reported .
In order to accomplish this gargantuan feat , the federal government ( through FEMA and other agencies ) would most likely seek first to control and manage the transportation system and then operate relocation centers to manage evacuees .
Toward this end , the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) has already declared the airspace over the oil spill site to be a no - fly zone until further notice .
Various sources have indicated that local police , highway patrol , National Guard , US military and foreign troops may be involved in an operation to evacuate the Gulf Coast .
In fact , the Governor of Louisiana has already requested evacuation assistance ( i.e. National Guard ) for his state from the Department of Defense ( DoD ) and the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) .
Madsen ’s trusted sources now lend credence to the SCMLA report .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t

DK Matai reports that by some geologists ’ estimates , the methane now escaping into the Gulf may have been part of a massive bubble trapped for thousands of years under the sea floor .
“ More than a year ago , geologists expressed alarm in regard to BP and Transocean putting their exploratory rig directly over this massive underground reservoir of methane .
Warnings were raised before the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe that the area of seabed chosen might be unstable and inherently dangerous , ” writes Matai .
Matai and others fear the methane — under intense pressure ( experts estimate the pressure to be between 30,000 and 70,000 pounds per square inch ) — may form a bubble that would then rupture the seabed and erupt with an explosion .
“ The bubble is likely to explode upwards propelled by more than 50,000 psi of pressure , bursting through the cracks and fissures of the sea floor , fracturing and rupturing miles of ocean bottom with a single extreme explosion , ” Matai explains .
“ If the toxic gas bubble explodes , it might simultaneously set off a tsunami traveling at a high speed of hundreds of miles per hour .
Florida might be most exposed to the fury of a tsunami wave .
The entire Gulf coastline would be vulnerable , if the tsunami is manifest .
Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and southern region of Georgia might experience the effects of the tsunami according to some sources . ”
Private contractors went house - to - house confiscating weapons after Hurriance Katrina .
In is not certain the federal government is concerned about the prospect of a tsunami .
However , if Madsen ’s sources are correct , they are concerned about the release of deadly hydrogen sulfide , benzene , methylene chloride , and the prospect of toxic rain .
A mass evacuation of the Gulf states would be impossible without a declaration of martial law .
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina , the government all but declared martial law in New Orleans and the southern Gulf Coast — it was deemed a “ state of emergency , ” not officially martial law — and this gave rise to the largest military mobilization since the so - called Civil War .
Combat - equipped troops and private contractors went house - to - house to enforce the complete removal of the civilian population in New Orleans and also confiscate guns and leave residents defenseless .
Moreover , FEMA imposed iron - grip censorship of the media .
On September 7 , 2005 , MSNBC ’s Brian Williams reported that the city had “ reached a near - saturation level of military and law enforcement . ”
Williams and his crew were ordered to stop taking photographs by gun-toting National Guard troops .
Williams said he experienced “ the palpable feeling that this area is somehow separate from the United States . ”
Indeed , if Florida and the Gulf states are evacuated as predicted — and again , Madsen ’s sources are usually impeccable — a large part of the country will be separated from the United States and placed under martial law .

Photo of the Day : Best of August 2009

Now that California has managed to replenish wild elk herds nearly eliminated during the mid-1800s , the state Department of Fish and Game this week for the first time awarded permits to hunt elk in Alameda and Santa Clara counties .
There are only two permits — one for a bull in each county — but the slots drew relatively few applicants .
That is largely because elk in those hunting zones are on private property , where hunters need landowners ' permission to hunt , officials say .
The Alameda and Santa Clara permits drew 28 and 79 applicants respectively this season , compared with older hunting zones on ...
“ They have n’t got any great players , but you can never write them off ” is the usual line about Germany .
In 2010 , that old cliche might not be appropriate .
Not because you can write them off , but because Germany actually have a rather talented first XI .
Worldwide superstars wo n’t be found in this side , especially with the loss of captain Michael Ballack , but in Toni Kroos , Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira they have some technically superb youngsters that have made a real impact in the Bundesliga – and are exactly the sort of players that often emerge from nowhere to take the tournament by storm .
The loss of Ballack is a big blow .
42 goals in 98 games is an incredible record for a midfield player , and he has rescued Germany so many times throughout the past decade .
Today , he plays a deeper , more reserved role in the centre of midfield .
He would have partnered Bastian Schweinsteiger , another who has moved back into a deep central midfield position recently .
Instead , Ballack ’s place will probably go to Sami Khedira , a talented , tactically astute player who has been virtually assured of his place in the first XI by Joachim Low .
Schweinsteiger has been used to playing alongside a more dominant , experienced player in his new role ( Ballack for Germany and Mark van Bommel for Bayern ) and will have to step up and start to really dictate games .
Those two will play ahead of a defence that still has question marks about personnel .
The one definite is that it will be based around the towering , 6′6 Per Mertesacker .
His likely partner is Arne Friedrich , a less dominant figure , but decent enough , and good on the ball .
Philip Lahm , the captain , could start on the right or the left – if it ’s the former , Jerome Boateng will start at right - back , if it is the latter then Holger Badstuber is the favourite for left - back .
It seems slightly strange that Lahm , the closest thing Germany have to an established world class player , is unsure of his position , especially when his attacking tendencies when compared to his full - back colleagues will play an important role in how the rest of the team operates .
It was Lahm and Bastuber for the final friendly against Bosnia , which worked quite well , so that seems the most likely combination for the opening game against Australia .
The band of three attackers will feature Mesut Ozil as the playmaker .
Ozil is rumoured to be Arsenal ’s first choice if Cesc Fabregas leaves the club this summer , and Fabregas is probably a good comparison for those uninitiated - he is a creative player but also a busy one who goes looking for the ball when it is n’t coming his way .
Rafael Honegstein wrote a gushing report on him earlier this season , saying , “ Özil ’s status ( is ) the best player in the league at the moment , a one - man source of creativity and surprise .
Operating behind the strikers , he ’s both a playmaker and an auxiliary winger ; his intelligent runs provide the width that should be missing in Thomas Schaaf ’s diamond formation .
And his passing could n’t be finer if he was folding kings against aces , every single time .
The European Under - 21 winner who destroyed England in the final has been working hard in the gym , too : a couple of extra kilos of abdominal muscle have given him more balance . ”
On the right wing will be Toni Kroos a ( 20 - year - old who threatened to help take the title to Leverkuen this season , despite being owned by Bayern ) , Thomas Muller , Bayern ’s hard - working , versatile forward or Piotr Trochowski , the Hambug winger .
Muller may have the edge as he is superior defensively .
None of those three prefer the right , but are forced into that position because Low likes Lukas Podolski to fill the left - wing position .
Whilst Podolski ’s club career seems to have stalled , he has a quite incredible international scoring record of 38 goals from 72 games – at the age of just 24 .
It ’s no wonder Low has such faith in him .
A similar thing could be observed of Miroslav Klose , who will play as the lone striker .
His record of 48 goals in 95 games more than makes up for his underwhelming bench - warming 2009 / 10 campaign , and he is of course a World Cup specialist – the only man to score 5 + goals at consecutive World Cups .
Podolski and Klose need to start well , however , because they have Brazilian - born Cacau and yet another youngster , Marko Marin , ready to step in .
The 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 is a fairly structured one – it is more a Benitez - esque 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 than say , the fluid 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 favoured by Germany ’s great rivals , the Netherlands .
The wide midfielders are expected to get back and form two banks of four – Podolski is not particularly good at this , whilst Muller would be more disciplined on the right .
Ozil is given less defensive responsibility than the wingers , although he is capable of picking up an opposition holding midfielder .
Schweinsteiger and Khedira will probably dovetail in midfield – both are capable of getting forward and creating .
Conclusion
Germany are depending on some talented youngsters who have little international experience and are completely unused to playing with each other .
The most established partnership in the side is Klose - Podolski , and yet those two are hardly playing with confidence at the moment .
Schweinsteiger is playing in what is still a relatively new role , Kroos , Khedira and Ozil all have under ten caps , and the defence is far from settled .
So whereas we ’re used to German sides being experienced , boring , and effective , we are now faced with one that is young , exciting and unpredictable .
Atypical Germans .

One of the drinks we love in the summer is the classic Gin and Tonic .
It ’s an easy drink to prepare that does n’t require any special barware and is a perfect complement to hot summer weather .
Choices in tonic water have expanded over the years to include boutique specialty waters that cost as much as $ 3 per bottle .
We were curious if these premium tonic waters make a difference , so we decided to do a blind tasting with our tasting panel of five Gin and Tonics each using a different tonic water .
Picking a gin to use for this face off was a difficult choice .
While we love Organic Nation ’s Gin and often mix with Dry Fly , neither of these gins are widely available nationally .
We also considered Junipero Gin and Blue Coat Gin , but ultimately decided on the gold standard of gin – Beefeaters .
This London
Dry style gin can be found at almost every liquor store and bar nationwide , and while it ’s a huge branded spirit , we quite enjoy it as it ’s extremely well distilled and easy drinking .
The five tonic waters we put head to head against each other were : Fever Tree Tonic Water , Q Tonic , Fentiman ’s , Canada Dry and Schweppes .
It ’s important to note that both Canada Dry and Schweppes are owned by the same company that produces Dr. Pepper and Seven Up , and both contain high fructose corn syrup .
Both the Fever Tree and Fentiman ’s sweeten their tonic water with sugar , and Q Tonic uses agave .
For our tests we used a fairly basic Gin and Tonic recipe :
2oz of Beefeater ’s London Dry Gin
3oz Tonic Water
1 wedge of lime
Pour over ice , stir , add lime and serve .
Here ’s how the tonic waters fared :
Q Tonic –
Of all the tonics the Q - Tonic seemed to let the juniper notes shine the brightest .
The Q Tonic was a little sour and sharp but not too bitter and made for an extremely enjoyable gin and tonic .
A bottle of Q Tonic is 6.25 oz and retails around $ 3 per bottle .
Q Tonic is only 14 calories in our per 3 oz , less than half of Canada Dry or Schweppes .
Canada Dry – Perhaps the sweetest of the tonics , Canada Dry Gin and Tonic was closest to sipping a soda and gin .
A bottle of Canada Dry is 10 oz and retails for around $ 1 a bottle .
Canada
Dry is 33 calories per 3 oz used in our Gin and Tonic recipe .
Schweppes – Much sharper than the Canada Dry or Q Tonic , Schweppes may be too sharp and much more bitter than sweet .
Not bad , but probably better suited for people who are looking for more bite in their gin and tonics .
From a price and calorie perspective Schweppes is identical to Canada Dry : a bottle is 10 oz and retails for around $ 1 a bottle .
Schweppes is 33 calories per 3oz .
Fever Tree –
Of the five tonics this one had the lowest amount of carbonation which made it taste a little on the flat side .
The taste was pretty sour with an undercurrent of sweet .
A bottle of Fever Tree is 6.8 oz and 33 calories per 3 oz and runs about $ 3 a bottle .
Fentiman ’s – Way too sweet with overbearing citrus notes , Fentiman ’s made our gin and tonic taste more like an alcoholic 7 up .
Fentiman ’s bottle is the smallest at 4.2 oz and the most expensive of the tonic waters at $ 2.75 - $ 3 a bottle .
No calorie information is available for this tonic , either on the bottle or on Fentiman ’s site .

I was digging through some files the other day and found this document from 1997 .
It gathers a set of quotes from issues of Wired magazine in its first five years .
I do n’t recall why I created this ( or even if I did compile all of them ) , but I suspect it was for our fifth anniversary issue .
I do n’t think we ever ran any of it .
Reading it now it is clear that all predictions of the future are really just predictions of the present .
If I were compiling this list today instead of in 1998 , I would have selected much different insights .

On Saturday , America spoke clearly :
Tax the rich !
Cut the military budget !
Tax Wall Street !
But the message that will be delivered to the President ’s Deficit Commission will likely be : Cut Social Security !
Cut Medicare !
And the message to Congress will be sacrifice the unemployed , education , and jobs to reduce the deficit .
Billionaire investor Peter Peterson financed America Speaks last Saturday — simultaneous “ town meetings ” in 60 towns and cities .
Peterson has poured $ 1 billion into the Peterson Institute , whose goal is building popular support for cutting Social Security and Medicare / Medicaid .
I attended the event in New Haven , CT .
False Premises
All of the cities followed the same script .
But the whole discussion was based on false premises :
1 . The greatest threat to America ’s future is the long - term deficit
2 . It is possible to talk about the deficit in isolation from the rest of the economy
The script presented an alarming picture of a growing deficit that threatens to swallow the entire economy .
But it did not present the context .
A few of the things they left out :
1 . The long - term budget problem is really a problem of health care costs .
It is the health care system that needs being fixed .
2. Inequality has reached record levels in the last 30 years .
The richest 1 % have doubled and tripled their wealth , while the other 99 % have stagnated or lost ground .
Taxes on the wealthy have fallen while taxes ( including state and local ) on the rest of us have risen .
3. Social Security has its own funding stream ( our payroll taxes ) , is running a surplus , and will be able to pay full benefits for at least another 25 - 30 years without cutting benefits or raising the retirement age .
4 . The ability to meet government expenses depends on a strong economy , including a well - educated and healthy population , a strong infrastructure , clean environment , clean reliable energy supply , a more equitable distribution of income , and production of useful goods and services , not speculation and luxury consumption .
Limited Options
The participants were divided into small groups and asked to cut the deficit in 2025 by $ 1.2 trillion .
We were not allowed to challenge the goal or the premises , or to raise other urgent problems to be solved in the next 15 years .
We were presented with 40 options for reducing the deficit , with less than 2 minutes to discuss each option , and no way to suggest other options .
The 3,500 participants across the country agreed on measures to tax the rich , the corporations , and Wall Street , to cut military spending , and to enact a carbon tax to aid a shift to clean energy .
These were also the conclusions reached by the small group I participated with .
There was a class - conscious current that crossed party lines .
A man who plans to vote for the Republican Senate candidate was outspoken that the rich need to pay more , “ and none of us at this table make that kind of money , ” he said .
But my group also went along with the other participants nationwide in agreeing to raise the Social Security retirement age to 69 , and to cut Medicare / Medicaid spending by 5 % - 10 % .
In the two minutes allowed for each option , there was no time to explore these issues in depth .
But in some cities , participants refused to follow the script , and insisted on being allowed to vote for “ single payer ” health care reform .
This would be an essential step to controlling the costs of the entire health care system , avoiding cuts to Medicare / Medicaid .
When confronted with the question , should the government concentrate on solving immediate problems or long - term problems , my group all agreed that it is a false question ; that solving immediate problems like creating jobs in education , clean energy , rebuilding infrastructure is essential to solving long - term problems .
But this was not an option we were allowed to vote on .
Stacked Deck
The “ town hall ” meetings were presented as an opportunity for ordinary citizens to have input to deciding national priorities .
Most in my group expressed appreciation of the opportunity to speak out , and a sense of obligation to be part of the discussion .
Locally , the meeting was organized and conducted by academic researchers and groups like Community Mediation , which are interested in bringing together people from diverse backgrounds to solve problems .
But we were playing with a stacked deck .
Even though we came up with some surprisingly good proposals , the immediate impact of these “ town hall meetings ” will be to validate the faulty premise that the biggest economic priority is immediate action to cut future deficits .
This premise has already been used as an excuse by Senate Republicans to kill extended unemployment benefits and deny aid to state governments .
As a result , over a million people have already lost all their income , and another 7.5 million will be kicked off by December .
State governments are facing new budget crises and 300,000 teachers are on track to be laid off on top of last year ’s cut - backs .
How can this help the economic future of the country ?

Jesus Spotted At Local Jewish Singles Event
CARMEL VALLEY — Last weekend Jesus Christ made his first public appearance in over 2000 years when he attended Temple Beth Shalom ’s annual Jewish Singles Shmooze event — an evening where young Jews come together in the hopes of making a romantic connection with a fellow member of the tribe .
During the event , Christ was kind enough to take a break from mingling and eating kosher h’orderves to explain his situation to curious reporters .
“ Look , I ’m just here to have a good time and meet a nice Jewish girl like everyone else , ” stated Christ unconvincingly .
“ Ok , you got me , ” admitted Christ .
“ Actually , truth is , I ’ve been pretty depressed ever since my girlfriend left me about six months ago .
My ex is Catholic and her reason for breaking up with me was that she could n’t marry a Jew .
Can you believe her ?!
Why does religion have to stand in the way of two people being happy together ? ” expressed a neurotic , and somewhat bitter Christ .
Christ then admitted that his depression has made him reclusive , and this was the first time he ’s left his Hillcrest apartment in over three months .
“ Sometimes it ’s hard for me to remain optimistic .
I ’m 36 years old and always thought I ’d be married before my second coming .
After Catherine left me I thought to myself , maybe it ’s time I give Jewish women a chance , so I created a profile on JDate .
I ’m sure my mom will be thrilled about that since she ’d probably have a heart attack if she knew I had a thing for Shiksas . ”
When asked how he thought he did with the Jewish women at the event , Christ explained , “ The Jewish singles scene is pretty tough .
I mean , I ’m here competing with doctors , lawyers , and engineers … I make a modest salary as a carpenter . ”
“ To break the ice with women , I ’ve been resorting to a classic party trick where I turn water into wine , which came in handy tonight since the event is n’t open bar . ”
At the close of the event , Christ was asked if he was glad he attended .
“ The food was just ok , and the air conditioner made the room colder than I like , ” said Christ .
“ Honestly , I expected a little more for $ 10 . ”
By now , you should at least be passingly familiar with Python .
One of the fastest - growing languages , Python has been gaining popularity for years and has reached a level of maturity that makes it a top choice for enterprise development .
Companies from Microsoft to Google have embraced Python and are not only supporting its use , but also investing in its development .
Google uses it to power some of the world ’s most scalable applications .
Developers pick it up quickly and easily .
Following are five reasons so many companies are embracing Python for rapid development of scalable , enterprise Web applications .
1. Strong Support and Community
There should be little doubt that Python is here to stay .
Just look at the continually growing community around the Python project and its offshoots .
In addition to a stable community , Python has a stable road map .
Python ’s 2.x series has been well maintained and extended , while Python 3000 ( Python 3 ) has been in development .
Even though Python 3 breaks from Python 2.x in some significant ways , there is no rush to move developers to the new platform , as Python 2.x is being maintained and extended simultaneously with Python 3 development .
2. Established Developer Base
Python reached maturity years ago , but it still had a relatively small developer base .
It ’s hard to bet on a language when developers are scarce , no matter what the qualities and advantages of the language are .
Python passed the point of developer scarcity quite some time ago , though .
Python usage has increased dramatically in the last few years .
For example , it shot up by 45 percent since the spring of 2008 , Evans Data announced last year .
By November 2009 , Python was cited by more than 20 percent of the developers Evans surveyed .
If you want more evidence of Python developer interest , you need look no further than the Python Package Index ( PyPI ) .
You ’ll find more than 10,000 modules for Python , many of which are aimed at working with enterprise middleware and databases .
You might not find quite as many experienced Python developers as .
Net or Java folks , in part because Python is younger than Java and has n’t had the corporate push of .
Net. Still , Python ’s doing well enough in developer adoption to make it a solid choice .
3. Vendor Neutral
Another advantage in Python ’s court ?
It ’s vendor neutral .
It ’s backed by many companies , including Google , Microsoft and many others .
Before Sun was gobbled up by Oracle , it had engaged support for Jython — a Python for the Java platform .
The recent spike in Python developers can be attributed in part to Google ’s embrace of Python , one of three “ official ” languages adopted by the search giant .
The company supports Python on its App Engine platform .
Google ’s support is a vote of confidence from a major player with the deep pockets to help ensure Python will continue to do well .
Google hired Python ’s creator , Guido van Rossum , a few years ago to ensure he could continue working on Python .
Google is also using Python in YouTube search , the second largest search utility on the Internet , and throughout its properties .
Google ’s build system is managed with Python , and all of Google ’s reporting and data collection is done with Python .
Even Google ’s support documentation uses Python , as you can see from the “ answer.py ” format in its help documentation .
If Python can handle Google ’s infrastructure , it can handle that of any enterprise .
Python can also help port applications to the cloud .
The use of Python in Google App Engine gives companies the ability to build and deploy Web apps on the App Engine infrastructure .
No need to worry about scalability and support — and it runs only US $ 8 a user per month with a maximum of $ 1,000 a month .
Hard to beat that .
Microsoft also bankrolls Python development , working on IronPython for the .
Net framework , and it supports using Python for IIS scripting .
4. Protects Current Investment
This brings me to the next point .
Jython and IronPython help protect existing infrastructure and investments by making Python an additive language to your existing environment .
If you already have significant investments in .
Net or Java , Python can sit alongside them without disrupting your current code .
Instead , legacy code can run unchanged while new development continues in Python .
Python also gives much more flexibility in terms of deployment .
As mentioned earlier , enterprises have the option of deploying on App Engine for cloud offerings .
However , Python runs on all major OSes well , making it an excellent choice no matter what operating system or systems your company has standardized on .
5. Enterprise - Friendly Licensing
Finally , it ’s important to note that Python ’s licensing is enterprise friendly .
Python is open source , and the license is considered compatible with the world ’s most popular copyleft license ( the GNU General Public License ) .
However , Python ’s license imposes little restriction on what can be done with it .
It is free , and it allows resale of products written in Python — and even products that contain the Python interpreter .
Python has some modest licensing requirements but only in the form of ensuring that copyright notices are included in source and binary redistributions of code .
Redistributions also need to include descriptions of changes made to Python if it ’s redistributed , but beyond that , Python ’s licensing requirements are quite liberal .
Python modules have their own licenses , and organizations can find turnkey solutions from commercial vendors to help ensure they ’re in compliance .
When you add up all the advantages , technically and commercially , Python is a no-brainer for the enterprise .
It ’s solid , swift , and simple .
The question is n’t why enterprises should deploy Python — it ’s why not ?

A retired Army Colonel and fairly moderate , former three - term House member , Simmons kicked off his Senate bid last year and appeared very competitive .
Democrats had reason to worry .
This morning , however , Simmons is done , effectively ending his campaign rather than fight an uphill primary battle against former wrestling executive Linda McMahon .
Simmons made the announcement on WXLM - FM in New London , but he stopped short of definitively saying he was dropping out of the race .
He said he was releasing all his staff , ceasing fundraising and would no longer issue news releases .
Simmons planned an announcement later Tuesday morning .
A Republican with knowledge of Simmons ’ plans told The Associated Press that Simmons is expected to withdraw from the race .
“ I will no longer be campaigning , ” Simmons said during the radio interview .
As campaign developments go , this one is tough to understand .
Indeed , after last week ’s controversy over state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ’s ( D ) rhetoric about his military service , Simmons would presumably be an even stronger candidate — he ’s a decorated Vietnam vet .
So , why would Connecticut Republicans push aside the war hero with a track record of winning congressional elections , in favor of an inexperienced candidate best known for helping run a controversial wrestling company ?
Part of it came down to ideology .
Simmons had a moderate voting record , while McMahon , now the likely GOP nominee , embraced a far - right , Tea Party platform .
For some Connecticut primary voters , Simmons may have been the stronger choice in November , and he tried to pretend to be as conservative as the party base is , but he just was n’t right - wing enough .
And then there ’s the money — McMahon ’s lucrative wrestling business made her extremely wealthy , and she committed $ 50 million of her own money on the campaign .
Simmons could n’t keep up , so he ’s quitting .
If the purported Republican “ wave ” fails to materialize in the midterm elections , it will have something to do with bizarre Republican electoral decisions like this one .
Journalists on the Morning Star , the left - wing pro-trades union daily tabloid , are planning to go on strike from next Sunday in an increasingly bitter pay dispute .
Editorial staff represented by the National Union of Journalists want an extra £ 1,000 a year to supplement their current £ 19,000 salaries plus some form of recompense for working anti-social hours .
In November 2009 , the paper 's management - representing its co-operative owners , the People 's Press Printing Society - offered £ 1,000 .
But it was part of a three - year deal that staff believe will lead to very small rises in the second and third years .
There was also no recognition for anti-social working hours .
So the offer was rejected
According to one of the staff planning to strike , management initially refused to negotiate with the NUJ chapel any further .
Then , with industrial action looming , a new offer was tabled earlier this month .
Staff were offered £ 900 in a two - year - deal and some form of recognition for anti-social hours .
An NUJ member said : " This is a step forward , but
it is n't enough , and we have asked them to continue to negotiate ... they have refused to do so , so we will have no option but to strike . "
He also claimed that staff were subjected to " a vicious campaign of smears " that " would make Murdoch proud " , and that certain Communist Party members loyal to management acted as spies .
( You could n't make this stuff up ) .
It is further alleged that management has bought an off - the - shelf company that could conceivably be used in strike - breaking activities or to enable the firing of staff .
My call to the Star 's editor , Bill Benfield , had not been returned at the time of posting this item .
There are echoes in this dispute of a similar one more than a year ago when Star journalists originally secured their £ 19,000 - a- year minimum pay deal .
Here 's the relevant transcript .
SEN .
JOHN THUNE ( R- SD ) ( 6/10/2010 ) : ... you ca n't continue to blame Bush , you can't continue to blame Cheney ... REP .
VIRGINIA FOXX ( R- NC ) ( 6/15/2010 ) : ... they blame everything on our former President Bush ... JEB BUSH ( 6/19/2010 ) : ... people wake up that are partisans and they have a sniffle and they blame my brother ...
SEN .
JOHN MCCAIN ( R - AZ ) ( 6/3/2010 ) : BIOB , that 's " Blame It On Bush " ...
Yeah , BIOB .
Well ...
HRWTPITHRTCITG ( sic ) .
He Really Was A Terrible President That Ran The Country Into The Ground .
I see that 's a very common acronym .
Want to see my favorite " Do n't blame Bush " talking point of all time ?
Ladies and gentlemen , I give you Old Man Carter .
Rep. JOHN CARTER ( R - TX ) ( 6/16/2010 ) : I actually heard , I believe , that somehow , this oil spill is now George W. Bush 's fault .
It reminds me of the game , the Kevin Bacon game that no matter your job is , no matter what actor or movie you attach , you lay out before the public , you gotta bring it back in seven cycles to Kevin Bacon .
All right , listen , I do n't need seven cycles to trace this spill to Bush .
I do n't even need six degrees , which is the actual way you play the Kevin Bacon game .
Because the oil spill is the result of the Mineral Management Services ' decision to stop regulating natural resources , and start regulating how much coke they were sniffing off of oil executives ' asses , a decision they made during the administration of George W. Bush ... who was played by Josh Brolin , who starred in Hollow Man with ...
Kevin Bacon !
Boom !
I got from the Gulf disaster to Kevin Bacon in only five cycles !
What were we talking about again ?
Ah , maybe we 're so quick to blame Bush because a lot of bad stuff did happen during his Presidency .
I mean , I remember we were barely two months into Bush 's presidency when the economy started to tank .
SEAN HANNITY ( 3/14/2001 ) : ... the Clinton economy and the near recession we 're in because it's the Clinton economy ...
SEAN HANNITY ( 3/26/2001 ) : ... this is the Clinton recession and the Clinton economy ...
Yeah , that is , OK , that is a fair point , that is true .
The first thing I think of when I think of the Clinton years ... is the bad economy .
And the second thing I think of is a lack of oral sex scandals .
But , to be fair , Bush had only been in office for two months when the recession hit , so OK , fair point .
And he'd only been in office nine months on 9/11 .
So the statute of limitations on blaming Clinton then ?
PAT BUCHANAN ( 9/27/2002 ) : ... there were opportunities to take out this al - Qaeda 's leadership ... President Clinton really evaded this issue ...
Ah !
Blame Clinton for 9/11 too !
So the first policy that Bush had to own for his own Presidency was the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
According to Republicans , 18 months is apparently the cutoff point for blaming the old guy , and at that point , when he invaded Iraq , Bush had been in office for 26 months .
RUDY GIULIANI ( 5/21/2007 ) :
It was the policy of the Clinton administration to have regime change in Iraq , so in a way , George Bush carried out what Bill Clinton wanted to do .
Yes , the George W. Bush administration wanted no part !
They had no beef with Iraq .
But what could they do ?
Clinton made them pinky swear !
So wow , almost all the way through Bush 's first term , and he 's still just buried underneath Clinton 's failed policies .
Well finally in 2005 , there was that flare - up with North Korea when the United States ended direct diplomacy with them , and the Bush presidency began .
SEAN HANNITY ( 2/10/2005 ) : Trouble could be brewing in North Korea , but is it all the fault of Bill Clinton ?
Clinton !
All right , fuck it , let 's just jump ahead to 2008 , and the collapse of the housing market !
RICK SANTORUM ( 10/1/2008 ) : Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were two organizations run by Democrats , that was abused by the Clinton administration ...
NEIL CAVUTO ( 10/7/2008 ) : I might just be cynical that this is a scandal that can date back clearly to the Clinton administration ...
FRED BARNES ( 12/22/2008 ) : You can go back to the Community Reinvestment Act under President Carter and all the things President Clinton did ...
At that point Bush had been in office almost EIGHT WHOLE YEARS , and had yet , apparently , to have an impact !!
Which brings us back full circle to the very show that said it was inappropriate for the Obama administration to mention the Bush administration , when talking about the wars or the economy or the regulatory environment that helped lead to the oil spill .
I give you that same show , two weeks prior .
June 9 , 2010 : STEVE DOOCY : Explain what happened during the Clinton administration that impacted what is going on right now in the Gulf .
DICK MORRIS : Congress , at President Clinton 's urging , passed legislation exempting the oil companies from any payment to the government for royalties for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico ... it's why we had all this new drilling in the Gulf .
STEVE DOOCY : Right , it started under Clinton .
Do you realize this shit is being broadcast and recorded ???
So everything bad that happened during the Bush administration was Bill Clinton 's fault !
And now , everything bad during the Obama administration ... is Bill Clinton 's fault !
Who ... by the way , was played by John Travolta in Primary Colors , who was in Carrie with Piper Laurie , who was in The Faculty with Jon Stewart ... who ... is banging Kevin Bacon .
Women were being discouraged , even intimidated .
Porter was shocked .
For decades Melbourne had been the diocese most supportive of women priests , and the issue seemed long resolved .
But now , in the Anglican Church and in others , it seems to be a divisive issue once again , with a backlash unleashed and gaining ground .
The question is broader than whether women can be priests and exercise leadership over men , though that is usually how it is framed inside the church .
It concerns all the roles women play in the church and in the
home , where the once - traditional idea that they should submit to their husbands is gaining fresh traction .
This is being re-examined in churches around Australia : Anglican , Baptist , Lutheran , Pentecostal and others .
Porter says the change in Melbourne and elsewhere is due to a rising number of hard - line young Melbourne ministers who are strongly influenced by resurgent conservatism in the United States .
She says they are " very masculine and horrified by what they call the ' chickification ' of Christianity " .
According to Kevin Giles , a Melbourne evangelical minister and veteran of the fight for women 's equality within the church , the issue is " about power — who has it and who does n't , who determines how the Scriptures should be read " .
Those who support the " headship " doctrine are called complementarians .
They say women and men are created equal in value but with different roles , in which leadership is reserved for men .
The biblical text they rely on is Paul 's first letter to Timothy , which says : " A woman should learn in quietness and full submission .
I do not permit a woman to teach or have authority over a man ; she must be silent . "
The pro-equality group argues that these verses have a specific context and are not a permanent mandate .
They rely on texts such as Paul 's letter to the Galatians : " There is neither Jew nor Greek , slave nor free , male nor female , for you are all one in Christ . "
This group , who call themselves egalitarians , argue that ministry is based on abilities and not gender .
According to Giles , the debate is not about whether women can " minister " .
He says : " Everyone is in favour of women 's ministry , because that can be anything — even making tea .
The real key is leadership , headship .
The debate is full of code words , but unpacked it means men lead , women obey . "
Giles and his wife , Lynley , a noted marriage educator , are sufficiently concerned that they have organised the annual international conference of Christians for Biblical Equality in Melbourne this weekend .
Founded in the US in 1988 , the group claims it has members from 100 denominations in 70 countries .
Kevin Giles blames the increasingly confident assertion of headship doctrine on the influence of the Sydney diocese — Australia 's largest and most powerful , and a staunch advocate of headship — and the Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students , which is influential in universities around the nation .
" It 's a minority , but it 's a vocal , strong , able minority which does a lot of good work in other areas . "
Modern technology is also playing a significant role in emboldening conservatives to stand against women joining the threefold ministry of deacon , priest and bishop .
Important American evangelical leaders such as Mark Driscoll and John Piper are instantly accessible through their podcasts and blogs , which thousands of people around the world download every day .
Driscoll , of Mars Hill Church in Seattle , wants more testosterone in the church .
He complains that the church has produced " chickified " men .
" Sixty per cent of Christians are chicks , and the 40 per cent that are dudes are still sort of chicks . "
In a famous 2006 sermon , he said real men avoid the church because it projects a hippie , queer Christ , whereas men want the " ultimate fighting Jesus " .
According to Cheryl Catford , a Churches of Christ minister who has researched the issue , Driscoll would never have had the influence 20 years ago that he has now .
Catford , who is a speaker at this weekend 's conference , has researched attitudes to gender roles among Pentecostals ( churches such as Hillsong that in America are called evangelical ) .
Paradoxically , such churches often have glamorous women in the pulpit while at the same time teaching that women must be subordinate .
She says many young women are not even attempting to get into Christian ministry .
" If they can get in they can't express their gifts in the fullest extreme , and sometimes run up against neo-Calvinism .
So a lot of younger women are going off and doing their own things . "
Among Anglicans , the young women bearing the brunt of opposition are reluctant to say much because they are told that to highlight disagreement within the church would hinder spreading the gospel .
Hannah Craven , who is training for the priesthood at Parkville 's Ridley College — the institution that trains evangelical Anglican candidates for ordination and is at the centre of the renewed debate in Melbourne — says she has noticed the trend both at Ridley and in the wider church .
" It 's one of those things people are afraid to bring up publicly , and you have the sense it 's happening under the radar .
You hear a group of people met and talked . "
Craven feels strongly supported by her own church , St Hilary 's in Kew , but even so she is not unscathed .
" From my perspective , it 's more that sense that God 's called you to do something , and you are striving to be faithful and obedient , yet know that a lot of people believe that in the process you are being disobedient and ungodly .
And you have to take that seriously , and can't help but find that discouraging .
It creates uncertainty . "
Megan Curlis - Gibson , a young minister at St Hilary 's , agrees .
" I 've had people decide not to come because I 'm preaching , or tell me why what I 'm doing is wrong .
It 's just a conversation for them , but I 'm sitting there defending my entire career .
The implication is that I 'm disobeying God in everything I do . "
RIDLEY College principal Peter Adam , a complementarian , believes that Christians can hold either view with a clear conscience .
He concedes that the issue has become a source of tension among students , but so are other matters , such as infant baptism .
Nevertheless , he says , the women 's issue is " very delicate .
There are a number of political undercurrents going on in the diocese of Melbourne over this issue at the moment .
There 's a rumour going around that Ridley is lobbying the diocese to stop ordaining women , which has no truth at all . "
Adam 's policy is not to stifle debate .
" For the broader welfare of the church , I think it 's better not to take sides in a way that precludes others or denies them their rights to participate in the diocese . "
Ridley 's written policy is to welcome and provide equal training for male and female students , and accept a variety of views on the roles of men and women in ministry and leadership — the same policy as the Melbourne diocese and , indeed , the Anglican Church of Australia .
Leading advocates of headship believe egalitarians are overstating the problem .
Ridley lecturer Rhys Bezzant , a leader of the Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students in Melbourne , says the group makes " an easy whipping boy " .
" The issue is n't front and centre on Melbourne campuses .
There would be staff who hold a variety of views , and students and student leaders .
AFES is not nearly as monochrome as people want to suggest , " he says .
Healesville minister TimAnderson , a leader among younger evangelicals who want to limit women 's ministry , says he does not argue with the same stridency as the case is argued in Sydney , and that he respects other people 's views .
" I believe women should n't be in charge of churches or preaching to mixed congregations .
Within the scope of a large church like St Hilary 's , with a decent - sized ministry team , there 's a range of roles
God calls women to that they can fulfil very well , but I would n't include being senior minister or regular preacher . "
But women 's ministry is far less significant to him than , say , the consecration of a lesbian as bishop in the US last month , or Christians who minimise the importance of Jesus Christ .
" When there 's stuff like that on the radar , it 's not helpful to get wound up about secondary matters . "
Anderson says pro-women 's ordination advocates such as Kevin Giles and Muriel Porter expected that after women were ordained in 1992 , opposition would fall away and that opponents would gradually retire or change their minds as they encountered women doing a good job .
" That was their hope , so it 's with considerable alarm that they see this is n't happening , " he says .
He 's right that Porter is alarmed .
She says the problem is serious , especially as the Melbourne diocese has from the first been a leader in the fight for women 's equality in the church .
It was Melbourne that in 1976 called on the national church to do whatever was needed to ordain women — Melbourne evangelicals , unlike their Sydney counterparts , were strongly supportive — and Melbourne was among the first to ordain women in 1992 , a move approved by 90 per cent of the synod .
But evangelicalism today is shaped more by Sydney 's Moore College , and it is these evangelicals , who teach subordination of women , whose churches are the fastest growing .
Today , Melbourne has 524 Anglican male priests and 106 women .
Half of Ridley 's students are women , and they make up 31 per cent of candidates for ordination .
Porter notes that while many liberal women priests have been elected to represent Melbourne at the Australian synod this year , there will not be one evangelical woman priest .
She says evangelical women are not being promoted or encouraged by their side of the political divide .
Porter says these evangelicals think women should be subordinate everywhere , but they have lost the battle in wider society .
People would laugh , she says , if anyone suggested women should not be MPs , judges or chief executives .
Family and church are the only remaining spheres where these evangelicals can be influential .
Porter says if evangelicals understood their history , they would advocate an equal role for women in church because feminism has an evangelical heritage .
" It came out of Bible believing women in the US in the 19th century who wanted to fight for the freedom of the slaves , and were told they could n't speak because they were women . "
So Porter is steeling herself for battle once more .
" I 'm heartbroken that this reaction has emerged , and sad that I and my friends have to take up this cause again that we thought was safely accomplished .
And we will take it up again .
We are not simply going to acquiesce in the undoing of 25 years of our life 's work . "
The International Christians for Biblical Equality Conference will be held tomorrow to Monday at the Jasper Hotel in Elizabeth Street , Melbourne .

As Karl Burkart at Mother Nature Network says , if Anderson Cooper is ticked off , something must really be wrong .
COOPER : There is this yellow line up there .
And they literally will not get you within 20 to 30 feet , where you can actually get a picture of an oiled bird being brought in .
Why ?
They say they do n't want to upset the birds , and they do n't want to interfere with workers .
But , I mean , I can assure you , one cameraman is a trained professional at CNN , and they 're not going to interfere with workers .
As -- as for BP , they have promised transparency on a number of occasions .
Most recently was a letter that we just obtained yesterday .
It was actually sent out a couple days ago .
And , in the letter -- it is from BP Doug -- COO Doug Suttles -- they say -- quote -- " BP has not and will not prevent anyone working in the cleanup operation from sharing his or her own experiences or opinions with the media . "
That 's from , as I said , BP's Doug Suttles to company employees and contractors .
Now , the " has not " part , that they have n't done this , is patently false .
I mean , that 's a rewriting of history .
Many reporters from many news organizations over many weeks have been blocked and stiff - armed and given the silent treatment or told flat - out , BP said we would lose our jobs if we talked .
And this is n't just one news organization .
This has been going on for weeks .
As for the " will " not part , that they 're not going to prevent anyone from cooperating with the media , well , maybe not everyone has gotten the memo .
We put it to the test today .
Karl 's post suggests this goes beyond the possibility of simply covering for BP , though .
While he's not revealing specifics , he refers to a text message he received from a friend in the cleanup zone :
At first I thought it was because the government was somehow backing for BP , supporting them in their attempt to keep the story from getting out of hand .
Now I ’m not so sure ...
This afternoon I received a text message sent on a borrowed phone from someone who had recently returned form [ sic ] the cleanup operation .
The contents of that message were so mind - numbingly horrific that I cannot publish them here .
I am earnestly attempting to confirm what I was told , and I will be tweeting about my findings on @greendig .
If true , it would explain WHY the government wo n’t let even the New York Times fly over the original site of Deepwater Horizon .
And it would also explain why Obama has done a 180 on his policy of government transparency , risking his entire political career by deceiving the American people .
Now Karl is a pretty level - headed blogger .
He does n't routinely don a tinfoil hat and start writing about undisclosed text messages that appear to be harbingers of doom , or worse .
So I 'm inclined to take him seriously , and am watching to see if he receives confirmation of what he suspects .
All I can say is this : I hope whatever it is that has him so concerned is n't related to that munitions dump due west of the Deepwater Horizon .
Because it would explain a lot , if it does .
THE Opposition Leader , Tony Abbott , seemed to misread the mood of his audience yesterday when he began talking politics and criticising the government 's mining tax at an Italian National Day celebration .
Despite the three state and federal politicians who spoke before him talking about the contribution Italians had made to society , Mr Abbott could not resist a dig at the federal government 's proposed mining tax .

'' The Italians of this country understand that it 's very important to make a living through business and I just ask this question of this perceptive , culturally sophisticated audience , '' he said .
'' How many of you would be in business for 6 per cent ?
Not very many . ''
At this point , many in the 500 - strong audience became agitated , murmuring among themselves that their guest was using the event to play politics .
Mark Webb has issued a plea for unity © Getty Images Enlarge
Mark Webber has urged Red Bull to learn from its experiences in Turkey and remain united as the battle with McLaren heats up .
Webber collided with team - mate Sebastian Vettel while fighting for the lead of the Turkish Grand Prix , resulting in considerable friction between the drivers after the race .
Red Bull 's advisor Helmut Marko , who has overseen much of Vettel 's progress in the junior ranks , came out in favour of his protégé and blamed Webber for not leaving enough space .
In the aftermath there were several reports claiming " civil war " had broken out at Red Bull , but Webber has put the tensions down to the team 's inexperience and said it would quickly learn from the incident and move on .
" If you look back after it has all happened , you of course want to handle things a whole lot differently , " he said in a video on Red Bull 's website .
" We are in uncharted waters with both of us leading the championship and both of us at the front in the race .
The team , collectively with the drivers , has to learn what to do in these sorts of situations , maybe better in the future .
That 's all we can probably learn from it . "
He added that it was crucial that Red Bull remained united as it faced a very serious threat from more established teams like McLaren .
" People have to remember that we are a very young team , " he said .
" To take McLaren on week - in - week - out is not an easy task , but one that Red Bull is hungry for and we 've proven that we will fight them hard .
So it 's a feather in our cap on one side but on the other side we are still learning .
Unfortunately in Turkey I think we learnt in a way that was n't the best way , but teams like Ferrari and McLaren have had these days and they know how tough it can be when you have some adversity .
We need to bounce back and be united as a team , and keep going . "
He said that he would personally deal with the incident by continuing to push as hard as possible .
" I 'll just keep doing my best , that 's all I can do .
I like to believe that I try not to leave too much left and give 100 % from myself .
That 's what it is about at this level , to get the absolute maximum out of every session and every single race .
So far it 's been going really well , obviously Turkey was a bit of a speed hump in our programme , but we 've all had tougher days .
I certainly have had tougher days in the past so I will bounce back from this and we press on .
" Both McLaren drivers and Fernando [ Alonso ] are still there [ challenging us ] .
Ferrari had a tough day in Turkey but there are still hundreds of points to go and I 'm just keeping my feet on the ground and thinking about Canada now .
We need to work on the top speed of the car - whether it's with the F - duct or working with the aerodynamics - so that we are quicker at some other venues coming up in the championship . "

The former president of the now - dissolved activist group ACORN struck back at Republicans , Democrats and even the Obama Administration Thursday after a federal report cleared the organization of misusing federal funds and election fraud .
In an exclusive interview with Raw Story — her first public remarks since the reportÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s release — ACORN ’s Bertha Lewis said the findings of the Government Accountability Office proves the withering criticism against ACORN Ã‚Â that all but shuttered the group was an orchestrated right wing attack against the poor .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ This was a McCarthy - era style war against the poor and minorities , nothing more , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  the group ’s former leader told Raw Story .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ This proves the right will resort to anything to maintain power to continue the war on poor black and brown people , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  she added .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Glen Beck and Rush Limbaugh can call me a racist all they want to , Ã¢â‚ ¬ Â  she said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ But there is no way there was not a racial element and class element to this whole attack .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
She also hinted that the favorable report might serve as a catalyst for a reincarnation of the group , founded in 1970 to advocate for better housing , jobs , and healthcare for working families .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Some new organization will be continuing the mission , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  she said .
Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It might not be exactly the same .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ But we will be back , ” she said referring to now defunct local chapters of the organization that may re-emerge under different names .
The GAO found in a report released Tuesday that nearly $ 40 million in contracts awarded ACORN by a myriad of federal agencies was spent properly .
The report also revealed that the group had not violated any federal campaign laws related to voter registration , an oft repeated claim of the right wing media critics like Beck and Limbaugh .
The report was commissioned by Congress as both parties voted to ban federal funding for the group after selectively edited videos were released depicting ACORN employees counseling two right - wing provocateurs posing as a college student and a prostitute .
ADVERTISEMENT
The ban was later ruled unconstitutional .
But the report comes too late , Lewis said , to completely salvage the reputation of the organization that was relentlessly attacked by conservative commentators like Beck as corrupt .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ You get upset and angry about the unfairness of this , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  she said of the onslaught of negative publicity from the videos that were criticized as being heavily edited .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ This is just the 21st century version of high - tech lynching .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Lewis laid some of the blame for the groupÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s demise on the lack of support from Democrats and progressives , who she said failed to support the group and voted for the funding ban .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ It just pisses me off that the right can get away with attacks on the organization while the left and progressives just stood by and did nothing to defend us .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
The report bolsters her argument that entire campaign was to neutralize the groupÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s efforts to register poor and minority voters , Lewis said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ When we began to register poor people to vote we became an issue , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s when the Republicans started coming after us , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â she continued .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Remember , weÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve been accused of stealing the election for Obama .
Ã¢â‚¬Â 
Key to reviving the groupÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s mission is a lawsuit currently on appeal in federal court arguing the ban on funding was unconstitutional .
ADVERTISEMENT
Lewis said the ban amounts to a Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ bill of attainderÃ¢â‚ ¬Â when a legislature accuses a group or a person of crime without the benefit of a trial .
Ã‚Â
The constitution specifically bans the practice , and a federal judge recently ruled in ACORNÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s favor granting a temporary injunction of the ban .
The ban has effectively prevented former associates of ACORN from applying for federal funding .
Ã‚Â IfÃ‚Â not overturned , similar bans could be aimed at other activist groups .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ If this is allowed to stand , a politician could get a government ban on a person or group and single them out .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Lewis was also critical of the Obama administration ’s continued effort to fight the lawsuit by filing appeals .
ADVERTISEMENT
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s politics pure and simple , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  she said .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ TheyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re scared .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
A hearing is scheduled on the Justice DepartmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s appeal June 24 in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York .
MOSCOW , June 11 ( Reuters ) – Russia ’s parliament on Friday voted to boost the powers of the successor to the Soviet KGB , allowing it to summon people it believes are about to commit a crime and threaten jail for those who disobey its orders .
Rights groups said the proposed regulations could be used by the FSB security service to detain opposition activists and independent journalists and undermine President Dmitry Medvedev ’s promises to foster civil rights .
" It ’s a step toward a police state , " said Vladimir Ulas , a member of the opposition Communist Party .
" It is effectively a ban on any real opposition activity . "
What in the world has happened to the United States of America ?
Once upon a time , young boys and girls across this great land of ours could set up little lemonade stands and make a little bit of extra cash without fear of being raided by the cops .
But those days are apparently gone .
In the town of Tulare , California one little 7 - year - old girl recently had her lemonade stand shut down by authorities because she did not have the proper business permits .
So what in the world are authorities doing running around shutting down lemonade stands for ?
Do n’t they have anything better to do ?
After all , if your car is stolen these days you are very fortunate if you can even get a cop to come out to the scene .
But apparently stopping a little girl from raising money so that she can go to Disneyland is a top priority in the town of Tulare .
So now what is this little 7 - year - old girl supposed to think about trying to live the American Dream ?
This is yet another example of how far America has fallen .
Once upon a time our system of free enterprise greatly rewarded those who take initiative , but today ’s version of “ capitalism ” is all about permits and lawyers and corporations and making it next to impossible for the “ little guy ” to rise up and make a go of things .
The following is a video news report about the ordeal that the authorities in Tulare have put this little girl through … .
So did the authorities have any legitimate reasons for shutting down the lemonade stand that the little girl was running ?
Well , yes .
The lemonade stand was positioned near a very , very busy intersection and there was the possibility that it could have caused an accident .
But there is a reason why the story of this little girl is resonating so profoundly with so many people .
It is because our society has become structured in such a way that it is becomes increasingly difficult for our young people to make it in this world .
In a piece recently published on MSN Money , journalist Joe Queenan described the environment that 2010 college graduates are being thrown into as they enter the real world ….
They will enter an economy where roughly 17 % of people aged 20 through 24 do not have a job , and where two million college graduates are unemployed .
They will enter a world where they will compete tooth and nail for jobs as waitresses , pizza delivery men , file clerks , bouncers , trainee busboys , assistant baristas , interns at bodegas .
Today our young people are saddled with record amounts of student loan debt , and when they graduate they enter a world that contains very few prospects for them .
At a time when so many graduating college students should be optimistic about an unlimited future , they are instead having to deal with the pressure of severely reduced expectations .
One of our readers recently left a comment that expresses this sentiment incredibly well .
The truth is that it is hard to be optimistic about the future when the U.S. economy is crumbing to pieces all around you ….

Concerned Reader :
I read this forum all the time and I am a 21 - year - old college student myself .
Frankley I do no see much employment opprotunities available right now .
The counsoulers at my high school always told us to get in to the “ Med - ED ” professions because that was where all the jobs are currently being made .
But with this healthcare bill being passed I forsee the collapse of our hospital industry which means no medical jobs for college graduates .
The same goes for education , most teachers quit within the first year of employment and with the ever growing number of high school drop outs and illiterate students there just does not seem that much of a lucrative buisness .
The same goes for engineering and software employment .
Because of the large abundance of Chinese and Indian labor tech firms and aircraft enginnering companies would rather hire these foreign students becuase they have a better work ethic and they have no liabilities unlike the American graduates .
These guys will work harder for less money and their presecence impedes American students from gainig employment status .
As for myself , I am not sure what to go to college for any way .
My funds are nearly depleted and my father wants me to take out student loans to continue my education .
I constantly argue with him becasue I know that the student loan industry is just another big bank scheme such as credit cards and home loans .
I told him I might as well take out a loan on a $ 300,000 house and max out three or four credit cards rather than take out student loans .
I will benefit in the long run if I do not take student loans .
There are several reasons why tutition is skyrocketing .
First is the growing demand for limited space in the colleges .
Thousands of people are applying to colleges in an attempt to keep up with the jones and any one from high school graduates to middle aged people and retirees are joining in record numbers .
Secondly , you take a local or state university and they have to have all kinds of bells and whistles in regards to sports .
They have to have huge stadiums and tracks and what not .
This stuff costs money , both for the college and the sponsors who charge the university .
The bills for this stuff are then redistributed towards the students in higher tuition bills .

It would be nice if we all could tell “ Concerned Reader ” that this is only a temporary downturn and that things are going to be better than ever very soon , but that is not the truth .
The truth is that we are witnessing the early stages of the complete and total collapse of the U.S. financial and economic systems .
We have squandered the great wealth our forefathers left us , we have dismantled our once great manufacturing base , we have shipped millions of our jobs overseas and we have piled up the biggest mountain of debt in the history of the world .
So our economic future looks bleak to say the least .
Fortunately , there is much more than money to live our lives for .
We are moving into what will be one of the most chaotic times in human history , but it will also be filled with some of the greatest opportunities to make a difference .
So for those who consider their lives to be defined by what they own and by how much money they have , a whole lot of disappointment is coming .
But for those who are looking for meaning , purpose and adventure , the times in which we now live are perfect .
It is during the darkest times that the true lights shine the brightest .
When it is your time to shine make the most of it .
I would like to say a big thank you for the professional looking books you supplied .
We had our book launch on Saturday and everyone who purchased the book , love the professional look , the quality printing and photos and beautiful binding .

Photos from the Italian Front How the Nazis Used War Rubble as Propaganda
As the Allies marched inexorably northward through Italy during World War II , the Nazis set to work photographing the rubble of damaged historical buildings and artwork .
The images were supposed to prove that their enemies were cultural barbarians .
Thousands turned out to protest racial discrimination against Palestinians the other day — and with good reason .
The long - suffering Palestinians face armed soldiers at the gate if they try to leave their camps .
They are frozen out of public medical and social services .
They are barred from dignified work in dozens of occupations such as engineering , medicine , law and journalism .
They can not own property .
Their children are banned from regular schools .
If it looks like apartheid and sounds like apartheid , let 's march against it .
. .
Except . . .
I 'm not referring to the quest by Queers Against Israeli Apartheid ( QuAIA ) to hijack Toronto 's Pride Parade over the weekend .
While QuAIA and its fellow travellers issue righteous ( if wrong - headed ) denunciations of the Jewish state , Palestinian protestors in Beirut are targeting “ apartheid ” closer to home .
Some 6,000 Palestinians marched on the Lebanese parliament late last month to protest their discriminatory treatment — not at the hands of Israel , but by Lebanon itself .
As Lebanese columnist Rami G. Khouri noted last week , the treatment of these Palestinians — like “ penned - in animals ” — must be condemned as a “ lingering moral black mark . ”
Writing in the Daily Star of Beirut , Khouri argued that “ Lebanon faces a moment akin to . . . when South Africans seriously mooted changing their apartheid system in the 1980s . ”
Aha — apartheid alert !
Perhaps we 'll see a Queers Against Lebanese Apartheid protest at next year 's Pride Parade ?
As Gaza - born journalist Ahmed Moor wrote in the Guardian last month , “ the Arab world is rife with hypocrisy when it comes to the Palestinian issue . ”
His conclusion , from Beirut : “ They are second - class citizens here . ”
In fact , he 's quite wrong .
Palestinians are not second - class citizens for the simple reason that they are pointedly ineligible for citizenship in Lebanon , whether first - or second - class .
Lebanon 's politicians , always wary of upsetting the country 's delicate sectarian balance , have preferred to ghettoize their 300,000 Palestinian refugees in camps while righteously railing against Israel to take them back .
Six decades later , generations of Lebanese - born Palestinian refugees who have never seen Haifa — and probably never will — remain fodder for the world 's debating societies and protest marches .
Belatedly , a proposal to be debated by Lebanon 's parliament later this month would let Palestinians own an apartment and get hospitalization for work - related accidents — while retaining the ban on employment in major professions .
Not all countries in the Middle East are equally prejudiced against Palestinians .
Jordan grants them full citizenship , without falling for the intellectually corrupt trap of claiming that a passport precludes their right of return to Palestine .
Syria grants them full residency rights , though not citizenship .
Egypt does neither .
Israel , for the record , grants full citizenship , legal and language rights to Arabs ( including gay Arabs ) within its borders — notwithstanding attempts to conflate Israel proper with the West Bank and Gaza when using the apartheid label .
To be sure , decades of occupation have degraded Palestinians and dragged down Israel .
But occupation is not racial segregation , despite the superficial similarities .
I remember when the notorious Glenn Babb , South Africa 's ambassador to Canada during its apartheid era , paraded around reserves condemning our discriminatory treatment of status Indians .
Babb was smearing us with sophistry back then , so why stoop to using his misleading tactics now against Israel ?
Unless one really believes Canada is also an apartheid state .
As for the quirky cause of Queers Against Israeli Apartheid , they have seen the enemy and the enemy is gay - friendly Israel : the QuAIA website falsely claims that “ Israel 's apartheid system extends gay rights only to some , based on race ” while blithely giving a free pass to Arab regimes that extend gay rights to no one — such as Hamas in Gaza , the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank , Egypt , Jordan , Syria , Lebanon , Saudi Arabia and others .
I 'M ALL FOR FREE SPEECH , so I 'm waiting for QuAIA to take its quixotic crusade against Israel to the Santa Claus Parade ( the Jewish state discriminates against Christmas ? ) , and to demand a float in the St. Patrick 's Day Parade ( let 's see if the archdiocese offers them a spot ) .
Word is , however , that QuAIA is not seeking a float on the next Freedom Flotilla to Gaza , lest the gay - friendly Israeli army ( yes , homosexuals can serve ) waves them through and the Toronto protestors find themselves in the arms of Hamas enforcers .
The QuAIA website declares , “ There is no pride in apartheid , and QuAIA is dedicated to fighting it wherever it exists ” — even though it turns a blind eye to Lebanese - style apartheid or pan-Arab homophobia .
There 's a word for that kind of selective morality .
I would n't call it anti-Semitism or hateful , though it goes beyond hypocritical .
It 's hutzpah .
Martin Regg Cohn writes Tuesday .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Goldman Sachs Group
Inc could not function as a market maker if it was a fiduciary , President and Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn said on Tuesday .
People walk outside the Goldman Sachs headquarters , also known by its address as 200 West Street , in New York 's lower Manhattan , April 7 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid / Files
Executives from the bank , which is facing civil fraud charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , faced questions two weeks ago from a Senate panel in Washington about Goldman ’s role in the subprime mortgage crisis .
That panel discussed whether Goldman Sachs was conflicted in selling securities to clients and then shorting those securities .
Cohn , Goldman ’s second - in - command , did not testify before the Senate panel , but at the conference on Tuesday in New York he defended Goldman Sachs ’ role as a market maker .
He said the bank needs to be able to offset risks related to market making , in which it offers prices for sometimes illiquid securities that may not have both buyers and sellers .
Markets would not work if market - makers were fiduciaries , he said .
Goldman shares have tumbled more than 20 percent since the SEC accused the bank on April 16 of failing to tell investors who bought risky debt tied to subprime mortgages that hedge fund manager John Paulson helped select the underlying portfolio for the security and was shorting the deal .
The firm is also being investigated by the Justice Department , according to a source and is facing shareholder lawsuits .
Separately , Cohn said Goldman Sachs is seeing the beginnings of a slow pickup in mergers and acquisitions activity , even as the economic environment remains uncertain .
Markets are likely to remain volatile in the short term as investors digest the significance of the Greek bailout .
Expected reform of the U.S. banking system is also contributing to uncertainty , Cohn added .
Goldman Sachs is broadly in favor of efforts to reform the financial system , he said , noting the bank supports plans to increase exchange trading and clearing of derivatives , among other measures being discussed by lawmakers .
The bank is aiming to adapt quickly to regulatory changes , he said .
Goldman said on Monday it continued its trading momentum in the first quarter of 2010 , reporting zero days of trading losses , the first time it had an entire quarter with no losing days .
Goldman had 35 days in which its traders posted revenues of more than $ 100 million in the first quarter .
NDP MP Bill Siksay ’s trans rights bill passed second reading in the House of Commons on June 8 after the government declined to take a recorded vote on the issue .
“ It is going to committee , and I feel great , ” says Siksay .
“ It ’s taken a long time — it ’s been six years of work by lots of folks across Canada , lots of activists , lots of people took personal initiatives , and it ’s very exciting that we ’ve reached this spot . ”
Siksay ’s C-389 would add gender identity and gender expression as prohibited grounds of discrimination to the Canadian Human Rights Act .
The private member ’s bill would also amend the hate crime and sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code .
On June 8 , MPs from all three opposition parties rose in support of the bill , while the parliamentary secretary for the minister of justice , Daniel Petit , gave the government position that the bill was unnecessary because trans people are already protected from gender - based discrimination in existing laws .
Speaking for the Liberals , gay MP Mario Silva quoted imprisoned Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi , saying “ Please use your freedom to promote ours . ”
Silva ’s message was of human rights , saying no minority was too small to be denied the protection of the law .
Also speaking for the Liberals was Vancouver Centre MP Hedy Fry , who related her experiences as a physician as to the physical and psychological costs of discrimination .
Fry also noted that because gender identity is a medical diagnosis , it entitled trans people to full healthcare under the Canada Health Act , which was also why this bill was necessary .
Speaking for the Bloc Quebecois , MP Nicole Demers related her own experiences facing discrimination , having married a black man in 1970 .
Not only did the priest refuse to marry them because he did n’t want “ mulatto children ” in his parish , but she says her husband had difficulty finding work or housing because he sounded Quebecois on the phone , and the jobs or apartments were always “ filled ” when he came in person .
“ What I said came from my own experience , ” Demers says .
“ I know that it ’s very difficult sometimes for people who live different situations than the situations that we live , to be able to go forward in life because people are stopping them from doing them because of prejudice . ”
Demers feels that enforced gender norms are part of the problem , and she relates with horror the plight of children born with both sexes , whom doctors assign a gender to .
“ They should never do that because the children have to decide for themselves what they ’re going to be later on in life , ” Demers says .
“ The time has come to make sure that everybody can be respected and can have their rights respected . ”
Demers notes that the Bloc fully supports the bill .
Also speaking for the NDP were Libby Davies and Jim Maloway .
Observing the debate in the public gallery was Ottawa trans activist Joanne Law .
“ Awesome presentations — it was just great , ” Law says .
“ The guy from the Conservative party was a little on the different side , but that ’s the politics of change . ”
“ This is almost like a lifetime ’s worth of work , so I feel very rewarded and fulfilled right now , ” says trans activist Susan Gapka , who was also in the gallery .
“ This is a step toward full , enumerated and specific equality for transgendered and transsexual people in Canada , and I ’m honoured to have been part of that . ”
The bill now heads to the Commons justice committee , where it must be dealt with within 60 sitting days .
“ We have to find out that timing , then we have to figure out exactly what the committee needs to hear in terms of an initial presentation , because the person whose bill it is gets to do that , ” Siksay says .
“ There ’s lots of work to be done now that we ’ve reached this point , which is great .
It was also mentioned in debate that the bill needs to go to committee so that Parliament could hear directly from trans people .
“ Trans people have n’t been able to stand in the House and say ‘ This is how this affects my life , and this is what this would mean to my life , ' ” says Siksay .
Gapka looks forward to that opportunity .
“ We ’re really eager to get to committee to share those human stories on why this is incredibly important for people like myself and others across Canada . ”
The Shirt Says on the Front : Yup , I 'm a Racist On the Back : if the Government Says so Because ...
I support the Constitution I support Free Speech I support the Right to Bear Arms I support the Bill of Rights I support Capitalism I support NO Government Bailouts I support closing the border I support the Military I support the Tea Party I support Jesus Christ as My Savior .
This apparently passes for Irony in Tea Party World .
Somehow , just like Alanis Morisette , I do not think they know what that word means .
This list is not why anyone in the Tea Party was ever associated with or accused of bigotry or racism - this is ...
This ...
This ...
And this ...
And specifically THIS ...
When the reality is that what Obama did with the Stock Market after George W. Bush Crashed it was THIS ...
What I have n't seen is anyone in the Tea Party denounce this kind of imagery as inappropriate and bigoted .
They clearly think it 's JUST FINE !
Rather than call this stuff out , they rather pretend " Oh , it just a few guys OVER THERE " it was n't ME - I did n't hold that sign up , I just stood right next to the guy who did , then whine and play the Victim Card for their not so tacit endorsement of this stuff , which is actually what this new set of Silly T - Shirts are really all about .
Racism comes from people like Mark Williams , who happens to be the leader of the Tea Party Express , who openly says that " Muslim 's are Animals " .
And from their GOP Rank and File , even before he was Elected you got Stupid Stupid Crap like this ...
The fact is that people who support Barack Obama also support the Constitution , including Article 1 which includes the power of the Congress to pass the Laws , and Article 2 which outlines the Powers and Responsibilities of the Presidency - which includes enforcing the Laws , even when he does n't agree with them or like them .
( Unlike Bush who just ignored the Laws he did n't like )
After the Supreme Court 's Heller decision ( which is briefly mentioned in the first video ) which established the Right to Bear Arms as a Constitutional Right , there is n't much that the President or Congress Could Possibly do to take people 's " Guns Away " , not that he 's ever suggested any such thing .
It 's interesting to note what that shirt does n't support - the 13th Amendment which Abolished Slavery ( almost ) , the 14th Amendment which guaranteed the equal protection of the laws to all persons within the jurisdiction of the state - regardless of whether they are citizens or how they arrived in that jurisdiction ( even Gitmo Detainees )
Sure , the first and second amendments are great , but what about the 4th Amendment protection against illegal search and seizures ?
What about the 5th Amendment Right against Self - Incrimination ?
What about the 8th Amendment protection from Cruel and Unusual Punishment ?
I did n't see any Tea Partiers with big " George W. Bush is a NAZI signs " when he was sanctioning illegal wiretaps ( which violates the 4th and 5th ) and torture ( which violates the 8th Amendment ) now did I ?
I did n't see any Tea Partiers when Bush cut taxes for people who did n't need their taxes cut and turned the budget surplus into the greatest deficit we 've ever had ?
I did n't see any Tea Partiers with " George W. Bush is a Communist / Socials / Muslim " when he sent thousands of our soldiers to die in the Iraq War based on a pack of lies generated by ignorance , stubbornness ( even after we were specifically TOLD Saddam had destroyed his weapons stockpiles ) , bribery ( Curveball ) , torture ( al Libi ) and forgeries ( Niger ) .
There are some legitimate policy issues and leadership issues to criticize Obama for , specifically his far too hands off attitude with BP and the spill cleanup , his aggressive prosecution of Whistleblowers for merely revealing Bush Administration malfeasance and failure to followup on Bush War Crimes - but when President Barack Obama implements the Bailout that Bush Crafted , then manages to actually make a profit doing it by keeping a close eye ( certainly closer than Sec. Paulsen wanted ) on Wall Street ...
The Troubled Asset Relief Program has reached a significant milestone :
The amount of TARP funds paid back to the federal government has surpassed the amount that remains outstanding .
Through the end of May , $ 194 billion in TARP funds had been repaid , compared with $ 190 billion in TARP funds still owed to the government .
The completion of the Treasury Department ’s sale of 1.5 billion shares of Citigroup , which provided $ 6.2 billion in gross proceeds to taxpayers , was the deal that put repayments ahead of outstanding TARP funds .
Taxpayers also have received $ 23 billion from dividends , interest and other income through TARP , the program that was created in 2008 to bail out the financial system , but also has been used to prop up corporations like General Motors and Chrysler .

More money has been paid back than is owed - bizjournals :
When 40 % of the Obama Stimulus Bill included Tax Cuts for the Working Middle Class and Small Businesses , when the Budget Deficit actually came down by $ 400 Billion during his first year , when he manages to do what he can to actually support the Right to Living with a Health Care proposal that requires people to show Personal Responsibility by carrying their own Health Insurance instead of mooching and making everyone else pay for their care in the Emergency Room , when he EXPANDS our Military Involvement in Afghanistan trying to block a safe haven from Al Qeada ( after Bush failed to do that for 9 years ) ... he gets called a Socialist Witchdoctor Nazi Communist Kenyan with a Bone Through His Nose ?!
The truth is the Tea Partiers Do n't Deserve to be called " Racist " - IMO that 's too good for 'em - they deserved to be called a Pack of Fracking Deluded Idiots !
Any confusion with Actual Racists , is merely a function of their Shared Rank Stupidity .
But do n't mind me using my still fully functioning Free Speech to say so .

ATTACK ON AMERICAN FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM
BACKGROUND -
The Powell Memorandum : When National Chamber Director Eugene B. Sydnor , Jr. , became chairman of our Education Committee , he discussed with his neighbor and long - time friend , Lewis F. Powell , Richmond attorney , ways to provide the public a more balanced view of the country 's economic system .
At Mr. Sydnor 's request , Mr. Powell , based on his broad experience as chairman of the Richmond City School Board , as well as the Virginia State Board of Education prepared a memorandum in which he incorporated a number of possible approaches .
The memorandum covered a broad range of educational and other activities for study and consideration by the National Chamber .
The memorandum was dated August 23 , 1971 , two months before Mr. Powell was nominated to become a member justice of the Supreme Court of the United States .
It has been under study and evaluation by Chamber officers and staff members .
Several of its approaches have been put into practice .
Others would require substantial new resources to carry out .
Recently , Jack Anderson , the syndicated columnist , wrote several columns discussing the memorandum .
Mr. Anderson obtained a copy of the memorandum without the knowledge or permission of the National Chamber .
Anyone reading the Powell memorandum will easily conclude that it objectively and fairly deals with a very real problem facing the free enterprise system .
To give all members of the National Chamber an opportunity to read the memorandum and to allow each to evaluate all the points raised , WASHINGTON REPORT presents the document in its entirety .
CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM
ATTACK OF AMERICAN FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM
DATE : August 23 , 1971
TO : Mr. Eugene B. Sydnor , Jr.
Chairman
Education Committee
U.S. Chamber of Commerce FROM : Lewis F. Powell , Jr.
This memorandum is submitted at your request as a basis for the discussion on August 24 with Mr. Booth ( executive vice president ) and others at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
The purpose is to identify the problem , and suggest possible avenues of action for further consideration .
Dimensions of the Attack
No thoughtful person can question that the American economic system is under broad attack .
1
This varies in scope , intensity , in the techniques employed , and in the level of visibility .
There always have been some who opposed the American system , and preferred socialism or some form of statism ( communism or fascism ) .
Also , there always have been critics of the system , whose criticism has been wholesome and constructive so long as the objective was to improve rather than to subvert or destroy .
But what now concerns us is quite new in the history of America .
We are not dealing with sporadic or isolated attacks from a relatively few extremists or even from the minority socialist cadre .
Rather , the assault on the enterprise system is broadly based and consistently pursued .
It is gaining momentum and converts .
Sources of the Attack
The sources are varied and diffused .
They include , not unexpectedly , the Communists , New Leftists and other revolutionaries who would destroy the entire system , both political and economic .
These extremists of the left are far more numerous , better financed , and increasingly are more welcomed and encouraged by other elements of society , than ever before in our history .
But they remain a small minority , and are not yet the principal cause for concern .
The most disquieting voices joining the chorus of criticism come from perfectly respectable elements of society : from the college campus , the pulpit , the media , the intellectual and literary journals , the arts and sciences , and from politicians .
In most of these groups the movement against the system is participated in only by minorities .
Yet , these often are the most articulate , the most vocal , the most prolific in their writing and speaking .
Moreover , much of the media - for varying motives and in varying degrees - either voluntarily accords unique publicity to these " attackers , " or at least allows them to exploit the media for their purposes .
This is especially true of television , which now plays such a predominant role in shaping the thinking , attitudes and emotions of our people .
One of the bewildering paradoxes of our time is the extent to which the enterprise system tolerates , if not participates in , its own destruction .
The campuses from which much of the criticism emanates are supported by ( i ) tax funds generated largely from American business , and ( ii ) contributions from capital funds controlled or generated by American business .
The boards of trustees of our universities overwhelmingly are composed of men and women who are leaders in the system .
Most of the media , including the national TV systems , are owned and theoretically controlled by corporations which depend upon profits , and the enterprise system to survive .
Tone of the Attack
This memorandum is not the place to document in detail the tone , character , or intensity of the attack .
The following quotations will suffice to give one a general idea :
William Kunstler , warmly welcomed on campuses and listed in a recent student poll as the " American lawyer most admired , " incites audiences as follows :
" You must leam to fight in the streets , to revolt , to shoot guns .
We will learn to do all of the things that property owners fear . "
2
The New Leftists who heed Kunstler 's advice increasingly are beginning to act -- not just against military recruiting offices and manufacturers of munitions , but against a variety of businesses :
" Since February , 1970 , branches ( of Bank of America ) have been attacked 39 times , 22 times with explosive devices and 17 times with fire bombs or by arsonists . "
3
Although New Leftist spokesmen are succeeding in radicalizing thousands of the young , the greater cause for concern is the hostility of respectable liberals and social reformers .
It is the sum total of their views and influence which could indeed fatally weaken or destroy the system .
A chilling description of what is being taught on many of our campuses was written by Stewart Alsop :
" Yale , like every other major college , is graduating scores of bright young men who are practitioners of ' the politics of despair . '
These young men despise the American political and economic system . . . ( their ) minds seem to be wholly closed .
They live , not by rational discussion , but by mindless slogans . "

A recent poll of students on 12 representative campuses reported that :
" Almost half the students favored socialization of basic U.S. industries . "
5
A visiting professor from England at Rockford College gave a series of lectures entitled " The Ideological War Against Western Society , " in which he documents the extent to which members of the intellectual community are waging ideological warfare against the enterprise system and the values of western society .
In a foreword to these lectures , famed Dr. Milton Friedman of Chicago warned :
" It ( is ) crystal clear that the foundations of our free society are under wide - ranging and powerful attack -- not by Communist or any other conspiracy but by misguided individuals parroting one another and unwittingly serving ends they would never intentionally promote . "
6
Perhaps the single most effective antagonist of American business is Ralph Nader who -- thanks largely to the media -- has become a legend in his own time and an idol of millions of Americans .
A recent article in Fortune speaks of Nader as follows :
" The passion that rules in him -- and he is a passionate man -- is aimed at smashing utterly the target of his hatred , which is corporate power .
He thinks , and says quite bluntly , that a great many corporate executives belong in prison -- for defrauding the consumer with shoddy merchandise , poisoning the food supply with chemical additives , and willfully manufacturing unsafe products that will maim or kill the buyer .
He emphasizes that he is not talking just about ' fly - by - night hucksters ' but the top management of blue chip business . "

A frontal assault was made on our government , our system of justice , and the free enterprise system by Yale Professor Charles Reich in his widely publicized book : " The Greening of America , " published last winter .
The foregoing references illustrate the broad , shotgun attack on the system itself .
There are countless examples of rifle shots which undermine confidence and confuse the public .
Favorite current targets are proposals for tax incentives through changes in depreciation rates and investment credits .
These are usually described in the media as " tax breaks , " " loop holes " or " tax benefits " for the benefit of business .
*
As viewed by a columnist in the Post , such tax measures would benefit " only the rich , the owners of big companies . "
8
It is dismaying that many politicians make the same argument that tax measures of this kind benefit only " business , " without benefit to " the poor . "
The fact that this is either political demagoguery or economic illiteracy is of slight comfort .
This setting of the " rich " against the " poor , " of business against the people , is the cheapest and most dangerous kind of politics .
The Apathy and Default of Business
What has been the response of business to this massive assault upon its fundamental economics , upon its philosophy , upon its right to continue to manage its own affairs , and indeed upon its integrity ?
The painfully sad truth is that business , including the boards of directors ' and the top executives of corporations great and small and business organizations at all levels , often have responded -- if at all -- by appeasement , ineptitude and ignoring the problem .
There are , of course , many exceptions to this sweeping generalization .
But the net effect of such response as has been made is scarcely visible .
In all fairness , it must be recognized that businessmen have not been trained or equipped to conduct guerrilla warfare with those who propagandize against the system , seeking insidiously and constantly to sabotage it .
The traditional role of business executives has been to manage , to produce , to sell , to create jobs , to make profits , to improve the standard of living , to be community leaders , to serve on charitable and educational boards , and generally to be good citizens .
They have performed these tasks very well indeed .
But they have shown little stomach for hard - nose contest with their critics , and little skill in effective intellectual and philosophical debate .
A column recently carried by the Wall Street Journal was entitled : " Memo to GM : Why Not Fight Back ? " 9
Although addressed to GM by name , the article was a warning to all American business .
Columnist St. John said :
" General Motors , like American business in general , is ' plainly in trouble ' because intellectual bromides have been substituted for a sound intellectual exposi-tion of its point of view . "
Mr. St. John then commented on the tendency of business leaders to compromise with and appease critics .
He cited the concessions which Nader wins from management , and spoke of " the fallacious view many businessmen take toward their critics . "
He drew a parallel to the mistaken tactics of many college administrators :
" College administrators learned too late that such appeasement serves to destroy free speech , academic freedom and genuine scholarship .
One campus radical demand was conceded by university heads only to be followed by a fresh crop which soon escalated to what amounted to a demand for outright surrender . "
One need not agree entirely with Mr. St. John 's analysis .
But most observers of the American scene will agree that the essence of his message is sound .
American business " plainly in trouble " ; the response to the wide range of critics has been ineffective , and has included appeasement ; the time has come -- indeed , it is long overdue -- for the wisdom , ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshalled against those who would destroy it .
Responsibility of Business Executives
What specifically should be done ?
The first essential -- a prerequisite to any effective action -- is for businessmen to confront this problem as a primary responsibility of corporate management .
The overriding first need is for businessmen to recognize that the ultimate issue may be survival -- survival of what we call the free enterprise system , and all that this means for the strength and prosperity of America and the freedom of our people .
The day is long past when the chief executive officer of a major corporation discharges his responsibility by maintaining a satisfactory growth of profits , with due regard to the corporation 's public and social responsibilities .
If our system is to survive , top management must be equally concerned with protecting and preserving the system itself .
This involves far more than an increased emphasis on " public relations " or " governmental affairs " -- two areas in which corporations long have invested substantial sums .
A significant first step by individual corporations could well be the designation of an executive vice president ( ranking with other executive VP's ) whose responsibility is to counter - on the broadest front - the attack on the enterprise system .
The public relations department could be one of the foundations assigned to this executive , but his responsibilities should encompass some of the types of activities referred to subsequently in this memorandum .
His budget and staff should be adequate to the task .
Possible Role of the Chamber of Commerce
But independent and uncoordinated ( sic ) activity by individual corporations , as important as this is , will not be sufficient .
Strength lies in organization , in careful long - range planning and implementation , in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years , in the scale of financing available only through joint effort , and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations .
Moreover , there is the quite understandable reluctance on the part of any one corporation to get too far out in front and to make itself too visible a target .
The role of the National Chamber of Commerce is therefore vital .
Other national organizations ( especially those of various industrial and commercial groups ) should join in the effort , but no other organizations appear to be as well situated as the Chamber .
It enjoys a strategic position , with a fine reputation and a broad base of support .
Also -- and this is of immeasurable merit -- there are hundreds of local Chambers of Commerce which can play a vital supportive role .
It hardly need be said that before embarking upon any program , the Chamber should study and analyze possible courses of action and activities , weighing risks against probable effectiveness and feasibility of each .
Considerations of cost , the assurance of financial and other support from members , adequacy of staffing and similar problems will all require the most thoughtful consideration .
The Campus
The assault on the enterprise system was not mounted in a few months .
It has gradually evolved over the past two decades , barely perceptible in its origins and benefiting ( sic ) from a gradualism that provoked little awareness much less any real reaction .
Although origins , sources and causes are complex and interrelated , and obviously difficult to identify without careful qualification , there is reason to believe that the campus is the single most dynamic source .
The social science faculties usually include members who are unsympathetic to the enterprise system .
They may range from a Herbert Marcuse , Marxist faculty member at the University of California at San Diego , and convinced socialists , to the ambivalent liberal critic who finds more to condemn than to commend .
Such faculty members need not be in a majority .
They are often personally attractive and magnetic ; they are stimulating teachers , and their controversy attracts student following ; they are prolific writers and lecturers ; they author many of the textbooks , and they exert enormous influence -- far out of proportion to their numbers -- on their colleagues and in the academic world .
Social science faculties ( the political scientist , economist , sociologist and many of the historians ) tend to be liberally oriented , even when leftists are not present .
This is not a criticism per se , as the need for liberal thought is essential to a balanced viewpoint .
The difficulty is that " balance " is conspicuous by its absence on many campuses , with relatively few members being of conservatives or moderate persuasion and even the relatively few often being less articulate and aggressive than their crusading colleagues .
This situation extending back many years and with the imbalance gradually worsening , has had an enormous impact on millions of young American students .
In an article in Barron 's Weekly , seeking an answer to why so many young people are disaffected even to the point of being revolutionaries , it was said :
" Because they were taught that way .
"
10
Or , as noted by columnist Stewart Alsop , writing about his alma mater :
" Yale , like every other major college , is graduating scores ' of bright young men ... who despise the American political and economic system . "
As these " bright young men , " from campuses across the country , seek opportunities to change a system which they have been taught to distrust -- if not , indeed " despise " -- they seek employment in the centers of the real power and influence in our country , namely : ( i ) with the news media , especially television ; ( ii ) in government , as " staffers " and consultants at various levels ; ( iii ) in elective politics ; ( iv ) as lecturers and writers , and ( v ) on the faculties at various levels of education .
Many do enter the enterprise system -- in business and the professions -- and for the most part they quickly discover the fallacies of what they have been taught .
But those who eschew the mainstream of the system often remain in key positions of influence where they mold public opinion and often shape governmental action .
In many instances , these " intellectuals " end up in regulatory agencies or governmental departments with large authority over the business system they do not believe in .
If the foregoing analysis is approximately sound , a priority task of business -- and organizations such as the Chamber -- is to address the campus origin of this hostility .
Few things are more sanctified in American life than academic freedom .
It would be fatal to attack this as a principle .
But if academic freedom is to retain the qualities of " openness , " " fairness " and " balance " -- which are essential to its intellectual significance -- there is a great opportunity for constructive action .
The thrust of such action must be to restore the qualities just mentioned to the academic communities .
What Can Be Done About the Campus
The ultimate responsibility for intellectual integrity on the campus must remain on the administrations and faculties of our colleges and universities .
But organizations such as the Chamber can assist and activate constructive change in many ways , including the following :
Staff of Scholars
The Chamber should consider establishing a staff of highly qualified scholars in the social sciences who do believe in the system .
It should include several of national reputation whose authorship would be widely respected -- even when disagreed with .
Staff of Speakers
There also should be a staff of speakers of the highest competency .
These might include the scholars , and certainly those who speak for the Chamber would have to articulate the product of the scholars .
Speaker 's Bureau
In addition to full - time staff personnel , the Chamber should have a Speaker 's Bureau which should include the ablest and most effective advocates from the top echelons of American business .
Evaluation of Textbooks
The staff of scholars ( or preferably a panel of independent scholars ) should evaluate social science textbooks , especially in economics , political science and sociology .
This should be a continuing program .
The objective of such evaluation should be oriented toward restoring the balance essential to genuine academic freedom .
This would include assurance of fair and factual treatment of our system of government and our enterprise system , its accomplishments , its basic relationship to individual rights and freedoms , and comparisons with the systems of socialism , fascism and communism .
Most of the existing textbooks have some sort of comparisons , but many are superficial , biased and unfair .
We have seen the civil rights movement insist on re-writing many of the textbooks in our universities and schools .
The labor unions likewise insist that textbooks be fair to the viewpoints of organized labor .
Other interested citizens groups have not hesitated to review , analyze and criticize textbooks and teaching materials .
In a democratic society , this can be a constructive process and should be regarded as an aid to genuine academic freedom and not as an intrusion upon it .
If the authors , publishers and users of textbooks know that they will be subjected -- honestly , fairly and thoroughly -- to review and critique by eminent scholars who believe in the American system , a return to a more rational balance can be expected .
Equal Time on the Campus
The Chamber should insist upon equal time on the college speaking circuit .
The FBI publishes each year a list of speeches made on college campuses by avowed Communists .
The number in 1970 exceeded 100 .
There were , of course , many hundreds of appearances by leftists and ultra liberals who urge the types of viewpoints indicated earlier in this memorandum .
There was no corresponding representation of American business , or indeed by individuals or organizations who appeared in support of the American system of government and business .
Every campus has its formal and informal groups which invite speakers .
Each law school does the same thing .
Many universities and colleges officially sponsor lecture and speaking programs .
We all know the inadequacy of the representation of business in the programs .
It will be said that few invitations would be extended to Chamber speakers .
11
This undoubtedly would be true unless the Chamber aggressively insisted upon the right to be heard -- in effect , insisted upon " equal time . "
University administrators and the great majority of student groups and committees would not welcome being put in the position publicly of refusing a forum to diverse views , indeed , this is the classic excuse for allowing Communists to speak .
The two essential ingredients are ( i ) to have attractive , articulate and well - informed speakers ; and ( ii ) to exert whatever degree of pressure -- publicly and privately -- may be necessary to assure opportunities to speak .
The objective always must be to inform and enlighten , and not merely to propagandize .
Balancing of Faculties
Perhaps the most fundamental problem is the imbalance of many faculties .
Correcting this is indeed a long - range and difficult project .
Yet , it should be undertaken as a part of an overall program .
This would mean the urging of the need for faculty balance upon university administrators and boards of trustees .
The methods to be employed require careful thought , and the obvious pitfalls must be avoided .
Improper pressure would be counterproductive .
But the basic concepts of balance , fairness and truth are difficult to resist , if properly presented to boards of trustees , by writing and speaking , and by appeals to alumni associations and groups .
This is a long road and not one for the fainthearted .
But if pursued with integrity and conviction it could lead to a strengthening of both academic freedom on the campus and of the values which have made America the most productive of all societies .
Graduate Schools of Business
The Chamber should enjoy a particular rapport with the increasingly influential graduate schools of business .
Much that has been suggested above applies to such schools .
Should not the Chamber also request specific courses in such schools dealing with the entire scope of the problem addressed by this memorandum ?
This is now essential training for the executives of the future .
Secondary Education
While the first priority should be at the college level , the trends mentioned above are increasingly evidenced in the high schools .
Action programs , tailored to the high schools and similar to those mentioned , should be considered .
The implementation thereof could become a major program for local chambers of commerce , although the control and direction -- especially the quality control -- should be retained by the National Chamber .
What Can Be Done About the Public ?
Reaching the campus and the secondary schools is vital for the long - term .
Reaching the public generally may be more important for the shorter term .
The first essential is to establish the staffs of eminent scholars , writers and speakers , who will do the thinking , the analysis , the writing and the speaking .
It will also be essential to have staff personnel who are thoroughly familiar with the media , and how most effectively to communicate with the public .
Among the more obvious means are the following :
Television
The national television networks should be monitored in the same way that textbooks should be kept under constant surveillance .
This applies not merely to so - called educational programs ( such as " Selling of the Pentagon " ) , but to the daily " news analysis " which so often includes the most insidious type of criticism of the enterprise system .
12
Whether this criticism results from hostility or economic ignorance , the result is the gradual erosion of confidence in " business " and free enterprise .
This monitoring , to be effective , would require constant examination of the texts of adequate samples of programs .
Complaints -- to the media and to the Federal Communications Commission -- should be made promptly and strongly when programs are unfair or inaccurate .
Equal time should be demanded when appropriate .
Effort should be made to see that the forum - type programs ( the Today Show , Meet the Press , etc. ) afford at least as much opportunity for supporters of the American system to participate as these programs do for those who attack it .
Other Media
Radio and the press are also important , and every available means should be employed to challenge and refute unfair attacks , as well as to present the affirmative case through these media .
The Scholarly Journals
It is especially important for the Chamber 's " faculty of scholars " to publish .
One of the keys to the success of the liberal and leftist faculty members has been their passion for " publication " and " lecturing . "
A similar passion must exist among the Chamber 's scholars .
Incentives might be devised to induce more " publishing " by independent scholars who do believe in the system .
There should be a fairly steady flow of scholarly articles presented to a broad spectrum of magazines and periodicals -- ranging from the popular magazines ( Life , Look , Reader 's Digest , etc. ) to the more intellectual ones ( Atlantic , Harper 's , Saturday Review , New York , etc. ) 13 and to the various professional journals .
Books , Paperbacks and Pamphlets
The news stands -- at airports , drugstores , and elsewhere -- are filled with paperbacks and pamphlets advocating everything from revolution to erotic free love .
One finds almost no attractive , well - written paperbacks or pamphlets on " our side . "
It will be difficult to compete with an Eldridge Cleaver or even a Charles Reich for reader attention , but unless the effort is made -- on a large enough scale and with appropriate imagination to assure some success -- this opportunity for educating the public will be irretrievably lost .
Paid Advertisements
Business pays hundreds of millions of dollars to the media for advertisements .
Most of this supports specific products ; much of it supports institutional image making ; and some fraction of it does support the system .
But the latter has been more or less tangential , and rarely part of a sustained , major effort to inform and enlighten the American people .
If American business devoted only 10 % of its total annual advertising budget to this overall purpose , it would be a statesman - like expenditure .
The Neglected Political Arena
In the final analysis , the payoff -- short - of revolution -- is what government does .
Business has been the favorite whipping - boy of many politicians for many years .
But the measure of how far this has gone is perhaps best found in the anti-business views now being expressed by several leading candidates for President of the United States .
It is still Marxist doctrine that the " capitalist " countries are controlled by big business .
This doctrine , consistently a part of leftist propaganda all over the world , has a wide public following among Americans .
Yet , as every business executive knows , few elements of American society today have as little influence in government as the American businessman , the corporation , or even the millions of corporate stockholders .
If one doubts this , let him undertake the role of " lobbyist " for the business point of view before Congressional committees .
The same situation obtains in the legislative halls of most states and major cities .
One does not exaggerate to say that , in terms of political influence with respect to the course of legislation and government action , the American business executive is truly the " forgotten man . "
Current examples of the impotency of business , and of the near - contempt with which businessmen 's views are held , are the stampedes by politicians to support almost any legislation related to " consumerism " or to the " environment . "
Politicians reflect what they believe to be majority views of their constituents .
It is thus evident that most politicians are making the judgment that the public has little sympathy for the businessman or his viewpoint .
The educational programs suggested above would be designed to enlighten public thinking -- not so much about the businessman and his individual role as about the system which he administers , and which provides the goods , services and jobs on which our country depends .
But one should not postpone more direct political action , while awaiting the gradual change in public opinion to be effected through education and information .
Business must learn the lesson , long ago learned by labor and other self - interest groups .
This is the lesson that political power is necessary ; that such power must be assidously ( sic ) cultivated ; and that when necessary , it must be used aggressively and with determination -- without embarrassment and without the reluctance which has been so characteristic of American business .
As unwelcome as it may be to the Chamber , it should consider assuming a broader and more vigorous role in the political arena .
Neglected Opportunity in the Courts
American business and the enterprise system have been affected as much by the courts as by the executive and legislative branches of government .
Under our constitutional system , especially with an activist - minded Supreme Court , the judiciary may be the most important instrument for social , economic and political change .
Other organizations and groups , recognizing this , have been far more astute in exploiting judicial action than American business .
Perhaps the most active exploiters of the judicial system have been groups ranging in political orientation from " liberal " to the far left .
The American Civil Liberties Union is one example .
It initiates or intervenes in scores of cases each year , and it files briefs amicus curiae in the Supreme Court in a number of cases during each term of that court .
Labor unions , civil rights groups and now the public interest law firms are extremely active in the judicial arena .
Their success , often at business ' expense , has not been inconsequential .
This is a vast area of opportunity for the Chamber , if it is willing to undertake the role of spokesman for American business and if , in turn , business is willing to provide the funds .
As with respect to scholars and speakers , the Chamber would need a highly competent staff of lawyers .
In special situations it should be authorized to engage , to appear as counsel amicus in the Supreme Court , lawyers of national standing and reputation .
The greatest care should be exercised in selecting the cases in which to participate , or the suits to institute .
But the opportunity merits the necessary effort .
Neglected Stockholder Power
The average member of the public thinks of " business " as an impersonal corporate entity , owned by the very rich and managed by over - paid executives .
There is an almost total failure to appreciate that " business " actually embraces -- in one way or another -- most Americans .
Those for whom business provides jobs , constitute a fairly obvious class .
But the 20 million stockholders -- most of whom are of modest means -- are the real owners , the real entrepreneurs , the real capitalists under our system .
They provide the capital which fuels the economic system which has produced the highest standard of living in all history .
Yet , stockholders have been as ineffectual as business executives in promoting a genuine understanding of our system or in exercising political influence .
The question which merits the most thorough examination is how can the weight and influence of stockholders -- 20 million voters -- be mobilized to support ( i ) an educational program and ( ii ) a political action program .
Individual corporations are now required to make numerous reports to shareholders .
Many corporations also have expensive " news " magazines which go to employees and stockholders .
These opportunities to communicate can be used far more effectively as educational media .
The corporation itself must exercise restraint in undertaking political action and must , of course , comply with applicable laws .
But is it not feasible -- through an affiliate of the Chamber or otherwise -- to establish a national organization of American stockholders and give it enough muscle to be influential ?
A More Aggressive Attitude
Business interests -- especially big business and their national trade organizations -- have tried to maintain low profiles , especially with respect to political action .
As suggested in the Wall Street Journal article , it has been fairly characteristic of the average business executive to be tolerant -- at least in public -- of those who attack his corporation and the system .
Very few businessmen or business organizations respond in kind .
There has been a disposition to appease ; to regard the opposition as willing to compromise , or as likely to fade away in due time .
Business has shunted confrontation politics .
Business , quite understandably , has been repelled by the multiplicity of non-negotiable " demands " made constantly by self - interest groups of all kinds .
While neither responsible business interests , nor the United States Chamber of Commerce , would engage in the irresponsible tactics of some pressure groups , it is essential that spokesmen for the enterprise system -- at all levels and at every opportunity -- be far more aggressive than in the past .
There should be no hesitation to attack the Naders , the Marcuses and others who openly seek destruction of the system .
There should not be the slightest hesitation to press vigorously in all political arenas for support of the enterprise system .
Nor should there be reluctance to penalize politically those who oppose it .
Lessons can be learned from organized labor in this respect .
The head of the AFL - CIO may not appeal to businessmen as the most endearing or public - minded of citizens .
Yet , over many years the heads of national labor organizations have done what they were paid to do very effectively .
They may not have been beloved , but they have been respected -- where it counts the most -- by politicians , on the campus , and among the media .
It is time for American business -- which has demonstrated the greatest capacity in all history to produce and to influence consumer decisions -- to apply their great talents vigorously to the preservation of the system itself .
The Cost
The type of program described above ( which includes a broadly based combination of education and political action ) , if undertaken long term and adequately staffed , would require far more generous financial support from American corporations than the Chamber has ever received in the past .
High level management participation in Chamber affairs also would be required .
The staff of the Chamber would have to be significantly increased , with the highest quality established and maintained .
Salaries would have to be at levels fully comparable to those paid key business executives and the most prestigious faculty members .
Professionals of the great skill in advertising and in working with the media , speakers , lawyers and other specialists would have to be recruited .
It is possible that the organization of the Chamber itself would benefit from restructuring .
For example , as suggested by union experience , the office of President of the Chamber might well be a full - time career position .
To assure maximum effectiveness and continuity , the chief executive officer of the Chamber should not be changed each year .
The functions now largely performed by the President could be transferred to a Chairman of the Board , annually elected by the membership .
The Board , of course , would continue to exercise policy control .
Quality Control is Essential
Essential ingredients of the entire program must be responsibility and " quality control . "
The publications , the articles , the speeches , the media programs , the advertising , the briefs filed in courts , and the appearances before legislative committees -- all must meet the most exacting standards of accuracy and professional excellence .
They must merit respect for their level of public responsibility and scholarship , whether one agrees with the viewpoints expressed or not .
Relationship to Freedom
The threat to the enterprise system is not merely a matter of economics .
It also is a threat to individual freedom .
It is this great truth -- now so submerged by the rhetoric of the New Left and of many liberals -- that must be re-affirmed if this program is to be meaningful .
There seems to be little awareness that the only alternatives to free enterprise are varying degrees of bureaucratic regulation of individual freedom -- ranging from that under moderate socialism to the iron heel of the leftist or rightist dictatorship .
We in America already have moved very far indeed toward some aspects of state socialism , as the needs and complexities of a vast urban society require types of regulation and control that were quite unnecessary in earlier times .
In some areas , such regulation and control already have seriously impaired the freedom of both business and labor , and indeed of the public generally .
But most of the essential freedoms remain : private ownership , private profit , labor unions , collective bargaining , consumer choice , and a market economy in which competition largely determines price , quality and variety of the goods and services provided the consumer .
In addition to the ideological attack on the system itself ( discussed in this memorandum ) , its essentials also are threatened by inequitable taxation , and -- more recently -- by an inflation which has seemed uncontrollable .
14
But whatever the causes of diminishing economic freedom may be , the truth is that freedom as a concept is indivisible .
As the experience of the socialist and totalitarian states demonstrates , the contraction and denial of economic freedom is followed inevitably by governmental restrictions on other cherished rights .
It is this message , above all others , that must be carried home to the American people .
Conclusion
It hardly need be said that the views expressed above are tentative and suggestive .
The first step should be a thorough study .
But this would be an exercise in futility unless the Board of Directors of the Chamber accepts the fundamental premise of this paper , namely , that business and the enterprise system are in deep trouble , and the hour is late .

About this document
On August 23 , 1971 , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce distributed the Powell Memorandum to its national membership of leading executives , businesses , and trade associations .
The memo , published here in its entirety , constituted the entire contents of the issue of its regular publication WASHINGTON REPORT to members .
Republican Rick Barber has a new campaign advertisement out and it targets taxes and government accounting standards .
The Alabama Congressional Candidate sits down for a discussion with American revolutionaries .
In the end , the George Washington character exclaims , " gather your armies . "
Via Politico :
Unfortunately for Williams , the NBA - related organizations best suited to help him have closed their checkbooks to him .
The NBA Legends Foundation , which awarded him grants totaling more than $ 10,000 in 1996 and 2004 , denied his recent request for help .
So did the NBA Retired Players Association , which in the past year gave him two grants totaling $ 2,000 .
“ When I played the game , they always talked about loyalty to the team , ’’ Williams said .
“ Well , where ’s the loyalty and compassion for ex-players who are hurting ?
We opened the door for these guys whose salaries are through the roof . ’’
One thing Williams especially wants them to know :
Unlike many troubled ex-players , he has never fallen prey to drugs , alcohol , or gambling .
Williams , 55 and diabetic , wants the titans of today ’s NBA to help take care of him and other retirees who have plenty of time to watch games but no televisions to do so .
He needs food , shelter , cash for car repairs , and a job , and he believes the multibillion - dollar league and its players should treat him as if he were a teammate in distress .
“ Ray is like many players who invested so much of their lives in basketball , ’’ said Mike Glenn , who played 10 years in the NBA , including three with Williams and the New York Knicks .
“ When the dividends stopped coming , the problems started escalating .
It ’s a cold reality . ’’
A former top - 10 NBA draft pick who once scored 52 points in a game , Williams is a face of big - time basketball ’s underclass .
As the NBA employs players whose average annual salaries top $ 5 million , Williams is among scores of retired players for whom the good life vanished not long after the final whistle .
“ They say God wo n’t give you more than you can handle , ’’ Williams said in his roadside sedan .
“ But this is wearing me out . ’’
Williams , a generation removed from staying in first - class hotels with Larry Bird and Co. in their drive to the 1985 NBA Finals , mostly wonders how much more he can bear .
He is not new to poverty , illness , homelessness .
Or quiet desperation .
The 10 - year NBA veteran formerly known as “ Sugar Ray ’’ leans back in the driver ’s seat , drapes his legs over the center console , and rests his head on a pillow of tattered towels .
He tunes his boom box to gospel music , closes his eyes , and wonders .
POMPANO BEACH , Fla . —
Every night at bedtime , former Celtic Ray Williams locks the doors of his home : a broken - down 1992 Buick , rusting on a back street where he ran out of everything .
Charles D. Smith , an NBA veteran who heads the retired players association , said Williams has not taken advantage of efforts to help him find work .
“ You can only do so much for any one player because there are a lot of guys who need help , ’’ Smith said .
“ Ray needs to let us help him help himself . ’’
Problems in transition Hall of Famer Bob Cousy , who helped create the Legends Foundation and serves as a director , understands the financial pressures squeezing many NBA retirees .
Cousy himself auctioned his NBA memorabilia in 2003 to help support his daughters and grandchildren .
As for Williams , Cousy said , the Legends Foundation generally limits former players to two financial grants .

“ If a client comes back a third time , he needs to make a very compelling case , ’’ Cousy said .
“ Ray just has n’t done that . ’’
The rejections angered Williams .
He said he wants to work but needs transportation to reach a workplace .
“ I ’m in the middle of an emergency , and they ’re going to turn their backs on me ? ’’ he said .
“ How about all these [ NBA ] guys with big contracts ?
Are they going to help ? ’’
Times have changed since Williams joined the NBA .
As the 10th overall pick in 1977 out of the University of Minnesota — he played there with Kevin McHale — Williams signed a four - year , $ 500,000 contract with the Knicks .
He received no significant endorsements .
By contrast , 19 - year - old Brandon Jennings , the 10th pick last year , received a two - year , $ 4.5 million contract with the Bucks after landing a $ 2 million deal with Under Armour and playing a season in Italy for $ 1.65 million .
Jennings earned more in his first two years as a professional than Williams made over a decade .
After Williams led the Knicks in scoring ( 16.8 points a game ) over his first four years in the league , he signed his richest deal — a three - year , $ 1.5 million contract with the Nets in 1981 .
But his production declined after the deal expired , and he retired in ’ 87 without a college degree or professional skill .
A generation later , Williams has little more than memories to show for running NBA floors with the likes of Bird , Magic Johnson , and Michael Jordan .
“ Ray is like a lot of us who had trouble maintaining our pride and dignity in new environments after we left professional sports , ’’ said the Reverend Woody Bennett , a former NFL running back who has supported Williams .

A Brief History Of Cakes
The ancient Egyptians were the world ’s first great bakers , with large - scale bakeries that produced unleavened breads and cakes , first baked on hot stones .
They were the first to discover how to use wild ( natural ) yeast to make those flatbreads and cakes rise .
Cakes are round because they descended from ancient breads — round loaves of dough placed on hearthstones to bake .
It took another few millennia , until the 18th century , to discover the technique of whipping eggs to make cakes rise .
While it required many hours of beating , it heralded the dawn of modern baking .
By the 1840s , baking soda had been invented , followed by baking powder in the 1860s .
As ovens with regulated temperatures became available , and sugar became affordable to everyone , more people were able to bake , resulting in more creativity in recipe development ; the modern cake as we know it began to take shape in the mid-19th century .
Even though sugar originated in Asia , cakes as we now know them — flour , eggs , butter and sugar baked to a sweet , fluffy deliciousness — are a Western evolution .
There are thousands of different types of cakes in the world today ; each culture has its specialties , most of which never reach our shores .
Here , we present some of the more popular types one is likely to encounter — or at least hear about — in the U.S .
It is important to note that there is no one — or even 100 — recipes for any of the cakes described here .
Over the centuries , bakers have varied and refined the original recipes to their own preferences , and the challenge for everyone who loves to bake ( or eat ) good cake is to keep trying recipes until we find the versions that suit us to perfection .

ALMOND PASTE
See marzipan .
ANGEL FOOD CAKE
A light , flourless cake made with sugar , cream of tartar , salt , vanilla or almond extract , and a dozen or so egg whites , depending on the recipe .
There is no leavening .
Angel cake is typically baked in a tube pan .
It is popularly served with berries and whipped cream , although it is just fine plain or with a dessert sauce ( caramel , chocolate , custard , fruit , etc. ) .
Some historians think that the first angel food cakes were baked in the South by African - American slaves , due to the strength required to whip the air into the whites .
Others theorize that the cake originated in Pennsylvania Dutch country in the early 1800s .

October 10th is National Angel Food Cake Day .
Here are recipes for a from - scratch angel food cake , and for a strawberry glaze .
If you do n’t want to bake from scratch , try a store - bought or cake mix .
APPLESAUCE CAKE
A cake made with raisins , walnuts , spices ( cinnamon , cloves , nutmeg ) and of course , applesauce .
Some recipes add a square of baking chocolate .
This casual cake cake makes a good snack cake unfrosted , or can be dressed up with a penuche ( brown sugar ) frosting .
BABA or BABA AU RHUM or RHUM BABA
Small cakes baked in cylindrical molds , containing raisins or currants , made from yeast dough and soaked with sugar syrup , usually flavored with rum .
According to legend , the baba evolved from the kouglhopf or kugelhopf .
As the story goes , Polish King Stanislas Leszczynska ( 1710 –1774 ) , the the father - in - law of King Louis XV of France , was deposed and exiled to Lorraine , where he found the traditional kouglhopf too dry and dipped it in rum .
His chef refined the recipe , using brioche dough and adding raisins .
The king named the cake after one of the characters in his favorite book , Ali Baba ; the name became shortened to baba .
Not all babas are rhum babas ; baba refers to the shape .
Today , rhum babas are made a variety of shapes , including fluted ( Bundt - like , as in the photo above ) , unfluted circle molds and individual , brioche - like portions .

BABKA
A yeast ring originating in Eastern European , baked with raisins or other dried fruit in the dough .
Similar to coffee cake , without the glaze or streusel .
Today it also is also made in a loaf shape .
Some babkas , such as the one in the photo at right , are made in the style of a marble cake , swirled with chocolate , as a variation on the traditional dried fruit .
Babka available from Zabars.com .
BACCA DI MONTAGNA CAKE
A lovely summer cake , the name means “ berries from the mountain ” or mountain berries .
The white sponge cake layered with almond pastry cream is topped with wild blueberries and raspberries covered with a natural jelly glaze .
The sides are pressed with almond biscotti crumbs .
This Bacca di Montagna cake is available from 1-800 - Bakery.com .
BAKED ALASKA
This dessert is ice cream encased in meringue and browned in an oven .
Though it did not get its current name until 1896 , it was invented in 1804 by Benjamin Thompson Rumford ( 1753 - 1814 ) , an American - born physicist who became a British subject during the American Revolution .
The dessert was the by - product of his study of the resistance of stiffly beaten egg whites to the induction of heat .
He named the dessert Omelette Surprise .
Later versions added sponge cake underneath the ice cream , the recipe that is common today .

BAKING
The technique of cooking food in an enclosed space — it can be an oven , box , covered , dug pit , etc. — with dry heat .
BAKING POWDER
A chemical leavening agent that causes batter to rise during the baking process .
Baking powder consists of baking soda , cream of tartar ( and / or sodium aluminum sulfate ) , plus cornstarch .
It creates a chemical reaction that enlarges the air bubbles already present in the batter .
BAKING SODA
Baking soda , another leavening agent , is also known as bicarbonate of soda and by its chemical name , sodium bicarbonate .
It is about four times as strong as baking powder .
Baking soda is used in recipes that contain an acidic ingredient : for example , brown sugar , buttermilk , chocolate , citrus juice , chocolate , fruit , honey , maple syrup , molasses , sour cream , vinegar and yogurt .
BATTENBERG CAKE or WINDOW
CAKE
A light sponge cake covered in marzipan with a checkerboard interior .
One layer is dyed pink to contrast with the yellow cake ; the layers are cut into uniform logs and joined with apricot jam into one cake .
The origin of the name is obscure ; one theory claims that the cake was created to celebrate the 1884 marriage of Queen Victoria ’s granddaughter , Princess Alice , to Prince Louis of Battenberg .
The four squares representing each of the four Battenberg princes : Louis , Alexander , Henry and Francis Joseph .
Prince Louis of Battenberg is the father of Admiral of the Fleet Louis Mountbatten , 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma , grandfather of Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , consort of Queen Elizabeth II , and great - grandfather of Prince Charles .
BATTER
Batter is the uncooked material from which cakes are made .
The main ingredients generally include flour , eggs , sugar , butter , flavoring ( almond , chocolate , vanilla , etc. ) and sometimes milk , cream or sour cream .
These are the same ingredients as in a dough ; the only difference is that a batter is thinner in consistency .
The word comes from the French “ battre , ” meaning “ to beat . ”

BAUMKUCHEN
Baumkuchen , German for “ tree cake , ” is an airy sponge painstakingly made of paper - thin layers so that it appears to be the cross-section of a tree .
It is made by very few bakeries ( five in the U.S. ) since it requires special equipment and time - consuming attention to detail .
The cylinders in a specialty oven are covered with batter .
They rotate , bake , are recoated and baked again until 20 or more layers are created .
The ovens can only make this one item , and baking requires constant attention ( as opposed to leaving the cake for 40 minutes or so , then checking on it ) .
It takes several hours per batch .
Here ’s a recipe you can make at home with a jerry - rigged toaster oven .

BEE STING CAKE or BIENENDTICH
A German yeast cake filled with custard or pastry cream and frosted with honey , butter and almonds .
It is more of a brioche pastry than an American - style cake .
According to legend , it is named for a baker who made a cake with a honey topping , which attracted a bee that stung him .
Here ’s a recipe with step - by - step photos .

BIRTHDAY CAKE
This generally refers to a frosted layer cake , decorated with roses or other themes that honor the interests of the celebrant .
It typically has the inscription , “ Happy Birthday ” and the celebrant ’s name .
Tradition is to include one candle for each year — up to a certain point , when discretion and the surface area of the cake recommend only one or a few candles .
The custom may have begun in ancient Greece with honey cakes .
Ancient Romans also celebrated their 50th year with a honey cake .
Much later , cakes celebrated birthdays of young children in Germany .
In medieval England , coins were mixed into the batter and the tradition continues there today .
From early times , fire sent signals to the gods ; today , one makes a private wish while blowing out the candles on one ’s cake .
While some birthday cakes are even greater works of art than wedding cakes — sculptures that one would n’t dare mar with candles — the iconic birthday cake often just has a few buttercream roses .
The cake above can be ordered from ChocolateBakery.com .
BLACK BOTTOM CAKE
A cake fashioned after the black bottom pie , which has a chocolate layer bottom and a vanilla pudding top .
In the cake version , a chocolate layer is topped with a cream cheese / chocolate chip layer , which bakes into a cheesecake - like top .
BLACK FOREST CAKE
A chocolate layer cake , filled with Kirsch - flavored whipped cream and sour Morello cherries and traditionally frosted with whipped cream and chocolate curls .
The cake is believed to have originated in the late 16th century in the Black Forest region of Germany .
The area is known for its sour Morello cherries and Kirschwasser , a clear brandy made from the cherries .
Read more about the history of the Black Forest Cake , including a recipe .

BLACKOUT CAKE
A blackout cake is a very dark chocolate layer cake , filled and frosted with dark chocolate pudding and covered in chocolate crumbs .
It was developed in New York during World War II , named after the blackout drills performed by the Civilian Defense Corps .
When the Navy sent ships to sea from the Brooklyn Navy Yard at night , the streetlights were turned off and the windows of Brooklyn were “ blacked out ” to avoid silhouetting the battleships against the city .
Blackout cake available at Zabars.com .
BOMBE
A bombe , also known as a dome , is a dome - shaped confection made of cake and mousse ( or other creamy center ) .
The word comes from the French bombé , meaning domed or rounded .
Created in a dome - or melon - shaped mold , two or more fillings are layered , typically atop a layer of cake .
When unmolded , they can be covered with a thin layer of chocolate , with meringue or other tasty topping .
Frozen bombes are combinations of ice cream and sorbet , sometimes with cake ( a dome - shaped Baked Alaska is a bombe ) .
When the bomb is cut , the interior should present a contrast of colors and textures .
While the chocolate bombe in the photo , with flourless chocolate cake and halvah mousse , is not flashy , frozen bombes especially can look like a tropical paradise ( strawberry ice cream with mango and kiwi sorbet , for example ) .

BOSTON CREAM PIE
Just as the cheesecake is really a pie , the Boston Cream Pie is really a cake : two layers of sponge cake filled with vanilla custard and glazed with chocolate .
It is the descendant of the early American pudding - cake pie .
The first reference , a recipe published in 1855 , calls it a “ pudding pie cake ” and had a powdered sugar topping , which evolved to the current chocolate glaze .
So why is it called a pie ?
The answer is most likely that , in the mid-19th century pie tins were more common than cake pans .
The distinction between calling something pie or cake was more flexible than it is today .
The cake might well have been baked in pie tins .

Chef M. Sanzian , hired for the opening of Boston ’s Parker House Hotel in 1856 , is credited with the modern Boston Cream Pie , a sophisticated remake of the early American pudding - cake pie recipe .
He sandwiched two layers of sponge cake with crème pâtissière , a vanilla - flavored custard .
He topped the cake with a chocolate ganache glaze .
At the Parker House Hotel , the cake was originally served with the names Chocolate Cream Pie or Parker House Chocolate Cream Pie .
Beginning in the 20th century , a custard filling often replaced the crème pâtissière .
In 1996 , Boston Cream Pie was declared the official cake of Massachusetts .
In modern times , a custard filling often replaces the crème pâtissière .
October 23 is National Boston Cream Pie Day .
Make one with this recipe .
BOUCHON
A small , bite - size chocolate cake with brownie - like qualities .
Bouchon is the French word for cork , and the cakes are baked in tin that produces cork shapes .
Since French recipes tend to be on the bittersweet rather than the sugary side , they go well with a demi-sec or Pinot Noir - based Champagne — all the more reason to celebrate !
They are a signature pastry at Thomas Keller ’s Bouchon Bakery , where mini chocolate chips are baked into the batter ( photo at right ) and the tops are dusted with confectioner ’s sugar .

BREAD
There is a transition between sweet breads and low - sugar cakes baked in loaf pans , such as carrot bread and banana bread .
What ’s the difference between a banana bread and a banana cake ?
The obvious difference is that banana bread ( or other bread ) is baked in a loaf pan while a cake is baked in a round , square or rectangular cake pan .
A less obvious distinction is that the bread style of cake , as a quickbread* , is leavened with baking soda .
In general , loaf cakes or “ breads ” also have a denser crumb , a rougher texture and often less sugar than their cake counterparts .

This recipe and others available at McCormick.com .
While the origin of the “ bread ” style of cake is unknown , food historians believe that it was originated in the 18th century with housewives experimenting with pearl ash .
Banana bread became common in American cookbooks in the 1930s , with the popularization of baking soda and baking powder , and very popular in the 1960s , when variations with simple inclusions ( nuts , chocolate morsels ) created simple but delicious snack cakes .
* Quickbreads use a chemical leavener instead of yeast , which makes them quick to rise .
Other examples include cornbread , biscuits , muffins , scones soda bread .
BROWN BETTY
Most often found in recipes for a Brown Betty or an Apple Brown Betty , a betty is like a pie without the crust .
Sugared fruit is topped with buttered breadcrumbs and baked .
The dish and name date back to Colonial times , but the original “ Betty ” is lost to history ; the brown presumably refers to the browning of the fruit , as there is no brown sugar .
See also crisp .
BROWNIES & BARS
While cake - like brownies and bars ( like lemon bars ) are baked in cake pans and have a dense , cakey texture , they are actually classified as bar cookies , not cakes .
See the different types of cookies , and read the origin of brownies .
Brownies available from MackenzieLtd.com .
BÛCHE DE NOËL French for “ yule log ” or “ Christmas Log . ”
Instead of gathering around the Christmas tree , French families gather around a Yule log burning in the fireplace .
Sometime after 1870 , a Parisian pâtissier was inspired by the festivity to create the first bûche de Noël , a chocolate frosted roulade , baked in a jelly roll pan .
To imitate the log , a roll of génoise ( sponge cake ) is covered in chocolate buttercream that is textured to resemble bark .
Smaller pieces of cake , also covered in buttercream , are affixed to the main roll to represent trimmed branches .
The ends of the roll and the cut faces of the branches are frosted with vanilla cream to imitate cut wood .
The log is decorated with holly leaves made of icing or marzipan , and meringue mushrooms .
Fresh berries and powdered sugar ( to resemble snow ) can also be used .
Today ’s modern pâtissier make futuristic logs , with angular shapes , decorated in silver , like this one by Maison Kayser , enrobed in white chocolate with white chocolate slabs on the ends :
A classic Yule log design , available from MackenzieLtd.com .
A more modern approach is below : a recipe from Pom Wonderful .
BUNDT CAKE
The Bundt cake was born in 1950 , after the Bundt pan was created by H. David Dahlquist , the founder of Nordic Ware , a Minneapolis - based manufacturer of kitchenware products .
He did so at the request of members of the Minneapolis chapter of Hadassah , a Jewish women ’s service organization , based on a fluted ceramic kugelhopf cake mold from Europe that belonged to the mother of one of the members .
The original kugelhopf , a Viennese specialty , is a sweet yeast bread similar to brioche and panettone .
Over the years , denser cakes were baked in the same fluted molds .
Dahlquist modified the design by introducing folds in the fluted edges , and fashioned the pan out of aluminum .
Photo of King ’s Cupboard White Hazelnut Cake Mix , baked in a Bundt pan .
According to the company , the name Bundt was taken from the German word bund , which means “ community ” or “ a gathering of people ” ; Dahlquist added the “ t ” and trademarked the word .
Read more about kugelhopf and the history of the bundt cake .
BUTTER CAKE
A butter cake is a cake made with shortening — butter , margarine , oil or vegetable shortening .
They are finer - grained than fluffy sponge cakes , and thus are easier to make into white , yellow and chocolate layer cakes and loaf cakes .
The American butter cake evolved from the English pound cake .
In addition to butter , eggs , sugar and flour , they use a chemical leavener ( baking powder or baking soda ) to rise .
Examples include coconut cake , cream cake , pound cake and queen cake .
Chocolate cake .

BUTTERCREAM
A frosting and filling made of unsalted butter , either egg yolks or egg whites , sugar and flavorings .
There are many recipes for versions both cooked and uncooked .
Buttercream can be variously flavored , including chocolate , coffee , lemon , lime , nut ( e.g. pistachio ) , orange , peppermint , strawberry and vanilla .
