Fuzz testing is incredibly cool .
Essentially , you throw random data at a program , seeing how it responds .
This has a broad range of applicability , especially so in the world of security ( finding fringe cases that the program authors did n’t cover , leading to exploits ) .
For example , if you were testing a web application , you could generate random query strings of input to send to it , to see how the site might respond ( possibly detecting an exploit or XSS attack of some sort ) .
Jesse Ruderman just introduced a fantastic new utility for probing JavaScript implementations called jsfunfuzz .
Specifically , this utility generates various JavaScript statements then executes them – seeing what the result will be .
I ’ve actually been following the progress of this utility for a while now – seeing it ’s outstanding results pop up on various tickets that I ’ve watched .
At first , I did n’t know about the jsfunfuzz utility and just assumed that Jesse was a wizard of developing obscure ways to break JS engines .
It was n’t until that I found and looked into the tool that his various bug comments made much more sense .
The usefulness of jsfunfuzz falls into two distinct areas : Testing the security of a JavaScript implementation looking for errors capable of crashing a browser and testing the validity of a JavaScript implementation looking for syntax errors .
Security
jsfunfuzz has explicit knowledge of how JS is parsed and interpreted , so it ’s able to make educated guesses at how to write code that will break a browser .
Because of this , over 280 bugs have been found in Mozilla thus far , with about 2 dozen of them being exploitable .
This aspect of the utility has been making some significant news lately , when it was announced at the Blackhat conference .
Tons of examples of the result of this work can be found in the jsfunfuzz ticket .
Here ’s one statement , for example , that jsfunfuzz generated that was able to produce a security exploit in Mozilla :
js > this .x setter= new Function ; this .
watch ( 'x ' , function ( ) {} ) ; gc( ) ; x = {} ; before 9232 , after 9232 , break 01205000 Bus error
Language Implementation
The second positive side - effect of this utility , and the one that I ’m particularly interested in , is that of testing a JavaScript language implementation for correctness .
Update :
It should be noted that ‘ correctness ’ is only hap - hazardly verified through fuzz testing ( in that , no specific output is tested or verified – it simply watches for crashes or decompilation errors ) .
It ’s this second group of tests ( uneval - ing a code block then verifying its contents to be equivalent to the input ) that are particularly handy for testing the basic syntactical validity of a JavaScript implementation – but it does n’t go much beyond that .
For example , look at this recent ( large ) ticket where Brendan implemented a number of speed improvements to Spidermonkey .
He asked Jesse to come in and run the fuzzer to see if it could find any loose - ends , and sure enough , plenty were to be found :
js > [ ] . map ( 1 for ( x in [ ] ) )
Assertion failure : * pc == JSOP_NULL , at jsopcode .
c:3862
—
js > ( 4).__lookupGetter__('w ')
Crash [ @ obj_lookupGetter ]
—
js > f = function ( ) { new ( delete y ) } function ( ) { new delete y ; } js> eval ( uneval ( f ) ) typein:2 : SyntaxError : syntax error : typein : 2 : ( function ( ) { new delete y; } ) typein : 2 : ..................^
—
( The following script caused a crash [ @ js_ValueToString ] . )
function c( gen ) { Iterator ; '' + gen ; for ( var i in gen ( ) ) ; } function gen ( ) { ( {}).hasOwnProperty ( ) ; yield ; } c( gen ) ;
Now , all of this is not for waste .
What happens now is that for each of these issues that jsfunfuzz discovered ( albeit in a patched version of the JS engine ) can be converted into test cases , which will be re-run every time a new build of the browser is generated .
This is absolutely fantastic .
It ’s pretty incredible how a common security testing tool can become good at testing , and generating test cases for , a JavaScript language implementation .
This is especially important as development of ECMAScript 4 - compliant language implementations start to appear – as new ways to test and break them will need to be discovered ; and fuzz testing looks to be a fantastic way to achieve that .
Not sleepy .
My heart is racing to over 100 beats per minute .
I 've started sweating even though I 've been lying down in a cool dark London hotel room for hours .
Now my heart feels like it 's beating out of my chest and I feel like death will occur at any moment .
Fortunately I 'd been through this before and knew this was n't the end of life for me but rather a panic attack that would pass .
I ended up spending the rest of that night wide awake and dragged myself to the airport at dawn .
.
.
.
.
This is one of the last very rough nights I can remember vividly .
I 'd been dealing with insomnia for 15 years prior to that hellish night in the beautiful Rookery Hotel in central London .
For 15 years I 'd chalked it up to something uniquely me , something in my biochemistry , something inescapable , something perhaps sealed at birth with my DNA .
( The first domain I ever registered was notsleepy.com in 1999 )
But 10 months later I 'd begin to get a glimpse of a better life .
A life that included real sleep .
See I accidentally made one change that produced a few nights of good sleep .
It caught my attention .
Hang on ... I can sleep ?
I was hooked .
I began experimenting with many variables to see what else I could do to string together more and more nights of uninterrupted sleep .
The following is a guide for what works .
It is not a guarantee and is truly a n=1 experiment that produced a life changing outcome .
But it is now clear to me this recipe is rooted in science and will likely help others stuck in the rut of insomnia .
I 'm going to rate each lifestyle change I made with an estimate of it's influence and degree of confidence .
These ratings are my personal experience but from what I 've discovered in talking to others it seems these changes have a positive effect on the plurality of those insomniacs that try them .
Let 's go .
We will start with the biggest change with the most impact and greatest confidence ...
Would you drive a SUV called a Himmer ?
Phonetic symbolism refers to the notion that the sounds of words , apart from their assigned definition , convey meaning .
A fascinating forthcoming paper from the October issue of the Journal of Consumer Research applies this theory to product names .
The researchers find that product names with vowel sounds that convey positive attributes about the product are deemed more favorable by consumers .
Front vowel sounds are ones that are made with the tongue forward in the mouth , such as the sound of the letter " I " in mill .
Back vowel sounds are ones that are made with the tongue farther back in the mouth , such as the " a " sound in mall .
Numerous prior studies have shown that the two types of vowel sounds tend to be associated with different concepts that are strikingly uniform , even across cultures .
Front vowel sounds convey small , fast , or sharp characteristics , while back vowel sounds convey large , slow , or dull characteristics .
" The implications of phonetic symbolism for brand names are relatively straightforward , " write Tina M. Lowrey and L. J. Shrum ( University of Texas -- San Antonio ) .
" If sounds do convey certain types of meaning , then perceptions of brands may be enhanced when the fit between the sound symbolism and the product attributes is maximized . "
The researchers created fictitious brand names that varied only by one vowel sound ( e.g. nillen / nallen ) .
They then varied product categories between small , fast , sharp objects -- such as knives or convertibles -- and products that are large , slow , and dull , such as hammers and SUVs .
They asked participants to choose which of the word pair they thought was a better brand name for the product .
Overwhelmingly , participants preferred words with front vowel sounds when the product category was a convertible or a knife ( by about a 2:1 margin ) , but preferred words with back vowel sounds when the product category was an SUV or hammer ( again , by about a 2:1 margin ) .
The researchers also tested a vowel sound that is generally associated with negative meaning ( e.g. , the " yoo " sound in the word " putrid " ) .
Regardless of product category , words this vowel sound were least preferred by consumers .
" New brands are frequently created , and thus so are new brand names .
In many cases , brand managers use various linguistic devices to increase the memorability of those names , " the researchers write .
" Our findings suggest that in these cases , understanding the relation between the sounds generated by vowels and consonants and the meanings that are associated with these sounds would be useful . "

Preface for 2009
It has been two years since this column was first published , and despite a new Democratic administration and further scientific evidence debunking the Official Conspiracy
Theory , the situation is largely unchanged .
The United States is still occupying the nations of Iraq and Afghanistan , causing an appalling number of civilian deaths , creating resentment and hatred of the U.S. among the local populations , making the world a more dangerous place ( according to three former CIA agents ) and further bankrupting Americans in the process .
Domestically , assaults continue on the rights and freedoms that America was once famous for .
The mainstream media ( and many on the Internet ) continue to characterize those who sensibly disbelieve the Official Conspiracy Theory as " conspiracy theorists " and " nutjobs " ; the ever - growing body of evidence against that official version of events continues to be ignored , downplayed , and misrepresented .
The " Big Lie " theory espoused by Hitler has thus once again been proven correct .
Few Americans are willing to put up with the discomfort of seeing things as they really are in this situation .
Of the " further scientific evidence " mentioned above , I will highlight only one item : the finding , by an international team of scientists , that a huge amount of high - tech nano - thermite was used in the demolition of the World Trade Center buildings .
The PDF of the study published in The Open Chemical Physics Journal may be read here ( 25 pages ) and is highly recommended .
Beyond the higher numbers of casualties for both U.S. troops and locals in the occupied areas , little in the column below would merit change .
If you have not yet been willing to face the unpleasant truth of this situation , I encourage you to to do so .

Epic Disaster and Failure All Around
Six years ago , on September 11 , 2001 , America 's staggeringly expensive defense system failed catastrophically .
Four airliners were hijacked and then used as weapons ; three were flown into buildings and the fourth crashed on the way to an unknown target .
Three skyscrapers in New York were completely destroyed ( although one had not been hit by a plane ) and the Pentagon suffered serious damage .
Almost three thousand lives were lost , and people are still suffering and dying from the aftereffects .
Last Friday , Discover Magazine reported that " Up to 70 percent of first responders are ill as a result of 9/11 contamination .
If a similar rate of illness holds true for those who lived and worked near the Twin Towers , the number of seriously ill New Yorkers could climb to 300,000 in the near future . "
This disaster should have been prevented , but was not .
The people and organizations charged with detecting and thwarting such an attack failed .
Warnings were in fact given , but as is typical of government action , even the sincere efforts of dedicated individuals were not enough to prevent the organization as a whole from failing , in this case with horrific consequences .

Accountability
Imagine that a group of private firms had been in charge of defending America from attack on 9/11 , and imagine these firms had failed as completely as did our own defense establishment on that day .
What would have happened to those firms and to their executives in the wake of the attacks ?
Businesswoman Martha Stewart went to prison for five months merely for lying to investigators about a stock trade .
Any corporation , small business , or other non-government organization responsible for the death of even a single person through negligence or failure of their product or service might well be taken to court , and those at the top charged with negligent homicide or other serious crime in regards the death .
What on Earth would we have done to people responsible for the incredible failures of September 11 – if those people had not been highly placed in our own government ?
Not only have those responsible for this massive and deadly failure not been held accountable , they have been allowed to use their own failure as a blank check for staggering new police - state powers and for waging aggressive war against Afghanistan and Iraq – two nations which had neither attacked us nor even threatened to attack us , and which were in fact incapable of realistically threatening the most powerful nation on Earth .

Using Grenades to Kill a Fly at a Dinner Party
The 9/11 attacks were not an act of war by any nation 's military , but instead criminal acts committed ( so the Official Story goes ) by a relatively small group of people headed by Osama bin Laden .
War was an entirely inappropriate response to such attacks , and according to many authorities , was illegal under international law ; see also here .
The wars ( and the occupations in the aftermath of the wars ) in Afghanistan and Iraq have already cost over 4,000 American lives – more than the number of lives lost on September 11 .
The total number of American war dead is much higher ( although figures are hard to come by ) if one includes civilian workers and contractors , some of whom are , alarmingly , acting as mercenaries for us .
The number of crippled , blinded , maimed , and other wounded Americans is huge , with total American wounded now standing at over 27,000 and by some estimates , closer to 100,000 .
Civilian deaths in the two nations we have invaded far exceed the numbers of coalition casualties ; last year , a widely - reported study in the medical journal The Lancet found that 655,000 Iraqis had been killed since our invasion of that nation .
Together , Afghanistan and Iraq have suffered " at least 832,962 people . . . killed and 1,590,895 seriously injured " by one current estimate .
It bears repeating :
In the process of hunting down a small band of attackers , we have been responsible for nearly a million deaths and a staggering number of wounded .
Men , women and children have been torn apart by bullets and bombs , burned alive , buried under rubble from their own homes or other buildings , and killed in dozens of other ways .
Over 1.5 million human beings will bear the scars of these wars for life , and that is n't even counting the cost in pain and emotional damage , which will impact future generations as well .
We have also destroyed much of the infrastructure in two nations , doused wide areas with thousands of tons of poisonous and radioactive depleted uranium , and generally wreaked havoc and violence .
No wonder millions of Iraqis have already fled their homes and their nation .
The London Independent reports that perhaps 50,000 of these refugees , including many who are " alarmingly young , " have been forced into prostitution in Syria and elsewhere .
In light of all that , one cannot be surprised that America 's standing in the world has suffered dramatically , with polls finding that large majorities in most nations now believe America is a threat to world peace .
Not only have we squandered the sympathy and good will the world expressed towards us after the 9/11 attacks , we have made ourselves feared , hated , and despised .
It seems almost petty to consider financial costs in light of so much death and pain , but these wars will be a financial millstone around America 's neck for generations .
The country 's financial situation was already grave before the 9/11 attacks ( although few Americans seemed aware of this ) , but since that day our national debt has skyrocketed and our unfunded liabilities have grown even faster than the official debt .
The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are not the only factors in this , but consider : the war in Iraq may already have cost us $ 1 trillion or even $ 2 trillion when future expenses ( for care of wounded soldiers , replacement of lost and destroyed equipment , and other costs ) are included .
The original cost for the Iraq war was estimated by the Pentagon at roughly $ 50 billion ( see " $ 1 trillion " link above ) , so what we have is a $ 50 billion estimate versus a possible $ 2,000 billion ( and rising ) price tag .
Despite all that , we have failed to achieve our objectives .
Indeed , we have made our original problem worse .
Osama bin Laden has not been captured and our own intelligence agencies reported last September that the terror threat has INCREASED because of our efforts .
A recent New York Times / CBS
News poll found that a majority of Americans believe we " made a mistake getting involved in the war in Iraq " – and no wonder .

Was a Better Response Available ?
Our Constitution , our history , and international law all suggest that our response to the 9/11 attacks has been wrong and , once again , outright criminal – even aside from our systematic violations of the Geneva Conventions regarding torture .
Furthermore , there exists a remedy that would have likely succeeded at capturing , killing , or otherwise neutralizing our enemies without causing all the needless death , destruction , and other negative effects of our " Preemptive War " approach .
That remedy , listed by name in Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution , is the use of letters of marque and reprisal .
Congressman ( and now presidential candidate ) Ron Paul introduced the Marque and Reprisal Act of 2001 to deal with the problem of the 9/11 attacks by specifically targeting only the people responsible , rather than going to war with nations that had not attacked us .
Early administrations in U.S. history successfully used letters of marque and reprisal to deal with piracy .
Paul 's legislation was ignored in favor of our present , incredibly disastrous course of action .
Why ?

About the List , and an Omission
I have limited the list below to items I find personally compelling .
I have also put aside several well - known reasons for concern about the official 9/11 story because of widespread and heated disagreement over their meaning .
That does not mean the listed items are uncontroversial ; nearly everything related to September 11 is controversial .
The most obvious omission is the collapse of the three buildings at Ground Zero in New York .
Burning skyscrapers rarely fall down , and burning steel - framed skyscrapers that have completely collapsed – at near free - fall speed , into their own footprints , the way professionally demolished buildings do – are so rare that I know of only three : the Twin Towers and their lesser - known companion Building 7 , on September 11 , 2001 .
Amazingly , the idea that all three of these buildings – one of which was not hit by a plane – would collapse in precisely this way without demolition charges or other covert assistance is controversial .
That does not mean the matter is settled ; it is not settled , and the fact and manner of these building collapses remain important reasons to suspect foul play on the part of some person or persons in addition to the hijackers .
But given that expert opinion is divided on the topic and that the WTC building collapses are already the subject of more discussion than perhaps any other element of the 9/11 story , I have left this very large concern off my list .
Still , the collapse of those towers is worth a moment 's reflection .
Note that the first steel - framed skyscraper dates to 1885 , so we have 122 years of real - world data to draw upon .
How many other steel - framed buildings ( skyscrapers , not utility buildings or smaller structures without protective insulation around the steel ) have collapsed from fire in those 122 years ?
Once again : none that I know of .
Certainly not the Empire State Building , which was hit by a B - 25 bomber in 1945 – and which sustained a substantial fire as a result .
The building still stands today .
In Los Angeles , the First Interstate Bank Building sustained a horrific fire in 1988 ; the LA Fire Department called it " . . . the worst , most devastating high - rise fire in the history of Los Angeles . "
The account at lafire.com continues : " Extinguishing this blaze at the 62 - story First Interstate Bank Building , 707 West Wilshire Boulevard , required the combined efforts of 64 fire companies , 10 City rescue ambulances , 17 private ambulances , 4 helicopters , 53 Command Officers and support personnel , a complement of 383 Firefighters and Paramedics , and considerable assistance from other City departments . "
No collapse , though .
In 2004 , a high - rise in Caracas burned , suffering severe damage to the top 22 stories .
Here again , no collapse .
The only near - example I could find was of the Windsor Building in 2005 , which was steel - reinforced concrete rather than steel - framed , and which collapsed only in part and in stages ( see also here ) .
What happened was nothing like the near freefall collapse of all three WTC buildings on 9/11 .
Those who insist the three buildings at ground zero collapsed because of fire may be right , but so much suggests otherwise that a careful , independent , and unbiased investigation seems an obvious necessity .
Unfortunately , much of the relevant evidence was quickly destroyed – but I am getting ahead of myself .
( For a level - headed recap of major concerns about the WTC events , consider Why Did the Trade Center Skyscrapers Collapse ? by Morgan Reynolds ; for a reminder that the WTC buildings may indeed have collapsed from the fires , click here for a recent story about a Berkeley professor 's study which supports that position , although few details are yet available ) .

The List
Top Ten Reasons for a New Investigation of 9/11
10 ) The Project for a New American Century
This group of neo-cons , including several in the Bush Administration , made it clear years before 9/11 that " a new Pearl Harbor " would be necessary to rally public opinion around their violent plans for taking over the Middle East .
For details , see the New American Century website , begun in the 1990s and still active .
David Ray Griffin titled his book The New Pearl Harbor : Disturbing Questions about the Bush Administration and 9/11 in reference to that " Pearl Harbor " comment .
When those who benefit from a crime have expressed a desire and claimed a " need " for that crime beforehand , it is natural and realistic to consider them as possible suspects in the crime .
This is surely one reason that , according to a Scripps Howard / Ohio University poll last year , " Thirty - six percent of respondents overall said it is ' very likely ' or ' somewhat likely ' that federal officials either participated in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon or took no action to stop them ' because they wanted the United States to go to war in the Middle East . ' "
Other polls ( see here , here , and here ) have found much higher percentages ( as much as 90 % ) who believe the 9/11 attacks were orchestrated or covered up in some fashion by the U.S. government – an opinion shared by many overseas , by the majority of New Yorkers , by many NY police and firefighters , and by numerous scientists and academics .
9 ) $ 2.3 Trillion went MISSING from the Pentagon before September 11 , 2001
The day before the terror attacks of 9/11/2001 , Donald Rumsfeld said the Pentagon could not track how 25 % of its entire budget is spent ; at the time , he said the Defense Department was missing $ 2.3 trillion dollars ( link is to a CBS " Eye on America " report by Vince Gonzalez ; highly recommended ) .
A trillion is a thousand billion , and a billion is a thousand million .
Can that much money actually be misplaced ?
Even if $ 100 billion was lost and another $ 100 billion stolen , that leaves $ 2.1 trillion to account for – plus whatever is unaccounted for since 2001 .
One can be certain those trillions were spent on something , by somebody – officially accounted for or not .
And yes : it does seem suspicious that the Pentagon " lost " such an ocean of money in the few years leading up to the 9/11 events .
At the very least , those trillions could have bought a more effective defense for America than we actually had .
When Enron lost a few piddly billions through fraud and mismanagement ( perhaps $ 70 billion ) , the people at the top of that organization went to prison .
8 ) Our defense system – the most expensive on Earth – was useless , yet those responsible were not held accountable
Have those responsible for the failure to detect , prevent , or even respond appropriately at the time to the attacks been fired , hauled into court , charged with anything , fined , or otherwise inconvenienced ?
No .
The entire defense and intelligence community has a single legitimate function : to protect the people of this nation from attack .
America pays more for defense than any other nation in the world , by a large margin ; Americans have a right to expect their defense and intelligence agencies will detect and prevent attacks , or at least respond swiftly and effectively to any attack in progress .
Certainly , Americans have the right to expect their government will not provoke attacks against them – by , for example , repeated and violent meddling in other nations around the world .
The system failed , thousands died , and yet no one has been held accountable .
The government running this protection racket has shown no interest in getting to the bottom of why such a failure happened and in punishing or at least replacing those responsible for the failure .
Bush actually opposed an investigation into the intelligence failures leading to events of 9/11 ( as did others in the administration ) .
Why ?
7 ) Foreknowledge : Relevant intelligence was ignored and insiders were warned
There are many reasons for believing that hard - won intelligence and outright warnings were ignored ; see here , here , and here for examples .
Again , the question is : why ?
Alleged insider trading and other stock market action prior to 9/11 is another reason to suspect foreknowledge of the attacks .
This topic was reported in the major media briefly and then fell off the mainstream radar .
Still another reason for suspicion is that many among the power elite were apparently warned shortly before 9/11 not to fly on that date .
6 ) President Bush continued reading The Pet Goat to children instead of being whisked to safety or doing his job
Here is the Wikipedia article on the topic , including links to video of the President 's reaction to the news that America was under attack .
There are at least two issues here : first , Bush was at a publicly - scheduled event and thus attackers could easily have known his location .
One would have expected the Secret Service to have immediately removed the President to safety upon learning that the nation was under attack .
We have all seen the Secret Service spring into action to protect a President ( when Reagan was shot , for example ) , and while Bush was not near the hostile actions occurring in the north , there was no way to know what other hostile actions might have been planned or in progress .
Besides , one would hope the President would have more important things to attend to after learning that Americans were dying in unprecedented attacks on their home soil .
But if the attacks were expected , then everything changes .
In that case , Bush and his Secret Service detail would have known he was in no danger and that he had nothing important to be doing right then .
This is n't courtroom - level proof of anything ; as I said above , these 10 points are ones I find personally compelling .
It could just be that everyone was in shock and not thinking clearly .
The second reason for listing this point is subjective .
Watch the video of Bush in the minutes after he is told that an attack is in progress ( here 's a copy , hosted at The Memory Hole website ) , and , well – see what you see .
5 ) Passports fluttering down from the WTC
You 've seen video ( and may have seen live coverage at the time ) of the airliners slamming into the towers of the World Trade Center at hundreds of miles per hour and the ensuing fireballs .
( Here 's one ; many others are available on the web , from many vantage points ) .
Naturally , your first thought was : " I bet one of the passenger 's passports will survive that crash and flutter to Earth without so much as a scratch or a singe . "
And you were right !
Almost nothing else survived the crash and fire ( in any of the four airliner tragedies that day ) – massive steel - framed skyscrapers were brought down by the fire , we are told – but one thing did survive : a passport from one of the hijackers .
In fact , not one but TWO passports , both in fine condition , were recovered near the scene , and – proving that miracles do happen – both were from evildoers .
All by itself , this is enough to prove – beyond anything I would consider reasonable doubt – that we are not getting an honest and accurate accounting of the day 's events .
This seemingly minor detail is a mistake of such magnitude that it calls the entire Official Story into doubt .
4 ) Huge airliner vanishes at Pentagon ; no bodies , no debris to speak of – no plane !
Take a look for yourself : see an airliner ?
For that matter , can you spot the plane at the Flight 93 crash site ?
Me neither .
See also here .
Some experts say this is to be expected ; for example , flight 93 just sort of embedded itself in the ground , which " liquefied " when hit .
As soon as excavation is started and both the plane and the passenger bodies are found under the ground , I 'll consider such an explanation at least slightly plausible .
In the meantime , it is worth knowing that several on - the - scene observers saw the same thing YOU see in the photos and video : basically , nothing – no airliner or any suggestion that an airliner had been there .
You can read Dr. Karen Kwiatkowski's report of her experience at the Pentagon right after the impact , here , along with 9/11 - related reports and comments from many other military people , active and retired ( and on other pages at the site , from people in other fields ) .
The site , http://www.patriotsquestion911.com/, offers commentary from a claimed :
110 + Senior Military , Intelligence Service , Law Enforcement , and Government Officials
200 + Engineers and Architects
50 + Pilots and Aviation Professionals
150 + Professors Question 9/11
190 + 9/11 Survivors and Family Members
90 + Entertainment and Media Professionals
This is an excellent resource .
I urge you to visit http://www.patriotsquestion911.com/; you will find enough material to keep you busy for days .
The Official Story about 9/11 does not stand up well to the observations and commentary presented by the hundreds of very credible people at this site .
3 ) FBI immediately confiscated video of Pentagon event
Why on Earth was video from a gas station across from the Pentagon taken into custody and kept from the pubic , and for that matter how did the FBI manage to get to the gas station " within minutes " after the impact ?
This point not only goes with # 4 above : I list it because there is clearly no legitimate " national security " reason for keeping this video from the public for even a single day .
We have all seen airliners ; nothing top - secret is involved .
Unless we are being lied to , of course .
2 ) Obstruction of justice and tampering with evidence
If there is one thing even a child knows about crime scenes , it is that you do n't mess with the evidence .
This point is constantly hammered home in television shows and movies , and in fact tampering with evidence is a serious crime [ use menu box at link and scroll down to " tampering " ] .
Evidence tampering is a felony that you , as a mere citizen , might actually go to prison for .
Yet most of the steel in the collapsed World Trade Center buildings was quickly sold off for scrap ( see also here ) .
This would be the steel that failed so spectacularly and unexpectedly in a fire that today , six years later , experts are still arguing over whether such an event was even really possible or whether something else ( say , demolition charges ) might have been involved .
Darn .
Would n't it be nice to have the actual steel handy for testing ?
The steel beams from the WTC towers are only the most well - known examples of 9/11 evidence being destroyed or tampered with .
1 ) Use of 9/11 to enable tyranny
Covert attacks on one 's homeland or on one 's military abroad – blamed on foreigners or other enemies – have been used repeatedly in history to rally citizen support for war and tyranny .
These are called false flag attacks .
Hitler used the Reichstag fire to create the dictatorial Nazi state , beginning with the Reichstag Fire Decree and then the Enabling Act .
Many believe that the Nazis set the fire themselves for this purpose , but the tactic works even when an actual enemy makes the attack .
Perhaps the Communists really did set the fire as the Nazis claimed ; either way , Hitler was able to use the fire to gather dictatorial powers , eliminating basic rights for German citizens – who were told , naturally , that this was all for their own protection .
Eventually , Hitler 's National Socialist regime murdered millions of Germans and millions of foreigners , and caused the indirect death of millions more .
Giving up freedom for protection did not work well for the Germans .
It never does .
It is known that in 1962 , the CIA planned a false - flag operation ( in which terrorist attacks would have been staged in America itself ) to be blamed on Cuba , for the purpose of creating public support for military action against Castro .
Operation Northwoods was never activated .
Was 9/11 a set of false flag attacks , designed to help the Bush administration gain police - state powers and to create support for aggressive war in the Middle East ?
That is certainly possible .
Bush was planning to attack both Afghanistan and Iraq before 9/11 , and he attacked Iraq despite knowing Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction .
Either way , the 9/11 attacks have been used , very successfully , as cover for tyranny and aggressive war .
Consider the passage of blatantly unconstitutional laws including the Patriot Act and the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , both of which illegally strip Americans of rights enshrined in the Constitution and in common law ( although the second of those Acts is aimed primarily at non-citizens , Americans are also jeopardized by the Act directly , as almost any citizen can be declared an “ enemy combatant ” ) .
Consider the widely - discussed and illegal use of torture by the United States against detainees in the War on Terror .
Consider the John Warner Defense Authorization
Act of 2007 which deals a blow to the protections of the Posse Comitatus Act , paving the way for Bush ( or any future president ) to simply declare an emergency and use American troops against American citizens .
Consider the $ 385 million Halliburton contract for domestic concentration camps ( they are being called " detention camps " ) announced in January of 2006 and pretty much ignored by the media since .
And consider , of course , the war in Afghanistan , the war in Iraq , and the constant saber - rattling in recent months for an attack on Iran .
This has all been incredibly profitable for the military - industrial complex and for many in the power elite .
None of it would have been possible without an enabling event – a " new Pearl Harbor " to rally Americans around a militaristic administration that claimed to be protecting the homeland .
9/11 was that event .
Whether the 9/11 attacks were actually instigated , financed , and planned by a small group of distant Arabs living in caves , or whether some other explanation is nearer the truth , one thing cannot be disputed and must not be missed : Americans have allowed those attacks to be used against themselves .
Our rights are gone , our money is gone , our respect among other nations is gone , many of our sons and daughters are dead , and things look even bleaker for the next generation , which is inheriting quagmires that we cannot manage or pay for even today , but may be with us for decades .
The likely response by future administrations to public unrest over these matters will be to clamp down even more , which the Bush administration 's enabling legislation will greatly facilitate .
The 9/11 attacks have been used to destroy America in ways that no mere terrorist assault could ever do .
And that is the number one reason for a new , independent , unbiased investigation into the events of September 11 , 2001 .

Cheney impeachment bill gains yet another co-sponsor
by Nick Juliano
On Tuesday , a northern Virginia Democrat decided to add his support to a growing movement in the House of Representatives to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
A spokesman for Rep. Jim Moran told RAW STORY that the congressman had decided to co-sponsor the impeachment bill introduced in April by Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio .
When he announced the bill , Kucinich , who is currently seeking the Democratic nomination for president , said that he would n’t push his fellow lawmakers to sign on .
But the bill has gradually gained support since then , garnering at least 10 co-sponsors , including Moran , according to the Library of Congress .
AfterDowningStreet.org lists 12 co-sponsors to the impeach - Cheney bill .

Arms deals with the Saudis have been worth billions to the UK
BBC investigation
The UK 's biggest arms dealer , BAE Systems , paid hundreds of millions of pounds to the ex-Saudi ambassador to the US , Prince Bandar bin Sultan .
The payments were made with the full knowledge of the Ministry of Defence .
Prince Bandar " categorically " denied receiving any improper payments and BAE said it acted lawfully at all times .
The MoD said information about the Al Yamamah deal was confidential .
Sir Raymond Lygo , a former chief executive of BAE , told the BBC's World Business Report that there had been " nothing untoward " about the arms deal .
" I was the one who won the contract , " he said .
" I do n't know anything about him ( the prince ) at all .
I would have remembered that name . "
All that BAE has ever rejected is any suggestion that the commission payments were illegal

When asked about the secret payments , Sir Lygo said that it was not going on when the deal was signed .
" I would have known if it was going on at the time .
I was not aware of it , so as far as I am concerned it was not occuring .
" Yes , we paid agents .
Nothing illegal about that .
It was absolutely in accordance with the law at the time ... there was nothing untoward about the deal whatsoever . "
Private plane
The investigation found that up to £ 120 m a year was sent by BAE Systems from the UK into two Saudi embassy accounts in Washington .
There was n't a distinction between the accounts of the embassy or official government accounts ... and the accounts of the royal family
David Caruso
American bank investigator
Timeline : BAE Systems probe
The BBC's Panorama programme has established that these accounts were actually a conduit to Prince Bandar for his role in the 1985 deal to sell more than 100 warplanes to Saudi Arabia .
The purpose of one of the accounts was to pay the expenses of the prince 's private Airbus .
David Caruso , an investigator who worked for the American bank where the accounts were held , said Prince Bandar had been taking money for his own personal use out of accounts that seemed to belong to his government .
He said : " There was n't a distinction between the accounts of the embassy , or official government accounts as we would call them , and the accounts of the royal family . "
Mr Caruso said he understood this had been going on for " years and years " .
" Hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars were involved , " he added .
Investigation stopped
According to Panorama 's sources , the payments were written into the arms deal contract in secret annexes , described as " support services " .
They were authorised on a quarterly basis by the MoD .
Prince Bandar was Saudi ambassador to the US for 20 years
It remains unclear whether the payments were actually illegal - a point which depends in part on whether they continued after 2001 , when the UK made bribery of foreign officials an offence .
The payments were discovered during a Serious Fraud Office ( SFO ) investigation .
The SFO inquiry into the Al Yamamah deal was stopped in December 2006 by attorney general Lord Goldsmith .
Prime Minister Tony Blair declined to comment on the Panorama allegations .
But he said that if the SFO investigation into BAE had not been dropped , it would have led to " the complete wreckage of a vital strategic relationship and the loss of thousands of British jobs " .
The SFO 's inquiry is thought to have angered Saudi Arabia , to the point where there was a risk that BAE could lose a contract to sell the new Typhoon fighter to Riyadh .
Prince Bandar , who is the son of the Saudi defence minister , served for 20 years as US ambassador and is now head of the country 's national security council .
Panorama reporter Jane Corbin explained that the payments were Saudi public money , channelled through BAE and the MoD , back to the Prince .
The SFO had been trying to establish whether they were illegal when the investigation was stopped , she added .
She believed the payments would thrust the issue back into the public domain and raise a number of questions .
' Bad for business '
Labour MP Roger Berry , head of the House of Commons committee which investigates strategic export controls , told the BBC that the allegations must be properly investigated .
If there was evidence of bribery or corruption in arms deals since 2001 - when the UK signed the OECD 's Anti-Bribery Convention - then that would be a criminal offence , he said .
He added : " It 's bad for British business , apart from anything else , if allegations of bribery popping around are n't investigated . "
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said that if ministers in either the present or previous governments were involved there should be a " major parliamentary inquiry " .
" It seems to me very clear that this issue has got to be re-opened , " Mr Cable told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight .
" It is one thing for a company to have engaged in alleged corruption overseas .
It is another thing if British government ministers have approved it . "
Panorama will be broadcast on Monday 11 June 2007 on BBC One at 2030 BST
The graffiti was discovered by staff on Tuesday
The man , who might speak with a Liverpudlian accent , is said to be 5ft 6 in , of medium build with fair hair .
He may be using the name Brian Finlay and make conversation about the Celts , police on Orkney added .
Staff found the graffiti daubed on the 5,000 - year - old site - including the words " Scouse Celts " - on Tuesday .
Monument managers said vandals had entered one of the houses at the site and drawn a smiley face , their name and the date with black marker pen , defacing both the dresser and one of the bed posts .
Ruled out
It was initially thought that the vandalism may have been carried out by tourists travelling round the island in a silver people carrier .
However , police ruled the group out of their inquiries after questioning the vehicle 's occupants earlier .
The man they are now looking for is believed to be sleeping rough on Orkney and has a backpack with him .
Historic Scotland , which is responsible for the upkeep of the world heritage site , said that it was liaising with its conservation centre in Edinburgh to find the best way of removing the graffiti as soon as possible .
" Graffiti removal on buildings of historical or architectural importance needs to be handled sensitively , " said a spokeswoman .
Our visitors have reacted with surprise and sympathy to the damage caused
Historic Scotland spokeswoman
" The careful process needs to ensure any long - term damage caused by the graffiti is kept to a minimum and the stone itself is not further damaged as part of the graffiti removal process .
" Our visitors have reacted with surprise and sympathy to the damage caused . "
The cost - which is expected to be substantial - is not yet known .
Skara Brae was first discovered following a major storm in 1850 , which battered the island to such an extent that an outline of a series of stone buildings was revealed .
A series of excavations was carried out over the next century , finally revealing eight stone dwellings which were originally believed to be an Iron Age settlement .
However , in the 1970s radiocarbon dating showed that the village was originally built between 3200 and 2200 BC .

Notice how each picture is actually an image of something that is 10 times bigger or smaller than the one preceding or following it .
The number that appears on the lower right just below each image is the size of the object in the picture .
On the lower left is the same number written in powers of ten , or exponential notation .
Exponential notation is a convenient way for scientists to write very large or very small numbers .
For example , compare the size of the Earth to the size of a plant cell , which is a trillion times smaller : Earth = 12.76 x 10 +6 = 12,760,000 meters wide
( 12.76 million meters ) Plant Cell = 12.76 x 10 - 6 = 0.00001276 meters wide
( 12.76 millionths of a meter ) Scientists examine things in particular ways using a combination of very sophisticated equipment , everyday instruments , and many unlikely tools .
Some phenomena that scientists want to observe are so tiny that they need a magnifying glass , or even a microscope .
Other things are so far away that a powerful telescope must be used in order to see them .
It is important to understand and be able to compare the size of things we are studying .
To learn more about the relative sizes of things , visit our Perspectives : Powers of 10 activity site .
Note : -
The sequence of images in this tutorial has been optimized for maximum visual impact .
Due to the fact that discrete exponential increments are not always the most convenient interval for illustrating this concept , our artists and programmers have made dimensional approximations in some cases .
As a consequence , the relative size and positioning of several objects in the tutorial reflect this fact .
The original concept underlying this tutorial was advanced by Dutch engineer and educator Kees Boeke , who first utilized powers to aid in visualization of large numbers in a 1957 publication entitled " Cosmic View , the Universe in 40 Jumps " .
Several years later , in 1968 , architect Charles Eames , along with his wife Ray , directed a " rough sketch " film of the same concept and finally completed the work ( entitled the " Powers of Ten " ) with the assistance of Philip Morrison in 1977 .
Other notable contributors to this effort include Philip 's wife Phylis , who has assisted in translation of the concept into several beautifully illustrated books that are currently still available through the booksellers .

Like dogs , sharks rely on a keen sense of smell to track down food .
But new research shows noses are n’t the only way that sharks detect smells :
Their entire bodies , in fact , function as giant noses capable of even picking up the “ shape ” of a smell .
Running down the sides of every shark are nerve - packed strips called lateral lines .
Researchers know these sensitive structures can detect the faint vibrations emitted by living things in water , but their ability to pick up scent was previously unknown .
Even more surprising , researchers said , is that lateral lines can detect the 3 - D “ plumes ” of scents — structures resembling the turbulence left behind after waving a hand through thick fog or steam .
" Odor plumes are complex , dynamic , three - dimensional structures used by many animal species to locate food , mates and home sites , " said Jelle Atema , a Boston University biologist and co-author of the study detailed in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Experimental Biology .
When deprived of the “ odor plume ” information , the study shows , sharks are unable to find the source of an odor .
To figure this out , researchers ran a stream of squid odor through a circulating water tank and noted a shark ’s ability to find the source — with no eddies and plumes to track , the shark almost always failed .
They then used the same setup , but added a brick behind the scent source , thereby jumbling up the flow of the squid smell and giving the shark more information to track it .
Sure enough , the sharks fared much better in locating the " prey . "
Researchers also numbed the lateral lines with a common antibiotic , producing a similarly disabling effect on the sharks ' hunting abilities .
" The results are interesting for our understanding of animal navigation under water and for the development of guidance of autonomous underwater vehicles , ” Atma said .

CBS fires consultant Gen. Batiste over VoteVets ad ; ' We went to war with a fatally flawed strategy ' Mike Sheehan
Published : Friday May 11 , 2007 Print This Email This Retired Army Major Gen. John Batiste has been asked to leave his position as a consultant to CBS News over a new advertisement criticizing the Iraq war .
The ad was produced by the group VoteVets .
Appearing on MSNBC's Countdown , Batiste , former First Infantry Division commander , tells host Keith Olbermann in the video clip below , " I 'm no longer wearing the uniform of our country ; I have no ties to the defense industry ; I can speak honestly , I have a duty to do so .
And I know there [ are ] other generals both active duty and retired that are doing all they can within their means .
In my case , I 'll continue to speak out . "
After Olbermann asks Batiste about the war itself , the retired general says , " We went to war with a fatally flawed strategy ...
This is all about a president who 's relying almost solely on the military component of strategy to accomplish the mission in Iraq . "
" Sadly , " he continues , " we 're missing the diplomatic , the political , and the economic components that are fundamental and required to be successful . "

WSRF - based modeling of clinical trial information for collaborative cancer research .
In 8th IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid ( CCGrid08 ) , May 2008 .
To appear . [ bib | .pdf ]
The CancerGrid consortium is developing open - standards cancer informatics to address the challenges posed by the modern cancer clinical trials .
This paper presents a service - oriented software paradigm implemented in CancerGrid to derive clinical trial information management systems for collaborative cancer research across multiple institutions .
Our proposal is founded on a combination of a clinical trial ( meta ) model and WSRF ( Web Services Resource Framework ) , and is currently being evaluated for use in early phase trials .
Although primarily targeted at cancer research , our approach is readily applicable to other areas for which a similar information model is available .

Unfolding abstract datatypes .
Submitted for publication , January 2008 . [ bib | .pdf ]
One of the most fundamental tools in the programmer 's toolbox is the abstract datatype .
However , abstract datatypes are not widely used in functional programming , perhaps because they are not subject to familiar proof methods such as equational reasoning and induction - in essence , because they are a form of codata rather than a form of data .
We show that proof methods for corecursive programs are the appropriate techniques to use .
In particular , building on established work on final coalgebra semantics for object - oriented programs , we show that the reasoning principles of unfold operators are perfectly suited for the task .
We illustrate with solutions to two recent problems in the literature .

International Institute for Software Technology , United Nations University . [ bib | .pdf ]
This paper explains how semantic frameworks can be used to support successful e-Government initiatives by connecting system design to a shared understanding of interactions and processes .
It shows how metadata standards and repositories can be used to establish and maintain such an understanding , and how they can be used in the automatic generation and instantiation of components and services .
It includes an account of a successful implementation at an international level , and a brief review of related approaches .

Report on Fourth Workshop on “ Commercial Users of Functional Programming ” .
Oxford University Computing Laboratory , December 2007 . [ bib | .pdf ]
The goal of the Commercial Users of Functional Programming series of workshops is “ to build a community for users of functional programming languages and technology ” .
The fourth workshop in the series took place in Freiburg , Germany on 4th October 2007 , colocated as usual with the International Conference on Functional Programming .
The workshop is flourishing , having grown from an intimate gathering of 25 people in Snowbird in 2004 , through 40 in Tallinn in 2005 and 57 in Portland in 2006 , to 104 registered participants ( and more than a handful of casual observers ) this time .
For the first time this year , the organisers had the encouraging dilemma of receiving more offers of presentations than would fit in the available time .
The eventual schedule included an invited talk by Xavier Leroy , eleven contributed presentations , and an energetic concluding discussion .
Brief summaries of each appear below .

Model - driven architecture for cancer research .
In Software Engineering and Formal Methods , September 2007 . [ bib | .pdf ]
It is a common phenomenon for research projects to collect and analyse valuable data using ad - hoc information systems .
These costly - to - build systems are often composed of incompatible variants of the same modules , and record data in ways that prevent any meaningful result analysis across similar projects .
We present a framework that uses a combination of formal methods , model - driven development and service - oriented architecture ( SOA ) technologies to automate the generation of data management systems for cancer clinical trial research , an area particularly affected by these problems .
The SOA solution generated by the framework is based on an information model of a cancer clinical trial , and comprises components for both the collection and analysis of cancer research data , within and across clinical trial boundaries .
While primarily targeted at cancer research , our approach is readily applicable to other areas for which a similar information model is available .

Parametric datatype - genericity .
Submitted for publication , July 2007 . [ bib | .pdf ]
Datatype - generic programs are programs that are parametrized by a datatype or type functor .
There are two main styles of datatype - generic programming : the Algebra of Programming approach , characterized by structured recursion operators parametrized by a shape functor , and the Generic Haskell approach , characterized by case analysis over the structure of a datatype .
We show that the former enjoys a kind of parametricity , relating the behaviours of generic functions at different types ; in contrast , the latter is more ad hoc , with no coherence required or provided between the various clauses of a definition .

Verifying business process compatibility .

Business Process Modelling Notation ( BPMN ) , developed by the Business Process Management Initiative ( BPMI ) , intends to bridge the gap between business process design and implementation .
In this paper we describe a process - algebraic approach to verifying process interactions for business collaboration described in BPMN .
We first describe briefly a process semantics for BPMN in Communicating Sequential Processes ; we then use a simple example of business collaboration to demonstrate how our semantic model may be used to verify compatibility between business participants in a collaboration .

The essence of the Iterator pattern .
Submitted for publication , 2007 .
Revised ( December 2007 ) version of [ iterator - msfp ] . [ bib | .pdf ]
The Iterator pattern gives a clean interface for element - by - element access to a collection .
Imperative iterations using the pattern have two simultaneous aspects : mapping and accumulating .
Various existing functional iterations model one or other of these , but not both simultaneously .
We argue that McBride and Paterson 's applicative functors , and in particular the corresponding traverse operator , do exactly this , and therefore capture the essence of the Iterator pattern .
We present some axioms for traversal , and illustrate with a simple example , the wordcount problem . [ bpmn-csp ]

A process semantics for BPMN .
Draft , 2007 . [ bib | .pdf ]
Business Process Modelling Notation ( BPMN ) , developed by the Business Process Management Initiative ( BPMI ) , intends to bridge the gap between business process design and implementation .
However , the specification of the notation does not include a formal semantics .
This paper shows how a subset of the BPMN can be given a process semantics in Communicating Sequential Processes .
Such a semantics allows developers to formally analyse and compare BPMN diagrams .
A realistic example of a complex business process is included .

Unifying theories of objects .
In Davies and Gibbons [ ifm2007 ] , pages 599- 618 . [ bib | .pdf ]
We present an approach to modelling Abadi - Cardelli - style object calculi as UTP designs .
Here we provide a core object calculus with an operational small - step evaluation rule semantics , and a corresponding UTP model with a denotational relational predicate semantics .
For clarity , the UTP model is defined in terms of an operand stack , which is used to store the results of subprograms .
Models of a less operational nature are briefly discussed .
The consistency of the UTP model is demonstrated by a structural induction proof over the operations of the core object calculus .
Overall , our UTP model is intended to provide facilities for encoding both object - based and class - based languages .

Integrated Formal Methods , volume 4591 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science .
Springer - Verlag , 2007 . [ bib | | .pdf ]
The design and analysis of computing systems presents a significant challenge : systems need to be understood at many different levels of abstraction , and examined from many different perspectives .
Formal methods - languages , tools , and techniques with a sound , mathematical basis - can be used to develop a thorough understanding , and to support rigorous examination .
Further research into effective integration is required if these methods are to have a significant impact outside academia .
The Integrated Formal Methods ( IFM ) series of conferences seeks to promote that research , to bring together the researchers carrying it out , and to disseminate the results of that research among the wider academic and industrial community .
Earlier meetings in the series were held at : York ( 1999 ) ; Dagstuhl ( 2000 ) ; Turku ( 2002 ) ; Kent ( 2004 ) ; Eindhoven ( 2005 ) .
IFM 2007 is the largest to date , with 32 technical papers ( from 85 submissions ) , 3 invited talks , 3 workshops , and a tutorial .
The success of the series reflects the enthusiasm and efforts of the IFM community , and the organisers would like to thank the speakers , the committee , and the reviewers for their contributions . [ dgp ] Jeremy Gibbons .
Datatype - generic programming .
In Backhouse et al. [ ssdgp ] . [ bib | .pdf ]
Generic programming aims to increase the flexibility of programming languages , by expanding the possibilities for parametrization - ideally , without also expanding the possibilities for uncaught errors .
The term means different things to different people : parametric polymorphism , data abstraction , meta - programming , and so on .
We use it to mean polytypism , that is , parametrization by the shape of data structures rather than their contents .
To avoid confusion with other uses , we have coined the qualified term datatype - generic programming for this purpose .
In these lecture notes , we expand on the definition of datatype - generic programming , and present some examples of datatype - generic programs .
We also explore the connection with design patterns in object - oriented programming ; in particular , we argue that certain design patterns are just higher - order datatype - generic programs .

A leitmotif in the evolution of programming paradigms has been the level and extent of parametrisation that is facilitated - the so - called genericity of the paradigm .
The sorts of parameters that can be envisaged in a programming language range from simple values , like integers and floating - point numbers , through structured values , types and classes , to kinds ( the type of types and / or classes ) .
Datatype - generic programming is about parametrising programs by the structure of the data that they manipulate , exploiting that structure when it is relevant and ignoring it when it is not .
Programming languages most commonly used at the present time do not provide effective mechanisms for documenting and implementing datatype genericity .
This volume is a contribution towards improving the state of the art . [ gip ]

Generic and indexed programming .
In Marco Morazan , editor , Trends in Functional Programming , 2007 . [ bib | .pdf ]
The EPSRC - funded Generic and Indexed Programming project will explore the interaction between datatype - generic programming ( DGP ) - programs parametrized by the shape of their data - and indexed programming ( IP ) - lightweight dependently - typed programming , with programs indexed by type - level representations of properties .
Integrating these two notions will provide new ways for programmers to capture abstractions .

A process - algebraic approach to workflow specification and refinement .
In Software Composition , 2007 . [ bib | .pdf ]
This paper describes a process algebraic approach to specification and refinement of workflow processes .
In particular , we model both specification and implementation of workflows as CSP processes .
CSP 's behavioural models and their respective refinement relations not only enable us to prove correctness properties of an individual workflow process against its behavioural specification , but also allows us to design and develop workflow processes compositionally .
Moreover , coupled with CSP is an industrial strength automated model checker FDR , which allows behavioural properties of workflow models to be proved automatically .
This paper details some CSP models of van der Aalst et al .'s control flow workflow patterns , and illustrates behavioural specification and refinement of workflow systems with a business process scenario .

Metamorphisms : Streaming representation - changers .
Science of Computer Programming , 65:108-139 , 2007 .
Revised version of [ metamorphisms - mpc ] . [ bib | .pdf ]
Unfolds generate data structures , and folds consume them .
A hylomorphism is a fold after an unfold , generating then consuming a virtual data structure .
A metamorphism is the opposite composition , an unfold after a fold ; typically , it will convert from one data representation to another .
In general , metamorphisms are less interesting than hylomorphisms : there is no automatic fusion to deforest the intermediate virtual data structure .
However , under certain conditions fusion is possible : some of the work of the unfold can be done before all of the work of the fold is complete .
This permits streaming metamorphisms , and among other things allows conversion of infinite data representations .
We present the theory of metamorphisms and outline some examples .

Cross - trial query system for cancer clinical trials .
In International Joint Conferences on Computer , Information and Systems Sciences and Engineering ( CISSE ) , December 2006 . [ bib | .pdf ]
Data sharing represents one of the key objectives and major challenges of today 's cancer research .
CancerGrid , a consortium of clinicians , cancer researchers , computational biologists and software engineers from leading UK institutions , is developing open - standards cancer informatics addressing this challenge .
The CancerGrid solution involves the representation of a widely accepted clinical trials model in controlled vocabulary and common data elements ( CDEs ) as the enabling factor for cancer data sharing .
This paper describes a cancer data query system that supports data sharing across CancerGrid - compliant clinical trial boundaries .
The formal specification of the query system allows the model - driven development of a flexible , web - based interface that cancer researchers with limited IT experience can use to identify and query common data across multiple clinical trials .

However , using current programming languages , these elements can only be expressed extra-linguistically : as prose , pictures , and prototypes .
We believe that this is not inherent in the patterns themselves , but evidence of a lack of expressivity in the languages of today .
We expect that , in the languages of the future , the code part of design patterns will be expressible as reusable library components .
Indeed , we claim that the languages of tomorrow will suffice ; the future is not far away .
The necessary features are higher - order and datatype - generic constructs ; these features are already or nearly available now .
We argue the case by presenting higher - order datatype - generic programs capturing Origami , a small suite of patterns for recursive data structures .

The essence of the Iterator pattern .
In Conor McBride and Tarmo Uustalu , editors , Mathematically - Structured Functional Programming , 2006 .
Superseded by [ iterator ] .
[ bib | .pdf ]
The Iterator pattern gives a clean interface for element - by - element access to a collection .
Imperative iterations using the pattern have two simultaneous aspects : mapping and accumulating .
Various functional iterations model one or other of these , but not both simultaneously .
We argue that McBride and Paterson 's idioms , and in particular the corresponding traverse operator , do exactly this , and therefore capture the essence of the Iterator pattern .
We present some axioms for traversal , and illustrate with a simple example , the repmin problem . [ fission ] Jeremy Gibbons .
Fission for program comprehension .

Fusion is a program transformation that combines adjacent computations , flattening structure and improving efficiency at the cost of clarity .
Fission is the same transformation , in reverse : creating structure , ex nihilo .
We explore the use of fission for program comprehension , that is , for reconstructing the design of a program from its implementation .
We illustrate through rational reconstructions of the designs for three different C programs that count the words in a text file .

In Principles of Programming Languages , pages 206 - 217 , January 2006 .
Accompanying proofs at http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~nad/repos/fast-and-loose-proofs/. [ bib | .pdf ]
We justify reasoning about non-total ( partial ) functional languages using methods seemingly only valid for total ones ; this permits `fast and loose ' reasoning without actually being loose .
Two languages are defined , one total and one partial , with identical syntax .
The semantics of the partial language includes partial and infinite values and lifted types , including lifted function spaces .
A partial equivalence relation is then defined , the domain of which is the total subset of the partial language .
It is proved that if two closed terms have the same semantics in the total language , then they have related semantics in the partial language .
It is also shown that the partial equivalence relation gives rise to a bicartesian closed category , which can be used to reason about values in the domain of the relation .

An unbounded spigot algorithm for the digits of π. American Mathematical Monthly , 113( 4):318-328 , 2006 .

[ bib | .pdf ] Rabinowitz and Wagon ( American Mathematical Monthly 102( 3) :195-203 , 1995 ) present a spigot algorithm for computing the digits of π.
A spigot algorithm yields its outputs incrementally , and does not reuse them after producing them .
Their algorithm is inherently bounded ; it requires a commitment in advance to the number of digits to be computed , and in fact might still produce an incorrect last few digits .
We propose two streaming algorithms based on the same characterization of π , with the same incremental characteristics but without requiring the prior bound .

The purpose of this tutorial is to draw together ideas from the Design Patterns community ( the Gang of Four : Gamma , Helm , Johnson , Vlissides ) and the Functional Programming world ( eg Bird , Meertens , Hughes ) .
In particular , the thesis is that whereas design patterns must be expressed extra-linguistically ( as prose , diagrams , examples ) in object - oriented languages , they may be captured directly as abstractions using higher - order operators in functional programming languages .
Therefore , they may be reasoned about , type - checked , applied and reused , just as any other abstractions may be .
We argue this case by developing the idea of higher - order operators , specifically for capturing patterns of computation in programs .
We then build on this to show how the intentions behind a number of the Gang of Four patterns - such as Composite , Visitor , Iterator , and Builder - have higher - order operators as their analogues in functional languages .
Specifically , the structure of these patterns is determined essentially by the structure of the data involved , and they can be captured as generic programs parametrized by that datatype .
The aim is to give greater insight into and understanding of already - familiar patterns .

TypeCase : A design pattern for type - indexed functions .
In Daan Leijen , editor , Haskell Workshop , 2005 . [ bib | .pdf ]
A type - indexed function is a function that is defined for each member of some family of types .
Haskell 's type class mechanism provides collections of open type - indexed functions , in which the indexing family can be extended by defining a new type class instance but the collection of functions is fixed .
The purpose of this paper is to present TypeCase : a design pattern that allows the definition of closed type - indexed functions , in which the index family is fixed but the collection of functions is extensible .
It is inspired by Cheney and Hinze 's work on lightweight approaches to generic programming .
We generalise their techniques as a design pattern .
Furthermore , we show that type - indexed functions with type - indexed types , and consequently generic functions with generic types , can also be encoded in a lightweight manner , thereby overcoming one of the main limitations of the lightweight approaches .

Unfolds generate data structures , and folds consume them .
A hylomorphism is a fold after an unfold , generating then consuming a virtual data structure .
A metamorphism is the opposite composition , an unfold after a fold ; typically , it will convert from one data representation to another .
In general , metamorphisms are less interesting than hylomorphisms : there is no automatic fusion to deforest the intermediate virtual data structure .
However , under certain conditions fusion is possible : some of the work of the unfold can be done before all of the work of the fold is complete .
This permits streaming metamorphisms , and among other things allows conversion of infinite data representations .
We present the theory of metamorphisms and outline some examples .

Disciplined , efficient , generalised folds for nested datatypes .
Formal Aspects of Computing , 16( 1):19 - 35 , 2004 . [ bib | .pdf ]
Nested ( or non-uniform , or non-regular ) datatypes have recursive definitions in which the type parameter changes .
Their folds are restricted in power due to type constraints .
Bird and Paterson introduced generalised folds for extra power , but at the cost of a loss of efficiency : folds may take more than linear time to evaluate .
Hinze introduced efficient generalised folds to counter this inefficiency , but did so in a pragmatic way , at the cost of a loss of reasoning power : without categorical or equivalent underpinnings , there are no universal properties for manipulating folds .
We combine the efficiency of Hinze 's construction with the powerful reasoning tools of Bird and Paterson 's. [ patterns ] Jeremy Gibbons .

Generic programming consists of increasing the expressiveness of programs by allowing a wider variety of kinds of parameter than is usual .
The most popular instance of this scheme is the C++ Standard Template Library .
Datatype - generic programming is another instance , in which the parameters take the form of datatypes .
We argue that datatype - generic programming is sufficient to express essentially all the genericity found in the Standard Template Library .
Moreover , datatype - generic programming is a precisely - defined notion with a rigorous mathematical foundation , in contrast to generic programming in general and the C++ template mechanism in particular , and thereby offers the prospect of better static checking and a greater ability to reason about generic programs .
This paper describes work in progress .

Arithmetic coding is a method for data compression .
It produces a theoretically optimal compression under much weaker assumptions than Huffman and Shannon - Fano , and can compress within one bit of the limit imposed by Shannon 's Noiseless Coding Theorem .
Earlier presentations provided little in the way of proof of why the various steps in the encoding process were correct , particularly when it came to the specification of precisely what problem the implementation solved , and the details of why the inverse operation of decoding was correct .
Our aim in these lectures is to provide a formal derivation of basic algorithms for coding and decoding .
Our development makes heavy use of the algebraic laws of folds and unfolds .
One novel result concerns a new pattern of computation , which we call streaming , whereby elements of an output list are produced as soon as they are determined ( and which has nothing to do with lazy evaluation ) .

Origami programming .
In Gibbons and de Moor [ fop ] , pages 41 - 60 . [ bib | .pdf ]
One style of functional programming is based purely on recursive equations .
Such equations are easy to explain , and adequate for any computational purpose , but hard to use well as programs get bigger and more complicated .
In a sense , recursive equations are the `assembly language ' of functional programming , and direct recursion the goto .
As computer scientists discovered in the 1960s with structured programming , it is better to identify common patterns of use of such too - powerful tools , and capture these patterns as new constructions and abstractions .
In functional programming , in contrast to imperative programming , we can often express the new constructions as higher - order operations within the language , whereas the move from unstructured to structured programming entailed the development of new languages .
In this chapter we will look at folds and unfolds as abstractions .
In a precise technical sense , folds and unfolds are the natural patterns of computation over recursive datatypes ; unfolds generate data structures and folds consume them .
Functional programmers are very familiar with the foldr function on lists , and its directional dual foldl ; they are gradually coming to terms with the generalisation to folds on other datatypes .
The computational duals , unfolds , are still rather unfamiliar ; we hope to show here that they are no more complicated than , and just as useful as , folds , and to promote a style of programming based on these and similar recursion patterns .

Functional programming has come of age : it is now a standard course in any computer science curriculum .
Ideas that were first developed in the laboratory environment of functional programming have proved their values in wider settings , such as generic Java and XML .
The time is ripe , therefore , to teach a second course on functional programming , delving deeper into the subject .
This book is the text for such a course .
The emphasis is on the fun of programming in a modern , well designed programming language such as Haskell .
There are chapters that focus on applications , in particular pretty printing , musical composition , hardware description , and graphical design .
These applications are interspersed with chapters on techniques , such as the design of efficient data structures , interpreters for other languages , program testing and optimisation .
These topics are of interest to every aspiring programmer , not just to those who choose to work in a functional language .
Haskell just happens to be a very convenient vehicle for expressing the ideas , and the theme of functional programming as a lingua franca to communicate ideas runs throughout the book .

Software architects such as Garlan and Katz promote the separation of computation from coordination .
They encourage the study of connectors as first - class entities , and superposition of connectors onto components as a paradigm for component - oriented programming .
We demonstrate that this is a good model for what visual programming tools like IBM's VisualAge actually do .
Moreover , Fiadeiro and Maibaum 's categorical semantics of parallel programs is applicable to this model , so we can make progress towards a formal semantics of visual programming .

Functional programs are merely equations ; they may be manipulated by straightforward equational reasoning .
In particular , one can use this style of reasoning to calculate programs , in the same way that one calculates numeric values in arithmetic .
Many useful theorems for such reasoning derive from an algebraic view of programs , built around datatypes and their operations .
Traditional algebraic methods concentrate on initial algebras , constructors , and values ; dual co-algebraic methods concentrate on final co-algebras , destructors , and processes .
Both methods are elegant and powerful ; they deserve to be combined .

Program construction is about turning specifications of computer software into implementations .
Doing so in a way that guarantees correctness is an undertaking requiring deep understanding of the languages and tools being used , as well as of the application domain .
Recent research aimed at improving the process of program construction exploits insights from abstract algebraic tools such as lattice theory , fixpoint calculus , universal algebra , category theory and allegory theory .

On the semantics of nested datatypes .
Information Processing Letters , 80(5):233-238 , December 2001 . [ bib | .ps.gz ]
Nested ( or non-regular or non-uniform ) datatypes are recursively defined parameterised datatypes in which the parameter of the datatype changes in the recursive call .
The standard semantic definition of recursively defined datatypes is as initial algebras in the category Set of sets and total functions .
Bird and Meertens have shown that this theory is inadequate to describe nested datatypes .
Instead , one solution proposed there was to define them as initial algebras in the functor category Nat( Set ) , with objects all endofunctors on Set and arrows all natural transformations between them .
We show here that initial algebras are not guaranteed to exist in the functor category itself , but that they do exist in one of its subcategories : the category of all cocontinuous endofunctors and natural transformations .
This category is then a suitable semantic domain for nested datatypes , both first order and higher - order .

The approximation lemma was recently introduced as a simplification of the well - known take lemma , and is used to prove properties of programs that produce lists of values .
We show how the approximation lemma , unlike the take lemma , can naturally be generalised from lists to a large class of datatypes , and present a generic approximation lemma that is parametric in the datatype to which it applies .
As a useful by - product , we find that generalising the approximation lemma in this way also simplifies its proof .

The point - free relational calculus has been very successful as a language for discussing general programming principles .
However , when it comes to specific applications , the calculus can be rather awkward to use : some things are more clearly and simply expressed using variables .
The combination of variables and relational combinators such as converse and choice yields a kind of nondeterministic functional programming language .
We give a semantics for such a language , and illustrate with an example application .

It is well - known that each polymorphic function satisfies a certain equational law , called a naturality condition .
Such laws are part and parcel of the basic toolkit for improving the efficiency of functional programs .
More rarely , some polymorphic functions also possess a higher - order naturality property .
One example is the operation unzip that takes lists of pairs to pairs of lists .
Surprisingly , this property can be invoked to improve the asymptotic efficiency of some divide - and - conquer algorithms from O( n log n ) to O( n ) .
The improved algorithms make use of polymorphic recursion , and can be expressed neatly using nested datatypes , so they also serve as evidence of the practical utility of these two concepts .

Bridging the algorithm gap : A linear - time functional program for paragraph formatting .
Science of Computer Programming , 35 ( 1 ) , 1999 . [ bib | .ps.gz ]
In the constructive programming community it is commonplace to see formal developments of textbook algorithms .
In the algorithm design community , on the other hand , it may be well known that the textbook solution to a problem is not the most efficient possible .
However , in presenting the more efficient solution , the algorithm designer will usually omit some of the implementation details , thus creating an algorithm gap between the abstract algorithm and its concrete implementation .
This is in contrast to the formal development , which usually proceeds all the way to the complete concrete implementation of the less efficient solution .
We claim that the algorithm designer is forced to omit some of the details by the relative expressive poverty of the Pascal - like languages typically used to present the solution .
The greater expressiveness provided by a functional language would allow the whole story to be told in a reasonable amount of space .
In this paper we use a functional language to present the development of a sophisticated algorithm all the way to the final code .
We hope to bridge the algorithm gap between abstract and concrete implementations , and thereby facilitate communication between the constructive programming and algorithm design communities .

This paper is about point - free ( or `pointless ' ) calculations - calculations performed at the level of function composition instead of that of function application .
We address this topic with the help of an example , namely calculating the radix - sort algorithm from a more obvious specification of sorting .
The message that we hope to send is that point - free calculations are sometimes surprisingly simpler than the corresponding point - wise calculations .

Folds are appreciated by functional programmers .
Their dual , unfolds , are not new , but they are not nearly as well appreciated .
We believe they deserve better .
To illustrate , we present ( indeed , we calculate ) a number of algorithms for computing the breadth - first traversal of a tree .
We specify breadth - first traversal in terms of level - order traversal , which we characterize first as a fold .
The presentation as a fold is simple , but it is inefficient , and removing the inefficiency makes it no longer a fold .
We calculate a characterization as an unfold from the characterization as a fold ; this unfold is equally clear , but more efficient .
We also calculate a characterization of breadth - first traversal directly as an unfold ; this turns out to be the `standard ' queue - based algorithm .

A good way of developing a correct program is to calculate it from its specification .
Functional programming languages are especially suitable for this , because their referential transparency greatly helps calculation .
We discuss the ideas behind program calculation , and illustrate with an example ( the maximum segment sum problem ) .
We show that calculations are driven by promotion , and that promotion properties arise from universal properties of the data types involved .

Representing x and y by trees , Bird derives an algorithm for the problem taking time proportional to the sum of their depths .
Bird 's derivation is more complicated than necessary .
By the simple tactic of delaying a design decision ( in this case , the decision to represent the lists as trees ) as long as possible , we obtain a much simpler solution .

The Third Homomorphism Theorem is a folk theorem of the constructive algorithmics community .
It states that a function on lists that can be computed both from left to right and from right to left is necessarily a list homomorphism - it can be computed according to any parenthesization of the list .
We formalize and prove the theorem , and describe two practical applications : to fast parallel algorithms for language recognition problems and for downwards accumulations on trees .

The tree - drawing problem is to produce a `tidy ' mapping of elements of a tree to points in the plane .
In this paper , we derive an efficient algorithm for producing tidy drawings of trees .
The specification , the starting point for the derivations , consists of a collection of intuitively appealing criteria satisfied by tidy drawings .
The derivation shows constructively that these criteria completely determine the drawing .
Indeed , there is essentially only one reasonable drawing algorithm satisfying the criteria ; its development is almost mechanical .
The algorithm consists of an upwards accumulation followed by a downwards accumulation on the tree , and is further evidence of the utility of these two higher - order tree operations .

Downwards passes on binary trees are essentially functions which pass information down a tree , from the root towards the leaves .
Under certain conditions , a downwards pass is both `efficient ' ( computable in a functional style in parallel time proportional to the depth of the tree ) and `manipulable ' ( enjoying a number of distributivity properties useful in program construction ) ; we call a downwards pass satisfying these conditions a downwards accumulation .
In this paper , we show that these conditions do in fact yield a stronger conclusion : the accumulation can be computed in parallel time proportional to the logarithm of the depth of the tree , on a CREW PRAM machine .

We argue that Ariola and Felleisen 's and Maraist , Odersky and Wadler 's axiomatization of the call - by - need lambda calculus forms a suitable formal basis for tracing evaluation in lazy functional languages .
In particular , it allows a one - dimensional textual representation of terms , rather than requiring a two - dimensional graphical representation using arrows .
We describe a program LetTrace , implemented in Gofer and tracing lazy evaluation of a subset of Gofer. [ dashed ] Jeremy Gibbons .

The initial - algebra approach to modelling datatypes consists of giving constructors for building larger objects of that type from smaller ones , and laws identifying different ways of constructing the same object .
The recursive decomposition of objects of the datatype leads directly to a recursive pattern of computation on those objects , which is very helpful for both functional and parallel programming .
We show how to model a particular kind of directed acyclic graph using this initial - algebra approach .

The Bird - Meertens Formalism , or ` Squiggol ' , is a calculus for the construction of programs from their specifications by a process of equational reasoning .
Developments are directed by considerations of data , as opposed to program , structure .
This paper presents a brief introduction to the philosophy and notation of the calculus , in the guise of the ( well - known ) derivation of a linear - time solution to the `maximum segment sum ' problem .

Accumulations are higher - order operations on structured objects ; they leave the shape of an object unchanged , but replace elements of that object with accumulated information about other elements .
Upwards and downwards accumulations on trees are two such operations ; they form the basis of many tree algorithms .
We present two EREW PRAM algorithms for computing accumulations on trees taking O( logn ) time on O ( n / logn ) processors , which is optimal .

The tree - drawing problem is to produce a `tidy ' mapping of elements of a tree to points in the plane .
In this paper , we derive an efficient algorithm for producing tidy drawings of trees .
The specification , the starting point for the derivations , consists of a collection of intuitively appealing criteria satisfied by tidy drawings .
The derivation shows constructively that these criteria completely determine the drawing .
Indeed , there is essentially only one reasonable drawing algorithm satisfying the criteria ; its development is almost mechanical .
The algorithm consists of an upwards accumulation followed by a downwards accumulation on the tree , and is further evidence of the utility of these two higher - order tree operations .

An accumulation is a higher - order operation over structured objects of some type ; it leaves the shape of an object unchanged , but replaces each element of that object with some accumulated information about the other elements .
Upwards and downwards accumulations on trees are two instances of this scheme ; they replace each element of a tree with some function - in fact , some homomorphism - of that element 's descendants and of its ancestors , respectively .
These two operations can be thought of as passing information up and down the tree .
We introduce these two accumulations , and show how together they solve the so - called prefix sums problem .

Algebras for Tree Algorithms .
D. Phil. thesis , Programming Research Group , Oxford University , 1991 .
Available as Technical Monograph PRG - 94 .

This thesis presents an investigation into the properties of various algebras of trees .
In particular , we study the influence that the structure of a tree algebra has on the solution of algorithmic problems about trees in that algebra .
The investigation is conducted within the framework provided by the Bird - Meertens formalism , a calculus for the construction of programs by equational reasoning from their specifications .
We present three different tree algebras : two kinds of binary tree and a kind of general tree .
One of the binary tree algebras , called `hip trees ' , is new .
Instead of being built with a single ternary operator , hip trees are built with two binary operators which respectively add left and right children to trees which do not already have them ; these operators enjoy a kind of associativity property .
Each of these algebras brings with it with a class of `structure - respecting ' functions called catamorphisms ; the definition of a catamorphism and a number of its properties come for free from the definition of the algebra , because the algebra is chosen to be initial in a class of algebras induced by a ( cocontinuous ) functor .
Each algebra also brings with it , but not for free , classes of `structure - preserving ' functions called accumulations .
An accumulation is a function that preserves the shape of a structured object such as a tree , but replaces each element of that object with some catamorphism applied to some of the other elements .
The two classes of accumulation that we study are the `upwards ' and `downwards ' accumulations , which pass information from the leaves of a tree towards the root and from the root towards the leaves , respectively .
Upwards and downwards accumulations turn out to be the key to the solution of many problems about trees .
We derive accumulation - based algorithms for a number of problems ; these include the parallel prefix algorithm for the prefix sums problem , algorithms for bracket matching and for drawing binary and general trees , and evaluators for decorating parse trees according to an attribute grammar .

We present a new formalism of labelled binary trees , using two partial binary constructors instead of the usual total ternary constructor .
This formalism is complemented by some higher - order operators , encapsulating common patterns of computation on trees .
We explore their use by deriving solutions to a couple of algorithmic problems on trees .
The work proceeds in the Bird - Meertens style .
This is a calculus for programs , closely related to applicative programming languages .
Expressions are written at the function level , avoiding the use of unnecessary names and being as concise as possible .
Derivations are performed by program transformation - the application of correctness - preserving transformations to an initial specification , with the intention of improving its efficiency without changing its meaning .

More calls for attorney general to resign over firings of US attorneys
By Barry Grey
9 April 2007
Appearing on the “ Fox News Sunday ” program , former speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich joined other prominent Republicans and a larger number of Democratic lawmakers in urging Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales to resign over his role in the firings of eight US attorneys .
The purge of federal prosecutors — seven were dismissed last December 7 and the eighth some months before — has sparked an escalating political scandal .
The fallout from the firings has exposed a systematic effort by the White House and Justice Department to stack US attorney offices around the country with right - wing Bush loyalists prepared to use their prosecutorial powers to suppress the voting rights of working class and minority citizens and launch trumped - up voter fraud prosecutions to discredit Democratic candidates .
The scandal has implicated Karl Rove , Bush ’s chief political adviser , and other high - level White House officials , as well as Gonzales and his top lieutenants in the Justice Department .
Mounting evidence from thousands of pages of emails and other documents released by the administration to the judiciary committees in the Democratic - controlled House of Representatives and Senate , as well as public testimony by Gonzales ’ former chief of staff , indicate that the political conspiracy was intensified in preparation for the 2008 presidential election .
Assertions by Gonzales , both in statements to the press and testimony earlier this year before the Senate Judiciary Committee , that he played no significant role in the US attorney firings have been exposed as lies .
Gonzales , a Bush acolyte since the president ’s term as Texas governor in the 1990s , is scheduled to testify before the Senate committee on April 17 .
While Bush has publicly reiterated his continuing support for Gonzales , some Republican notables are calling for Gonzales to step down in the hope that his departure will defuse the scandal and shield Rove and other White House officials , including Bush .
Leading Democrats appear eager to assist in such a cover-up .
Last week , New York Senator Charles Schumer , who has been heading the investigation , proposed on national television a “ compromise ” to end a stalemate with the administration over demands by the House and Senate judiciary committees that Rove , former White House counsel Harriet Miers and other White House officials testify on their roles in the US attorney firings .
The White House has refused to allow its aides to testify , citing executive privilege .
It has also withheld internal White House documents on the planning and execution of the dismissals .
Instead , the White House insists that Rove and other aides may be questioned only in private , without being sworn in , and with no transcripts of the proceedings .
Both the Senate and House judiciary committees last month voted to authorize the issuance of subpoenas ordering the White House aides to testify in public and under oath , but have failed to execute the subpoenas .
On April 1 , on the “ Face the Nation ” news program , Schumer accepted the White House proposal , with the caveat that that there be transcripts .
Senator Arlen Specter , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee who was also on the program , immediately endorsed the Democratic cave - in .
However , to this point the White House has rebuffed the offer .
On Sunday , Gingrich said , “ You know , the buck has to stop somewhere , and I ’m assuming it ’s the attorney general and his immediate team . ”
Asked by interviewer Chris Wallace whether Gonzales should resign , Gingrich said , “ I can not imagine how he is going to be effective for the rest of this administration .
I think the country , in fact , would be much better served to have a new team at the Justice Department , across the board . ”
Gingrich ’s statement followed the announcement Friday that Monica Goodling , Gonzales ’ senior counsel and liaison to the White House , had resigned her post , effective immediately .
Goodling figures prominently in the emails and other documents thus far released on discussions between Rove , Miers and other White House aides and Justice Department officials on the purge of federal prosecutors .
Last month she went on indefinite leave .
She was summoned to testify by the judiciary committees in both houses of Congress , but two weeks ago she invoked her 5th Amendment right against self - incrimination and declared she would not answer any questions from congressional investigators .
Goodling became the third high - ranking Justice Department official to resign since the US attorney scandal erupted last January .
Michael A. Battle , the former director of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys , who notified the prosecutors of their dismissals , announced last month that he was leaving to enter private practice .
D. Kyle Sampson resigned as Gonzales ’ chief of staff on March 12 .
Sampson testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 29 and flatly contradicted Gonzales on two key questions .
He said Gonzales was directly involved in the discussions concerning the firing of the federal prosecutors and had presided over a November 27 , 2006 meeting where the final list of targeted US attorneys was reviewed .
He also testified that Gonzales was aware of plans to use a provision inserted into the revised USA Patriot Act of 2006 to appoint new US attorneys on an interim basis so as to circumvent the Senate confirmation process .
Goodling ’s political profile and academic résumé provide a telling indication of the type of individuals who have been recruited by the Bush administration to administer the Justice Department .
Only 33 , she is a 1995 graduate of Messiah College in Grantham , Pennsylvania and a 1999 graduate of Regent University Law School in Virginia , founded by the right - wing Christian fundamentalist Pat Robertson .
In her letter of resignation to Gonzales , she wrote , “ May God bless you richly as you continue your service to America . ”
According to a column published Sunday in the Washington Post by Dahlia Lithwick , a former career official in the Justice Department told the newspaper that Goodling “ forced many very talented career people out of main Justice so she could replace them with junior people that were either loyal to the administration or would score her some points . ”
The column quotes a former classmate as saying Goodling “ developed a very positive reputation for people coming from Christian schools into Washington looking for employment in government ... ”
Lithwick continues , “ Goodling is one of 150 graduates of Regent University who have served in this administration , as Regent ’s web site proudly proclaims .
Pretty impressive for a 29 - year - old school .
The university says that ‘ approximately one out of every six Regent alumni is employed in some form of government work . ’
“ Former attorney general John Ashcroft teaches at Regent , and graduates have obtained senior positions in the Bush administration .
The express goal is not only to tear down the wall between church and state in America but also to enmesh the two . ”
One of Goodling ’s main tasks was to help coordinate the removal of US attorneys who either prosecuted Republican lawmakers for corruption or refused to indict Democratic politicians and pro-Democratic voter - registration groups for “ voter fraud ” during the run-up to the 2004 and 2006 elections .
The purge was part of a broader drive to install what Kyle Sampson called “ loyal Bushies ” as US attorneys , especially in so - called battleground states deemed critical to Republican electoral fortunes .
One result of this campaign is the failure of the Justice Department ’s Civil Rights Division to bring a single voting case on behalf of an African American since 2001 .
Instead , the division has been deployed to oppose supposed voter fraud or discrimination against Christians .
More than a dozen Bush administration insiders have been appointed as federal prosecutors over the past two years , according to government records .
These include right - wing lawyers who worked at Justice Department headquarters or the White House and were dispatched to fill top posts in United States attorney offices on an interim basis , such as J. Timothy Griffin in Arkansas , Bradley J. Schlozman in Missouri , R. Alexander Acosta in Miami and Matthew M. Dummermuth in Iowa .
Griffen and Schlozman , for example , were directly involved in Republican efforts to challenge and block likely Democratic voters or discredit Democratic campaigns by issuing voter fraud indictments on the eve of elections .
One such Bush loyalist is Rachel K. Paulose , who was sworn in on March 9 of this year as the United States attorney in Minneapolis , Minnesota .
She was a senior aide to Paul J. McNulty , the deputy attorney general , before she was named as an interim United States attorney in Minneapolis in early 2006 .
She was subsequently confirmed on a permanent basis by a unanimous vote of the Senate .
Her appointment followed the resignation of Thomas B. Heffelfinger .
Emails released to Congress strongly suggest that Heffelfinger was among those targeted for dismissal , but decided instead to resign .
Last Thursday , three of Paulose ’s four top deputies resigned their leadership positions in protest over what they regarded as Ms. Paulose ’s ideologically driven and dictatorial managerial style .
As Gonzales ’ Senate hearing approaches , the administration is refusing to release further documents to the Judiciary Committee .
At issue are several hundred pages of documents , most of them unedited versions of documents that were provided to Congress only in edited form .
The Senate Judiciary Committee is reportedly set to issue a new round of subpoenas Thursday for these documents , as well as for all other documents the Justice Department has related to the firings .
Meanwhile , House and Senate staffers are conducting private interviews with high - ranking Justice Department officials , and Gonzales has holed himself up with Republican officials to practice his testimony in advance of his April 17 appearance .
In addition to the US attorney firings scandal , congressional investigators are requesting documents and testimony in connection with influence peddling and corruption or improper political manipulation of government agencies involving the General Services Administration , the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Education student loan programs .
A House committee is also investigating White House connections to the convicted Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
Following up on Monday night 's Nexus of Terror & Politics report , Keith Olbermann talks with Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) to get more details on the revelation that the Bush Administration used bogus intelligence in order to frighten lawmakers into voting for last August 's expanded FISA bill .
Harman says that after much digging she found the classified intelligence document in question and the document clearly stated that the intelligence community did not deem the source to be reliable .

Olbermann : " Nobody doubts the existence of terrorism or terrorists or the need to act on their existence , but at this point , is our freedom beginning to be or even now already at greater risk from terrorism , or from people who are exploiting the fact of terrorism to gain unprecedented and perhaps irreversible rights to spy and detain and rendition and everything else ? "
Harman : " Well , I think this is a - a quite a scary period in our history and there are right answers .
We can get surveillance right .
I think most of us , maybe all of us in the House and in the Senate support surveilling people who are trying to harm us , but we can do that within the careful framework of FISA .
FISA is not broken .
What 's broken is the view of executive power that some hold in the administration .
They claim it trumps all laws and our constitution . "
LOS ANGELES , July 25 —
On a night four years ago , five soldiers back from three months in Iraq went drinking at a Hooters restaurant and a topless bar near Fort Benning , Ga .
Before the night was over , one of them , Specialist Richard R. Davis , was dead of at least 33 stab wounds , his body doused with lighter fluid and burned .
Two of the group would eventually be convicted of the murder , another pleaded guilty to manslaughter , and the last confessed to concealing the crime .
Now some in Hollywood want moviegoers to decide if the killing is emblematic of a war gone bad , part of a new and perhaps risky willingness in the entertainment business to push even the touchiest debates about post - 9/11 security , Iraq and the troops ’ status from the confines of documentaries into the realm of mainstream political drama .
On Sept. 14 , Warner Independent Pictures expects to release “ In the Valley of Elah , ” a drama inspired by the Davis murder , written and directed by Paul Haggis , whose “ Crash ” won the Academy Award for best picture in 2006 .
The film stars Tommy Lee Jones as a retired veteran who defies Army bureaucrats and local officials in a search for his son ’s killers .
In one of the movie ’s defining images , the American flag is flown upside down in the heartland , the signal of extreme distress .
More often than not , review copies either collect in a pile by the door for trade - in or they ’re used as prizes at PAX .
I ’m aware that this is sort of rude , but we have our own opinions on which games warrant advocacy .
As yesterday ’s news was a thin , absolutely homogenous gruel , we turned to a reviewable copy of Odin Sphere received earlier in the week .
It was poking out from beneath a chair leg and it took some time to find .
Hours later , we realized that a comic had not been written .
The game has interesting systems in place - I would describe it as clever , with its five interlocking stories , elaborate food options , and the Action RPG sugar - rush that binds men ’s souls .
But against this game ’s art , no other feature breaks the surface .
Like a soaring hawk , I often hear the cries below - the deep lament of those who crave the certainty and power of the second dimension , the dimension cast aside by budgetary realities and market demands .
Odin Sphere ’s luscious animation must been seen to be appreciated , which is why I linked to a trailer page above - but even that is insufficient .
We ’d certainly seen screens and trailers before , but we ’d never seen them writ large - seen the incidental animations that add so much life and spirit .
Gigantic player sprites do battle with boss enemies that dwarf even them - sometimes literally dwarf them , because this game has dwarfs in it .
Being 2D , each skirmish area takes place on a circular track similar to Defender .
You can go all the way around it either way , and when you ’ve defeated all of a zone ’s enemies ( and been rewarded based on your performance ) you can leave that circular area for another one , travelling through an entire map made of these nodes .
When you run before multiple layers of painted , parallax countryside …
I mean , when was the last time we got to say parallax ?
I would say that we had travelled back in time , but games of this type were never as beautiful .
It ’s really more like we have travelled sideways , into another timeline where the sprite is still king .
Because this is a DVD - R in a small plastic case , I do n’t know who handled the translation - if Atlus brought it over complete or if they managed it internally .
It ’s so good that I ’m leaning toward the latter .
Seriously , I dug the sender ’s contact information out of the trash so I could call and thank him .
That might be rude , too , I suppose - hopefully I can be forgiven .
I was n’t aware they were making games like this anymore .

Update - 1st August :
The hearing is underway .
Here 's a doozy for you : on Wednesday , the aviation industry is taking five million people - including a lot of their own staff - to court .
If you 're a member or supporter of a group that 's concerned about climate change , the chances are you 're a defendant too .
The industry seems to want to ban five million of us from Heathrow and all routes to the airport , including the Piccadilly line , parts of the rail network , and sections of the M25 and M4 .
In three weeks ' time , the Camp for Climate Action is due to gather near Heathrow to peacefully protest against Heathrow 's vast contribution to climate change ( the airport 's planes emit more greenhouse gases than many individual countries ) and its planned runway expansion .
The owner of Heathrow , the British Airports Authority ( BAA ) , seems to be , frankly , terrified .
It 's seeking an injunction , which names as defendants " all persons acting as members , participants or supporters " of anti-aviation group Plane Stupid , anti-noise group HACAN and AirportWatch .
The injunction is to stop people from setting foot on Heathrow and " the arterial infrastructure serving " it .
So far , so good .
Just another example of the aviation industry 's corporate bullying , albeit a draconian one .
But the interesting bit is that AirportWatch , named on the injunction , is just an umbrella organisation .
Its member organisations include the National Trust , the RSPB , the Woodland Trust , the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England , Transport 2000 , Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace , among many others .
The combined supporter base of these organisations is well over five million people .
And it includes the Queen , patron of the RSBP and CPRE .
Prince Charles , president of the National Trust , would also be banned from Heathrow and its surrounds - as would Imran Khan and Shane Warne , who recently fund - raised for HACAN .
Even more bizarrely , the injunction covers many of BAA 's own staff .
Their 2006 Corporate Responsibility report ( pdf ) tells us that BAA sent its airport staff to the RSPB nature reserve at Lochwinnoch " where they spent the day building nest boxes for the native bird population " .
Which seems to me to fit the description of " persons acting as members , participants or supporters " .
When we got the news , after sitting around open - mouthed for a bit , we suspected that BAA did n't know who or what AirportWatch was ; they 'd panicked , we thought .
Had n't done their research .
But ' a source ' who 's spoken to BAA has just told us that BAA is deliberately making the ban as broad as possible , and leaving it up to the police to apply it with common sense .
Which means , if BAA wins , the police will have the right to stop you , me or Her Maj from , say , getting on " all railway trains and carriages operating upon the Piccadilly line " ...
I 've been trying to get hold of an electronic copy of the injunction for all the defendants out there but I 've had no luck so far ( the version delivered was so large it filled four ring - binders ) .
If I manage , I 'll post it here .
Take action !
If you 're not one of the defendants and are feeling a bit left out , feel free to show a bit of solidarity ; just sign up to a green organisation of your choice .
If we can get another five million people banned from Heathrow , BAA might find it does n't need its third runway after all ...
In fact , they could solve all their problems of lost luggage , queues and general chaos while they 're at it .
British newspapers will and should be subject to some form of new external regulation , the outgoing prime minister , Tony Blair , said yesterday in a broadside that attacked the media for behaving like feral beasts and eschewing balance or proportion .
In a sweeping critique of the industry , Mr Blair claimed newspapers , locked into an increasingly bitter sales war in a 24 - hour news environment , indulged in " impact journalism " in which truth and balance had become secondary to the desire for stories to boost sales and be taken up by other media outlets .
He admitted that his own attempts to bypass traditional media through websites and press conferences had been " to no avail " .
He also conceded that he was partly to blame for the predicament , saying his determination to convey the Labour message in the period of opposition and early years in government had made him complicit in the decline in news standards .
But he said the fierce competition for stories had led to the media now hunting in a pack .
" In these modes it is like a feral beast , just tearing people and reputations to bits , but no one dares miss out . "
He added that distinctions between comment and news had become so blurred that it was rare to find newspapers reporting precisely what a politician was saying .
It was incredibly frustrating , he said , adding that politicians had to act immediately to rebut false charges before they became fact .
Mr Blair said he was describing " something few people in public life will say , but most know is absolutely true : a vast aspect of our jobs today - outside of the really major decisions , as big as anything else - is coping with the media , its sheer scale , weight and constant hyperactivity .
At points , it literally overwhelms . "
The damage that can be done " saps the country 's confidence and self - belief " , he said .
" It undermines its assessment of itself , its institutions and above all , it reduces our capacity to take the right decisions , in the right spirit for our future . "
The consequence was a fall in morale in the public services , a loss of trust between politicians and media and even a climate of fear in which those in public life dare not attack the media 's sensationalist culture for fear for the media 's counterblast .
In a world of 24 - hour news and huge diversity of outlets , he said , it is impact that gives a competitive edge .
" Of course the accuracy of a story counts .
But it is secondary to impact .
It is this necessary devotion to impact that is unravelling standards , driving them down , making the diversity of the media not the strength it should be but an impulsion towards sensation above all else . "
" News is rarely news unless it generates heat as much as or more than light .
Second , attacking motive is far more potent than attacking judgement .
It is not enough for someone to make an error .
It has to be venal .
Conspiratorial . "
Moving on to the regulation of newspapers , Mr Blair said changes were inevitable : " As the technology blurs the distinction between papers and television , it becomes increasingly irrational to have different systems of accountability based on technology that no longer can be differentiated in the old way . "
He also questioned whether papers needed some system of accountability that went beyond sales .
He said : " The reality is that the viewers or readers have no objective yardstick to measure what they are being told .
In every other walk of life in our society that exercises power , there are external forms of accountability , not least through the media itself .
The prime minister 's aides admitted he had thought long and hard before making the speech , but felt free to do so now that he was , in his own words , leaving office " still standing " .
Ministers conceded privately that the regulatory structure of newspapers may change over the next decade , but did not believe it would lead to direct regulation .
" It is possible we could end up with a kitemark that websites pass certain tests , but it is a long way away , " said one minister .
There is also ministerial and industry scepticism that EU legislation and the convergence of newspapers and broadcasting would see a single regulatory structure for newspapers and TV .
The coming EU legislation is likely to make the broadcast regulator , Ofcom , responsible for regulating the internet , but is likely to leave unregulated the content of newspapers on the website .

With the recent release of a microcode reliability update on Microsoft ’s site that addresses a handful of Intel Core 2 processors , concern over the pervasiveness of bugs in some of the company ’s latest processors is growing , especially now that OpenBSD founder Theo de Raadt released his own rundown of outstanding , fixed , and what he deems as “ non-fixable bugs . ”
In a post published to the Real World Technologies Web site , however , fellow developer Linus Torvalds said the bugs were of no consequence .
Details are still lacking about what , precisely , the June 22 patch fixes not to mention how severe the actual bugs were but in de Raadt ’s own words , some of the Intel ’s latest processors “ are buggy as hell . ”
Additionally , “ some of these bugs do n’t just cause development / debugging problems , ” according to a de Raadt posting on a mailing list , “ but will * ASSUREDLY * be exploitable from userland code . ”
If true , that could spell trouble for Intel on multiple fronts .
As de Raadt notes , some of the errors found on Intel ’s latest errata ( or error ) list cannot be fixed via the standard microcode updates the chipmaker usually releases .
According to de Raadt , there are 20 to 30 of such bugs in Intel ’s latest errata list that cannot be worked around by operating systems and will be potentially exploitable .
However , Linux founder Linus Torvalds posted a message on the RWT Web site noting the bugs were “ totally insignificant ” .
“ The biggest problem is that Intel should just have
documented the TLB behavior better , ” Torvalds wrote .
“ The Core 2 changes are kind of gray area , and the old documentation simply
did n’t talk about the higher - level page table structures
and the caching rules for them .
“ So that part is just a good clarification , and while it
could be called a “ bug ” just because older CPU ’s did n’t
do that caching , I do n’t think it ’s an errata per se , ” Torvalds added .
“ Of course , if you depended on it not happening ( and a
lot of people did ) , it ’s painful .
But it really does make
the architecture definition better and clearer . ”
As far as Intel is concerned , the company would not comment on whether it agreed with de Raadt ’s assessment or not  or whether there were any imminent plans to recall or respin the chips to solve such bugs .
It did , however , seem to downplay the importance and alleged severity of such bugs in its Core 2 processors .
“ Months ago , we addressed a processor issue by providing a BIOS update for our customers that in no way affects system performance , ” said Nick Knupffer , an Intel spokesman , in an e-mail .
“ We publicly documented this as an erratum in April , ” he continued .
“ All processors from all companies have errata , and Intel has a well - known errata communication process to inform our customers and the public .
Keep in mind the probability of encountering this issue is low . ”
Knupffer went to say that Intel investigates all errata for issues and vulnerabilities and , if found , the company issues fix , usually through a microcode update .
In his post , de Raadt said that “ Intel understates the impact of these erraata [ sic ] very significantly .
Almost all operating systems will run into these bugs . ”
The latest round of patches address the Intel dual - core “ MCW ” and quad - core “ KC ” architecture , and Intel released urgent BIOS and microcode versions for its line up on June 11 .
The affected CPUs included the Core 2 Duo E4000 / E6000 , Core 2 Quad Q6600 , Core 2 Xtreme QX6800 , QX6700 and QX6800 , according to Intel ’s errata ( or error ) list .
Editor ’s Note :
This story has been corrected to add the correct date of Intel ’s recent BIOS updates .
It has also been updated to add an additional quote from de Raadt on Intel ’s response to the errata , and subsequently updated on June 29 to add comments by Linus Torvalds .
WASHINGTON – John Edwards , who yesterday demanded Democratic candidates return any campaign donations from Rupert Murdoch and News Corp. , himself earned at least $ 800,000 for a book published by one of the media mogul ’s companies .
The Edwards campaign said the multimillionaire trial lawyer would not return the hefty payout from Murdoch for the book titled “ Home : The Blueprints of Our Lives . ”
The campaign did n’t respond to a question from The Post about whether it was hypocritical for Edwards to take money from News Corp .
while calling for other candidates not to .
In addition to a $ 500,000 advance from HarperCollins , which is owned by News Corp. , Edwards also was cut a check for $ 300,000 for expenses .
Edwards claimed $ 333,334 in royalties from last year ’s release of the book , according to media accounts .
The campaign said last night that those funds were part of the advance .
He says he gave that amount to charity , which would also provide tax benefits for Edwards .
“ We ’re more than happy to give even more of Murdoch ’s money to Habitat for Humanity and other good causes , ” spokesman Eric Schultz told The Post yesterday .
He declined to show proof , however , that Edwards had donated the $ 500,000 advance or $ 300,000 expense checks to charity .
Meanwhile , Edwards yesterday attacked Hillary Rodham Clinton for taking more than $ 20,000 in donations from News Corp. officials , arguing that the company ’s Fox News Channel is tilted to the right .
News Corp. also owns The New York Post .
Clinton declined to respond .
The Edwards campaign said it would return less than $ 1,000 in donations from three Fox employees .
Languishing in the polls behind Clinton and Barack Obama , Edwards also has led the Democratic field ’s boycott of a Fox co-sponsored presidential debate .
“ The time has come for Democrats to stop pretending to be friends with the very people who demonize the Democratic Party , ” Edwards said .
Neckties can be cool when they ’re not lopsided .
( ( c ) fresh pesh )
His name was the “ Egyptian magician . ”
Well , that was his nickname , anyway .
He lived down the hall from me my sophomore year of high school and delighted in laughing at my mangled attempts at wearing neckties .
I did n’t realize he was laughing at my ties until he decided to offer me one of his secrets .
“ Step inside , ” he offered and waved a hand towards the mirror in his closet .
I never had a name for the solid gold me gave me–a method for tying the perfect tie every time–until two days ago .
Here I am in humid North Carolina for a once - a - decade family reunion , and the dress code is–as luck would have it –strict southern gentleman : suit and tie after 6 pm .
“ Nice Windsor knot , ” my dad remarked two nights ago , and , thrilled to finally have a name for this technique , I now pass on what I learned 15 years ago .
Ladies , I encourage you to pay attention .
If you pass this on to any man who has n’t found it –whether boyfriend , father , son , or stranger –they will love you forever .
So without further ado , I offer the little - known Windsor knot or , in homage to my friend whose name I cannot remember , “ The Egyptian magician knot . ”
Enjoy …

" I think in his actions and the actions in which he has joined , he has made the court an arm of the Republican Party , " Leahy said .
Leahy said he voted for Roberts because he knew Roberts was going to be confirmed anyway and did not want a party - line vote that would encourage Roberts to believe that he was " an appointment of the Republican Party . "
But that is what has happened anyway , Leahy said .
" I love to hear Republicans give lip service to the ideals of the Founding Fathers and then ignore them when it serves their purposes , " he said .
" They ( the Republicans ) say they do n't want an activist Supreme Court , but this is the most activist Supreme Court we have ever seen , running roughshod over the Constitution , like Plessy v. Ferguson did . "
In that landmark case in 1896 , the Supreme Court upheld racial segregation in America under the " separate but equal " doctrine .
This was repudiated in 1954 by the court in another landmark decision , Brown v. Board of Education .
In a 5 - 4 decision a few weeks ago , the Roberts court ruled that race cannot be a factor in the assignment of children to public schools , even when the purpose is to desegregate those schools .
" The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race , " Roberts wrote in his decision .
Leahy said : " I am not sure the president realizes what he has done with the court .
He was told by Dick Cheney and others , ' This is what you are going to do . ' "
Asked to compare Bush with the other presidents he has served with , Leahy stated : " He does not measure up to any of the others .
I have never seen any introspection in him , with the possible exception of the comprehensive immigration bill , and election - year politics pushed him away from that .
Our vice president has an inordinate amount of control over him . "
Leahy says that when he talks to constituents , he finds " there is a real disquietude toward this administration from both Republicans and Democrats on everything from the environment to the war .
They feel that nobody is listening , that the president is not listening to anybody except a small group at the White House , and that he is detached from the country . "
Leahy blames many of the current ills on Congress , however .
" It was because they ( the White House ) had a rubber - stamp Congress for six years , a Congress in their corner , " Leahy said .
" The Senate allowed the White House to replace one majority leader with another !
Bill Frist is a very nice guy , but he did n't have any idea how to lead the Senate .
I can't imagine the Senate allowing the White House to dictate who the majority leader is going to be . "
In late 2002 , Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was replaced by Frist , a senator from Tennessee , after Lott made remarks that seemed to support America 's segregated past .
" Too many members of the House and Senate think their greatest achievement is to win office , " Leahy said .
" Our greatest achievement is to do something good when we get here . "
Leahy 's office is unlike many other offices on Capitol Hill in that it contains no autographed pictures of Leahy standing with famous people .
Instead , it contains pictures that Leahy , a published photographer , has taken .
The centerpiece -- placed , Leahy says , so he can stare into it every day from his desk -- is a haunting one of a man he met in a refugee camp in El Salvador in 1982 .
" Sometimes Washington changes people , " Leahy said .
" We get a sense of our own importance .
But I strongly believe the Senate should be and has been the conscience of the nation . "
*** Update : I ’ve corrected a few mistakes in the intro , and I ’ve attached August ’s PDF of the arguments ( great for printing out ) and added some of his own thoughts .
The arguments themselves are unchanged .
Sorry for any inconvenience !***
August Berkshire , the public relations representative for Minnesota Atheists and Vice - President of Atheist Alliance International , has put together a simple , concise list of “ 18 Unconvincing Arguments for God ” ( PDF ) .
August has said the list was written in order to give Christians ( and those of other faiths ) “ insight as to what arguments are not likely to work with us , as we have already considered them and found them insufficient …
It was meant to be a time - saving device for believers . ”
And if you understand August ’s points , you ’ll certainly get more reception from the atheists you ’re talking to .
We ’ve heard these arguments before and new arguments would better stimulate our curiosity and require new rebuttals .
August has been invited to give this talk the past few years at local Christian colleges and has been featured in the Star Tribune ( Minneapolis - St. Paul , Minnesota ) as a result .
Here is August explaining why he wrote the list :
I have been giving this talk for the past two years specifically to Christian colleges where I am invited to speak .
The impetus happened three years ago , speaking to a “ Creative Evangelism ” class taught by Sherry Bunge Mortenson at Bethel University in St. Paul .
A student asked what would convince me that God exists ?
I named a few miracles that would at least convince me that something supernatural exists .
But the question stuck in my mind and I naturally began to think of what would n’t convince me .
Thus , if the goal of these students was to evangelize an atheist , it seemed perfectly appropriate that I give them a list of what would n’t work , so they could creatively come up with some new arguments , as their class title suggests .
I meant this to be educational and in no way condescending , and that is how I hope the students perceive my presentation .
His revised and updated list is presented for you here :
(1) Holy Books – Just because something is written down does not make it true .
This goes for the Bible , the Qu’ran , and any other holy book .
People who believe the holy book of their religion usually disbelieve the holy books of other religions .
(2) “ Revelations ” – All religions claim to be revealed , usually to people called “ prophets . ”
But a revelation is a personal experience .
Even if the revelations really did come from a god , there is no way we could prove it .
As Thomas Paine said , it is a revelation only to the first person , after that it is hearsay .
People of one religion usually disbelieve the revelations of other religions .
(3) Personal Testimony / Feelings –
This is when you are personally having the revelation or feeling that a god exists .
Though you may be sincere , and even if a god really does exist , a feeling is not proof , either for you or for someone else .
As a matter of fact , scientists have begun to study why some people believe and other do n’t , from a biological perspective .
They have identified certain naturally occurring chemicals in our bodies that can give us religious experiences .
Studies of identical twins separated at birth seem to indicate that god - belief is about 50 % nurture and 50 % nature .
Some claim to have found a “ god gene ” that makes people more likely to believe .
In studies of religion and the brain , a new field called neurotheology , they have identified the temporal lobe as a place in the brain that can generate religious experiences .
Another part of the brain that regulates a person ’s sense of “ self ” can be consciously shut down during meditation , giving the meditator ( who loses his sense of personal boundaries ) a feeling of “ oneness ” with the universe .
(4) “ Open Heart ” – It will do no good to ask atheists to “ open our hearts and accept Jesus ” ( or any other deity ) .
If we were to set aside our skepticism , we might indeed have an inspirational experience .
But this would be an emotional experience and , like a revelation , we ’d have no way to verify if a god was really speaking to us or if we were just hallucinating .
(5) Unverifiable “ Miracles ” / Resurrection Stories – Many religions have miracle stories .
And just as religious people are usually skeptical towards miracle stories of other religions , atheists are skeptical toward all miracle stories .
Good magicians can perform acts that seem like miracles .
Things can be mismeasured and misinterpreted .
A “ medical miracle ” can simply be attributed to our lack of knowledge of how the human body works .
Why are there never any indisputable miracles , such as an amputated arm regenerating ?
Regarding resurrections , atheists will not find a story of someone resurrecting from the dead to be convincing .
There are many such legends in ancient literature and , again , most religious people reject the resurrection stories of other religions .
Modern resurrection stories always seem to occur in the Third World under unscientific conditions .
There have been thousands of people in hospitals hooked up to machines that verified their deaths when they died .
Why did n’t any of them ever resurrect ?
(6) Fear of Death / “ Heaven ” – Atheists do n’t like the fact that we ’re all going to die any more than religious people do .
However , this fear does not prove there is an afterlife – only that we wish there was an afterlife .
But wishing does n’t make it so .
There is no reason to believe our consciousness survives the death of our brains .
The mind is not something separate from the body .
Chemical alteration and physical damage to our brains can change our thoughts .
Some people get Alzheimer ’s disease at the end of their lives .
The irreversible damage to their brains can be detected by brain scans .
These people lose their ability to think , yet they are still alive .
How , one second after these people die , does their thinking return ( in a “ soul ” ) ?
(7) Fear of Hell – The idea of hell strikes atheists as a scam – an attempt to get people to believe through fear what they cannot believe through reason and evidence .
Then there is the problem of which religion ’s hell is the true hell .
Without evidence , we can never know .
(8) “ Pascal ’s Wager ” / Faith – In short , Pascal ’s Wager states that we have everything to gain ( an eternity in heaven ) and nothing to lose by believing in a god .
On the other hand , disbelief can lead to a loss of heaven .
We ’ve already addressed the issues of heaven and hell , so let us address the faith wager part .
First , it assumes a person can will himself or herself into belief .
This is simply not the case , at least not for an atheist .
So atheists would have to pretend to believe .
But according to most definitions of God , would n’t God know we were lying to hedge our bets ?
Would a god reward this ?
Part of Pascal ’s Wager states that you “ lose nothing ” by believing .
But an atheist would disagree .
By believing under these conditions , you ’re acknowledging that you ’re willing to accept some things on faith .
In other words , you ’re saying you ’re willing to abandon evidence as your standard for judging reality .
Faith does n’t sound so appealing when it ’s phrased that way , does it ?
(9) Blaming the Victim – Many religions punish people for disbelief .
However , belief requires faith , and some people , such as atheists , are incapable of faith .
Their minds are only receptive to evidence .
Therefore , are atheists to be blamed for not believing when “ God ” provides insufficient evidence ?
( 10 ) The End of the World – Like hell , this strikes atheists as a scare tactic to get people to believe through fear what they can’t believe through reason and evidence .
There have been predictions that the world was going to end for centuries now .
The question you might want to ask yourselves , if you ’re basing your religious beliefs on this , is how long you ’re willing to wait – what amount of time will convince you that the world is not going to end ?
( 11 ) Meaning in Life – This is the idea that without a belief in god life would be meaningless .
Even if this were true , it would only prove we wanted a god to exist to give meaning to our lives , not that a god actually does exist .
But the very fact that atheists can find meaning in their lives without a belief in god shows that god belief is not necessary .
( 12 ) “ God is Intangible , Like Love ” – Love is not intangible .
Unlike “ God , ” we can define love both as a type of feeling and as demonstrated by certain types of actions .
Unlike “ God , ” love is a physical thing .
We know the chemicals responsible for the feeling of love .
Also , love depends upon brain structure – a person with a lobotomy or other types of brain damage cannot feel love .
Furthermore , if love were not physical , it would not be confined to our physical brains .
We would expect to be able to detect an entity or force called “ love ” floating around in the air .
( 13 ) Morality / Ethics –
This is the idea that without a god we ’d have no basis for morality .
However , a secular moral code existed before the Bible : the Code of Hammurabi .
Christians can’t even agree among themselves what ’s moral when it comes to things like masturbation , premarital sex , homosexuality , divorce , contraception , abortion , embryonic stem cell research , euthanasia , and the death penalty .
Christians themselves reject some of the moral laws found in the Bible , such as killing disobedient children or people who work on the sabbath .
Other animals exhibit kindness toward one another and a sense of justice .
Morality is something that evolved from us being social beings .
It ’s based on the selfish advantage we get from cooperation , and on consequences .
( 14 ) Altruism – People sometimes say that without a god there would be no altruism , that evolution only rewards selfish behavior .
However , it can be argued that there is no such thing as altruism , that people always do what they want to do .
If they are only faced with bad choices , then people choose the thing they hate the least .
Our choices are based on what gives us ( our genes ) the best advantage for survival , including raising our reputation in society .
“ Altruism ” towards family members benefits people who share our genes .
“ Altruism ” towards friends benefits people who may someday return the favor .
Even “ altruism ” towards strangers has a basis in evolution .
This behavior evolved in small tribes , where everyone knew each other and a good reputation enhanced one ’s survival .
It is now hard - wired in our brains as a general mode of conduct .
( 15 ) Free Will – Some would argue that without a god there would be no free will , that we would live in a deterministic universe of cause and effect and that we would be mere “ robots . ”
Actually , there is far less free will than most people think there is and , in fact , most atheists have no problem admitting that , indeed , free will may be an illusion .
Some believe that the only free will we have is to exercise a conscious veto over actions suggested by our thoughts .
( 16 ) Difficulties of Religion – It has sometimes been argued that because certain religious practices are difficult to follow , nobody would do them if a god did n’t exist .
However , it is the belief in the existence of a god that is motivating people .
A god does n’t really have to exist for this to happen .
Difficulties can serve as an initiation rite of passage into being counted one of the “ select few . ”
After all , if just anybody could be “ saved , ” there would be no point in having a religion .
Finally , the reward for obedience promised by most religions – a heaven – far outweighs any difficulties religion imposes .
( 17 ) False Dichotomies –
This is being presented with a false “ either / or ” proposition : where you ’re only given two choices when , in fact , there are more possibilities .
Here ’s one that many Christians are familiar with : “ Either Jesus was insane or he was god .
Since Jesus said some wise things , he was n’t insane .
Therefore , he must be god , like he said he was . ”
But those are not the only two possibilities .
A third option is that , yes , it is possible to say some wise things and be deluded that you are a god .
A fourth possibility is that Jesus did n’t say everything that is attributed to him in the Bible .
Maybe he did n’t actually say all those wise things , but the writers of the Bible said he did .
Or maybe he never claimed to be God , but the writers turned him into a god after he died .
A fifth possibility is that Jesus is a fictional character and so everything was invented by the authors .
Here ’s another example of a false dichotomy : “ No one would die for a lie .
The early Christians died for Christianity .
Therefore , Christianity must be true . ”
What ’s left out of this is that there is no direct evidence that anyone who ever personally knew Jesus ( if he even existed ) was ever martyred .
We only have stories of martyrdom .
Another explanation is that followers had been fooled , intentionally or unintentionally , into thinking Jesus was God .
A final point is that if , for whatever reason , you believe you ’ll end up in a heaven after to die , then martyrdom is no big deal .
Does the fact that the 9/11 bombers were willing to die for their faith make Islam true ?
( 18 ) God - of - the - Gaps ( Medicine , Life , Universe , etc . ) –
The god - of - the - gaps argument says that if we do n’t currently know the scientific answer to something , then “ God did it . ”
God - of - the - gaps is used in many areas , but I ’ll focus on the three main ones : medicine , life , and the universe .
You ’ll notice that God never has to prove himself in these arguments .
It is always assumed that he gets to win by default .
Here ’s a medical example : A person experiences a cure for a disease that science ca n’t explain .
Therefore , God did it .
But this assumes we know everything about the human body , so that a natural explanation is impossible .
But the fact is , we do n’t have complete medical knowledge .
Why do n’t we ever see something that would be a true miracle , like an amputated arm instantaneously regenerating ?
Several studies of prayer , where the patients did n’t know whether or not they were being prayed for , including a study by the Mayo Clinic , have shown prayer to have no effect on healing .
And , of course , this raises the question of why we would have to beg an all - knowing , all - powerful , all - loving god to be healed in the first place .
It also raises the Problem of Evil :
Why would we be praying to an all - loving god to be cured from diseases and the effects of natural disasters that he himself created ?
An example of god - of - the - gaps as it applies to life is creationism and “ intelligent design . ”
It says we do n’t know everything about evolution , therefore “ God did it . ”
This ignores the fossil and genetic evidence and also fails to explain the many poor and sub-optimal “ designs ” we find in nature .
Is “ God ” an incompetent or sloppy designer ?
The final and most popular example of god - of - the - gaps is the universe .
But to say we do n’t know the origins of the universe – if the universe even had an ultimate beginning – does not mean that “ God did it . ”
Conclusion – Religious people have a tough , if not impossible task to try to prove a god exists , let alone that their particular religion is true .
If any religion had objective standards , would n’t everyone be flocking to the same “ true ” religion ?
Instead we find that people tend to believe , to varying degrees , the religion in which they were indoctrinated .
Or they are atheists .
Jon Stewart : ' Cheney can pixillate things just by touching them '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday June 28 , 2007 Print This Email This
The Daily Show's Jon Stewart returned on Wednesday to his series on Vice President Cheney 's extreme penchant for secrecy , reporting that " while the White House and Capitol appear crystal clear on Google Earth , the Naval Observatory , the vice president 's official residence , appears only as an obscured mass of pixels . "
" Do n't think that Dick Cheney asked Google to have him pixillated , " explained Stewart .
" Dick Cheney can pixillate things just by touching them .
...
It 's a superpower he got when he was bitten by a very low - resolution spider .
Luckily , with this power comes no responsibility . "
Stewart then turned to a story about a top adviser to Rudy Giuliani being arrested on charges of cocaine distribution .
" But relax everybody , this is no big - time drug dealer , " said Stewart , playing a clip of CNN saying that " the US Attorney handling the case says Ravenel purchased less than 500 grams of cocaine to share with other people , not to sell it . "
" Not to sell but to share ? " asked Stewart .
" And you call yourself a Republican ?
That is not capitalism , my friend , that is welfare . "
The following video is from Comedy Channel 's The Daily Show , broadcast on June 27 .
Some of the progressive students at Xavier University in Ohio are n’t too happy that the nasty , bigoted homophobe Ann Coulter is appearing on their campus .
But , they ’ve turned their anger into action at their blog , Counter Ann Coulter .
They ’re raising money — in $ 5.00 increments — to bring progressive speakers to campus :
She has every right to speak her mind ( and she ’s paid well to do it , her $ 20,000 + speaking fee equals about $ 5 for every Xavier student ) .
But we speak our minds , too ; for values like compassion , equality , and diversity .
The same values Xavier students work to uphold with groups like Xavier ’s Gay - Straight Alliance , Amnesty International , Habitat for Humanity , and Earthcare .
Here ’s where you come in : While Coulter pollutes the air with her divisive message on one side of Xavier ’s campus on September 6 , on the other side we ’ll be presenting a check to Xavier student organizations working to make their campus – and Ohio – a place where everyone feels at home .
Can you spare just $ 5 – an Abe Lincoln – to support the same communities Coulter regularly bashes for pay ?
We ’ll also send her a ‘ thank you ’ card signed with your name , and let her know how much money we raised .
There is an ongoing argument these days on the Obesity Factor in Kids .
" Whose fault is it ? " " The parents ?
The kids ? "
Kids sit a lot these days - about 6 hours and sometimes more at school yet when Kids Obesity is addressed , it 's almost always put on the Parent 's back .
Video games and television are blamed .
Activity periods should be a HUGE part of the daily grind NOT only at home , but also at school .
Activity periods should be instituted two times per day - an hour in the morning and an hour in the afternoon .
Kids should be allowed to choose what activity they would like to do - whether it 's just enjoying the outdoors , or shooting hoops .
It is only normal for the body to begin winding down at the end of the day .
This is just one more reason why our kids should be allowed opportunities at school to move around more .
Another contributor to Kid's Obesity is teachers who assign homework .
Many times , kids have four or more teachers , and each may assign homework which requires a half hour or more to complete .
They say it's to teach kids responsibility - yet homework not only eats into Family Time , it eats into Activity & Relaxation Time .
There are n't many adults who bring home work after hours .
To add even more ' weight ' to the Kids & Obesity issue , most school cafeterias would make a grown nutritionist cry , yet soda and candy machines are yanked out and tagged ' the Fat Predator ' .
Kids should be taught that soda and candy can be a part of a healthy diet AND healthy , TASTY foods should be a part of a kid 's school day .
Last but not least , when our kids are involved in fund - raisers , why are candies and cookies sold as fund - raisers ?

Ever heard the story of the giant ship engine that failed ?
The ship 's owners tried one expert after another , but none of them could figure but how to fix the engine .
Then they brought in an old man who had been fixing ships since he was a youngster .
He carried a large bag of tools with him , and when he arrived , he immediately went to work .
He inspected the engine very carefully , top to bottom .
Two of the ship 's owners were there , watching this man , hoping he would know what to do .
After looking things over , the old man reached into his bag and pulled out a small hammer .
He gently tapped something .
Instantly , the engine lurched into life .
He carefully put his hammer away .
The engine was fixed !
A week later , the owners received a bill from the old man for ten thousand dollars .
" What ? ! " the owners exclaimed .
" He hardly did anything ! "
So they wrote the old man a note saying , " Please send us an itemized bill . "
The man sent a bill that read :
Tapping with a hammer ......................... $ 2.00
Knowing where to tap ......................... $ 9998.00

Evaluating the impact of livestock antibiotics on the environment , University of Minnesota researchers have found that many vegetables uptake the antibiotics .
The study , in the Journal of Environmental Quality , shows that food crops can readily accumulate antibiotics from soils spread with cattle manure .
The findings were based on a greenhouse study involving three food crops : corn , lettuce , and potatoes .
The plants were grown in soil modified with liquid hog manure containing sulfamethazine , a commonly used veterinary antibiotic .
The researchers found that the antibiotic was taken up by all three crops .
The antibiotic was found in the plant leaves and concentrations in the plant tissue increased as the amount of antibiotic present in the manure increased .
Worryingly , it also diffused into potato tubers , which suggests that other root crops – such as carrots and radishes – may be particularly vulnerable to antibiotic contamination .
Researcher Satish Gupta said that contaminated plants had the potential to cause allergic reactions in people with antibiotic sensitivity .
He also noted that contamination is likely to foster antimicrobial resistance , which can render antibiotics ineffective .
And co-researcher Holly Dolliver warned that antibiotic contaminated plants may be of particular concern to the organic farming industry , where manure is often the main source of crop nutrients .
While the USDA stipulates that organic producers must manage animal materials in a manner that does not contribute to contamination of crops by residues of prohibited substances , manures containing antibiotics are not formally banned or prohibited .
Dolliver concluded that further research is needed to investigate how different plants absorb different antibiotic compounds .

The Biggest Crime You 've Never Heard of -- Return Fraud -- and How the Criminals Do It
by www.SixWise.com
While returning the bright pink sweater your aunt gave you for the holidays may hurt her feelings , it 's certainly not unusual .
Retailers expect that nearly 9 percent of gifts will be returned from the holiday season -- a disappointment to sales ?
Yes .
Illegal ?
No .
Return fraud cost retailers $ 3.5 billion during the 2006 holiday season alone .
There is , however , an immoral and often illegal phenomenon that 's costing retailers billions of dollars and , in turn , making shopping more expensive and inconvenient for all of us : return fraud .
According to the National Retail Federation ( NRF ) , " Criminals commonly take advantage of companies ' return policies to receive cash for stolen merchandise , launder money or return an item after it has been used . "
This return fraud cost retailers an estimated $ 3.5 billion during the 2006 holiday season , and a full $ 9.6 billion for the entire year , according to NRF .
Some estimates even say return fraud amounts to $ 16 billion in losses to retailers each year .
" Retailers have often viewed lenient return policies as a cost of doing business with honest shoppers , " said Joseph LaRocca , NRF vice president of loss prevention .
" Unfortunately , due to an increase in return fraud , retailers are being forced to strike a delicate balance between servicing loyal shoppers and discouraging opportunistic criminals . "
How is Return Fraud Committed ?
The most common form of return fraud , according to the NRF 's Return Fraud Survey , is returning merchandise that has been stolen , either for cash or for store credits .
An alarming 95.2 percent of retailers said they had had stolen goods returned within the past year ( you can check out an example of this return fraud caught on tape in this ABC News video ) .
" These people are going from store to store , mall to mall , stealing merchandise thousands of dollars at a time , and then coming back and returning it to the store , " LaRocca said .
" They can make millions if they 're very good at it . "
Another type of return fraud occurs when criminals return merchandise that was originally purchased with fraudulent or counterfeit tender .
Over 69 percent of retailers had experienced this fraud within the past year , and another 52.4 percent had had returns made using counterfeit receipts .
A practice known as " wardrobing , " though not illegal , per say , is also a form of return fraud that 's affected 56 percent of retailers .
Wardrobing describes the consumer who intentionally returns merchandise that 's not defective , but that has been used .
For instance , buying a prom dress , wearing it once , then taking it back for a refund ( this also happens with high - end electronics like digital cameras ) .
Aside from costing retailers money ( they must either discard the merchandise or resell it at a steep discount ) , wardrobing can strip stores of merchandise in the most popular colors , sizes and styles so that other customers cannot purchase it .
There 's also a con known as price arbitrage , which consists of buying items that look similar but have very different prices , then returning the cheaper item as though it 's the more expensive one .
For instance , buying two watches , switching the boxes and returning the less expensive one for the more expensive price .
See Return Fraud
Criminals in Action
See how these criminals netted hundreds of thousands of dollars by engaging in return fraud in this exclusive ABC News video .
As criminals get more and more brazen , they may even fill the box with a completely different item , such as a deck of cards , and return the item for a full refund ( betting on the fact that the clerk wo n't take the time to look inside the box ) .
More Return Fraud Means More Expense , and Less Convenience , for Consumers
As retailers lose billions of dollars to fraud , they 're being forced to raise prices to honest consumers to make up for the losses .
" You and I as consumers are paying a little extra at the register , almost a hidden crime tax , to cover those losses committed by people stealing merchandise and taking advantage of retail return policies , " LaRocca said .
Meanwhile , many retailers are making their return policies stricter than ever , a change that will impact consumers this year .
Over 69 percent of retailers said they 'd changed their return policies in the past to address return fraud , according to the NRF survey , and another 25 percent plan to tighten their policies this year .
While some stores are enlisting investigators to search online for stolen merchandise or sites selling fraudulent receipts , others are scanning driver 's licenses every time a return is made to keep track of people who are making excessive returns in short periods of time .
Still other stores are putting unique numbers on merchandise to keep better track of whether an item has been returned or purchased before , shortening return periods , charging significant restocking fees or limiting the amount of returns one customer can make .
" We are used to liberal return policies , but the liberal return policies are fading away , " said Edgar Dworsky , founder of ConsumerWorld.org , a Massachusetts - based consumer resource guide .
" They are being replaced with these far more complex ones , and ones that I call ' sliced and diced . '
Different categories of items have different return rules . "
The bottom line is , if you plan to make any returns this year , make sure you keep your receipt and ask the store to spell out exactly what their return policy entails .

Much of Sydney 's CBD as it appears in the satellite images on Google Maps Australia has been fuzzed out , just weeks before the APEC summit .
Google says the imagery was downgraded as a result of a " commercial issue " with a supplier , but the move has aroused speculation it was done at the request of police in order to minimise the risk of a terrorist attack during the September summit , where Sydney will play host to 21 world leaders including U.S. President George W. Bush .
Google has in the past been accused of censoring its maps due to national security concerns by governments , most recently in June when it updated its maps of Washington D.C. but maintained older , blurry images for most of the downtown area .
I always wanted to be seen as a " genius " , to impress my friends ( and girls ! ) with my knowledge and memory .
Little did I know that I could actually increase my IQ !
In an alarming display of fearmongering , former Republican Senator Rick Santorum has suggested that a series of " unfortunate events , " namely terrorist attacks , will occur within the next year and change American citizen 's perception of the war .
Appearing on the Hugh Hewitt radio show , Santorum also hyped the necessity of " confronting Iran in the Middle East , " and predicted that Giuliani , Romney and Fred Thompson would be the three surviving Republican candidates who would go head to head in the race for the nomination .
Santorum went on to clearly imply that terror attacks will occur inside America which will alter the body politic and lead to a reversal of the anti-war sentiment now dominating the country .
" Between now and November , a lot of things are going to happen , and I believe that by this time next year , the American public ’s going to have a very different view of this war , and it will be because , I think , of some unfortunate events , that like we ’re seeing unfold in the UK .
But I think the American public ’s going to have a very different view , " said the former senator from Pennsylvania .
Is Santorum expressing foreknowledge of some coming atrocity or is he merely using a tactic familiar to the leadership of his party - exploiting the fear of terror for the purposes of political rhetoric ?
Last month , the new chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party Dennis Milligan said that there needed to be more attacks on American soil for President Bush to regain popular approval .
" At the end of the day , I believe fully the president is doing the right thing , and I think all we need is some attacks on American soil like we had on [ Sept. 11 , 2001 ] , " Milligan told the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette , " And the naysayers will come around very quickly to appreciate not only the commitment for President Bush , but the sacrifice that has been made by men and women to protect this country , " he concluded .
Yearning for new mass casualty terror attacks for political gain is a GOP strategy - Milligan is merely parroting what was written in a leaked confidential memo that was circulated among senior Republican leaders in late 2005 .
" A confidential memo circulating among senior Republican leaders suggests that a new attack by terrorists on U.S. soil could reverse the sagging fortunes of President George W. Bush as well as the GOP and " restore his image as a leader of the American people , " reported Capitol Hill Blue on November 12 , 2005 .
Is it an OsamaBot ?
Or a clever audio forgery ?
Blogger George Maschke at Boomantribune.com has spotted an intriguing bit of cutting and splicing in the latest video purported to be from Osama Bin Laden .
The only evidence that the video is authentic is that Osama 's presumed voice refers to recent events .
But as Maschke writes ,
" All references to current events , such as the 62nd anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Japan , and Sarkozy and Brown being the leaders of France and the UK , respectively , occur when the video is frozen ! "
Odd , is n't it ?
Maybe Osama has joined the worms in some cave after all , as many of us suspected .
And maybe a voice - alike is doing the audio .
Otherwise , why freeze the tape just at the most crucial bit of evidence ?
Maschke believes that
" The audio track does appear to be in the voice of a single speaker .
What I suspect was done is that an older , unreleased video was dubbed over for this release , with the video frozen when the audio track departed from that of the original video . "
Well , no wonder Osama looks years younger in this tape .
He 's discovered the secret of eternal youth !
It 's like the 1989 movie A Weekend at Bernie's !
Osama might be a little bit gaga , but with some help from his friends he looks like the real , live thing .
Al Qaida even has its own " media production company , " according to CNN .
Anybody with cheap video software could produce this fake .
One of Osama 's sons could have been used to do a voice - over , in a particularly goulish bit of terrorist showbiz --- but that 's what these characters do anyway .
What 's the reason to have a young boy cut off some unfortunate man 's head , except for terrorist showbiz ?
And if Osama is alive , why freeze the video just at that point ?

THE MOST astonishing revelations in Michael Moore ’s “ Sicko ” have nothing to do with healthcare .
They ’re about vacation time .
French vacation time , to be precise .
Sitting at a restaurant table with a bunch of American ex-pats in Paris , Moore is treated to a jaw - dropping recitation of the perks of social democracy : 30 days of vacation time , unlimited sick days , full child care , social workers who come to help new parents adjust to the strains and challenges of child - rearing .
Walking out of the theater , I heard more envious mutterings about this scene than any other .
“ Why ca n’t we have that ? ” my fellow moviegoers asked .
The first possibility is that we already do .
Maybe that perfidious Michael Moore is just lying in service of his French paymasters .
But sadly , no .
A recent report by Rebecca Ray and John Schmitt of the Center for Economic and Policy Research suggests that Moore is , if anything , understating his case .
“ The United States , ” they write , “ is the only advanced economy in the world that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation . ”
Take notice of that word “ only . ”
Every other advanced economy offers a government guarantee of paid vacation to its workforce .
Britain assures its workforce of 20 days of guaranteed , compensated leave .
Germany gives 24 .
And France gives , yes , 30 .
Advertisement
We guarantee zero .
Absolutely none .
That ’s why one out of 10 full - time American employees , and more than six out of 10 part - time employees , get no vacation .
And even among workers with paid vacation benefits , the average number of days enjoyed is a mere 12 .
In other words , even those of us who are lucky enough to get some vacation typically receive just over a third of what the French are guaranteed .
This is strange .
Of all these countries , the United States is , by far , the richest .
And you would think that , as our wealth grew and our productivity increased , a certain amount of our resources would go into , well , us .
Into leisure .
Into time off .
You would think that we ’d take advantage of the fact that we can create more wealth in less time to wrest back some of those hours for ourselves and our families .
But instead , the exact opposite has happened .
The average American man today works 100 more hours a year than he did in the 1970s , according to Cornell University economist Robert Frank .
That ’s 2 1/2 weeks of added labor .
The average woman works 200 more hours -- that ’s five added weeks .
And those hours are coming from somewhere : from time with our kids , our friends , our spouses , even our bed .
The typical American , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , sleeps one to two hours less a night than his or her parents did .
This would all be fine if it were what we wanted .
But that does n’t seem to be the case .
One famous 1996 study asked associates at major law firms which world they ’d prefer :
The one they resided in , or one in which they took a 10 % pay cut in return for a 10 % reduction in hours worked .
They overwhelmingly preferred the latter .
Elsewhere , economists have given individuals sets of choices pitting leisure against goods .
Leisure does n’t always win out , but it is certainly competitive .
Yet we ’re pumping ever more hours into work , seeking ever - higher incomes to fund ever - greater consumption .
Why ?
Advertisement
A possible answer can be found in Frank ’s work .
He argues that the U.S. economy has set its incentives up so as to systematically underemphasize leisure and overemphasize consumption .
Much of what we purchase are called “ positional goods ” -- goods whose value is measured in relation to the purchases of others .
Take housing .
Would you rather live in a land where you had a 4,000 - square - foot house and everyone else had a 6,000 - square - foot house , or one in which you had a 3,000 - square - foot house and everyone else had a 2,000 - square - foot house ?
Given this choice , studies show that most respondents pick the latter .
Being concerned with one ’s relative position rather than one ’s absolute position is not irrational or merely motivated by envy .
In order to retain your relative standard of living , you need to keep up with the purchases of others in your income bracket .
Retaining your relative position also ensures that you do n’t send the wrong signals when a client comes over for dinner .
Houses , cars , clothing -- they all help send those signals .
And because the rich in this country keep getting richer , we ’re caught in what Frank calls “ expenditure cascades ” in an effort to keep up with them .
Their purchases raise the bar for the group right below them , which in turn increases the needs of the next income set , and so on .
This makes the purchase of positional goods more pressing and urgent than non-positional goods .
And so they “ crowd out ” their less context - contingent cousins .
People want to spend less time at work , but they also want to retain and improve their standard of living relative to their neighbors -- and the latter triumphs , time and again .
This is n’t because people are stupid , or irrational , or do n’t know what they want .
Rather , it ’s because the incentives are all fouled up .
Frank calls it a “ smart for one , dumb for all ” problem , but it ’s really just a classic failure of collective action .
An individual would be made worse off were he to unilaterally opt out of the positional competition .
But we would all be better off if we decided collectively to ratchet down the economic one - upmanship and instead devote a bit more time and resources to the leisure goods we claim to desire .

Here in the sweltering D.C. summer , there ’s nothing worse than wearing a necktie when the thermometer reads 95 and the humidity is so thick you could swim laps .
But on your own , there ’s not much you can do about this state of affairs .
If you ’re the only one who shows up dressed down , you ’ll look bad for it .
But if your office , or meeting , were to collectively decide to ease the dress code , all would be better off .
This is what the European Union just did , imposing new regulations on its bureaucrats barring ties in the summer .
Cutting down on air - conditioning costs was the rationale , but centralized action was the only way to end the practice .
Otherwise , every individual would still have had the incentive to show his commitment by dressing in a tie .
Only the collective could remove that spur .
So too with vacations .
Very few individual workers in the United States can ask for four weeks of vacation .
It is not only outside the benefits of their job but far outside the culture of our workplace .
The incentives for most every individual , particularly if they want to keep their position and amass a reputation as a good employee , is to abide by those norms .
But if the crowd outside “ Sicko ” was any indication , most people would love a substantial increase in vacation time .
This is what other advanced nations have pursued , using the government ’s role as an enforcer of collective sentiment to legislate the preferences that individuals could not , on their own , enact .
Advertisement
In this country , we ’ve left it to the individuals , and thus the average American worker only takes 13 days of vacation a year , and many get none .
We could do better , but that would require sidestepping American individualism for a moment and engaging in some American collectivism .

A single joint of cannabis raises the risk of schizophrenia by more than 40 per cent , a disturbing study warns .
The Government - commissioned report has also found that taking the drug regularly more than doubles the risk of serious mental illness .
Overall , cannabis could be to blame for one in seven cases of schizophrenia and other life - shattering mental illness , the Lancet reports .
The grim statistics - the latest to link teenage cannabis use with mental illness in later life - come only days after Gordon Brown ordered a review of the decision to downgrade cannabis to class C , the least serious category .
The Prime Minister is said to have a ' personal instinct ' that the change should be reversed , with more arrests and stiffer penalties for users .
Cannabis has been implicated in a string of vicious killings , including the recent stabbing of fashion designer Lucy Braham .
The authors of the latest study , the most comprehensive of its kind and commissioned by the Department of Health , said : ' Policymakers need to provide the public with advice about this widely - used drug .
' We believe there is now enough evidence to inform people that using cannabis could increase their risk of developing a psychotic illness later in life . '
The analysis does not look at the age at which schizophrenia is likely to develop .
However , previous studies have shown that smoking the drug as a teenager raises the risk of developing schizophrenia in one 's twenties or thirties .
The researchers , from four British universities , analysed the results of 35 studies into cannabis use from around the world .
This suggested that trying cannabis only once was enough to raise the risk of schizophrenia by 41 per cent .
At greatest risk , however , were heavy users , with those who took cannabis over 100 times having more than double the risk of those who never touched the drug .
With up to 40 per cent of teenagers and young adults in the UK believed to have tried cannabis , the researchers estimate that the drug could be behind 14 per cent of cases of schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses .
' Although individual lifetime risk of chronic psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia , even in people who use cannabis regularly , is likely to be low - less than three per cent - cannabis use can be expected to have a substantial effect on psychotic disorders at a population level because exposure to this drug is so common . '
Cardiff University researcher Dr Stanley Zammit added : ' Even if cannabis does cause an increased risk of developing psychosis , most people who use cannabis will not develop such an illness .
' Nevertheless , we would still advise people to avoid or limit their use of this drug , especially if they start to develop any mental health symptoms , or if they have relatives with psychotic illnesses . '
In an accompanying editorial in the Lancet , Dutch psychiatrists said the focus on heroin , cocaine and other Class A drugs meant the dangers of cannabis had been overlooked .
' In the public debate , cannabis has been considered a more or less harmless drug compared with alcohol , central stimulants and opioids .
' However , the potential long - term hazardous effects of cannabis with regard to psychosis seem to have been overlooked , and there is a need to warn the public of these dangers , as well as to establish a treatment to help young frequent cannabis users . '
Previous studies have shown a clear link between cannabis use in the teenage years and mental illness in later life .
Research completed by leading psychiatrist Professor Robin Murray in 2005 showed that those who smoked the drug regularly at 18 were 1.6 times more likely to suffer serious psychiatric problems , including schizophrenia , by their mid-20s .
For those who were regular users at 15 , the stakes were even higher , with their risk of mental illness by the age of 26 being 4.5 times greater than normal .
It is thought that , used during teenage years , the drug can cause permanent damage to the developing brain .
Professor Robin Murray , of the Institute of Psychiatry in London , warned yesterday that the risks were likely to be heightened by the increasing use of powerful skunk cannabis .
' My own experience suggest to me that the risk with skunk is higher .
Therefore their estimate that 14 per cent of cases of schizophrenia in the UK are due to cannabis is now probably an understatement . '
Marjorie Wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity SANE , said : ' This analysis should act as a serious warning of the dangers of regular or heavy cannabis use , doubling the risk of developing schizophrenia - a condition in which a person may hear voices and experience strange thoughts and paranoid delusions .
' The debate about classification should not founder on statistics but take into account the potential damage to hundreds of people who without cannabis would not develop mental illness .
' While the majority can take the drug with no mind - altering effects , it is estimated that 10 per cent are at risk .
' You only need to see one person whose mind has been altered and life irreparably damaged , or talk to their family , to realise that the headlines are not scaremongering but reflect a daily , and preventable , tragedy . '
However , others questioned the link , pointing out there has been little change in rates of schizophrenia in recent years despite the rise in cannabis use and the increasing strength of the drug .

Three heavy drug users and their horrific killings :
William Jaggs , a 23 - year - old Oxford University student and prolific cannabis user , stabbed fashion designer Lucy Braham 66 times at her home near Harrow , the public school in North - West London .
The paranoid schizophrenic was found covered in blood beside Lucy 's body , having plunged the knife into his own chest last September .
The former Harrow pupil , whose father is a teacher at the school , started using drugs when he was 14 , moving on from cannabis to cocaine .
He was sent to Broadmoor secure hospital this month for an unlimited period after admitting manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility .
Drug -crazed drifter Richard Cazaly is believed to have stabbed pregnant Abigail Witchalls in Surrey , in April 2005 .
Cazaly , 23 , who killed himself five days after the stabbing , had a history of heavy drug use dating back at least four years .
His girlfriend , Vanessa MacKenzie , told police both she and Cazaly were regular cannabis users , smoking ' a couple of joints a day ' .
Surrey police said Cazaly became psychotic and violent as a result of long - term abuse of drugs and the alcohol he had consumed on the day of the random stabbing .
Miraculously , Mrs Witchalls and her unborn baby survived the attack .
Her young son - who she was pushing in a pram when she was set upon by Cazaly - was unhurt .
Son of a nurse at Broadmoor Thomas Palmer butchered two of his friends during a woodland walk after his mind was warped by smoking skunk - a particularly potent form of cannabis .
Then aged 18 , he virtually beheaded 16 - year - old Steven Bayliss and repeatedly stabbed Nuttawut Nadauld , 14 , near their homes in Wokingham , Berkshire in September 2005 .
Palmer had started using the drug at 14 .
He told doctors he had not been smoking on the day of the killings but admitted to using skunk regularly in the weeks before the brutal attack .
In March this year , he was given a minimum 20 years in prison for the double murder .
More historical pictures of USSR in the 70-s .
For the most part in color .
Last year in Afghanistan , while serving with the British army , I sat on the rooftop of our patrol base in the middle of Sangin , a small town in Helmand province .
Surveying the skyline of flat - roofed mud homes and barren hills , I took stock of the situation .
We had seized and occupied Sangin a few days previously , wresting control of the town from the Taliban .
During our advance an 11 - year - old boy was killed in the crossfire , shot in the head accidentally by our allies , the Afghan national army .
Despite this we established our base in a local government building , the district centre , and patrolled the bazaar every day .
We bought mangos and chatted to the locals - who seemed ambivalent about our presence .
Just below the surface , however , tension simmered .
The boy 's death made us a threat to the local population .
Despite promising development we had nothing to show for all our big talk .
Crucially we had no real answers to questions about the future of the all - important poppy , the basis of Sangin 's economy .
To the locals , we were clumsy , interfering foreigners , whose arrival presaged conflict and the destruction of their livelihood .
Days later Sangin exploded into violence , seeing some of the fiercest fighting by British troops since the Korean war , and which continues as I write .
Sadly , many more civilians across Afghanistan have met the same end as the 11 - year - old .
Recently in Sangin an estimated 21 civilians were killed by bombs dropped from Nato planes after US and British soldiers were ambushed .
In the eastern city of Jalalabad in March , US soldiers shot dead 19 civilians in the aftermath of a bomb attack .
And yesterday seven policemen were killed by " friendly fire " in an air strike in the eastern province of Nangarhar .
The Jalalabad shootings may yet be deemed a war crime , but civilian deaths are normally tragic accidents .
Often outnumbered and outgunned by militia men , the immediate response of Nato troops is to call on overwhelming firepower delivered by artillery , helicopter gunships and jets .
The troops are n't wicked , they 're just keen on staying alive .
But these weapons are blunt - edged and indiscriminate .
The price of overwhelming firepower is the death of nearby civilians .
But accidental or not , civilian deaths catastrophically undermine the entire Nato effort , as relatives of the dead , bent on vengeance , flock to the Taliban cause .
As Pashtuns , the inhabitants of Helmand hold Badal , the pursuit of revenge , as a central concept of their social code , which is devotedly adhered to .
" A Pashtun waited a hundred years for revenge , " a local saying goes , " and was pleased with such quick work . "
Indeed , the Taliban are ruthlessly exploiting this mindset by deliberately engaging Nato troops from villages .
But it was never supposed to be like this .
On my arrival in Afghanistan , I was optimistic about being involved in a reconstructive , nation - building endeavour .
Our strategy , the Comprehensive Approach , was supposed to provide security , development and governance .
The UK army was to guard a secure " inkspot " around Lashkar Gah ( Helmand 's capital ) , inside which the Foreign Office and international development department DfID could establish an alternative to opium production and initiate development to improve the lives of ordinary Afghan people , some of the world 's poorest .
Afghan hearts and minds would be won over , leaving opium traffickers and the last remnants of the Taliban marginalised .
But the Comprehensive Approach was never given a chance .
Our occupation of Sangin and other towns across the north of Helmand was a wild digression away from the " inkspot " , motivated by haste and beset by ignorance .
We acted as the army alone , purely as a military force , without the crucial hearts and minds - winning capabilities DfID and the Foreign Office should have provided .
Far from improving Afghan lives , we have committed a terrible military blunder .
Afghans are sick of foreign armies killing their people .
Their president , Hamid Karzai , has publicly criticised Nato 's methods and warned that " bad consequences " will follow if civilian deaths continue unchecked .
The Afghan parliament has called for a halt to Nato military offensives , and for negotiations with Afghan members of the Taliban .
In Kabul last month , I met displaced civilians from Helmand province , some of the 80,000 to 115,000 people the UN estimates have lost their homes in the fighting in southern Afghanistan .
" Why do British planes kill our people ? " they said .
I struggled to answer .
The British command in Helmand should heed the president 's warning .
The Taliban now control 50 % of Helmand province .
Development is happening nowhere , and opium production has reached record levels .
Unless we immediately de-escalate the level of violence and prevent further civilian deaths , all of Helmand will be lost .
In Sangin today the district centre is a battle - scarred fortified position where more than a dozen British troops have been killed fighting from trenches .
Soldiers no longer sit on the roof to enjoy the view .
The town lies in ruins , with little trace left of the once thriving bazaar .
A peaceful , developed Helmand cannot be won by the sword , and the longer we try , the greater the tragedy .

Facebook WASHINGTON  Markets have the shakes .
The housing sector is searching for a bottom .
Consumers look fatigued .
Oil prices are volatile .
Is an economic soft landing supposed to feel this rough ?
The Federal Reserve meets today to discuss interest rate policy , bolstered by data pointing to the slower , sustainable growth and gradually moderating inflation it has predicted .
But Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues also face turmoil in stock and bond markets , despite Monday 's stock rally , as traders worry that an economic expansion built largely on easy credit is too brittle to hold together .
In the near term , Fed officials have given no hint of budging from their current policy of keeping interest rates steady as they focus on tamping down inflation .
The central bank has held a key short - term rate at 5.25 % for more than a year .
The question is what happens to the economy and Fed policy later this year and into 2008 .
Economists , including those at the Fed , have been reducing their growth estimates .
While many expect the nation to avoid a sharp downturn , given the strong world economy , tight labor market and healthy corporate profits , the shaky financial markets have added a new layer of risk .
Nariman Behravesh , chief economist at Global Insight , says the economy appears to be in a soft landing , predicting a slow 2 % to 2.5 % annual growth rate ahead .
He adds , however , that the economy 's " deceleration does make us vulnerable to another shock . "
Spreading credit crunch
The big , emerging area of worry is the financial markets , where interest rates on some corporate debt have jumped in recent weeks .
Soaring defaults in subprime mortgages , which are higher - priced loans to consumers who have impaired credit , have forced dozens of lenders out of business and torpedoed investors who bought bonds backed by the loans .
That , in turn , has prompted even lenders of higher - quality mortgages to tighten terms or stop offering some products , which could further delay a housing recovery and cut overall growth .
Martha Pomerantz , principal and co-chair of the investment committee at Lowry Hill , a $ 7 billion high - end individual money management firm , says the strong global economy means companies will continue to find markets and financing and to post healthy profits .
Financing for corporate deals has been historically cheap and is now simply moving to more normal levels , she says .
There 's a " movement of money from riskier markets to higher - quality companies that … have good prospects for durable earnings growth , " Pomerantz says .
Others are less sure , saying the bills are coming due for a cheap credit binge that resulted in too many houses no one wants to buy and a slew of questionable business deals .
" Slowly but surely , investors are opening their eyes to the reality of the widespread credit excesses of the past and tightening the noose around the neck of future credit availability , " investment advisory firm Caldwell & Orkin said in a recent analysis .
The economy has generally unfolded as the Fed has predicted in the past year and a half , though the central bank last month reduced its growth forecast , calling the housing correction worse than expected .
Signs of strength Unemployment is a low 4.6 % .
An index of core inflation , a measure that does n't include volatile food and energy prices , has declined from 2.5 % in November to a 1.9 % rate in the 12 months ended in June , near the top of the Fed 's informal comfort zone .
U.S. exports have picked up , manufacturing has expanded and the strong commercial real estate sector has helped dull the losses from the housing plunge .
World economic growth is booming .
" If it is a financial crisis , it 's a great time to have one , " says Jim Paulsen , chief investment officer of Wells Capital Management , who says the markets have overreacted .
" We 've got the business sector coming back ; clearly , international trade is coming back , and so is manufacturing . "
The Fed has given no sign that it plans to change interest rate policy in the near term due to stock and bond market gyrations .
Fed Governor Randall Kroszner told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that economic fundamentals had n't changed since mid-July , when the Fed released its outlook and called inflation its predominant concern .
Still , forecasters at financial firms such as JPMorgan ( JPM ) that had predicted the Fed would raise rates this year to attack inflation , are now backing off those forecasts and focusing more on slower growth .
Futures markets contracts that predict
Fed policy are giving higher odds of a rate cut later this year .
Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com says the Fed could change the wording of its statement to indicate that inflation is no longer its main risk and cut rates later this year to help get the credit markets moving again .
" It 's a rational repricing of risk , but when markets are repricing like this , they are extra vulnerable , " Zandi says .
" If anything goes wrong … you 'll get a credit crunch . "
A drag from housing New - home sales are down 20 % from last year , and Bernanke warned that housing will be a drag on the economy into next year , even if things start to turn around , given the large inventory of unsold homes to be worked through .
Some builders think the pain could last longer than that .
" None of the large public ( builders ) are buying any land , there are more lots for sale and more land that 's sitting , " says Marsha Elliott , president of Terrestris Development in Chicago , a midsize home developer .
Elliott , who has been in business for three decades , calls this downturn the strangest she 's seen in the sense that it's not pushed by fundamentals such as rising interest rates or a bad job market .
She does n't expect recovery for , " a couple of more years , at least .
It 's ' batten down the hatches . ' " Doug Duncan , chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association , says the problem is n't the cost of credit , but the availability of buyers in the secondary market for mortgage - backed securities due to perceived risk .
Interest rates on high - quality mortgages have actually dropped in recent days , with some rates near 6.5 % .
He expects the Fed to stand back a bit to gauge where housing is going , adding that a hasty rate move could be misinterpreted by markets .
He now expects it will be " well out into 2008 " before the housing fall hits bottom .
Andrew Chaban , CEO of Princeton Properties in Lowell , Mass. , which owns and manages about 5,500 apartment units , says the real estate market in areas of the Northeast where he operates is holding its own — for careful projects .
" If you have taken more gambles … if you 've overleveraged your property , you do n't have enough equity in the deal , those are the types of deals we see being hurt , " Chaban says .
While Bernanke 's housing outlook is hardly upbeat , some analysts think he 's far too optimistic .
In particular , they dispute the Fed 's analysis that problems in the housing sector have n't spilled into other areas of the economy — especially after the recent market churning from subprime — and that the falloff in housing will have only a small impact on consumer spending .
" The wealth effect ( from rising home prices ) equity extraction and excessive home building were absolutely necessary for this expansion to continue as long as it has or even continue at all , " says Kevin Feltes , associate director of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center .
Feltes predicts a broad retrenchment in consumer spending in the longer term , with borrowing and spending falling more than at any time since the early 1980s .
Economist Richard DeKaser of National City Bank , by contrast , says that even a sharp cutback in home equity withdrawals will have only a minimal impact on growth .
Benjamin Holzer , 36 , of Queen Creek , Ariz. , near Phoenix , says he's in pretty good shape , despite housing market troubles .
" I live in the most expensive house that I can afford , " Holzer says , adding that the value of his home has risen so much since he bought it that anything short of a dramatic drop in real estate prices wo n't sting .
" At the very worst , the market will come back down to a more normal situation .
I 'm in a good spot . "
Consumer spending , two - thirds of the economy , held the recovery together in the early part of the year , but gains slumped this spring .
Consumer confidence rose in July , but USA TODAY polls find a majority of respondents expect conditions to get worse .
" Things are getting more and more expensive ; fuel is way up there .
I 've honestly had to stop working because my income was n't helping .
I was having to pay day care and extra gas ; I was paying almost an extra $ 150 on gas a month , " says Christina Howard , 32 , of Port St. Lucie , Fla .
Economists have been counting on steady wage growth and a tight labor market to blunt some of the impacts of higher gasoline prices and the housing market slump .
Job growth was below predictions in July , though the unemployment rate remains low at 4.6 % .
" What we 're seeing is that feeling you get when you 're going to the dentist . …
There 's a lot of anxiety under the surface , " says Phil Rist of BIGresearch , a consumer research firm .
Nervous about oil prices
Core inflation — minus food and energy prices — is declining at the same time as the inflation measure that includes all prices is under pressure .
Oil prices hit a record high ( not adjusted for inflation ) of $ 78 a barrel last week , though they declined sharply Monday to a still - high $ 72.06 a barrel for light , sweet crude oil trading for delivery in September .
The Fed focuses on core prices because they give a better sense of underlying inflation pressures .
But that does n't mean the central bank does n't pay attention to the overall inflation number .
" We drive ; we eat ; we understand that inflation involves all prices , not just those that are not volatile , " Bernanke told Congress .
A big risk is that higher energy prices will start to work their way through to consumers , pushing inflation as they slow the economy .
Cliff Waldman , economist at Manufacturers Alliance / MAPI , a trade group in Arlington , Va. , says so far , manufacturers are able to weather the high energy costs , but their tolerance is " not limitless . "
A strong worldwide economy is leading to stronger export growth , and improved technology has allowed factories to use less energy in their production processes , both factors that are aiding factories .
But if prices were to go higher and stay there , it could cause problems for the economy , he says .
" As oil climbs , we have a reason to get a little nervous , " he says .

The folks who gave us the Willie Horton ads , the Swift boat campaign , the purges of black voters in Florida and endless other dirty electoral tricks are at it again .
Like crack addicts confronting the irresistible vial , the evil geniuses of the G.O.P. ca n’t seem to help themselves .
This time — with an eye toward seizing the White House again next year , even if they lose the popular vote — they ’re trying to rewrite the rules for the distribution of electoral votes in California .
Under current law , all of California ’s 55 electoral votes go to the presidential candidate who wins the popular vote statewide .
This “ winner take all ” system is the norm in the U.S.
It ’s in place in all but two states , Maine and Nebraska , which have just four and five electoral votes , respectively .
Now comes a move , from lawyers with close ties to the Republican Party , to scrap the current system in California and replace it with one that would divide up the electoral votes in a way that would likely give 20 or more of them to the candidate who loses the popular vote in the state .
fun fold f v nil = v | fold f v ( x : : xs ) = f( x , fold f v xs ) val plus = fn ( a , b ) => a + b val sumlist = fold plus 0 val sum = sumlist ( [ 5,6,7,8,9 ] )
and I set out to write the same code in Perl .
sub foldd { my $f = shift ; sub { my $v = shift ; sub { my $ list = shift ; if ( $ list - > { ' type'} eq ' EMPTY ' ) { return $ v ; } else { return $ f ->( $ list - > { ' head'} , foldd ( $f ) - > ( $ v ) - >( $ list - > {' tail '} ) ) ; } } } } my $ fold = \&foldd ; my $ plus = sub { shift ( @_ ) + shift ( @_ ) ; } ; my $ sumlist = $ fold - >( $ plus ) - > ( 0 ) ; my $ sum = $ sumlist ->( { ' type ' => ' CONS ' , ' head ' => 5 , ' tail ' => { ' type ' => ' CONS ' , ' head ' => 6 , ' tail ' => { ' type ' => ' CONS ' , ' head ' => 7 , ' tail ' => { ' type ' => ' CONS ' , ' head ' => 8 , ' tail ' => { ' type ' => ' CONS ' , ' head ' => 9 , ' tail ' => { ' type ' => ' EMPTY ' } } } } } } ) ; print $ sum ;
Observations :
My SML code is much longer than it needs to be ; it could have been written simply as " foldl op + 0 [ 5,6,7,8,9 ] " .
Even without the long list of numbers , Perl is much longer .
Moreover , it was also significantly more difficult to debug .
Without SML 's static type checking , Perl would do things like cast a function pointer into an integer and feed it to the plus function .
So even if Perl could technically support functional programming , I highly recommend against it .
Formatting may be lacking as a result .

Posted on June 7 , 2007 , William Assassin's Creed Coming this November
Ubisoft finally announced today that Assassin ’s Creed will be released this November .
The anticipated title will be coming to the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and the PC .
This is great news considering some feared the title may not make it to the shelves until 2008 .
So far , it looks like this will be an awesome holiday season for game purchasing .
In addition to the standard version , the company will also release a Limited Edition version of the game , set to retail at $ 69.99 with :
Microsoft Redefines " Genuine "
Microsoft has a new advertising campaign focussing on their efforts to reduce " piracy " of their software , that is , the sale of their software in violation of license agreements .
You can read about it here .
They call this campaign the " Microsoft Genuine Software Initiative " and use the term " genuine " in contexts such as this :
In the month of May , 38,000 customers purchased genuine Windows software after being notified that they had been sold non-genuine software .
Customers recognize that the value of genuine is greater than ever .
I find this use of " genuine " to be most peculiar .
An unlicensed copy of Microsoft Windows is perfectly genuine .
It has exactly the same functionality as a licensed copy and was made by the same company .
In contrast , if you buy a " Rorex " watch , it is not genuine because it is not made by the Rolex company and does not have the aesthetics , functionality , and resale value of a real Rolex .
What Microsoft is concerned about is the software equivalent of buying a refrigerator that fell off the truck .
The problem is not that you are not getting the real thing - the problem is that the transaction is not legal .
I suspect that Microsoft is attempting to redefine " genuine " because it has had a hard time getting sympathy for its actual complaint , namely unlicensed distribution .
Rightly or wrongly , many people consider Microsoft 's software overpriced , or dislike its license conditions or business practices , or are just cheap and dishonest .
Whatever the reasons may be , a great many people have little sympathy for a campaign based on Microsoft 's legal or moral rights .
I suspect that Microsoft is trying to reframe the issue in terms of genuiness in the hope of persuading consumers that Microsoft is looking after their interests rather than its own .
P.S. Some reader will likely respond that a licensed copy has greater functionality than an unlicensed copy because the user may be unable to install or use the unlicensed copy .
That is true to some extent , but it is true only by virtue of Microsoft 's efforts to block the use of unlicensed software , not due to any intrinsic property of the software .
It is therefore not an argument for the superiority of the genuine article of the same sort as Rolex might make for its watches .
Addendum 2006-09-16 20:22 PST .
A note to Slashdot readers .
Quite a few people seem to think that I am lamenting how the language is going to the dogs because Microsoft is using the word " genuine " in a way that deviates from what I consider to be the correct meaning .
Relax , that is not the point .
All of us here at Language Log think that linguistic variation and change is normal and nothing to get upset about .
( Some of us do occasionally pretend to complain about it , but it is always tongue - in - cheek . )
The point I am making here is that rather that Microsoft is using " genuine " in a way that deviates from the way it is commnly used and that this evidently for the purpose of putting a deceptive slant on things .

Republican senator : GOP will be ready by September to start looking at troop withdrawal Josh Catone
Published : Sunday May 27 , 2007 Print This Email This Republican Senator Jeff Sessions ( R - AL ) said this morning on CBS '
Face the Nation that " unless something extraordinary happens , " most members of Congress believe that troop withdrawal should be on the table in September .
" We have to be realistic , " he said .
" We have to know that we can't achieve everything we 'd like to achieve .
We have a limited number of men and women we can send to Iraq , and we can't overburden them . "
Sessions , who has been a staunch supporter of President Bush , and was ranked the 5th most conservative US senator by the political magazine the National Journal in March 2007 , said that simply removing troops would " really embolden the enemy . "
The senator argued that the best solution for Iraq is one in which the Iraqi government steps up its efforts to secure Iraq without US assistance .
However , he continued , " I do n't think we need to be any occupying power .
This is a fine line we 've walked , and this surge has got to be temporary . "
When asked if Bush felt as he did , that the surge must be temporary , Sessions said he was " coming around . "
Speaking about a report in yesterday 's New York Times , that said the Defense Department is considering drawing down troops by up to 50 % in 2008 , Sessions said , " I certainly hope that 's what will occur .
We cannot sustain this level , in my opinion , in Iraq and Afghanistan much longer . "
Appearing on the program with Sessions , Senator Carl Levin ( D - MI ) wondered why the US could n't change course now .
Levin argued that because Bush has not set firm dates for the Iraqi government to achieve certain goals , they lack the motivation necessary to get anything done .
" There must be no ambiguity .
This president is totally ambiguous , and he does n't get it .
He talks about the Iraq political leaders needing to do something , but he wo n't say what they must do or what the consequences are going to be , " he said .

SLOWLY but seemingly relentlessly , America 's deal with India on nuclear co-operation is wending its way to fruition .
Two years after it was first announced in Washington by George Bush and Manmohan Singh , India 's prime minister , the two countries have concluded negotiations on the terms of a technical agreement governing that co-operation .
Both sides have claimed a great breakthrough .
Nicholas Burns , the State Department official who has shepherded the deal through a maze of complications , called it “ perhaps the single most important initiative in the 60 years of our relationship ” .
M.K. Narayanan , Mr Singh 's national - security adviser , called it “ a touchstone of a transformed bilateral relationship ” .
That once distant ties between America and India are warming up is indeed cause for celebration .
But the heat also burns a huge hole in the global non-proliferation regime .
As this newspaper has argued ever since the deal was first mooted , this is wrong , dangerous and unnecessary .
India first tested a nuclear device in 1974 ( and became a declared nuclear - weapons state in 1998 ) , inspiring the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , which it , like Pakistan and Israel , never signed , and which its agreement with America perhaps fatally undermines .
Yet in both Delhi and Washington , DC , opposition to the agreement tends to be dismissed as nitpicking that ignores a fundamental shift .
India , which tilted Soviet - wards during the cold war , and remains by far the most powerful exponent of “ non-alignment ” , is entering a “ strategic partnership ” with America .
The world 's oldest democracy is at last going to be on the closest of terms with its largest democracy .
What could make more sense , when , in the background , a potentially hostile , undemocratic Asian giant is rapidly gaining economic weight , and adding military muscle ?
To spare everybody 's blushes , the rise of China is rarely mentioned as a factor in America 's nuclear exception for India .
But it is perhaps the fundamental impulse behind it .
Yet linking an end to India 's nuclear isolation to the need for a strategic hedge against the rise of China makes no sense .
No threat from China is either so great or so pressing .
Its army is indeed modernising and spending lavishly .
But as our briefing points out ( see article ) , its military budget , in hard - currency terms , is not much bigger than France's .
It remains decades away from being able to mount a credible military challenge to American pre-eminence .
Moreover , whereas conflict remains possible , especially over Taiwan , China 's priorities are internal : coping with the social and political dislocation that its economic revolution entails .
Nor is the nuclear prize going to buy undivided Indian loyalty .
Mr Singh 's leftist parliamentary allies will balk at anything that smacks of toeing America 's line , and especially of jettisoning close ties with Iran , an American priority .
Nehruvian “ non-alignment ” runs deep .
Even Mr Singh — liberal economist and leader of the drive for better relations with America — felt compelled last year to call Fidel Castro “ one of the greatest men of our times ” .
The main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , in government when India went nuclear in 1998 , is stridently nationalist .
Yashwant Sinha , the BJP 's most recent foreign minister , has criticised the government already for giving America too much .
Conversely , the collapse of the deal is not going to fling India into any sort of embrace with China .
Relations , still scarred by their war in 1962 , are improving apace .
China will soon be India 's largest trading partner .
But mutual suspicion and rivalry for resources mean that China will remain India 's main strategic threat — the one it cited to justify the 1998 nuclear tests .
No matter what nuclear stance America takes , India can be relied on to keep a healthy distance from China .
How to send all the wrong messages
China , then , is no justification for the damage America 's nuclear concessions to India will do .
They may yet trip at the remaining hurdles : in the American Congress ; at the International Atomic Energy Agency ; or the 45 - member Nuclear Suppliers Group .
The text of the latest agreement has not been made public .
But from what has been said about it , it makes the damage far worse , by allowing India to reprocess American - supplied nuclear fuel , and by permitting it to build fuel stockpiles and hence withstand any future cut - off of supplies should it test another bomb .
America claims that other aspirant nuclear powers , notably Iran , will learn the benefits of good behaviour — ie , of India 's fairly respectable record on non-proliferation .
More likely , however , the rewards India ( and North Korea ) are reaping will encourage countries without the bomb to strive to acquire one as soon as possible .
In the wake of the MacArthur Park melee , LAPD Chief William J. Bratton had decided the best way to avoid future problems is for his department to produce its own brand of reality television .
A Los Angeles Police Department camera crew will follow officers through major incidents , recording their actions from the early roll call to the after - incident report .
“ Every 15 minutes or 30 minutes , the incident commander will narrate what is occurring at the event , ” said Deputy Chief Mike Hillman , the new head of the department ’s critical - incident training bureau , who developed the idea .
Officials hope the camera will provide a solid record of what happened -- and keep officers on their best behavior .

During the May 1 immigration rally at the park , TV cameras recorded officers swinging batons and firing less - than - lethal weapons at protesters and journalists .
Bratton has expressed concerns over the police actions and demoted two commanders who oversaw the incident .
LAPD and FBI investigations are continuing .
The LAPD is no stranger to videotaping , but usually officers did n’t know they were being recorded .
The department was roiled by the 1991 videotape of officers beating motorist Rodney G. King .
Three years ago , a TV news helicopter crew recorded an LAPD officer beating car - chase suspect Stanley Miller with a flashlight .
Several cellphone videos of LAPD officers dealing with suspects have ended up on the YouTube website recently .
Advertisement
LAPD videographers have long worked with the department , generally in an ancillary role .
Now , they will take center stage .
“ Everything we do needs to be documented so we have an accounting of our actions , ” Hillman said .
It ’s part of a larger cultural shift for officers .
Advertisement
In the age of cellphone cameras , LAPD Cmdr .
Andrew Smith said he tells officers that “ each and every action you take on the streets is likely to be on video . ”
Mary Grady , LAPD communications director and a former TV reporter , said that videographers are being trained how best to capture the establishment of skirmish lines and other tactics at major events to tell the story .
At the recent labor union march , Deputy Chief Richard Roupoli became the first incident commander to formally begin providing a documentary commentary on events .
Images can also do more than document events : LAPD officials say they can also allow them to make better decisions during the event .
Advertisement
Next month , the LAPD will equip a helicopter with a state - of - the - art , high - definition camera capable of covertly capturing from several thousand feet up detailed images of an incident , even in low light .
The images will be beamed to a command station on the ground and back to top officials at police headquarters in real time .

AUGUST 23 -- Parents of minors starring in ' Kid Nation , ' the controversial new CBS reality show , signed away their rights to sue the network and the show 's producers if their child died , was severely injured , or contracted a sexually transmitted disease during the program 's taping .
The blanket liability waivers are contained in a detailed ' participant agreement ' prepared by the show 's producers and signed by parents .
That document , a copy of which you 'll find below , also gave consent to CBS and its production partners to make medical treatment decisions on the minor 's behalf ( including surgery ) , though the network made no promises about the ' qualifications or credentials ' of medical professionals that might treat the stars of ' Kid Nation , ' which was originally titled ' The Manhattan Project . '
The show , which debuts next month , features 40 children ( ages 8 - 15 ) living in a New Mexico ' ghost town ' for 40 days without adult supervision .
Concerns about possible violations of child labor laws have prompted state officials to investigate the TV production .
A copy of the participant agreement was provided to TSG by the New Mexico attorney general 's office in response to an open records request .
By signing the agreement , a parent gave CBS the right to ' search the Minor 's person and the Minor 's belongings ( including , without limitation , by x-ray or similar device ) . '
Additionally , the agreement notes , ' Kid Nation ' participants ' will have no privacy , ' except when they are in the bathroom .
Provided , of course , that the child is actually ' in the process of showering , bathing , urinating , or defecating . '
Parents are also asked to attest that their offspring has never been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony , and has never had a restraining order entered against them .
The agreement also includes a strict confidentiality clause covering media contacts and the disclosure of anything learned during the show 's production .
If a parent or minor violates these confidentiality provisions , they will be liable to CBS for a $ 5 million penalty , according to the agreement .
' Kid Nation ' participants were paid $ 5000 , though some earned $ 20,000 bonuses pegged to their performance in the program 's individual 13 episodes .

The tool detected changes to a page about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
Wikipedia Scanner allegedly shows that workers on the agency 's computers made edits to the page of Iran 's president .
It also purportedly shows that the Vatican has edited entries about Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams .
The tool , developed by a US researcher , trawls a list of 34 m edits and matches them to the net address of the editor .
Wikipedia is a free online encyclopaedia that can be created and edited by anyone .
Most of the edits detected by the scanner correct spelling mistakes or factual inaccuracies in profiles .
However , others have been used to remove potentially damaging material or to deface sites .
Mistaken identity
On the profile of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the tool indicates that a worker on the CIA network reportedly added the exclamation " Wahhhhhh ! " before a section on the leader 's plans for his presidency .
A warning on the profile of the anonymous editor reads : " You have recently vandalised a Wikipedia article , and you are now being asked to stop this type of behaviour . "
It is claimed the entry was changed by a CIA computer user
Other changes that have been made are more innocuous , and include tweaks to the profile of former CIA chief Porter Goss and celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey .
When asked whether it could confirm whether the changes had been made by a person using a CIA computer , an agency spokesperson responded : " I can not confirm that the traffic you cite came from agency computers .
" I 'd like in any case to underscore a far larger and more significant point that no one should doubt or forget :
The CIA has a vital mission in protecting the United States , and the focus of this agency is there , on that decisive work . "
Radio change
The site also indicates that a computer owned by the US Democratic Party was used to make changes to the site of right - wing talk show host Rush Limbaugh .
The changes brand Mr Limbaugh as " idiotic , " a " racist " , and a " bigot " .
An entry about his audience now reads : " Most of them are legally retarded . "
We really value transparency and the scanner really takes this to another level
Wikipedia spokesperson
The IP address is registered in the name of the Democratic National Headquarters .
A spokesperson for the Democratic Party said that the changes had not been made on its computers .
Instead , they said that the " IP address is the same as the DCCC " .
The DCCC , or Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , is the " official campaign arm of the Democrats " in the House of Representatives and shares a building with the party .
" We do n't condone these sorts of activities and we take every precaution to ensure that our network is used in a responsible manner , " Doug Thornell of the DCCC told the BBC News website .
Mr Thornell pointed out that the edit had been made " close to two years ago " and it was " impossible to know " who had done it .

The site also indicates that Vatican computers were used to remove content from a page about the leader of the Irish republican party Sinn Fein , Gerry Adams .
Wikipedia already collects the IP address or username of editors
The edit removed links to newspaper stories written in 2006 that alleged that Mr Adams ' fingerprints and handprints were found on a car used during a double murder in 1971 .
The section , titled " Fresh murder question raised " is no longer part of the main online encyclopaedia entries .
Wikipedia Scanner also points the finger at commercial organisations that have modified entries about the pages .
One in particular is Diebold , a company which supplies electronic voting machines in the US .
In October 2005 , a person using a Diebold computer removed paragraphs about Walden O'Dell , chief executive of the company , which revealed that he had been " a top fund - raiser " for George Bush .
A month later , other paragraphs and links to stories about the alleged rigging of the 2000 election were also removed .
The paragraphs and links have since been reinstated .
Diebold officials have not responded to requests by the BBC for information about the changes .

Many timid writers and commentators arewaking up to the fact that the powers - that - be are whipping up fear of the enemy in order to justify their imperial wars of aggression and a consolidation of power at home .
For example , liberal website Buzzflash is today running as its main story an editorial comparing Bush and company to the Nazis , and discussing how the Nazis bullied the legislature into passing the enabling act after the Reichstag fire .
But they 're missing the most important piece of the puzzle : the Nazis themselves lit the Reichstag fire and blamed it on others ( if you have trouble playing the clip , it is because the website hosting the clip requires you to download the clip before playing it ) .
The fire was the event which justified Hitler 's seizure of power and suspension of liberties .
And it is widely known that the Nazis , in Operation Himmler , faked attacks on their own people and resources which they blamed on the Poles , to justify the invasion of Poland .
And it was n't just the Nazis .
False flag attacks have almost always been the real root of wars and empires
This reality of the millenia - long secret of false flag terror is right in front of your eyes .

Iraqi TVs Carry Further Reporting , Commentary on Congressional Testimonies 11 Sep
Iraq — OSC Summary
Tuesday , September 11 , 2007
This summary highlights select Iraqi TV reporting and commentary on the testimonies before Congress made by General David Petraeus , commander of the Multinational Force in Iraq , and US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker , in Washington on 10 September .
It covers reports carried on : — Cairo Al - Rafidayn Satellite Channel in Arabic — Pro-Sunni , anti-US Iraqi channel believed to be affiliated with the Association of Muslim Scholars — Baghdad Baghdad Satellite Television in Arabic — television channel believed to be sponsored by the Iraqi Islamic Party — Cairo Al - Baghdadiyah Satellite Television in Arabic — Private Iraqi television known for its opposition to the US presence in Iraq — Baghdad Al - Furat Television Channel in Arabic — Television channel affiliated with the Shiite group , the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council , led by Abd - al - Aziz al - Hakim — Al - Sulaymaniyah Al - Fayha Television in Arabic —
A private , independent satellite channel that addresses Iraq - related issues , supervised by Muhammad al - Ta ’i , an Iraqi media figure Al - Rafidayn Satellite Channel
Within its 1300 GMT newscast on 11 September , Al - Rafidayn Satellite Channel carries the following reports :
–“ Incumbent National Security Adviser Muwaffaq al - Rubay ’i has welcomed the reports submitted by the commander of the US occupation troops in Iraq and the occupying power ’s ambassador , claiming that they were positive in general .
Furthermore , he claimed that such assessment reports confirm the transparent handling and assessment of the situation , as he put it .
For his part , Ali al - Dabbagh , spokesman for the incumbent government , said that the incumbent government would be comfortable with a gradual withdrawal of the US occupation troops as long as such plans are discussed with the government in Baghdad .
He added :
Any precipitous withdrawal would not be in the interest of any party ; it would not be in the interest of Iraq or the region . ”
Within its 1400 GMT newscast on 11 September , Al - Rafidayn Satellite Channel carries the following reports :
–“ In his testimony before Congress , Gen David Petraeus , commander of the occupation troops in Iraq , has claimed that an early withdrawal from Iraq would be catastrophic .
However , he recommended that an initial reduction of troops totaling 4,000 be implemented in December .
For his part , Ryan Crocker , ambassador of the US occupying power to Iraq , warned that Iran would gain from a US withdrawal from Iraq , as this would allow it to consolidate its control of resources and perhaps territory in Iraq . ”
This is followed by a commentary read by an unidentified Al - Rafidayn Satellite Channel correspondent , who says : “ There is nothing new or unexpected in the reports submitted by US General David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker , ambassador of the occupying power , in the course of the false testimonies they made before Congress . ”
The commentary adds : “ The paragraphs containing lies and the allegations made by the two US officials were the hallmarks of the theatrical show performed at a tumultuous session that was marked by disorder and chaos , which were pretty similar to the disorder and chaos the US occupation troops created in Iraq .
Nonetheless , the Congress ’s microphones in the state which considers itself the global policemen stubbornly remained silent for some time as if they were saying :
Stop the lies and allegations .
War General David Petraeus , commander of the occupation troops in Iraq , repeated the claim that the strategy of the occupiers in Iraq is largely achieving its military objectives . ”
The commentary continues : “ Despite the admission of failure seen every now and then , the US arrogance continued to demonstrate itself through the words of Petraeus , who alleged that it is possible to achieve the US objectives in Iraq as well as peace therein — the peace that has turned into a weird term in the lexicon of the Iraqis and their daily routine .
Petraeus said that it is possible to achieve peace .
He explicitly accused Iran of waging a proxy war on Iraqi territory through its support for militias and armed groups and aiding them , either through weapons supplies or training . ”
The commentary says : “ Ryan Crocker , the ambassador of the US occupying power , joined Petraeus by warning that Iran would gain from a US withdrawal from Iraq , and that if such a withdrawal were to be carried out , it would consolidate Iran ’s control of resources , and maybe territory in Iraq .
Crocker , who shared Petraeus ’s views , admitted that the situation in Iraq is difficult .
However , he claimed that the alternatives are worse .
He repeated the allegation that it is possible to achieve the US goals in Iraq and achieve peace therein .
What kind of peace , security , and stability can be achieved in Iraq in the midst of these bloodbaths and this stench of death , which is being smelled across Iraq ?
Immediately afterward , an unidentified anchorman conducts a live telephone interview with Nizar al - Samarra ’i , a writer and political analyst , in Damascus .
When asked about the Congressional testimonies by Petraeus and
Crocker , Al - Samarra ’i says : “ First , what can we expect from a report prepared by officials of the US Administration ?
The US ambassador is associated with the State Department and acts upon the directives of the US president .
Likewise , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( corrects himself ) the commander of the US troops in Iraq is associated with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the defense secretary .
What can we expect from an official government report on the situation in Iraq except embellishing the image of the US behavior in Iraq by saying that the US strategy is making big successes in Iraq ?
This report seems to be a response to the Hamilton - Baker report , which recommended a change in the US strategy in the Iraqi arena . ”
Al - Samarra ’i adds : “ What is important is that the US president wagered immensely on the reports prepared by the commander of the US troops in Iraq and the US ambassador .
This is due to the pressures that could be put on officials .
Given this , it is easy to understand that the report was fully harmonious with the wishes of the US president . ”
In conclusion , he notes partisan rivalries and differences between the Democrats and Republicans over Iraq .
Baghdad Satellite TV
Within its 1700 GMT newscast on 11 September , Baghdad Satellite Channel carries the following reports :
–“ Gen David Petraeus , commander of the US troops in Iraq , has said that the number of US troops could be reduced to some 130,000 by next summer , which is the number of troops before the surge ordered by US President George Bush this year .
But , it is too early to say when this number could be reduced to below 130,000 , Gen Petraeus noted . ”
This is followed by a report , which says : “ With regard to the local political elites , veteran Iraqi politician Mahmud Uthman , MP for the Kurdistan Alliance , said that President Bush ’s recent visit to Iraq was driven by a desire to hold consultations with Ambassador Crocker and Gen Petraeus before they submit their reports to the US Congress . ”
The report adds : “ Commenting on the testimonies of the two men , Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih expressed regret over the government ’s political performance , which has not measured up to the required level of handling the unseen challenges posed to the country .
He affirmed that the US troop surge achieved palpable security gains , but noted that these gains will be squandered unless Iraqi politicians work to achieve national reconciliation .
For his part , Adnan al - Dulaymi , head of the Iraqi Al - Tawafuq Front , said that the two reports were realistic and reflected the situation in Iraq .
He noted that the two reports stressed the need for national reconciliation , and for the government to heed real interests , which could foster the construction of Iraq .
Izzat al - Shahbandar , MP for the Iraqi List , was not surprised by the content of the reports submitted by Petraeus and Crocker .
He noted that the two men had earlier stated that a US withdrawal from Iraq would give Iran the opportunity to control Iraq .
Nasir al - Isawi , MP for the Al - Sadr bloc , said that the reports are an attempt to buy more time ahead of the laying out of a new strategy in Iraq . ”
Then , Iraqi laypersons are shown expressing their views on the Congressional testimonies .
An unidentified middle - aged Iraqi man is shown saying : “ By God , I am personally opposed to the notion of an immediate withdrawal by US troops , the international troops .
Why ?
Because the situation here in Iraq is unstable .
There is a need for a timetable for the withdrawal of the US Army . ”
Afterward , a young man is shown saying : “ Definitely , we are all sure that a US withdrawal is inevitable .
We do not disagree over this matter at all .
Meanwhile , we have a good government , enlightened people , and good field commanders .
If a sort of general solidarity is achieved , we will support and bless a US withdrawal . ”
Al - Baghdadiyah Satellite Television
— At 1400 GMT on 11 September , Al - Baghdadiyah Satellite Television begins to carry a live relay of the closing session of the US Congressional testimonies by Petraeus and Crocker .
Crocker is shown making his testimony .
Then , Petraeus is shown making his testimony .
At 1420 GMT , Al - Baghdadiyah Satellite Television conducts a live telephone interview with Iraqi MP Mufid al - Jaza ’iri for comments on the testimonies of both Crocker and Petraeus .
Al - Jaza ’iri says : “ I think that this report was largely harmonious with the approaches of the US policy in Iraq .
To do it justice , this report was largely honest in depicting developments in the security situation . ”
Al - Jaza ’iri adds : “ Following this report , I think that many tensions here in Iraq will be defused .
Better conditions for rapprochement and understanding among the various political forces will be made available .
Likewise , in general , an environment that is conducive to addressing outstanding issues , particularly those pertaining to national reconciliation , which is key to any true progress in the coming period , will be created . ”
When asked on whether this report backs the Iraqi Government or casts doubt on its successes , Al - Jaza ’iri says : “ In general , I think that this report came to lend a measure of credibility to ( the performance of ) the Iraqi Government .
This report certainly noted some aspects over which the US side represented by Petraeus and Crocker and the Iraqi Government were in disagreement .
Nonetheless , in general , all in all , the report can be considered positive , given how it viewed the evolution of the political process .
Of course , the report did not fail to mention an important issue ; namely , that there are many aspects which still need to be addressed .
Greater efforts could have been made in the past to address these aspects . “
When asked to respond to some detractors who described Petraeus ’s remarks regarding the security situation in Iraq as “ fabrications , ” Al - Jaza ’iri says : “ I do not think that they are fabrications .
Many of the things he talked about are palpable things that we feel every day in our daily life .
The security situation has certainly improved .
There is no doubt about this , but the political situation has not improved . ”
When asked about the remarks that Petraeus and Crocker made on Iran and Syria , and whether there could be US military action against them , Al - Jaza ’iri does not rule out this possibility .
However , he adds : “ The use of military force against either Syria or Iran because of Iraq is a matter that has thus far remained out of the question or unlikely .
However , the United States might wage a war against Iran due to the ( Iranian ) nuclear reactor or other pretexts . ”
In conclusion , Al - Jaza ’iri says : “ We must take into account that the reports submitted by Petraeus and Crocker are not directed to the Iraqi or Arab public .
Rather , they are directed to the American public and meant to address the political situation in the United States .
They are meant to be factored in the struggles among various political forces in the United States .
They are meant to provide some sort of ammunition for the battle being waged by President Bush against his Democratic opponents , who , for their part , are sharpening their weapons and getting prepared . ”
Immediately afterward , Al - Baghdadiyah Satellite Television says : “ US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker had warned that Iran would stand to gain from any US withdrawal from Iraq .
In his testimony before the US Congress , Crocker noted the possibility of Iran carrying out an intervention in Iraq in case the United States withdraws its troops from there . ”
At 1433 GMT , Al - Baghdadiyah Satellite Television says : “ Husayn al - Falluji , member of the Council of Representatives for the Al - Tawafuq Front , has said that the reports su bmitted to the US Congress by Gen David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker have affirmed that the problem in Iraq is political rather than security - related .
He added that the reports constitute a message addressed to the United States , given the fact that they noted that the US strategy is being implemented properly . ”
–“ Mustafa al - Hiti , MP for the National Dialogue Front , today criticized the Crocker and Petraeus reports , saying that they painted a rosy picture of the situation in Iraq at a time when life comes to a standstill at 1800 in Baghdad . ”
The Al - Baghdadiyah Satellite Television report adds : “ Al - Hiti expressed the belief that the reports came to embellish the image of the Al - Maliki government , or the image of the Bush administration and his party , which is facing opposition and crises in the United States . ”
Al - Furat Television Channel
Within its 1700 GMT newscast on 11 September , Al - Furat Television Channel carries the following reports :
–“ Ammar Al - Hakim ( son of Abd - al - Aziz al - Hakim , chief of the Iraqi Islamic Supreme Council ) has received Australian Ambassador to Iraq Marc Innes - Brown .
During the meeting , the two sides discussed the key points enshrined in the reports submitted ( to Congress ) by Gen David Petraeus , commander of the Multinational Force in Iraq , and US Ambassador in Baghdad Ryan Crocker .
They also discussed the enhancement of friendly bilateral ties .
Furthermore , they discussed the latest political and security developments in Iraq and the region . ”
–“ The US Congress listened to two reports submitted by US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and Gen David Petraeus , commander of the Multinational Force .
In his report , Crocker commended the efforts made by the elected government on the political and economic fronts , and also in the area of national reconciliation .
He also praised the high sense of national responsibility felt by Iraqi leaders in the course of their handling of national issues .
For his part , Petraeus stressed that any progress on the political front is contingent upon progress on the security front . ”
–“ The ( Iraqi ) Government has welcomed the two reports submitted by US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and Gen David Petraeus , commander of the Multinational Force .
At a news conference , National Security Adviser Muwaffaq al - Rubay ’i affirmed that the issuance of such assessments of the political and security situation in the country confirms that there is transparency in assessing the political and security situation in the country . ”
Afterward , the Al - Furat Television Channel carries a report saying : “ The Al - Tawafuq bloc has described the results ( enshrined in the two reports ) as realistic .
The Kurdistan Alliance considered the two reports positive , noting that they harmonize with the government ’s efforts to safeguard security and stability . ”
Salim Abdallah , MP for the Iraqi al - Twafuq Front , is shown saying : “ My preliminary assessment is that they ( the two reports ) are somewhat realistic , particularly with regard to the issues pertaining to the security situation and the improvements that have taken place . ”
Then , Muhammad Khalil Qasim , MP for the Kurdistan Alliance , is shown saying : “ We welcome this assessment .
We within the Kurdistan Alliance support the government , his excellency the prime minister , and the efforts to render the political process a success . ”
–“ Parliamentary quarters have described the two reports submitted by Crocker and Petraeus as positive and constructive , and considered them as additional boost to the momentum of the political process , and to the elected government as well .
MPs indicated that the two US reports underlined the ( Iraqi ) political leaders ’ efforts and their determination to face up to challenges in the country .
Besides , these reports highlighted the notable progress made on the security front , they added . ”
– The Al - Furat Television Channel adds : “ Shaykh Khalid al - Atiyah , first deputy speaker of the Council of Representatives , has considered the reports submitted by Crocker and Petraeus as positive in general .
He added :
The two reports highlighted the key obstacles facing the national unity government in the course of its efforts to achieve national reconciliation and consolidate security and stability in the country , which were identified by government officials .
“ MP Ali al - Allaq affirmed that the US reports contained positive and constructive aspects and underlined the ( Iraqi ) political leaders ’ efforts to face up to challenges in the country , noting that the two reports , in general , support the ongoing political process in the country .
For his part , MP Qasim Dawud called for handling the reports submitted by Crocker and Petraeus seriously to ensure su pport for the march of the democratic process .
He added that the reports noted many positive points , including the stabilizing security situation being witnessed in Baghdad and Al - Anbar compared to what it was last year . ”
Al - Fayha Television
Within its 1300 GMT newscast on 11 September , Al - Fayha Satellite Channel carries the following reports :
–“ US Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and Gen David Petraeus , commander of the US troops in Iraq , yesterday , Monday , submitted their anticipated reports on field developments in Iraq on the political and security levels .
Gen Petraeus affirmed that US troops , in cooperation with Iraqi troops , managed to largely weaken the clout of the terrorist Al - Qa’ida Organization in Iraq over the past eight months , and to deprive it of a safe haven in Iraq , which strongly boosts the troop surge strategy .
He commended the Iraqi tribes ’ role in cooperating with the Iraqi Government to help achieve security and stability .
For his part , US Ambassador to Iraq Crocker affirmed that Iraq is currently experiencing a revolution , and not only a political regime change .
This is because Saddam Husayn left a sectarian regime behind him , Crocker argued .
He noted the Iraqi leaders ’ determination to confront tough problems .
The Crocker - Petraeus report harmonizes with the views of the Iraqi Government , which Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki expressed before the Council of Representatives . ”
–“ Gen David Petraeus painted a positive picture of developments in the security situation in Iraq .
In a testimony before the US Congress , he affirmed that the US troop surge in Iraq resulted in defeating the remnants of the terrorist Al - Qa’ida Organization in Baghdad , and that the effort to clear the remaining cities is under way . ”
This is immediately followed by another report , which says : “ Americans view the dialogue with Petraeus and US Ambassadr Ryan Crocker in Congress as an important milestone in the ongoing debate in the United States on the status of US troops in Iraq , which Bush pledged will stay in the country until full security is achieved .
However , many Democrats , who control the two houses of Congress , the House of Representatives and the Senate , are saying that the presence of these troops must be brought to an end . ”
–“ Iraqi Government Spokesman Dr Ali al - Dabbagh has described the report Petraeus submitted to Congress as positive .
However , he added that this report mentions some difficulties encountered in the field , and that it is important to provide time to fully prepare Iraqi security troops .
Al - Dabbagh went on to say that Iraq will be comfortable with a gradual withdrawal of US troops as long as such plans are discussed with the Baghdad government in advance .
He said that a precipitous withdrawal would not be in any party ’s interest ; such a withdrawal would be in the interest of neither Iraq , nor the region . ”
Friends , members of the press , fellow citizens .
( PAUSE ) If bitches squirted their seeds like dudes do , I 'd sure have egg on my face .
( PAUSE for a moment so the morons can get the joke ) Boo -yah !
But seriously , I stand before you today not to apologize or deny my behavior , but to give you a serious reality check .
Remember that scene in A Few Good Men where Jack Nicholson said , " You ca n't handle the truth " ?
Well , that 's surely the case here in Washington , D.C. and all across America as regards sex .
Now the fact is , I 'm a natural born lover 's man .
From the day I turned 17 and my mama took me out to the shed and taught me the truth about Southern love , I 've had a taste for it — if you know what I mean .
Nowadays , I like 'em short or tall , fat or skinny , blonde or brunette , young or old .
Hell , I 've even had me one of them chicks with dicks .
Craziest night I ever spent .
We did it all , and though I wo n't get into too much detail , I will say Señor Dirty Sanchez did make an appearance .
The point is —
I 'm a pretty good looking guy and I 've got money and power .
I do n't have to pay for it .
But the nice thing about hookers : you do n't have to please 'em .
You know what I mean ?
I mean , it 's nice to make a lady cum , but as you get older , you really just want to be serviced by a pro .
And Deborah Palfrey had her a full stable of fine mares , if you know what I mean .
Now I 'm sure some of you are sitting there feeling sorry for my wife , Wendy .
Give me a break !
Just check her out in that leopard - skin dress .
You think she ain't got a couple of boy toys down in Louisiana ?
Not only that , but we 've shared a few of Debbie 's finest together .
When Wendy goes down on a muffin , bitch 'll be frightenin ' the horses for miles around .
And besides , every time I turn around , Wendy wants another addition to the house , new clothes , a couple of weeks ' vacation alone with one of her boy toys in Rome .
( PAUSE .
Look sympathetically at Fred Dodds from The Post and wink .
And then get all folksy )
So do n't y'all be feelin ' too sorry for Wendy .
Listen .
I got into politics because a friend of mine who is a big time corporate attorney thought I 'd be good at it .
He said I should be a Republican .
He explained to me all about crony capitalism and told me I 'd make great connections and scads of money .
And all I had to do was represent the interests of my friends and donors .
They 'd tell me what to do .
It was a totally sweet deal .
But he did n't tell me about the moralism part — about how you 've got to be all about family values , and you 've got to be for teen abstinence and against the queers and porn and abortion and Janet Jackson 's nipples .
And that 's because the common Christian folks down in Louisiana do n't care that much about whether my financial supporters make butt - loads of money or not .
They care about pretending to hate sex — like it tells you to do in The Bible .
Y'all know what a rube is ?
It comes out of the circus .
It 's a word for folks who are easily scammed .
Or , do you know what a mark is ?
It 's an old term used by petty thiefs for people who are easy pickins .
I think , originally , the word was used by pickpockets .
Here 's how it works .
You got yourself a mark , and with your right hand , you 're waving around the bible in front of his face and shouting about salvation .
Then , with your left hand , you 're picking the asshole 's pocket .
( PAUSE for laughter )
Now , the common folks — working folks , poor folks who put me into office — they 're marks and rubes , right ?
OK .
That 's about all I have to say .
I 'm gonna stay in the Senate unless someone kicks me out .
And those who paid this piper will continue to call the tune .
I signed on to give my financial supporters a sweet deal , and that 's what I intend to do .
But I can no longer be a hypocrite about sex because … shit , like I said , I 'm a natural born lover 's man .
So I will fight to legalize prostitution and any other kind of sex adults want to have .
Gays can get married for all I care , although I can't see why they 'd wanna .
( PAUSE .
Glare at Wendy . )
And girls , if you 're looking for a nice chunk a change , you know where to find me .
I 'll be in the U.S. Senate where I plan to stay until my term runs out .
Any questions ?
" Sharon Labchuk is a longtime environmental activist and part - time organic beekeeper from Prince Edward Island .
She has twice run for a seat in Ottawa 's House of Commons , making strong showings around 5 % for Canada 's fledgling Green Party .
She is also leader of the provincial wing of her party .
In a widely circulated email , she wrote :
I 'm on an organic beekeeping list of about 1,000 people , mostly Americans , and no one in the organic beekeeping world , including commercial beekeepers , is reporting colony collapse on this list .
The problem with the big commercial guys is that they put pesticides in their hives to fumigate for varroa mites , and they feed antibiotics to the bees .
They also haul the hives by truck all over the place to make more money with pollination services , which stresses the colonies .
Her email recommends a visit to the Bush Bees Web site at Here , Michael Bush felt compelled to put a message to the beekeeping world right on the top page :
Most of us beekeepers are fighting with the Varroa mites .
I 'm happy to say my biggest problems are things like trying to get nucs through the winter and coming up with hives that wo n't hurt my back from lifting or better ways to feed the bees .
This change from fighting the mites is mostly because I 've gone to natural sized cells .
In case you were n't aware , and I was n't for a long time , the foundation in common usage results in much larger bees than what you would find in a natural hive .
I 've measured sections of natural worker brood comb that are 4.6 mm in diameter .
What most people use for worker brood is foundation that is 5.4 mm in diameter .
If you translate that into three dimensions instead of one , it produces a bee that is about half as large again as is natural .
By letting the bees build natural sized cells , I have virtually eliminated my Varroa and Tracheal mite problems .
One cause of this is shorter capping times by one day , and shorter post - capping times by one day .
This means less Varroa get into the cells , and less Varroa reproduce in the cells .
Who should be surprised that the major media reports forget to tell us that the dying bees are actually hyper - bred varieties that we coax into a larger than normal body size ?
It sounds just like the beef industry .
And , have we here a solution to the vanishing bee problem ?
Is it one that the CCD Working Group , or indeed , the scientific world at large , will support ?
Will media coverage affect government action in dealing with this issue ?
These are important questions to ask .
It is not an uncommonly held opinion that , although this new pattern of bee colony collapse seems to have struck from out of the blue ( which suggests a triggering agent ) , it is likely that some biological limit in the bees has been crossed .
There is no shortage of evidence that we have been fast approaching this limit for some time .
We 've been pushing them too hard , Dr. Peter Kevan , an associate professor of environmental biology at the University of Guelph in Ontario , told the CBC .
And we 're starving them out by feeding them artificially and moving them great distances .
Given the stress commercial bees are under , Kevan suggests CCD might be caused by parasitic mites , or long cold winters , or long wet springs , or pesticides , or genetically modified crops .
Maybe it 's all of the above ...
Article Received from Lancifer
Last time I discussed how the Kelly criterion optimizes your investment by maximizing your expected growth rate .
The previous example was based on a coin tossing game .
This time I will implement the optimization in a Haskell program to illustrate a more sophisticated example .
> module KellyCriterion where > > import qualified Data .
Map as M
To do this I will leverage the power of Haskell blogs .
One thing I need to do is compute expected values .
Eric Kidd implements a probability monad .
Unfortunately it does n’t come with an expected value function , So instand I grab Martin Erwig and Steve Kollmansberger ’s PFP library that Eric refers to .
> import Probability hiding ( expected ) -- pfp-jun06
Unfortunately even PFP ’s expected value function is n’t quite general enough .
Because this is just a blog post , I wo n’t bother fixing it right now .
I will just write my own later .
I did , however , replace all Float s with Double s .
Next up , I need to optimize functions .
For that I use automatic differentiation with Netwon ’s method .
Lennart Augustsson shows how this is can be done , but I will use my own implementation based on Vlad Andreev ’s post .
> import Diff
For this example I am going to optimize a portfolio of claims in a 2008 U.S. Presidential Nomination Market .
In particular , the 2008 Democratic Nomination Winner - Takes - All Market .
At the time of writing there are four mutually exclusive claims available : CLIN_NOM , EDWA_NOM , OBAM_NOM , for Clinton , Edwards , and Obama winning the democratic nomination respectively , and DROF_NOM for some other candidate winning .
I define a Portfolio to be a collection of a number of claims , along with an amount of cash .
> data Portfolio a = Portfolio > {cash :: a > , claims :: M.Map Claim a} > deriving Show > > newPortfolio :: a ->
Portfolio a > newPortfolio cash = Portfolio cash M.empty
I abstract the portfolio over the type to represent the number of claims and cash .
Normally I would use an integer type here , but I will need a Floating class to do continuous optimization later .
So it is just easiest to leave this type abstract for now .
> type Claim = String
I identify claims with strings .
If you know your list of claims at compile time , feel free to make an enumeration instead .
After the democratic nomination is over , this market closes and one of these 4 claims will pay out $ 1 per share .
If one knows the winner one can compute the final value of the portfolio .
> close :: ( Num a , Ord a ) => Portfolio a -> Claim -> a > close portfolio winner = > cash portfolio + sum ( map value ( M.toList ( claims portfolio ) ) ) > where > value ( claim , held ) | 0 <= held = if claim == winner > then held else 0 > | otherwise = if claim == winner > then 0 else - held
Some future markets , such as the Foresight Exchange , allow one to hold a negative number of claims by short selling a claim .
This is allowed , so long as one covers one ’s position by leaving $ 1 per share on deposit .
If the claim sold short ends up winning , one ’s deposit is used to cover that claim ; however , if the claim does not win , the deposit is returned .
The IEM does n’t allow shorting , but it can be simulated by purchasing a bundle of claims for $ 1 ( analogous to the deposit ) , and then selling the one claim you want to short .
In either case the interpretion of the value of negative numbers of claims is the same .
Given a winner , the growth rate is log ( ( close portfolio winner ) / initial_investment ) .
One question I struggled with was what value to use for the initial_investment .
By rearrange the above formula one gets log ( close portfolio winner ) - log initial_investment .
The trick is to realize that one only cares about what the optimal portfolio is , not what the optimal growth rate is .
Because log initial_investment is a constant , one can just drop it from the expression , and it will not affect where the optimal point occurs .
> growthRate :: ( Floating a , Ord a ) => Portfolio a -> Claim -> a > growthRate portfolio winner = log ( close portfolio winner )
Given a probability distribution of each claim winning , one can compute a probability distribution of growth rates by using the probability functor .
From this one can compute the expected growth rate of a portfolio .
> expectedGrowthRate :: > ( Floating a , Ord a ) => Dist Claim -> Portfolio a -> a > expectedGrowthRate distribution portfolio = > expected $ growthRate portfolio `fmap` distribution
Unfortunately the expected function from the PFP library always returns a Float and I need an arbitrary Floating value .
The quick and dirty solution is to steel a sliver of code from them and tweak it to return an arbitrary Floating type .
This is only a blog posting after all .
> expected :: ( Floating a ) => Dist a -> a > expected = sum . map ( \(x , p ) ->x*( fromReal p ) ) .
unD > > fromReal :: ( Real a , Fractional b ) => a -> b > fromReal = fromRational .
toRational
The next step is to optimize the expected growth rate .
To do this one needs the ability to adjust a portfolio by buying or selling claims at a particular price .
The fact that one can short claims by covering one ’s position throws a small wrinkle into an otherwise trivial computation .
So to simplify things , I first wrote a function to sell one ’s entire stake ( positive or negative ) in a claim .
> sellAll :: ( Floating a , Ord a ) => > Portfolio a -> Claim -> a ->
Portfolio a > sellAll portfolio claim price = > Portfolio cash ' claims ' > where > shares = M.findWithDefault 0 claim ( claims portfolio ) > cash ' = cash portfolio + shares `valueAtPrice` price > claims ' = M.delete claim ( claims portfolio )
The value of a stake is the number of shares times the price when holding a positive number of shares .
When holding a short position one has to buy back all the shares .
This costs money , but for each share you buy back , you also get your deposit back , so overall you gain money when buying back your short position .
The value of stake at a given price is the following .
> valueAtPrice :: ( Floating a , Ord a ) => a -> a -> a > shares `valueAtPrice` price | 0 <= shares = price * shares > | otherwise = ( 1 - price ) *( - shares )
To compute a new portfolio after increasing or decreasing one ’s ( positive or negative ) position in a claim , I find it simplest to imagine selling everything and then buying into the new position .
This avoids having to dance around the change in behaviour when moving from a positive to a negative position or vice versa .
> adjustPortfolio :: ( Floating a , Ord a ) => > Portfolio a -> Claim -> a -> a ->
Portfolio a > adjustPortfolio portfolio claim price delta = > Portfolio cash ' claims ' > where > new Amt = delta + M.findWithDefault 0 claim ( claims portfolio ) > portfolio ' = sell
All portfolio claim price > cash ' = cash portfolio ' - valueAtPrice newAmt price > claims ' = M.insert claim newAmt ( claims portfolio ' )
Finally , I am able to a function to find the optimal adjustment to a single claim of a portfolio given a price that you can buy and sell at and a distribution of winners .
To do this I create a function from delta the change in number of shares , to the expected growth rate .
Then I use Newton ’s method to find the optimal adjustment by using an initial guess of 0 .
> optimizePortfolio distribution portfolio claim price = > f `optimizeNear` 0 > where > f delta = expected GrowthRate distribution portfolio ' > where > portfolio ' = adjustPortfolio portfolio claim price delta
At the time of writing , the quotes for the 2008 Democratic Nomination Winner - Takes - All Market is the following :
Quotes current as of 10:30:00 CST , Sunday , August 19 , 2007 .
Symbol Bid Ask Last Low High Average CLIN_NOM 0.665 0.669 0.672 --- --- --- EDWA_NOM 0.058 0.063 0.056 --- --- --- OBAM_NOM 0.205 0.221 0.220 --- --- --- DROF_NOM 0.063 0.070 0.070 --- --- ---
These prices can be interpreted as the probability of these events occurring .
Suppose you disagree with these probabilities .
Suppose you think Clinton has a 65 % chance of winning , Edwards has a 6 % chance , Obama has a 22 % chance and a 7 % chance of someone else .
Starting with an investment of $ 200 , how much should you short sell CLIN_NOM ?
To answer this question one can load up the KellyCriterion module in GHCi
* KellyCriterion > let d = mkD [ ( " CLIN " , 0.65 ) , ( " EDWA " ,0.06 ) , ( " OBAM " , 0.22 ) , ( " DROF " ,0.07 ) ] * KellyCriterion > optimizePortfolio d ( newPortfolio 200 ) " CLIN " 0.665 -13.466502076085735
According to the Kelly criterion , you should short sell about 13.5 shares of CLIN_NOM .
I usually round my shares towards 0 ( to reduce variance ) , and so I would sell 13 shares .
How many shares of EDWA_NOM should you sell .
The bid price is $ 0.058 , so the optimal value is :
* KellyCriterion > optimizePortfolio d ( newPortfolio 200 ) " EDWA " 0.058 7.321180174243999
The recommendation is to buy 7 shares .
Of course one cannot buy at the bid price , one can only buy at the ask price of $ 0.063 .
* KellyCriterion > optimizePortfolio d ( newPortfolio 200 ) " EDWA " 0.063 - 10.164151039284278
But the recommendation at the ask price is to sell 10 shares .
This is n’t so surprising because the given probability of Edwards winning , 6 % , lies between the bid and ask price .
Therefore you should not execute any trades for EDWA_NOM .
Suppose you manage to execute your sale of 13 shares at the market price of $ 0.665 .
* KellyCriterion > : set - fno-monomorphism - restriction * KellyCriterion > let portfolio1 = adjustPortfolio ( newPortfolio 200 ) " CLIN " 0.665 ( - 13 ) * KellyCriterion > portfolio1 Portfolio {cash = 195.645 , claims = fromList [ ( " CLIN " , - 13.0 ) ] }
Let ’s ask how many shares of EDWA_NOM one should sell at the bid price now .
* KellyCriterion > optimizePortfolio d portfolio1 " EDWA " 0.058 - 1.843864491964051
Now it is recommending that you sell 1 share of EDWA_NOM .
What has changed ?
All the claims in this market are correlated because they are mutually exclusive outcomes .
When you have correlated claims it is possible to hedge your bets buy buying ( or in this case , selling ) both .
The intuitive idea is that if Clinton does win the nomination , then you can at least make some money back on Edwards losing the nomination .
Hedging your bets is what smart investors do , and the Kelly criterion automatically quantifies how to hedge your bets .
In this case you can increase portfolio ’s growth rate even though the odds are against you .
Automatic differentiation works by performing computations on infinitesimals .
This allows me to define a derivative even when I use case analysis in value and valueAtPrice .
Whether a left or right derivative is taken depends on whether I use a strict or non-strict inequality in the case analysis .
There is ( presumably ) a kink in my functions where my computation switches branches of the case analysis ; however there is only one optimal portfolio .
Newton ’s method seems to work fine for me in this situation , but one cannot always rely on optimizeNear when one ’s function is not smooth .
Not that Newton ’s method is reliable for smooth functions either .
The probability library is n’t extensively used in this example , but it would be more useful in more complex situations .

But for the state to put its recommendations in place in a coherent way , he said , would require an unlikely alignment of galaxies :
The Ohio State Board of Education , the state ’s new Democratic governor and its Republican - dominated Legislature would all have to cooperate closely .
“ And that ’s not to mention Ohio ’s 613 school districts , ” he added .
“ So it ’s a real challenge to align all these actors behind that reform . ”
In Mr. Blair ’s Britain , it was possible to impose a new policy quickly .
From 1997 through 2001 , when Sir Michael headed the Standards and Effectiveness Unit of the Department for Education and Skills , he presided over the shuttering of some 130 chronically low - performing English schools .
No American state has addressed its failing schools with a vigor that is even remotely similar , even though under No Child Left Behind , about 1,800 of the nation ’s schools have been identified as in need of overhaul .
So far , none of the 50 states have even outlined a forceful set of policies for such schools .
When it comes to failing schools , Sir Michael expresses impatience .
When a public school is failing — not just going through a rough patch , but also systematically failing to educate its students — he says there is only one question the authorities should consider : “ How do I get these children a good education as fast as possible ? ”
“ Once you have the answer to that question , you just do it , ” he said .
“ If it ’s close the school , you close it and move the children into a better one .
If there are no better schools nearby , close it and replace it with another on the same site .
But you do whatever it takes . ”
If Sir Michael uses forceful language as he recalls his days as a powerful official in the Blair government , in his role as a McKinsey partner he speaks more cautiously , noting the need to respect clients ’ confidentiality , and perhaps in deference to the McKinsey official sitting in on the interview .
( BFM Bourse ) - Nous tentons aujourd ' hui un difficile parallèle entre la chute enregistrée jeudi par Ubisoft ( - 6 % à la mi-journée ) et la montée en puissance de l'américain Electronic Arts ( EA ) dans le tour de table d'Ubisoft .
Précisément , l'AMF a rapporté mercredi qu'EA , par le jeu des droits de vote doubles détenait désormais 24.86 % des droits de vote d'Ubisoft , pour une participation de 15.37 % du capital .
L'éditeur américain pèse donc plus lourd que la famille Guillemot au sein de l'éditeur français de jeux vidéo .
Voilà qui devrait logiquement relancer les rumeurs de rachat d'Ubisoft par Electronics Arts .
Il ne semble pourtant pas que cela soit l'hypothèse jouée aujourd ' hui par le marché .
A l'inverse , le titre Gameloft bénéficie d'un regain d'intérêt manifeste .
Il a franchi ce matin à l'ouverture les 7 euros .
Cet arbitrage Gameloft / Ubisoft peut laisser penser , pour l'heure tout du moins , que les investisseurs croient davantage au scénario d'un rachat de Gameloft plutôt que d'Ubisoft .
Il est vrai que la cession récente par Ubisoft des 18.89 % du capital qu'il détenait dans Gameloft a laissé quasiment sans défense le numéro deux mondial des jeux vidéo pour téléphones mobiles .
Sur le sujet , un analyste contacté le 20 juillet dernier par Tradingsat.com déclarait : « J'ai toujours pensé qu'Ubisoft vendrait ses titres Gameloft quand la famille fondatrice aura peur qu'Ubisoft passe sous contrôle étranger ».
En cas d'offre hostile sur Ubisoft , le prédateur ne mettra ainsi la main que sur une seule des deux sociétés fondées par la famille Guillemot .
Face à la pression d'EA , celle - ci aurait donc choisi d'axer sa défense sur les jeux vidéo , donc sur Ubisoft .
Ce qui pourrait expliquer le mauvais comportement du titre aujourd 'hui .
La question suivante est alors de savoir si Gameloft peut susciter l'intérêt d'Electronic Arts .
Cette hypothèse ne choque pas Charles Louis Planade , de chez Arkeon Finance . «
Les dernières publications ont montré que Gameloft rattrapait rapidement Electronics
Arts sur le marché des jeux pour téléphones mobiles » , nous explique l'analyste , qui n'exclut donc pas que l'américain puisse éprouver le désir de se renforcer sur ce segment d'activité .
« Lorsqu'ils [ Electronics Arts ] font quelque chose dans le jeu vidéo , c'est pour être leader » , souligne - t - il .

Claim : Photograph shows a water - channel bridge in Germany .
Status : True .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , 2005 ]
An amazing water bridge in Germany … .
What a feat !
An amazing water bridge in Germany … .
What a feat !
Six years , 500 million euros , 918 meters long ……. now this is engineering !
This is a channel - bridge over the River Elbe and joins the former East and West Germany , as part of the unification project .
It is located in the city of Magdeburg , near Berlin .
The photo was taken on the day of inauguration .
I forwarded this to those who appreciate engineering projects …..
Origins :
The photograph displayed above is one of a real structure , a kilometer - long “ concrete bathtub ” water bridge over the Elbe River in Germany that joins the Elbe - Havel canal to the Mittelland canal near the eastern town of Magdeburg .
As Deutsche Welle described the bridge upon its completion in 2003 :
Taking six years to build and costing around half a billion euros , the massive undertaking will connect Berlin ’s inland harbor with the ports along the Rhine river .
At the center of the project is Europe ’s longest water bridge measuring in just shy of a kilometer at 918 meters .
The huge tub to transport ships over the Elbe took 24,000 metric tons of steel and 68,000 cubic meters of concrete to build .
Taking six years to build and costing around half a billion euros , the massive undertaking will connect Berlin ’s inland harbor with the ports along the Rhine river .

The huge tub to transport ships over the Elbe took 24,000 metric tons of steel and 68,000 cubic meters of concrete to build .
The water bridge will enable river barges to avoid a lengthy and sometimes unreliable passage along the Elbe .
Shipping can often come to a halt on the stretch if the river ’s water mark falls to unacceptably low levels .
Plans for joining the two canals had been conceived as far back as 1919 , and construction on such a project began during the 1930s , but first World War II and then the post - war division of Germany put the project on hold until after German reunification was achieved in the 1990s .

Editor ’s Note : Scott Ritter was a Marine Corps intelligence officer from 1984 to 1991 and a United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1998 .
He is the author of numerous books , and his latest is “ Waging Peace : The Art of War for the Antiwar Movement ” ( Nation Books , April 2007 ) .
I joined the American Legion a few years back .
As a veteran of the Persian Gulf War in 1991 , I was eligible to do so for some time but always hesitated , perhaps out of a sense of trying to deny that my days as an active - duty combatant were long past .
Every year , on Memorial Day , my fellow firefighters and I would gather in the basement of the local American Legion hall before we paraded before the town we protect .
I would look around at the uniforms and faded patches and ribbons worn by the veterans who joined us in the hall and realize that they , too , were deserving of a great deal more support than simply being wheeled out once a year to participate in a parade .
So I sent in my application and was accepted .
One of the fringe benefits of membership in the American Legion is a subscription to its monthly journal , The American Legion , billed as “ the magazine for a strong America . ”
It quickly became apparent that The American Legion magazine was a sounding board for many holding quite militaristic and jingoistic opinions based on their rather limited personal experiences , many dating back to World War II .
The war in Iraq , together with the overarching “ global war on terror , ” seems to be viewed by many in the American Legion as an extension of their own past service , and much effort is made to connect World War II and the Iraq conflict as part and parcel of the same ongoing American “ liberation ” of the world ’s oppressed .
It ’s a shame for these Legionnaires that the Iraqis could n’t have turned out to be blond , blue - eyed Germans who looked like us , and whose women could be wooed with chocolate and nylon stockings by the noble American liberator and occupier .
Or , short of that , passive Japanese , who freely submitted their women to the massage parlors and barracks of their American conquering heroes while their men rebuilt a shattered society .
The simplistic approach of many of the American Legion ’s most hawkish advocates for the ongoing disaster in Iraq seems to be drawn from a selective memory which seeks to impose a carefully crafted past experience dating back to the last “ good war ” ( i.e. , World War II ) , expunged of all warts and blemishes , onto the current situation in Iraq in a manner which strips away all reality .
It turns out that the Iraqis are n’t like German or Japanese people at all , but rather a fiercely independent ( if overly complex ) nation deeply resentful of a so - called liberation which has brought them nothing but pain and agony , primarily at the hands of those who have , unbidden , “ freed ” them from their past .
The fact that the Iraqis resent the ongoing American occupation , and choose to express this resentment through violent resistance instead of submissive passivity , is in turn resented by many of the Legion ’s membership .
“ War has been declared on the United States by those who are envious of our freedom , and they wo n’t stop until we are under their heel , ” writes one Legionnaire in a letter published in the May 2007 issue of “ the magazine for a strong America . ”
The juxtaposition of Iraq with those who perpetrated the events of Sept. 11 , 2001 , implied in this statement is reflective of a level of ignorance that boggles the mind .
Iraq never declared war on the United States , the salesmanship exhibited in our promotion of “ freedom ” in Iraq leaves nothing to envy , and the Iraqis will stop resisting when we leave their country .
Do n’t try telling that to the blustery former Marine who authored the letter in question , however .
He , like the majority of the Legion , is tired of hearing about “ Bush ’s war . ”
“ Death , Not in Vain ” is the title of the feature article of the May 2007 issue .
The story revolves around how the parents of one Marine who died in Iraq seek to define their son ’s sacrifice .
“ People may not agree with the reason we went to war , ” the mother of the fallen Marine is quoted as saying , “ but while our troops are over there , we ca n’t be telling the world what they are doing is wrong .
If we say we support them , we have to support what they are doing . ”
Of course , the nature of the “ disagreement ” surrounding the Iraq war is never fully articulated in the article .
There is no mention made of the discredited claims by President Bush and other war advocates about weapons of mass destruction or connections between Saddam Hussein ’s government and al - Qaida .
Instead , the reader is told repeatedly about how fallen American service members gave their lives for America and a “ free Iraq . ”
Quoting their fallen sons , the families of Marines killed in Iraq speak proudly of bold statements such as “ We need to be there , but it ’s going to be hard , and it is going to be a long time . ”
Yet they never explore the actual “ need ” cited .
“ We ’ve got to support the troops and the mission , ” the article quotes one family member as saying .
“ The two are dependent on each other . ” I ’m all for supporting the troops .
But blind support for a mission of such nebulous origin ?
This is a much different matter , one requiring more introspective investigation .
I do n’t think it was the magazine ’s intent , but a foundation of such an investigation was laid in the very same issue .
In his article “ Minimizing the Holocaust , ” Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz slams those who seek to dismiss Nazi Germany ’s effort to commit genocide against Europe ’s Jews .
It is a very difficult article to digest , not because of the legitimate premise that those who seek to deny or minimize the Holocaust are deserving of condemnation , but rather for the ease with which the moralistic Dershowitz explains the bombing of Dresden in 1945 as a “ legitimate act of belligerent reprisal for the relentless bombings of civilians in London and elsewhere , ” or the dismissive waving - off of the systematic starvation of 1 million German prisoners of war by the United States after the surrender of Germany as an inconvenient result of a “ food crisis across Europe , a result of the continent ’s decimation , ” and being a “ far cry from the 6 million innocents who perished at the hands of the Nazis with absolutely no military justification . ”
I would be curious to know how Dershowitz would judge how the families of German soldiers deployed in combat operations should have viewed the Second World War .
What if a mother of a young panzer grenadier fighting on the Russian front was to say , “ The troops are the mission , and we cannot separate our support for either ” ?
Should blind support for the fighting men likewise have blinded the families of German soldiers to the illegitimacy of their cause ?
Certainly Dershowitz would favor the “ good German , ” one who would have sought to deny facilitation of the Holocaust by refusing to support the war which empowered it .
Would he so favor the “ good American , ” one driven by a sense of moral responsibility to speak out against acts perpetrated in Iraq and elsewhere by American fighting forces ostensibly in support of freedom , but in reality an extension of illegitimate policies reeking of global hegemony and American empire ?
Or would he choose to explain away Guantanamo Bay , Abu Ghraib , Bagram , the CIA ’s secret gulag of torture as “ legitimate acts of bellicose reprisals ” for the events of Sept. 11 , 2001 ?
In Dershowitz ’s tortured legal brain the events at Haditha and elsewhere , including the Marine massacre of civilians in Afghanistan , likewise assume legitimacy in this newfound legal defense of “ legitimate bellicose reprisal .
” In the end , Dershowitz ’s opinions are irrelevant .
The disturbing reality , however , is that his mind - set is not limited to the soap box he enjoys as a teacher of jurisprudence at one of America ’s finest institutions of higher learning but rather is increasingly embraced by American service members deployed in harm ’s way .
A recent U.S. Army survey shows that some 40 percent of American soldiers and Marines support the use of torture as a means of gathering intelligence .
Some 66 percent would refuse to turn in a fellow soldier or Marine for abusive actions against civilians , and less than 50 percent believe that noncombatants should be treated with dignity and respect .
Ten percent of those surveyed actually admitted to abusing civilians and their property for no reason whatsoever .
While acknowledging that this mind - set is at complete odds with official policy concerning the conduct of military personnel in a combat zone , the Pentagon did its best to portray the survey results as clear evidence that there was , in fact , “ good leadership ” in place , since the desires of the troops had not manifested themselves in large - scale acts of abuse or torture .
True , but the survey is also clear evidence that when such abuse or torture does occur , it is not the result of a few “ bad apples , ” so to speak , but instead indicative of a trend that could easily spiral out of control on any given day .
The survey results should not come as a surprise to anyone .
The innumerable home movies shot in Iraq and Afghanistan , some immortalized on YouTube , some in documentary film , some simply shared with friends and family , all show the same disturbing trend .
Whether it is a Marine singing the lyrics to the self - written “ Hadji Girl , ” or soldiers speaking disparagingly about “ ragheads ” or “ sand niggers , ” or any other dehumanizing remark imaginable , the reality is our troops are n’t in Iraq to liberate the Iraqi people .
We ’re there to kill them and we do an extraordinarily good job .
The British government recently certified as “ sound ” the methodologies used by the study published in the medical journal The Lancet which estimates the number of deaths ( as of 2006 ) that can be directly attributed to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and its aftermath at 655,000 .
If anything , this number has grown by leaps and bounds since the study was conducted .
One can point to sectarian violence as a major contributor to this total , but as an American I tend to reflect on the American - on - Iraqi violence , such as the barely mentioned deaths of Iraqi children in a recent air - delivered bomb attack against suspected Iraqi insurgents .
I ’m sure Dershowitz and those American service members desensitized to their own acts of depravity can explain the deaths of these innocents as “ legitimate acts of bellicose reprisal . ”
I call it murder , even if these deaths occurred in time of war .
Every mother and father of every soldier , sailor , airman and Marine deployed in Iraq should reflect on this as well .
“ Little Johnny ” may write home about what he says is a “ just war ” that “ needs to be fought , ” but before one embraces the words of someone in harm ’s way in desperate need of self - justification for the things he has seen and done , re-examine the area of operations your loved one is serving in or , worse , has perished in .
Are they “ living among the Iraqi people , ” as some would have you believe ?
Or are they sequestered away in base camps or fire bases , forced to conduct patrols out among a population that for the most part hates them and wants them gone from Iraq ?
Does “ Johnny ” himself call the Iraqis ragheads ?
Does he give a frustrated kick at the Iraqi male he just apprehended , not because of any crime or offense committed , but simply because he was there ?
Does he point his rifle and scream expletives at the mother or wife or daughter who cries out for a loved one ?
Does he break a lamp or table to emphasize his point ?
Or does he do worse , allowing his emotions and frustration to break free as he beats , shoots or rapes those he now hates more than anything else in the world ?
Freedom ?
Get real .
The mission of our military in Iraq is survival , and that is no military mission at all .
The war in Iraq is as immoral a conflict as the United States has ever been involved in .
Past wars were fought in a day and age where information was not readily available on the totality of issues surrounding a given conflict .
One could excuse citizens if they were not equipped with the knowledge and information necessary to empower them to speak out against bad policy .
Not so today .
For someone today to proclaim ignorance as an excuse for inactivity is as morally and intellectually weak an argument as can be imagined .
The truth about those who claim they simply “ did n’t know ” lies in their own lack of commitment to a strong America , one founded on principles and values worth fighting for , and one where every American is committed to the defense of the same .
Ignorance is bad citizenship .
In this day and age , bad citizenship carries ramifications beyond the environs of our local communities .
Given America ’s dominant role in the world , bad American citizenship has a way of manifesting itself globally .
I ’m not calling the parents of those who have fallen in Iraq and who continue to voice their blind adherence to the Bush administration ’s policies in Iraq bad citizens .
I understand their need to come to grips with their loss the best way possible , which is to try and extract some meaning from the sacrifice their family has had to make .
But I draw the line when these families allow their suffering to translate into blanket suffering for others .
As The American Legion magazine quoted one such individual who advocated in favor of the Bush administration : “ Are more servicemen and women returning the way my son did , in a casket , as a result of our words and actions ?
I believe the answer is yes .
The perception of a weak American military , should we lose , will make our enemy stronger than we ever imagined .
Because we do n’t want to be at war any more does n’t mean the war is over . ”
Thus , in a blind effort to find meaning in her son ’s death , this mother is willing to inflict suffering on other American families .
This may sound like a harsh indictment , but she indicts herself .
The same mother concludes the article with the following quote : “ I told President Bush last summer that the biggest insult anyone could hand me would be to pull the troops out before the job is complete .
If we ’re going to quit , at that point I ’ll have to ask , ‘ Why did my son die ? ’ ” The question she should have been asking long before his death was , of course , “ Why might my son die ? ”
That she failed to do so , and now seeks to send others off to their death in a cause not worthy of a single American life , is where she and those of her ilk stop receiving my sympathy and understanding .
The American Legion magazine , in its May 2007 issue , belittles those who speak out against the war .
“ While our forefathers gave us the right and privilege to challenge our leaders , ” one father of a fallen Marine writes , “ the manner and method that some people have chosen to use at this time only emboldens the enemy . ”
Reading between the lines , freedom of speech is treasonous if you question the motives and actions of those who got us involved in the Iraq war .
Alan Dershowitz can only wish that there had been more “ good Germans ” speaking out about the policies of Adolf Hitler before the Holocaust became reality .
I yearn for a time when “ good Americans ” will be able to stop and reverse equally evil policies of global hegemony achieved through pre-emptive war of aggression .
I know all too well that in this case the “ enemy ” will only be emboldened by our silence , since at the end of the day the “ enemy ” is ourselves .
I can see the Harvard professor shaking an accusatory finger at me for the above statement , chiding me for creating any moral equivalency between the war in Iraq and the Holocaust .
You ’re right , Mr. Dershowitz .
There is no moral equivalency .
In America today , we should have known better , since we ostensibly stand for so much more .
That we have collectively failed to halt and repudiate the war in Iraq makes us even worse than the Germans .
We take our young children to science museums , then as they get older we stop .
In spite of threats like global warming and avian flu , most adults have very little understanding of how the world works .
So , 50 years on from CP Snow 's famous ' Two Cultures ' essay , is the old divide between arts and sciences deeper than ever ?
Here we ask a celebrity panel to answer some basic scientific questions
It is an immutable law of nature that acute embarrassment can make a few short seconds last pretty much for ever .
The longest two minutes of my life occurred in the company of James Watson , one half of the famous double act who discovered the double helix .
I was interviewing Watson , then in his late seventies , at his lab in Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island .
At one point , I referred blithely to the ' perfect simplicity ' of his and Francis Crick 's findings about the code of life .
Watson is a mischievous , famously prickly man and that phrase seemed to get under his skin .
He raised an eyebrow .
He sat back .
He thought he would have some fun .
Seeing as it was all so perfectly simple , he suggested , maybe I could briefly run through my understanding of DNA base pairing , say , or chromosome mapping .
What followed - a tangled , stuttering stream of consciousness reflecting distant O - level biology and recent half - understanding of Watson 's brilliant books , punctuated with words like ' replication ' and ' mutation ' and meaning nothing much - gave new resonance to the notion of floundering .
Watson , resisting the temptation to laugh , correct or comment , simply moved on , having categorically established our respective levels of evolution .
I can still cringe now at the brief pause that concluded my ill - judged aside on the significance of the genome .
Given that science informs so much of our culture , and so many of us have such patchy knowledge , it is surprising that such embarrassments are not routine .
It 's half a century since CP Snow put forward the idea of the ' Two Cultures ' , the intractable divide between the sciences and the humanities , first in an article in the New Statesman , then in a lecture series at Cambridge and finally in a book .
Back then , Snow , who was both a novelist and a physicist , used to employ a test at dinner parties to demonstrate his argument .
' A good many times , ' he suggested , ' I have been present at gatherings of people who , by the standards of the traditional culture , are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists .
Once or twice , I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics .
The response was cold ; it was also negative .
Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of : have you ever read a work of Shakespeare's ? '
Fifty years on , and exponential scientific advance later , it seems unlikely that the response of dinner guests would be much different .
I was reminded of Snow 's test when reading the new book by Natalie Angier , science editor of the New York Times .
Angier 's book is called The Canon , and subtitled ' A Whirligig Tour of the Beautiful Basics of Science ' .
It is not a long book and it contains , as the title suggests , a breathless Baedeker of the fundamental scientific knowledge Angier believes is the minimum requirement of an educated person .
In many places , I found myself cringeing all over again .
I 've read a fair amount of popular science , tried to follow the technical arguments that underpin debates about global warming , say , or bird flu , listened religiously to Melvyn Bragg 's In Our Time , but still I discovered large black holes in my elementary understanding of how our world works .
Angier divides her book into basic disciplines - biology , chemistry , geology , physics and so on - and each chapter offers an animated essay on the current established thinking .
The result is the kind of science book you wish someone had placed in front of you at school - full of aphorisms that help everything fall into place .
For geology : ' This is what our world is about : there is heat inside and it wants to get out . '
For physics : ' Almost everything we 've come to understand about the universe we have learned by studying light . '
Along the way there are all sorts of facts that stick : ' You would have to fly on a commercial aircraft every day for 18,000 years before your chances of being in a crash exceeded 50 per cent ' , for example ; or , if you imagined the history of our planet as a single 75 - year human life span :
' The first ape did not arrive until May or June of the final year ... and Neil Armstrong muddied up the Moon at 20 seconds to midnight . '
Angier also gives as clear an insight as I have read of CP Snow 's culture - dividing Second Law of Thermodynamics , the law of entropy , the one that states that in any system inefficiency is inevitable and eventually overwhelming .
' Entropy , ' Angier writes , 'is like a taxi passing you on a rainy night with its NOT IN SERVICE lights ablaze , or a chair in a museum with a rope draped from arm to arm , or a teenager . '
Entropy , unusable energy , leads to the law that states that everything in time must wear out , become chaotic , die .
' The darkest readings of the Second Law suggest that even the universe has a morphine drip in its vein , ' Angier suggests , 'a slow smothering of all spangle , all spiral , all possibility . '
No wonder CP
Snow thought we should know about it .
For all of its infectious analogies and charged curiosity , the most telling fact about Angier 's book is that it seems to have been written out of sheer desperation .
It is something of a cry from the wilderness ; impassioned , overwrought in places .
It is written in the voice of someone who has spent her whole award - winning career evangelising about this amazing stuff and is facing up to the fact that most people have not even begun to ' get ' any of it .
Angier 's tipping point , the reason she came to write the book , was a decision made by her sister .
When the second of her two children turned 13 the sister decided that it was time to let their membership lapse in two familiar family haunts : the science museum and the zoo .
They were , the implication went , ready to put away childish things , ready to go to the theatre and the art gallery , places where there was none of this ' mad pinball pinging from one hands - on science exhibit to the next , pounding on knobs to make artificial earthquakes ' .
They had grown out of science .
Angier believes this idea - that science is something for kids - still pervades much of our thinking , and characterises the presentation of science in culture .
Part of it is the notion that argues science is just a bunch of facts with no overarching coherence .
Just as bad are the media , which insist on ghettoising science and serving it up as cliches : scientists as boffins , with permanent bad - hair days ; science as controversy , always set up for polarised clashes with religion .
' Science is rather a state of mind , ' Angier argues and , as such , it should inform everything .
' It is a way of viewing the world , of facing reality square on but taking nothing for granted . '
It would be hard to argue that this state of mind was advancing across the globe .
We no longer make and mend , so we no longer know how anything works .
One of Angier 's interviewees , Andrew Knoll , a professor of natural history at Harvard 's earth and planetary sciences department , suggests that ' the average American adult today knows less about biology than the average 10 - year - old living in the Amazon , or the average American of 200 years ago ' .
I spoke to Angier to find out why she thought that this might be the case .
To some extent , she suggested , that was a political question .
' Here in the US we have had the last seven years of this administration which has made everything about the two - cultures divide seem worse . '
But it is not just that .
' Newspapers are getting rid of all their science pages ; they are jettisoning all their science staff .
The feeling is people do n't want to read it .'
The implications of this , and the resultant general scientific illiteracy , she believes , are possibly catastrophic .
Forty - two per cent of Americans in a recent survey said they believed that humans had been on Earth since the beginning of time .
' A geophysicist friend suggests we are at a critical crossroads just like the start of the Renaissance , ' Angier says , ' where you could n't just leave reading and writing to the kings and priests anymore .
Ordinary people have to keep up .
In the world we live in , the new economy , you have to become scientifically literate or you will fall quickly from view . '
It is , apparently , not just America that does not want to hear this news .
Foreign rights to Angier 's book have been snapped up in auctions by publishers across Asia and Eastern Europe , ' countries that see themselves as the economic future ' , but she has not , for example , sold her book in the UK , a place , we might remember , where 20 per cent of people still believe that the Sun revolves around Earth .
' I tend to see that as a tiny little sign that some of these more aggressive competitive nations are more aware of what the future looks like , ' Angier suggests .
She believes this persistent apathy in matters of science in America and Britain comes in part from a lack of interest in what the future might hold .
' In the 1960s , we had the space race , we had these world fairs and the whole idea of the future was very exciting .
Science was something they wanted to be involved in . '
You could hope that the apocalyptic panic that attends climate change , the front pages of floodwaters rising , might have a similar effect .
' Whatever you think of him , Al Gore has been great for science , ' she says .
Angier 's initiation into the ' beautiful basics ' was brought about by a professor at the University of Michigan , who taught a ' physics of music ' class .
The walls between the two cultures came tumbling down every week .
' There were kids from the engineering and physics departments and then there were kids from the music departments .
I was just in there on my own .
But the way he brought us together was an extraordinary thing , ' she recalls .
' Both groups were kind of ecstatic ; this guy would get standing ovations at the end of every lecture .
So I guess I saw that bridging that gap might be something to strive for in life in terms of engaging people . '
This kind of engagement , a sense of a bigger picture in science , its poetry and mystery , is no doubt all too rare .
In a 2005 survey of British teenagers at school conducted by the exam board OCR , more than half said they thought science classes were ' boring ' , ' confusing ' and ' difficult ' .
Just 7 per cent believed that scientists were ' cool ' and when asked to pick out a famous scientist from a list including Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein , a fair few chose Christopher Columbus .
Some of this Angier believes has to do with the way science is taught - ' I go through these science books for kids and they are so dull compared to the novels that children read ...
I think that you have to make it an epic journey , a narrative with heroes and villains , molecules engaging in this struggle for life . '
A lot of it , however , is cultural , she believes .
Numbers of students still studying science at 18 are falling in Britain and America , perhaps because we are becoming generally less motivated to address difficulty .
As a culture , we allow ourselves too many excuses .
' Western parents are quite comfortable saying their children have a predilection for art or for writing or whatever , and allow them just to pursue that .
In the Asian education system , if you are not good at something , it 's because you are lazy and you just have to work harder at it .
Just because things are hard does not mean they are not worth doing .'
That idea of difficulty , I suggest , cannot really be helped in the States in particular , when all of the presidential candidates of one party stand up in televised debate and say they believe in ' intelligent design ' and suggest that the world could well have been created by a bearded God a few thousand years ago .
Angier laughs , somewhat bleakly .
' I see all that as a macho kind of posturing .
It 's like , I can believe the impossible : look , I can lift a tree !
It is a Republican initiation ritual , like having a hook pulled through your cheek and not flinching . '
But no , she concedes , it does n't help much .
Some people would suggest that Natalie Angier 's enlightenment utopia , in which everyone might one day agree on the fundamentals of the universe , the beautiful basics , is a false ideal ; the mass has always believed in mumbo- jumbo .
One of these people is John Brockman .
Brockman has probably done more than anyone to break down CP Snow 's cultural divide .
He is the PT Barnum of popular science , a great huckster of ideas .
In the Sixties , he hung out with John Cage and Andy Warhol , got an MBA and then made his first fortune selling psychedelia to corporations , turning on marketing executives with ' multikinetic happenings ' and showing them how their profits could levitate .
These days , he acts as literary agent for many of the world 's greatest minds , including Richard Dawkins , Daniel Dennett and Steven Pinker , and achieves for some of them the kind of publishing advances that it takes great mathematicians to compute .
It is Brockman who invented the publishing market for quarks and quantum theory and black holes in the 1990s , and it is he who is behind the current boom in atheism .
The universe may be infinite , but Brockman takes 15 per cent of it .
He also runs a kind of global online Royal Society called Edge .
Edge promotes what he calls the Third Culture , a marriage of physics and philosophy , astronomy and art .
The name itself derives from a phrase of CP Snow 's outlining his personal hope for the future .
Brockman , when launching his Third Culture in 1991 , had significant ambition for the project , much of which has been realised .
' The Third Culture consists of those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who , through their work and expository writing , are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives , redefining who and what we are , ' he suggested , grandly .
Though Brockman borrowed Snow 's phrase , he did not employ it in the same way :
Snow had hoped for a kind of detente between the rival mindsets ; Brockman perceived a third way .
' Literary intellectuals are not communicating with scientists , ' he suggested .
' Scientists are communicating directly with the general public .
Traditional intellectual media played a vertical game ; journalists wrote up and professors wrote down .
Today , Third Culture thinkers tend to avoid the middleman and endeavour to express their deepest thoughts in a manner accessible to the intelligent reading public . '
Brockman 's cross- fertilising club , the most rarefied of chatrooms , has its premises on his website www.edge.org.
Eavesdropping is fun .
Ian McEwan , one of the few novelists who has contributed to Edge 's ongoing debates , suggests that the project is not so far removed from the ' old Enlightenment dream of a unified body of knowledge , when biologists and economists draw on each other 's concepts and molecular biologists stray into the poorly defended territory of chemists and physicists ' .
Brockman is at the hub of this conversation .
When I phone him , he is waiting for a call from maverick geneticist Craig Venter about an invention that will ' put new operating mechanisms into genes ' and radically change our idea of life ; earlier , he has been speaking to George Smoot , the Nobel - winning astrophysicist who first identified the background radiation of the Big Bang and thereby invented cosmology .
From where he is sitting , the Two Cultures no longer applies , the Third Culture has long - since prevailed .
' Basically , in terms of whatever war has been going on , I think it has finished , ' he says .
' I do n't characterise it by saying we 've won .
I think everybody has won .
We are living in a profound science culture and the big events that are affecting people 's lives are scientific ones . '
What about Natalie Angier 's anxiety that these ideas have not trickled down , that , if anything , scientific thought seems to be on the retreat ?
' Since when have the masses of people had any ideas anyway ? '
Brockman asks .
' It is always a certain percentage of people who do the thinking for everybody else .
What is changing , ' he argues , contrary to Angier 's perception , 'is that the media people , who used to have no thoughts of science , now sit up .
Science makes the news .'
I wonder why there are still so few literary contributors to Edge , which has remained a predominantly scientific and philosophical forum .
Is there not some evidence there that the divide persists ?
Brockman explains how Edge evolved out of a group called the Reality Club that held actual meetings with scientists , artists , architects , musicians .
Ten of the leading novelists in America were invited to participate .
Not one accepted .
' We are talking about Vonnegut , Updike , Mailer , John Irving , ' Brockman says .
' Ian McEwan is one of the first writers to jump feet - first into the world of science and embraced it wholeheartedly .
But we still have never had a novelist come to one of these events .
Neither have we had a major business person .
Maybe getting up in front of a group of Nobel - winning scientists to talk might be intimidating for these people .
Maybe they are too busy .'
Brockman 's optimism is infectious , and , at his elite level , the battle may have been won , but further down the food chain , the forces of reason are still compromised by the culture .
When I had recovered a little of my composure with James Watson , back in Cold Spring Harbor , I asked him how he thought the climate of scientific research had changed since he made his fateful discovery of the structure of life in 1953 .
As ever , he came at the question from an unusual angle .
He doubted , he said , that in today 's world , he and Francis Crick would ever have had their Eureka moment .
' I recently went to my staircase at Clare College , Cambridge and there were women there !' he said , with an enormous measure of retrospective sexual frustration .
' There have been a lot of convincing studies recently about the loss of productivity in the Western male .
It may be that entertainment culture now is so engaging that it keeps people satisfied .
We did n't have that .
Science was much more fun than listening to the radio .
When you are 16 or 17 and in that inherently semi-lonely period when you are deciding whether to be an intellectual , many now do n't bother . '
Watson raised an eyebrow , fixed me again with a look .
' What you have instead are characters out of Nick Hornby 's very funny books , who channel their intellect in pop culture .
The hopeless male .'
As James Watson knows perhaps more clearly than anyone alive , biology works in mysterious ways .

Lib Dems say the new proposals will be " tax neutral "
Campbell interview
" Green " taxes on cars and flights and the ending of £ 13.5 bn of tax breaks for high earners would fund the cuts .
Council tax would be replaced by a local income tax and inheritance tax and stamp duty thresholds raised .
Leader Sir Menzies Campbell said : " Tax cuts for the majority will be paid for by the wealthy minority . "
The unacceptable reality is that in Britain today the poorest pay a higher proportion of their income in tax than the super - rich
Sir Menzies Campbell
Analysis : A winning package ?
The Lib Dem plans came in a document called Reducing the Burden : Policies for tax reform .
The plan to reduce the basic rate of income tax to 16 p in the pound would leave it at its lowest rate since 1916 , the party says .
The party said its proposals were aimed at making things easier for low and middle - income earners " whilst making the rich and people with environmentally damaging lifestyles pay a fairer share " .
The plan to replace the council tax would see the bulk of local taxation being paid by those in work , with most pensioners seeing their tax burden cut .
Other proposals include :
Reaffirming the party 's commitment to replacing the council tax with a " local income tax "
Removing " tax loopholes exploited by the super - rich "
Reducing stamp duty paid on properties worth less than £ 500,000
Raising the starting threshold for inheritance tax to £ 500,000
Return business rates to local control
Simplify the tax code to remove more than 500 pages of regulations
Bringing money made on UK property by people who are not resident in the UK , within capital gains tax
Sir Menzies said : " Our new proposals will put fairness at the heart of the tax system .
" By reforming stamp duty and inheritance tax we will ensure that people who were not originally intended to pay these taxes no longer do so .
" The unacceptable reality is that in Britain today the poorest pay a higher proportion of their income in tax than the super - rich . "
' Tax neutral '
The Liberal Democrats says the plans are " tax neutral " - in that they will not raise more tax , but will raise it in different ways - and have been looked at by the Institute of Fiscal Studies .
They have already pledged to replace airport passenger duty with a tax based on a plane 's emissions , a higher road tax for high polluting cars , linking fuel duty to inflation and reforming the climate change levy .
When you look at the small - print of the Lib Dem proposals , you find that millions of families will be hit by their proposals for a new local income tax
Philip Hammond
Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury
And they say they want to close down opportunities for some of the wealthiest people to avoid UK tax , because they are not considered " resident " .
But the Conservatives said the Lib Dems ' plan " falls apart on close inspection " .
Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Philip Hammond said : " They say they are helping families , but when you look at the small - print of the Lib Dem proposals , you find that millions of families will be hit by their proposals for a new local income tax . "
The Conservatives have said they will not promise " up - front , unfunded tax reductions at the next election " and will only reduce taxes later as the result of continuing economic growth .
But they do support green taxes and say they want to shift the tax burden from income and investment to pollution .
The Lib Dems dropped their flagship 50 % top tax rate policy after the 2005 general election in favour of taxes on pollution .
Your comments
Whether you agree with the proposed Lib Dem tax cuts or not , at least they 're bringing ideas to the table .
I 've not heard a decent idea from the Tories yet ¿
Alex Pepper , Cardiff , Wales
As always the Lib Dems can come up with any crack - pot idea as they know as well as the rest of us that they will never have to chance to implement it .
Adrian Cotton , Bedford , UK
The proposed tax changes seem good at first view , as does the proposal to give married couples a benfit amounting to £ 20 per week .
My only reservation to all these proposals is they all seem a ploy to get the vote but there is no mention of where other taxes may effect us - ie - tax on fuel or elsewhere which will mean whatever they give us in these proposals will be taken out somewhere else .
Simon Latham , Walsall UK
Why do n't the Liberal / Dems concentrate their energies trying to be constructive toward the encumbent government instead of coming away with policies whilst eye - catching are meaningless because they have no realistic chance of being elected and therefore no prospect of implementing these proposals .
John Blakey , Washington , UK
I voted Lib Dems in the last election but was n't going to this time around .
However I 've now changed my mind and will be voting for them again , I 'm sick to death of Labour stealth taxing everything .
I pay tax on tax on tax .
Right now I have to pay tax on a work fuel card or get 12 p per mile which does n't cover my costs so either way I end up paying to work !!
Simmi , Nottingham
So the plan is to tax those that are financially secure enough to move countries ?
I 'm seeing a flaw .
Mark , London
Well done Lib Dems , the only party willing to be honest with the British people .
These proposals will encourage environmentally friendly wealth generation .
Fergus Dodd , London , England
Why is it that politicians , even ones as old as Menzies Campbell , cannot resist promoting policies which appeal to the worst in us all ?
Pressing the envy button so often is really pathetic .
They are also too ready to rattle on about green taxes and other ' acceptable ' ways of accumulating our wealth into government coffers .
The Lib Dems need to get off our backs and find ways of NOT collecting taxes .
Wickedlymale , Stockport
It is a very good news for poor people like me and fair for every citizen in the country .
Keep up the good job you are doing Sir Menzies !
A Ibrahim , Northampton
There are details about what low - end taxes will be modified , but there are no specific details of exactly which taxes and allowances that high earners pay will be changed , so how can anyone make a decision as to whether this is a good or ' fair ' package or not ?
Paul Hill , Halesowen , UK
I would be more likely to vote Lib Dem due to their proposed changes in the tax system .
I am a single parent earning £ 19,000 and I think that I am taxed far too much compared to the high earners .

Controversy involving hard - line Muslims and whether their wives can be examined by male gynecologists :
France ’s leading gynaecologists have challenged hard - line Muslims to bow to France ’s secular , “ modern ” rules of society , and to stop insisting that their wives are examined by female doctors .
The heads of the French National College of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians issued a public declaration , rejecting any moves to undermine the principle that public hospitals are part of a secular state , in which patients must accept being examined by a doctor of the opposite sex .
The move came after a consultant in Paris was punched by a Muslim who was concerned that a male doctor wanted to examine his wife after complications in childbirth .
When the Democrats took the legislative branch back , I did a little dance .
For a good two weeks .
When the first 100 hours yielded a number of great bills passed , I danced again .
Over time , though , the good news stopped .
AlterNet nailed it , writing on how the Dems blew it in only eight months .
The voters put the Democrats in to end the war , and it ’s escalating .
The Democrats voted the money for the surge and the money for the next $ 459.6 billion military budget .
Their latest achievement was to provide enough votes in support of Bush to legalize warrantless wiretapping for “ foreign suspects whose communications pass through the United States . ”
Enough Democrats joined Republicans to make this a 227- 183 victory for Bush .
The Democrats control the House .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi could have stopped the bill in its tracks if she ’d wanted to .
But she did n’t .
The Democrats ’ game is to go along with the White House agenda while stirring up dust storms to blind the base to their failure to bring the troops home or restore constitutional government .
That ’s been one of my problems with the attorney scandal .
It seems to be the only part of the current White House horror show that the Democrats will actually pursue .
When it came time to stop Bush from expanding his warrantless surveillance program , they folded .
They could have put their collective left foot down and put the pressure on Bush by refusing to fund the war unless he agreed to take steps to end it , but they did n’t .
The attorney scandal is , honestly , symbolic more than anything and the fact that it ’s being doggedly pursued over all else tells me that the Democrats are more interested in making a big show out of fighting the largely meaningless fight because they do n’t have the stones to fight the important issues .
At the end of the day , does anyone give a good damn about whether or not Alberto Gonzales gets impeached when the president now has further reaching privacy - intrusion powers , and the war is getting funded just as openly as it was a year ago ?
It ’s nice to see that someone is getting smacked around , but it ’s not going to end the war or give us our civil liberties back .
What really baffles me is that they learned absolutely no lesson from , well , anything over the past few years .
Congress ’s approval rating went down the shitter because of one simple principle : the neoconservatives have really , really bad ideas .
Invading Iraq , repeated tax cuts for the wealthy , stem cell research , getting involved with Terri Schiavo , gay marriage amendments , expansion of presidential authority , each of these are exemplars of why the American people stopped trusting Congress .
Not coincidentally , each of these are strictly neocon ideals .
Congress was more than happy to pander to their rightmost base and go right along with them .
Then , when each of them later proved to be absolutely terrible ideas , the public started to realize that maybe the GOP did n’t have their best interests at heart .
It took a while , but finally the left got motivated and bingo bango the Democrats pick up a few dozen seats in Congress .
Yet despite seeing what happened to the party before and the legislative branch ’s approval thanks to rubber - stamping the President and his neocon base ’s desires , the Democrats somehow determined that the best course of action was to not do a damn thing differently .
So now the right is pissed off at Congress just for being blue , and the left is pissed off at Congress for not doing anything that they were elected to .
One of the oddest anomalies , and perhaps the only even mildly encouraging facet of all this , is that the reason the GOP - led Congress got reamed was that they went right along with the far right ’s wishes , only to expose the fact that the far right ’s wishes are disastrous .
Meanwhile , the Democratic Congress is getting raked over the coals because they ’re basically ignoring the liberal base .
Once again , proof that the country is far more liberal than the media seems to think .
Polls bear us out , and as AlterNet noted it has little to do with any Democratic leadership .
It ’s the other way around .
The people saw what happens when neoconservative ideology runs rampant in our government and elected people they hoped would fix things .
That those people basically turned their backs on the populace that voted them in is simultaneously bad for the country and bad for Democracy .
The resigned attitude toward that which probably wo n’t succeed is probably the most problematic part .
Until Reid forced an all - nighter , the Senate folded any time the Republicans wanted a veto , and both houses fall apart when it comes time to do anything that Bush wo n’t endorse .
Then at the same time they avoid pushing for legislation that will get vetoed , they go right along with legislation that Bush wants in order to avoid being seen as “ obstructionists ” .
Remember how 2004 had a huge turnout because people cared about the outcome ?
The prospect of getting Bush out of office and Kerry in so he could reign the war in and put things back in the right direction .
When that did n’t happen , 2006 had a huge voter turnout compared to 2002 .
The people were practically frothing at the mouth to get the Republicans out of power to put a stop to the catastrophic leadership that seemed hell - bent on leading us to military and economic ruin .
Now that we ’ve finally put our party into power and they are n’t doing anything , the Democrats have potentially destroyed their prospects for 2008 .
Realize that these two years are going to be illustrative of what we could expect from a Democratic presidency , and without anything substantial to point to it ’s going to be very difficult for any of the current crop of candidates to convince voters that they deserve even more power .
I love the Democratic candidates , I think we ’ve definitely got a better selection that the GOP , but I ’m not going to be particularly motivated if , come 2008 , we ’re not in any better position than we were in 2006 when we handed them the legislative branch .
The right is going to be mad that their candidates are beholden to the far right and the last 8 years proved that ’s a horrendous ideology , and the left is going to be mad that their candidates do n’t have the backbone to do anything different .
As it stands , one of the big reasons the Democrats have a good chance in 2008 is the Republicans ’ absolutely terrible pool of candidates .
The scruple - less Giuliani , the batshit crazy McCain , the flip - floppy Romney , the general non-entity of Fred Thompson .
Lord help the left if a really good Republican candidate shows up and Congress keeps shirking their duties like they are .
The only thing that the Democrats can hide behind is that Bush will veto whatever it is they want to do and that with their party in the White House then they ’ll really be able to get to business .
All that tells us is that they ’re afraid to make any stands on principle and just go along with the political tides .
While it ’s always a good idea to be realistic and not to beat your head against a wall with impossible legislation , when you only stand behind what is guaranteed to succeed you do n’t really represent anything , not your own principles and certainly not the people who elected you .
Besides , a Democratic Congress that actually stood by their beliefs as well as their voters ’ wishes only to be blocked with vetoes would seal Bush ’s legacy as a bullheaded obstructionist while proving that they themselves have the fortitude to stand strong for the right thing .
Come the 2008 debates , “ I co-sponsored a bill to legalize gay marriage ” or “ I voted to force the president to choose between funding the troops or continuing without an exit strategy ” will sound a hell of a lot better than “ I wanted to support that bill , but I did n’t think it would pass . ”
There ’s an old line of joking that Democrats are blessed with the ability to be handed opportunity and them proceed to shoot themselves in the foot with it .
Let ’s hope that this changes , and soon .
Gee , what a surprise .
Mr. Religious Right lied during the debate in an effort to seem all pro-marriage -y .
You ’ll recall that Romney criticized this new wildly popular supposed French marriage contract where you only get married for 7 years .
Well , I did a little searching and found out ( via another blog ) what Romney was talking about :
France ’s new civil unions law , the PACS as they call it .
A law that was passed in an effort to give gay people kind - of - sort - of some of the rights of marriage without actually giving them marriage ( and at the same time , it gave straight couples the same right since you could n’t just give the right to gays and not straights ) .
Romney is against gay marriage .
He ’s against gay civil unions .
He ’s against gay everything .
Putting aside the fact that up until two years ago Romney was pretty much for gay everything , it ’s rather incredible of Romney to complain that the French are n’t giving gays full marriage when he wo n’t give gays full marriage .
And his central criticism about the law only being for a seven year contract , well nobody can find that anywhere – it ’s just not true .
And yes , the law does provide a watered down version of marriage for straight couples , but that ’s only because people like Romney opposed giving gays full marriage – he can’t have it both ways .
So , Mitt Romney is now upset that France is n’t letting gays have real marriage ?
Or does Romney , who does n’t come off as the brightest bulb in the bunch , even have any idea what he ’s talking about ?
The man was handed some France - bashing talking points and he ran with it like the good slick - haired , well - monied , flip - flopping dimwit he really is .

The Warhawk itself is an advanced jet fighter .
It can hover , has afterburners , and is capable of carrying an array of offensive and defensive weaponry , mostly for air to air combat , but some designed for air to ground attacks .
When not in the Warhawk you get to run around in third person view and utilize jeeps , tanks , fixed SAM and Flak Cannons , as well as many anti-personnel and anti-vehicle weaponry to annihilate your opponents .
The game ships with 5 different maps which scale depending on how many max players the server is set to allow .
There are four game modes , Death Match ( Free for All ) , Team Death Match ( Team based frag fest ) , Capture the Flag , and Zones .
The Death Match scenarios are intense and fast paced with as many as 32 vs 32 jets flying through the skies .
In “ capture the flag ” your team must take strategic points to either defend your flag / base or capture the enemies flag .
In “ zone ” , your team captures positions and gains points over time while your team continues to hold those positions .
More Info and Video after the jump
One of the most enjoyable features of the game is the variety .
As a player you can either fight in a “ dogfight ” ( air to air type death match ) or you can engage in the fight by land to air or air to land .
The games can be very fast paced and really has the capability to utilize good team mechanics if the players choose to work together .
Another great aspect of the game is the accumulation of stats along with a ranking system .
However , for me the ranks and stats are not that awesome in and of themselves .
The cool factor comes with the badges , ribbons , and medals you gain which , along with helping you rank up , gives you customization options for your character and your Warhawk .
These customizations are new head gear or clothing options for your warrior as well as new paint schemes for your planes .
This is cool because it adds variety , and gives the players something tangible and unique for playing the game , allowing them to be set slightly apart from the pack .
Aside from the standard fair , the game offers excellent game play with fast paced action .
I personally enjoy the team based games where the fight is for objectives and not just fighting , though I do get some jollies out of all the destruction in the pure death match games .
Upon playing Warhawk for the first hour I was a bit frustrated because I was not as “ good ” as I hoped .
After spending more time with the game and playing the capture the flag scenario I was able to hone my skills and became enthralled .
I thought to myself , if there is one game out right now that makes me happy I own a PS3 , it ’s Warhawk .
I even experimented with motion sensor flight using the six axis controller .
Thankfully this is not a required control option for flight , but rather an interesting and challenging optional controller .
Oh yeah , visually the game is awesome and takes advantage of many of the advanced features of the PS3 .
There are a few bugs that Incognito is working on fixing right now , such as the server claiming a game if full when it is not and the stats / ranks displaying incorrectly .
Having said that , the game play itself is enough to keep you excited until all the bugs are fixed .
All in all I think that Warhawk is at least worth the 40 bucks to download , but a 20 dollar bluetooth headset is not too bad if you decide to go with the Blueray Disc version .
This game is fun and reminds me of the great times I had playing Day of Defeat years ago .
It ’s not perfect , but it is incredibly fun .
Now that Halo 3 is out , many people are beginning the inevitable “ Warhawk vs Halo , which is better ” threads .
Halo is different , plus it is exclusive to the Xbox , while Warhawk is exclusive to the PS3 .
I enjoy Halo for its game play and because it is Halo .
I enjoy Warhawk for its game play .
The two games are in similar genre , but have distinctly different game play .
Another factor , the PS3 offers free online play while the xbox charges a nominal fee for xbox live .
Either way you are definitely going to have fun , I ’m glad I have both !

17 Cheap Ways To Keep Cool And Survive A Heat Wave
So you think it ’s hot ?
It turns out , there are some things within our control that we can do .
Though you may be tempted to cool your surroundings , it may actually be cheaper to try to cool yourself first .
In other words , concentrate primarily on cooling your body instead of bringing down the temperature in your environment .
There are quite a good number of ways to feel cooler and actually enjoy the warmer days , and no , you should n’t have to build a $ 40,000 swimming pool on your premises at all .
Beat the heat with these tips !
Many Ways To Keep Cool And Survive The Heat
# 1 Visit the beach , lake or river .
If you live near a water hole or the open sea , then you ’re lucky — just drive there and jump in .
For those inland , this is n’t an option , but there are many other things you can try …
# 2 Visit water amusement parks .
For those inland , you may have a local water amusement park ( or “ waterpark ” ) somewhere close by .
If you do n’t have a natural water hole , then a man -made water hole also works !
However , this may not be the best advice since everyone else may have the same idea and you may find the local park to be a horrible , hot , crowded , dense convergence of humanity .
# 3 Find a community pool ( or someone else ’s pool ) .
If you build your own pool , it ’ll fetch you $ 40,000 for installation and $ 500 a month or thereabouts in maintenance costs .
So find someone else who already took care of those costs , pay them a visit and go jump in their pool .
Ideally , you ’d want a friend or family member to have a pool that can be exclusively loaned to you .
# 4 Buy an inflatable swimming pool .
These are n’t too expensive .
We have one that we got for $ 25 or so .
It was great and lasted many summers .
It recently fell victim to normal wear and tear so we ’ll need to replace it .
But for its size and the hours of fun it provides , it ’s so worth the cost .
We love this type of pool .
On the same note , we enjoy playing a lot of water games in our backyard .
Even just using our humble hose pipe helps .
# 5 Install air conditioning .
No need for central air conditioning , which actually costs at least $ 5,000 to install .
You can pick up one of those mobile A/C units from a hardware store .
# 6 Circulate the air with fans .
Use hand - held fans or electric fans , which are available even in more affordable styles .
See if keeping the windows open helps .
Although at least once a year , we do get heat waves in the Bay Area that feel worse when the windows are open with absolutely no air circulation from a breeze whatsoever .
If it gets unbearable around here on occasion at 105 degrees , I can just imagine what it ’s like elsewhere like Phoenix or Chicago in the dead of summer .
# 7 Make sure your house is well insulated .
Especially in your attic !
If your house is new , you probably do n’t need to worry about this matter .
But for older houses , you may want to think about investing in better insulation so you can save on utility bills along with improved temperature levels in your home .
# 8 Install a whole house fan ( in the attic or basement ) .
Whole house fans come in the guise of attic or basement fans .
Add attic fans or whirlybirds to your roof .
These fans can cost you several hundred dollars to install , but this should keep the overall temperature of your home at lower levels .
I see a lot of these whirlybird things on homes with wooden shingled roofs around my neighborhood so it ’s a common way for people to battle the heat .
Apparently , you can do something similar to your basement but I ’m not sure I ’d try installing it myself .
# 9 Change your air filters .
Maintain your HVAC unit by changing the filters on a regular basis so that they continue to work efficiently .
# 10 Use a programmable thermostat .
You can save significant money on utility bills ( up to 33 % ! ) using a configurable thermostat .
Depending on a schedule , your house can be cooled or warmed accordingly .
# 11 Plant more trees and get some shade .
I ’ve discussed the wonders of trees in the past .
One of the great benefits of trees in your property and your community is how the shade cools down the entire neighborhood .
I used to live in a newer suburb that barely had any landscaping and boy , was it dreadfully hot there during the summers .
Now that I live in an older neighborhood with mature trees — and not to mention , a country setting — we ’re naturally well insulated all year round .
# 12 Visit cooler spots .
Stay indoors and if need be , visit air - conditioned free public areas like the mall , movie theaters and so forth ( hopefully you do n’t end up spending money there ) .
As a younger person , this was how I found myself escaping heat waves .
Also , if you ’re in a structure that has more than one story , it ’s best to hang out at the lower levels since heat rises .
Downside : it could be pretty crowded at those public places .
# 13 Slow down .
Moving burns up calories and energy , making you feel hot .
If you rest and take it easy , you ’ll probably feel better even while the environment is baking like a sauna .
# 14 Drink a lot !
Hydration is extremely important when you ’re sweating buckets so ice water and cool drinks are a good way to go .
If you can , avoid those drinks that can dehydrate you such as anything with caffeine or alcohol .
# 15 Wear the right clothes .
What ’s the best type of clothing to wear when it ’s unspeakably hot ?
You ’re wrong if you thought “ nothing ” !
For the safest results , it ’s best to keep the sun ’s rays away from the skin and therefore , loose , flowing cotton or linen clothing should be good .
White and pastels are colors you should wear on such days since they reflect heat rather than absorb heat like darker colors do .
# 16 Avoid humidity .
If you can help it , keep the humidity levels down as humidity contributes to your discomfort .
You may consider purchasing a de-humidifier unit , but it ’s not necessary .
Instead , you can try the following : keep your bathroom door closed after taking a shower or bath , keep your baths or showers short and cool , avoid boiling or steaming meals and skip doing the laundry till after the heat wave !
# 17 Stick your feet out of your blankets .
This one is a contribution from my spouse .
He swears by this method of cooling down while you sleep , so let the heat escape from your feet .
Other ways to sleep comfortably on a hot night : forget the jammies , sleep in your birthday suit !
Fill a hot water bottle with cold water and keep it close , dampen your hair and sleep on your side .
Some more ideas here .
How Else Are You Keeping Cool ?
It ’s my favorite time of year but in some parts of the country , it ’s sweltering .
Some heat waves have arrived in some cities and it ’s not been pleasant .
You may be desperate enough to try something like this but resist the urge .
Let me make it clear :
Hanging off a window to install an air - conditioner in your apartment several stories above ground is highly discouraged .
Remember that there are many other ways to beat the heat on the cheap !

So here we are : at the end of the “ Harry Potter ” decade .
The books have been printed and are under lock and key .
( Presumably . ) J. K. Rowling has made her choices .
Harry is either going to live or die .
Severus Snape is either evil or good — or maybe a little bit of both .
Ginny will stick with Harry , and Ron will hook up with Hermione .
Or not .
Eager readers still have to wait a fortnight or so for answers to these questions .
Which is why the Op - Ed page asked four writers and one artist to fill the void and draft “ Harry Potter ” endings of their own .

Fences : Undetermined .
Early on Sunday morning , May 21 , 2006 , state lawmakers gave final approval to a financing plan for an open - air stadium for the Minnesota Twins .
The ballpark was projected to cost $ 522 million and be ready in time for the 2010 season .
On February 12 , 2008 , the Twins announced they would fund an additional $ 22.4 million to offset rising infrastructure expenses , bringing the total cost of the project to $ 544.4 million .
Under the terms of a plan unveiled at a Metrodome press conference April 25 , 2005 , the Twins and Hennepin County would have built a $ 360 million , 40,000 - seat open - air stadium .
The site was near the confluence of I -394 , the end of the Hiawatha Light Rail line and the proposed Northstar commuter rail in downtown Minneapolis .
The total cost of the ballpark project was projected to be $ 478 million , including bonding costs , site preparation and surrounding infrastructure , such as road and pedestrian improvements .
The proposed ballpark would n't include a roof , but the Twins still favored one .
The team encouraged the state to help cover that cost , projected to be at least $ 100 million .
Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad had promised to contribute $ 125 million to the project .
*
In January 2004 , the Minnesota Twins unveiled plans for a proposed retractable roof ballpark which would help ensure the long - term viability and competitiveness of the franchise while providing fans throughout the Upper Midwest with the nation 's premier baseball venue .
This project was estimated to cost $ 535 million .
While the plan which was actually passed in 2006 does not include a roof , most of the design elements from the 2004 plan survived .
The conceptual Twins ballpark design was a product of HOK Sport + Venue +
Event , the same group that designed Saint Paul 's Xcel Energy Center , Baltimore 's Camden Yards and San Francisco 's SBC Park .
While a site had yet to be determined , the ballpark had been designed to fit on a generic four - square city block .
Once a site was selected , variations in the design were necessary in order to accommodate the site , surrounding structures and infrastructure needs .
The new ballpark honors Minnesota 's rich baseball heritage and reflects the state 's dynamic blend of urban sophistication and rugged outdoor vitality .
Featuring the most intimate seating configuration in the game , Minnesota 's new ballpark has marked the return of outdoor baseball for a new generation of Twins fans .
The ballpark 's retractable roof , had it been built , would have offered the best possible fan experience and give fans across the Upper Midwest comfort in planning a baseball outing regardless of the weather .
" The design reflects Minnesota 's abundant natural beauty and its citizens ' vibrancy , " said HOK S+V+E senior principal Earl Santee .
" This ballpark will preserve and honor the state 's wonderful baseball tradition and add an exciting new dimension to the quality of life .
It will be an inviting landmark for all of Minnesota and an intimate home for America 's pastime . "
Featuring just 40,000 seats on four levels ( Lower Deck , Suite Level , Club Level and Upper Deck ) , Minnesota 's new ballpark is among the most intimate facilities in all of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) .
Highlights of the seating configuration include only 12,000 seats in the Upper Deck , which represents the fewest number of upper - level seats in all of MLB .
The new ballpark also features more than 17,000 seats between first and third base ; 60 private suites ; 12 group party suites ; 4,000 Club seats and disabled seating for more than 800 .
In addition to showcasing great baseball , Minnesota 's new ballpark was designed to be a family - oriented entertainment destination .
Inside the ballpark , fans enjoy the comfort of expansive , heated concourses providing open views of the playing field on all seating levels .
The new ballpark also features a Minnesota Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum , a retail store , a baseball - themed Sports Bar and Restaurant , an interactive area for kids and additional venues for group ticket buyers .
Minnesota 's new ballpark would have been the sixth retractable - roof facility to be constructed in MLB .
However , while the roof remains in clear view to a majority of fans when open in other parks , the original Twins design called for a three - panel roof to move completely off the ballpark in less than 15 minutes .
When open , fans inside the park would have had the experience of an open - air ballpark .
During cold or inclement weather , the roof would have been closed , thereby providing shelter for fans and ensuring a more comfortable fan experience with no rain delays or rainouts .
The natural grass playing field is slightly asymmetrical .
The distance from home plate to the left field foul pole measures 328 feet while the distance down the right field line measures 331 feet .
The power alleys to left and right measure 371 feet with straightaway center field 402 feet from home plate .
The exterior of the Twins proposed ballpark reflects the natural beauty of Minnesota .
Wrapped in native Minnesotan Mankota - Kasota limestone , it echoes the look of the state 's natural stone formations .
The ballpark 's exterior is complimented by Fenway green steel and seating .

Afghanistan : 40 civilians killed in US strike
By Joe Kay
11 May 2007
At least 40 Afghan civilians were killed in air strikes on Tuesday , adding to the mounting death toll from the escalation of US operations in the country .
The latest incident occurred in the Sangin district of the southern province of Helmand , the scene of stepped - up US and NATO attacks in recent months .
Earlier reports put the civilian death toll at 21 , according to the governor of Helmand , Assadullah Wafa .
Reuters reported the larger figure on Thursday , citing eyewitness accounts .
As usual , the US initially claimed that all of those killed were Taliban fighters .
This latest incident , however , appears to have followed a pattern repeated in other areas recently .
According to military spokesman , US forces came under attack while patrolling in the area , and one US soldier died in the fighting .
The embattled patrol responded by calling in air support , which carried out indiscriminate bombing raids , including on local villages .
Major William Mitchell , a spokesman for the US - led coalition troops in Afghanistan , claimed Wednesday , “ We do n’t have any report of civilian casualties . ”
Sergeant Dean Welch , a US spokesman at the Bagram Air Force base , acknowledged there were such reports , but said they were not “ confirmed . ”
A report in the Toronto Globe and Mail on Thursday refutes these claims , however , noting that after the incident local villagers brought their wounded and dead to a nearby military base to protest the killings .
“ A grim tally emerged as angry villagers brought their injured and dead to Forward Operating Base Robinson , an outpost shared by Canadian , British , and US troops , ” Globe and Mail reporter Graeme Smith reported from Sangin District .
“ There were seven women , three men and two children among the dead ; five women , five men and 15 children were injured . ”
The newspaper interviewed one of the survivors , a 13 - year - old boy named Rahmatullah .
In addition to a wounded uncle , four of his other relatives were killed , he said , but he dragged two of his brothers alive from the mud rubble of a house .
“ The people who bombed us are bad guys , ” Rahmatullah said .
“ They should attack the Taliban , not us . ”
The villagers who were killed belonged to tribes generally considered hostile to the Taliban .
Some residents rejected statements by Governor Wafa and the US military that there were Taliban in the area , and that they hid in civilian homes to use the civilians as shields .
“ There were no Taliban in our area , ” one resident of Sangin told Reuters by phone .
The recent killings are part of a broader US - led offensive to recapture parts of the country not under the control of the puppet regime of Hamid Karzai in Kabul .
In January , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , with the support of both the Democrats and Republicans in the US , announced an increase in the US - military presence to prepare for a “ spring offensive . ”
On Wednesday , the military announced that about 4,500 troops from the 101st Airborne Division would be sent to Afghanistan to maintain the current troop strength at least through 2008 .
There are currently about 25,000 US troops in Afghanistan , including two combat brigades , in addition to troops from Britain , Poland and other countries .
The deaths Tuesday come on the heels of several other attacks that have killed scores of civilians .
At the end of April , air strikes in the western Herat Province killed at least 50 , while other attacks in the south have killed dozens , including one incident , also at the end of April , in which 13 civilians were killed .
Near Jalalabad in the east , 6 Afghans were killed during a raid in April , while 19 civilians were killed and 50 wounded when US marines went on a killing spree in March .
All of these incidents are combining to sharply increase popular opposition to the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan .
Each of the killings has been followed by large protests , sometimes lasting for days , demanding the withdrawal of US and other military forces .
Growing concern within the Afghan government that popular opposition could undermine the Karzai government was on display Tuesday , when the upper house of the parliament voted for a military cease - fire and negotiations with the Taliban .
Meanwhile , a US Army brigade commander issued a cynical apology for the deaths of the 19 civilians near Jalalabad in March .
Colonel John Nicholson said he was “ deeply , deeply ashamed ” by the incident , and said the military was issuing payments of US $ 2,000 as “ essentially a symbol of our sympathy to them ” and “ a way of expressing our genuine condolences over the incident occurring . ”
Haji Lawania , who was injured and had two relatives killed by the Marines , expressed what was no doubt the reaction of many of those involved , saying , “ We do n’t want their money and apologies .
If somebody loses one of his family members , an apology wo n’t bring him back . ”
I use the above phrase to attack socialized medicine a lot .
I ’m not trying to be hostile or sarcastic when I say this .
I ’m not trying to convey an “ America … love it or leave it ” type message , nor am I interested in cutting off the debate about the problems with health care in this country , which I agree do exist .
I say this to people who try preaching the doctrine of universal health coverage ( or , more accurately , socialized medicine ) because , frankly , I believe that the best counter - argument to their ridiculous proposal is for those people to go live for a few years in a country that has socialized medicine ( as I did ) so they can see for themselves what a horrifically bad idea it is .
To fill in the gaps a bit , I ’m UCrawford .
I ’m a libertarian ( small - l ) from Wichita , Kansas and a guest poster here .
Until 2006
I spent 10 years as a member of the United States military , just under six of them stationed at a small base in northern England ( five if you do n’t count a short vacation I took to Afghanistan on the Army ’s dime ) .
Due to the fact that the base I was on was both small and rather remote from any other U.S. bases we ended up falling between a lot of administrative cracks , most of which are n’t worth going into here , which often led to problems with funding .
Needless to say , the U.S. government was often forced to improvise to provide quality of life services for us at a reasonable rate , so one of the solutions they came up with ( since the closest base with medical services was 4 - 5 hours away ) was to arrange to have all of our health care provided by Britain ’s National Health Service ( NHS ) .
That decision provided all of the military personnel on our base with the unique experience of living under a system of socialized medicine that Michael Moore recently held up as among the best in the world .
That decision also made it unlikely that anyone stationed at our base will ever end up in one of Moore ’s little press conferences singing the praises of socialized medicine …the experience was terrible .
My first indication that something shady was up with our medical care came in my first year when I went into our base clinic ( staffed by two NHS doctors ) with a chest cold , only to be told that my cold was likely “ viral ” and would n’t require antibiotics .
That in itself was n’t really so odd .
We worked in a close environment and doctors are n’t supposed to prescribe antibiotics for viruses .
Except that after talking to other people on the base I eventually came to realize that about 90 % + of the people who went in with colds were told the same thing .
I ’m saying “ 90 % + ” because in the three years where the NHS staffed the clinic unchecked nobody I met on the base ( I knew almost everyone and we all got sick at least once or twice a year because of the climate ) could actually identify anyone who had been diagnosed with a non-viral cold or had received antibiotics for said cold .
I ’m not willing to bet there were n’t at least one or two in three years , although I never ran across any of these people .
My platoon sergeant certainly was n’t one of them .
He later came down with severe pneumonia as a result of his untreated non-viral cold .
I could n’t figure out why this skinflint attitude towards medicine was happening , until I talked to my uncle ( a doctor who had studied in Scotland for awhile ) and he told me about the key to many of socialized medicine ’s problems … controlling costs .
More on that in a second .
The cost controls took a variety of forms at my base , ranging from the merely annoying ( as when our base physician refused to order x- rays unless you had a bone sticking out of your arm ) , to the mildly amusing ( as when the local hospital refused to admit our First Sergeant ’s in - labor wife , forcing her and her husband to deliver the child in their car on the drive home ) , to the ethically questionable ( as when one of my soldiers was discharged with a severe case of appendicitis on the grounds that surgery would be too expensive ) , to the medically indefensible ( as when my best friend ’s girlfriend nearly died because the hospital did n’t bother to check her for internal bleeding after a very complicated miscarriage ) .
For the first couple of years , I thought it was because our area had the most incompetent doctors in Britain .
Eventually I realized that the problems we had in our area were pretty much standard in comparison to the rest of the country ( or compared to any country that uses socialized medicine ) .
And the reasons for that are pretty simple .
Basically , the NHS ’s “ free ” medical system is n’t really free at all , which should n’t be a surprise to anyone who does n’t believe in magic money .
It ’s funded by taxes … income taxes , corporate taxes , capital gains taxes , property taxes , and hidden taxes ( revenue generated for the national government from things like Value Added Tax , speed cameras , fuel taxes , and congestion charges that you often do n’t notice or think of as taxes unless you ’re paying attention ) .
In exchange for all these taxes , the British government provides lots of services for the taxpayers like public transportation , a pension system , and socialized medicine , often at subsidized rates which has several regrettable effects :
1 ) It makes unobservant people who do n’t understand economics think they ’re getting a great deal by giving them medical treatment at a superficially low price , which
2 ) Pretty much insures that low - cost private alternatives do n’t develop ( since it ’s tough to compete with “ free ” ) , which
3 ) Removes any incentive for the health care users to try and save costs by limiting their use since they see health care as a free ( as opposed to “ free ” ) entitlement , which means that
4 ) Demand for services often outpaces the ability of tax revenue available to pay for those services .
When these things happen government is then forced to find new streams of revenue to pay for the additional demand ( more taxes ) .
And when they ca n’t find more revenue or raise taxes any higher , they ’re forced to control costs by reducing services where they can , by doing things like telling their doctors to prescribe less drugs , or understaffing medical facilities , or extending wait times for surgeries and consults ( unless you ’re willing to be extorted , of course ) , or starving terminal patients to death against their wishes , or skimping on oversight to insure that their doctors are n’t serial killers .
Basically , when it comes to a choice between quality of care for patients or saving a buck , government - run health care will choose the money , same as socialized medicine proponents accuse private industry of doing .
They ’ll just offer you a lot less in return .
Unsurprisingly many Britons I knew had very little faith in the NHS ’s commitment to excellence .
Unsurprisingly many Britons I knew chose to pursue private routes to get medical treatment where it was available .
Unsurprisingly , it was usually very expensive ( partly because they were still paying taxes for a health care system they no longer used ) .
Fortunately for us , after my soldier had to be medevac’d to the distant military hospital to get his appendix out , that base saw fit to provide our base with military doctors who had the authority to override the recommendations of the NHS doctors , and with the support of our command they enabled us to get access to private clinics in the local area more often .
Frankly , I ’d say that getting us away from government health care was one of the best things our government ever did for us .
And if our politicians want to do the right thing by us back here in the States , they ’ll do everything they can to stop socialized medicine from popping up here .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraq ’s top Shi’ite , Sunni Arab and Kurdish political leaders announced on Sunday they had reached consensus on some key measures seen as vital to fostering national reconciliation .

The agreement by the five leaders was one of the most significant political developments in Iraq for months and was quickly welcomed by the United States , which hopes such moves will ease sectarian violence that has killed tens of thousands .
But skeptics will be watching for action amid growing frustration in Washington over the political paralysis that has gripped the government of Shi’ite Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
White House spokeswoman Emily Lawrimore congratulated Iraq ’s leaders on the accord , hailing it in a statement as “ an important symbol of their commitment to work together for the benefit of all Iraqis . ”
The apparent breakthrough comes two weeks before U.S. President George W. Bush ’s top officials in Iraq present a report that could have a major influence on future American policy in Iraq .
“ I hope that this agreement will help Iraq move beyond the political impasse , ” Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih told Reuters .
“ The five leaders representing Iraq ’s major political communities .... affirmed the principle of collective leadership to help deal with the many challenges faced by Iraq . ”
Maliki ’s appearance on Iraqi television with the four other leaders at a brief news conference was a rare show of public unity .
The other officials present were President Jalal Talabani , a Kurd ; Sunni Vice President Tareq al - Hashemi ; Shi’ite Vice President Adel Abdul - Mahdi , and Masoud Barzani , president of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region .
Iraqi officials said the five leaders had agreed on draft legislation that would ease curbs on former members of Saddam Hussein ’s Baath party joining the civil service and military .
Consensus was also reached on a law governing provincial powers as well as setting up a mechanism to release some detainees held without charge , a key demand of Sunni Arabs since the majority being held are Sunnis .
The laws need to be passed by Iraq ’s fractious parliament , which has yet to receive any of the drafts .
OIL LAW
Yasin Majid , a media adviser to Maliki , told Reuters the leaders also endorsed a draft oil law , which has already been agreed by the cabinet but has not yet gone to parliament .
But a statement from Talabani ’s office said more discussions were needed on the draft oil law and constitutional reforms .
Committees had also been formed to try to ensure a “ balance ” of Shi’ites , Sunni Arabs and Kurds in government .
The oil law is seen as the most important in a package of measures stalled by political infighting in Maliki ’s government .
The lack of action has frustrated Washington , which has been urging more political progress before the pivotal report on Iraq is presented to the U.S. Congress around September 11 .
The report by the U.S. military commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and ambassador Ryan Crocker , is seen as a watershed moment in the unpopular four - year - old war , with Democrats likely to use the negligible political progress to press their case for troops to begin pulling out soon .

Bush is pleading for patience , pointing to the military ’s apparent success in reducing levels of violence between majority Shi’ite Muslims and minority Sunni Arabs .
The White House ’s Lawrimore said in her statement that the United States would “ continue to support these brave leaders and all the Iraqi people in their efforts to overcome the forces of terror who seek to overwhelm Iraq ’s democracy .
“ The President also welcomes the desire of the Iraqi leadership to develop a strategic partnership with the United States based on common interests . ”
But Democrats are not convinced , and presidential hopeful Senator Hillary Clinton and fellow Senator Carl Levin have called for Maliki to be replaced .
Maliki hit back on Sunday , saying : “ There are American officials who consider Iraq as if it were one of their villages , for example Hillary Clinton and Carl Levin . ”
“ This is severe interference in our domestic affairs .
Carl Levin and Hillary Clinton are from the Democratic Party and they must demonstrate democracy , ” he said .
“ I ask them to come to their senses and to talk in a respectful way about Iraq . ”

Posted on September 24 , 2007 , Jonathan Chinese MMO Bans Males From Playing Female Characters
Players of the Chinese MMORPG , King of the World , may have found themselves unable to log into their accounts this past weekend .
The game ‘s publisher , Aurora Technology , has apparently frozen the accounts of all male players choosing to play as a female characters .
Now , only female players can play female characters , and they ’re required to prove their gender via a webcam .
Females wanting to play males are still allowed though .
I ’m still waiting to hear a reason for this though .
The best I can think of is that they wanted people playing to be sure that the people they were talking too were really the gender they claimed they were , but then why still allow females to play male character ?
Seems like a pretty easy way to drive off a lot of customers though .
Besides essentially getting rid of any male wanting to play as a female character ( a fairly large consumer base ) , what about all those people who had their characters really built up at the time of the ban ?
Are they just out of luck and have to start over ?
And the webcam thing really is n’t going to deter male players from playing as females .
All you ’d need is a female friend willing to sit in front of a computer for a couple minutes or a penchant for cross-dressing .

The Messerschmitt Me 262 Schwalbe was the first German jet fighter used in World War II .
Photo : Bettmann / Corbis 1942 : The third prototype of the Messerschmitt 262 becomes the first true operational jet plane when it takes to the skies over Bavaria at the height of World War II .
Engine problems , other teething difficulties and political bungling delayed its debut as a combat aircraft until 1944 , but when it arrived , the twin - jet Me 262 showed that with an experienced pilot at the controls , it was more than a match for the best Allied fighters , including Britain 's own jet , the Gloster Meteor .
In truth , the Me 262 should have been ready for front - line service much earlier .
The original design , which , in the end , looked a lot like the finished product , existed as early as April 1939 .
But high costs and the belief of many high - ranking Luftwaffe officers that conventional aircraft could win the war prevented Germany from making the Me 262 a priority .
The first prototype flew in 1941 , but the BMW - made turbojets were n't ready , so the first Me 262 went aloft equipped with 700 - horsepower Jumo 210G piston engines .
Like the Type XXI U - boat , the Me 262 appeared too late in the war to help Germany stave off defeat .
History will remember it as the world 's first operational jet plane , but the Me 262's true legacy is the influence it had on the design of a new generation of warplanes .

BULLISH MARKET FORECAST !

Have you ever dreamed of purchasing your very own Boeing 747 ?
If so , now is the time to talk with your finance people and get all your ducks in a row .
During the next two to five years , the price of used Boeing 747s may fall to historic lows as the global supply of dead 747s climbs to unprecedented highs .
The in - service arrival of next - generation widebody aircraft such as the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747 - 8 means that several hundred of today 's oldest 747s -- mostly 747-200 models built during the 1970s that are currently used as air freighters -- will soon be headed out to pasture .
Aviation
Week outlines the market forces behind the coming surge in used 747 inventories :
Mass retirement is looming for the world 's fleet of aging freighters , especially Boeing 747-200s .
Boeing says that 40 % of the 320 747 freighters in service are at least 25 years old but keep flying because strong demand for new passenger jets and delays in delivery of Airbus A380s have suppressed the supply of replacement airplanes .
James Edgar , a cargo specialist with Boeing , says the old 747s " will be retired in droves " in the next few years as airframe production catches up with global traffic demand and passenger transports such as 747-400s are released for conversion to freighters .
Inevitably , a few of these vintage 747-200s will continue to fly , and some may be converted into technology testbeds or supersized VIP private jets .
( Heads - up Larry and Sergey ! )
Most , however , will be ferried out to the desert , broken up , and salvaged for scrap .
How much will a used 747 cost you ?
If you 're in the market for an entire aircraft , expect to pay around $ 100,000 for a complete hull that has been stripped of reusable components such as engines , landing gear , and cockpit avionics .
Your hollowed - out but otherwise - intact 747 will probably look something like this :
The interior of your 747 will be 187 feet ( 57 m ) long and 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) wide , and as you look aft , it will look much like this :
What a bargain !
For far less than the cost of a new Ferrari , you could be the first on your block to have your very own 747 .
Particularly if you think the whole shipping container architecture thing has become a bit trite , this may be a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to blaze new trails in the annals of creative - reuse .
Do n't giggle : Various backwoods - types have already converted smaller Boeing 727s into prefab houses ( interior views here ) , and a woman in Southern California made headlines in 2005 when it was learned that she planned to build a high - end house in the hills around Malibu using various pieces of a single 747 .
That was two years ago , so Telstar Logistics contacted the the offices of David Hertz , the architect who designed the 747 House , to get an update on the project .
We were told that the site work is complete and construction is getting underway , and that the concrete foundations will be poured soon .
Here 's how the 747 House will look :
If for various reasons a whole 747 is too much to swallow , you could also purchase select pieces of the airframe .
For example , a 747 cockpit section could be converted into a sleek back yard studio or office pod :
Arched sections of 747 fuselage can be used to create Quonset huts or out - buildings , like this crude 747 - based shed we saw in use at an aircraft scrapyard :
And if all that still seems a bit LARGE , remember that even random bits of 747 can look great if you display them as " recontextualized art . "
We speak here with some confidence , because in 2005 Telstar Logistics paid $ 375 for a big chunk of a Boeing 707 .
We then refinished the piece , added backlighting , and hung it on the wall of our Corporate Headquarters :
Perhaps we 're due for a widebody upgrade ?
In any event , keep an eye out at a boneyard near you as those hundreds of old 747s begin to arrive for hospice care .
If past trends are any guide , the scrapyards around Mojave , Calif. , Victorville , Calif. , and Marana , Ariz .
are likely to become fertile ground for 747 bargain - hunters .
Just do n't forget to bring your checkbook .

Is it legal to lock people out of their own computers ?
Michael Pollitt examines an online billing system that uses what could be considered strongarm tactics
Ted Kenyon does n't like being pursued for money by his computer .
Retired and living in the west country , he prefers using his PC to download MP3 files .
But whenever he turned it on recently , he was confronted by a large popup window demanding payment .
He closed it - only to see it instantly appear again .
While advertising popups often plague net users , Kenyon 's experience seemed worryingly different .
He saw that the window was from a company in Leeds called Micro Bill Systems asking for £ 19.99 , with the explanation that his computer had been used to sign up to a website .
After suffering the annoying problem for some time , he emailed the Guardian for help .
Kenyon is always careful about protecting his PC .
He was using fully updated Windows XP Professional along with Norton Internet Security 2007 , Spybot Search & Destroy , AVG anti-spyware and Sophos anti-rootkit .
He 'd seen popups before but this one stayed longer each day , hindering his computer use .
" The popup starts about 30 seconds after the PC is turned on and lasts for about four minutes before the window can be closed .
While the bill is displayed , you cannot minimise it or open any other window in front of it , as it always hogs the top window slot , " he says .
Locked out
The Guardian soon found Katie Singleton , who runs her own web business , with the same problem .
One day she noticed a window on her PC - headed " MBS direct billing " - demanding money .
" They were charging £ 19.99 for something called Sexpassport , which I had never heard of and certainly never used .
The popup started appearing intermittently and could be clicked out of , but after a few weeks it started to appear more frequently and would then lock me out of the system for up to two minutes , " says Singleton .
Kenyon and Singleton insist that they never signed up to a website ; both fought to regain control of their PCs .
After several unsuccessful attempts , Singleton bought some anti-spyware software from Pareto Logic to do the job .
Also struggling , Kenyon eventually followed advice in a user forum and deleted the unwanted files manually .
Other people have been reporting the same thing - an unexpected bill that increasingly disrupts PC use .
The website involved is sexxxpassport , operated by an Australian company using billing software provided by Micro Bill Systems .
The site offers a three - day free trial for anonymous access , following which charges are made - there 's a long list of terms and conditions too .
Simon Briskman , a partner in the technology law group at Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP , worries about the effects such problems have on consumer confidence in the internet .
" I think it 's very clever , " he says .
" We have n't seen something like this before and it looks like somebody has thought very carefully through the issues of producing the terms .
But all the same , nearly all the victims are going to be consumers and consumer contracts have to be fair - I do n't think these terms are fair . "
According to the terms , unless the bill is paid , the software will disrupt your computer use for longer each day .
There are up to four daily periods of 10 minutes when the window demanding payment is locked and cannot be minimised .
Restarting the computer offers no relief and may result in even more disruption .
Briskman also reckons that , if the billing software is installed without consent , it may breach the Computer Misuse Act 1990 .
But leaving aside the embarrassing suggestion of telling the police you 've been involuntarily signed - up to a pornographic website , Briskman offers another solution : " I 'm extremely sympathetic with people suffering from this because it 's difficult to do anything other than pay these people off .
More effectively , complain to the OFT [ Office of Fair Trading ] . "
As the director of malware research at computer security company Prevx , Jacques Erasmus has spent days investigating the software involved .
Erasmus started hacking in his early teens , a self - taught skill that led to a challenging IT career .
Prevx provides solutions to protect PCs above and beyond the ordinary security software that Kenyon used .
Erasmus signed up a test PC to see how the billing software works .
After user permission was given , two mutually protected files were installed in a system directory and the registry modified .
The software is then hard for non-technical users to remove .
" Once a user 's free period has expired , the application installed on the machine will start popping up relentless messages and fullscreen popups that cannot be closed instructing the user to pay their bill , " says Erasmus .
" These activities are both ruthless and on the borderline of ransomware applications . "
So how did Kenyon and Singleton get it ?
Erasmus has searched hard for an " exploit " where the billing software might be dropped silently onto PCs visiting malicious websites or distributed through other methods such as a botnet .
" There is no evidence of it being installed by a dropper of any kind , " says Erasmus .
" The best way to remove this is to use Prevx1 , which will scan your machine to check if you are infected and cure the infection if it is infected . "
Prevx1 also prevents the software installing in the first place .
Ashley Bateup , the managing director of Micro Bill Systems in Leeds , rebuts any suggestions of silent installations .
He says his company has developed a new internet billing system which is used by its only UK customer , sexxxpassport , and claims 100,000 users .
Software removal
" The most common situation giving rise to these complaints is where a member of the household downloads the software without actually reading the terms and conditions or warning , and once they realise they have contracted for a service they refuse to admit their use to the computer owner , who then assumes their PC has been infected in some way , " says Bateup .
" Our customer service team 's experience is that people seem to move into denial with their spouses or partners when pornography use is at question . "
If another member of the household is responsible , then the browser history may show this ; the company claims to have comprehensive access logs too .
Bateup says that one woman who rang to complain was shocked to discover her husband had visited the porn site many times despite his denials .
However , Kenyon and Singleton categorically deny that they or anyone else in their households visited the website .
So what about software removal for cases like theirs ?
" If the software was easily removable few people would pay for the service they had already consumed , " says Bateup .
" The software operates a reminder procedure to encourage people to settle their accounts .
If the consumer settles their account and cancels their subscription , the software can be uninstalled simply . "
As to the terms and conditions being lawful and fair , Bateup adds that he contacted the OFT - as well as Trading Standards - last October to inform them of the company 's business intentions .
Asked about this , the OFT said it does not normally comment on individual cases - which does not resolve whether it thinks MBS 's tactics are indeed fair and lawful .
The mystery remains , though .
Someone must be mistaken .
But who ?

Navy to spend $ 600,000 to mask ' hateful ' swastika - shaped barracks RAW STORY

Oy gevalt .
" The U.S. Navy has decided to spend as much as $ 600,000 for landscaping and architectural modifications to obscure the fact that one its building complexes looks like a swastika from the air , " Tony Perry reports in Monday 's edition of the LA Times .
" The four L - shaped buildings , constructed in the late 1960s , are part of the amphibious base at Coronado and serve as barracks for Seabees . "
The article continues , " But once people began looking at satellite images from Google Earth , they started commenting about on blogs and websites about how much the buildings resembled the symbol used by the Nazis . "
The shape of the barracks was first noticed and commented upon at a Google Earth Community bulletin board as early as February 2005 .
As the oddity became more widely known , however , calls arose for the Navy to do something about it .
Now the prevailing tone in blog comments is one of scorn for the waste of $ 600,000 on something that can only be seen from space .
Excerpts from LA Times article : # When contacted by a Missouri - based radio talk - show host last year , Navy officials gave no indication they would make changes .
But early this year , the issue was quietly taken up by Morris Casuto , the Anti-Defamation League 's regional director in San Diego , and U.S. Rep. Susan Davis ( D - San Diego ) .
As a result , in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 , the Navy has budgeted up to $ 600,000 for changes in walkways , " camouflage " landscaping and rooftop photovoltaic cells .
The goal is to mask the shape .
" We do n't want to be associated with something as symbolic and hateful as a swastika , " said Scott Sutherland , deputy public affairs officer for Navy Region Southwest , the command that is responsible for maintaining buildings on local bases .

Pattern Matching
In Python
This paper describes a model of pattern matching implemented using the Python programming language .
It 's designed with the following objectives :
To describe the style of pattern matching found in the SNBOL4 , Icon and OmniMark programming languages to those who do n't have an opportunity to use those languages .
To provide examples of the advantage of a streaming approach to pattern matching as found in the OmniMark language , its predecessor the Hugo language , and in Unix 's " lex " utility .
As an attempt to fit pattern matching into the Python language in a more expressive and powerful manner than the existing " re " pattern matching library .
To explain pattern matching in an accessible fashion , and to show that it 's not such a difficult subject .
This description and the accompanying implementation should be considered a work in progress .
It 's not intended as a criticism of the alternative grep / Perl / re style .
Rather it 's intended to present an alternative style , based on that used in the SNOBOL4 , Icon and OmniMark programmming languages , that has sufficient history and merit to warant serious consideration .
In addition , the implementation is best viewed as a prototype .
It 's no great shakes performance - wise .
There 's no compile - time optimizations , which would greatly help .
But it runs quite nicely for quite a variety of uses .
1. Different Kinds of Pattern Matching
When I started looking into Python , having heard that it had text pattern matching support , and read in the recent ( version 2.3 )
Python docs that it had adopted the Icon programming language 's model for iterator and generators , I had high hopes that I 'd find pattern matching of a similar sort to that in the Icon language .
What I found was a module ( " re " ) implementing a string - based " regex " grep - like pattern matching , similar to that in Perl , that can be applied to Python strings .
1.1 Icon-Like Pattern Matching
Pattern matching in the Icon language is different from that in Perl .
It 's an integral part of the language , like pattern rules in Perl , but its syntax is much closer to that of other expressions , similarly to arithmetic or string - valued expressions , and all the pattern operations are provided as operators or functions in the language .
The advantage of this approach is two - fold :
Pattern matching can be used in a wide variety of contexts , and that it can be readily extended in a variety of ways , allowing users to build application - specific pattern types and operations .
It fits better into the syntax of Icon , and would fit better into the syntax of Python than does the Perl model .
Icon 's style of pattern is a development of that in the earlier programming language SNOBOL4 , and was the inspiration for the pattern matching facilities of the OmniMark programming language .
So I 've been putting some time into seeing whether I could use Python to implement something closer to what Icon provides .
And it turns out that a quite close , and very usable implementation is possible .
The rest of this document describes a few modules that implement a new pattern matching model for use in Python .
1.2 A Short History
The style of pattern matching described in this document started out in the 1960's in the SNOBOL language , a programming language for processing text whose design and implementation was lead by Ralph E. Griswold .
In the 1970's he lead the design and implementation of a more general language , Icon , that had similar pattern matching features with a syntax closer to the general expressions in the language .
In the late 1970's I lead the implemenation of a programming language called Hugo at the Canadian Printing Office ( the Queen 's Printer ) in Ottawa and used a variant of the Icon pattern language , the major difference being that it used a non-backtracking model ( see later ) .
In the late 1980 's I adapted this model , still non-backtracking , for use in the OmniMark language .
The current OmniMark pattern matching langauge is a development of this original design and its implementation .
The following Python pattern matching sublanguage is a mixture of those in SNOBOL4 , Icon , Hugo and OmniMark .
Syntactically its closest to Icon and Hugo .
It has both a backtracking implementation , like SNOBOL4 and Icon , and non-backtracking implementation , like Hugo and OmniMark .
It avoids the low - level explication of the model as appears in Icon , and looks to the user more like SNOBOL4 , Hugo or OmniMark .
Compromises have had to be made to fit into what can be currently impelemented in Python .
On the other hand , there are things here that do n't appear in any of those languages ( like the " P1 - P2 " pattern ) , so enjoy !
2. Some Examples
Here 's a simple example :
if " abcdefgh23 ; ijklmn " ^ AnyOfP ( string.letters ) [ 4 ] : print " found four letters " else : print " did n't find four letters "
What this " if " statement does is check if the string " abcdefgh23 ; ijklmn " starts with four letters ( of course it does ) :
" ^ " applies a pattern to a string or streaming input .
It returns True if it successfully matches , or False if the pattern fails to match .
" AnyOfP ( string.letters ) " creates a pattern that matches a letter .
( The Python module " string " is a useful source of sets of characters that can be used with AnyOfP and NoneOfP . )
" [ 4 ] " takes a pattern and returns a pattern that matches it four times .
Here 's a slightly more complex example :
subject = MatchingInput ( " abcdefgh23 ; ijklmn " ) if subject ^ AnyOfP ( string.letters ) [ 4 ] >> " four letters " : print " found four letters : \ " " + subject [ " four letters " ] + " \ " " else : print " did n't find four letters "
The " if " statement checks for four letters again , but additionally saves them away for later use :
" MatchingInput " creates an input stream that can be used for matching .
It 's what the matching operator ( " ^ " ) wants as its first argument .
( If " ^ " is given just a string , it coerces to a MatchingInput . )
" >> " assigns what 's matched by the pattern to a dictionary entry in the " ^ " operator 's first argument , in this case named " four letters " .
" [ " four letters " ] " retrieves a named entry from a MatchingInput 's dictionary .
All the common ( and some uncommon ) pattern matching operators are available :
if " abcdefgh23 ; ijklmn " ^ ( AnyOfP ( string.letters ) [ 4 ] | \ AnyOfP ( string.digits ) [ 2 : ] & IsP ( " ; " ) ) : print " found four letters or two or more digits and a semicolon " else : print " did n't find four letters or two or more digits and a semicolon "
The " if " statement has been extended to matching either four letters , or matching two or more digits plus a tailing semicolon ( only in the case of finding digits ) :
" | " means " or " -- the first alternative found is the one used .
" & " means " and " -- both what precedes it and what follows it .
As is usual , " & " binds more tightly than does " | " .
Multiple separate matchings can be applied to an input :
subject = MatchingInput ( " abcdefgh23 ; ijklmn " ) if subject ^ AnyOfP ( string.letters ) [ 4 ] >> " four letters " : print " found four letters : \ " " + subject [ " four letters " ] + " \ " " elif subject ^ AnyOfP ( string.digits ) [ 2 : ] >> " the digits " & IsP ( " ; " ) : print " found two or more digits followed by a semicolon : \ " " + \ subject [ " the digits " ] + " \ " " else : print " did n't find four letters or two or more digits and a semicolon "
In this example , if the four letter match fails , the digit match is attempted on the same input .
As a final example , here is scanning through an input and matching as much as possible :
subject = MatchingInput ( " abcdefgh23 ; ijklmn " ) while True : if subject ^ AnyOfP ( string.letters ) [ 4 ] >> " four letters " : print " found four letters : \ " " + subject [ " four letters " ] + " \ " " elif subject ^ AnyOfP ( string.digits ) [ 2 : ] >> " the digits " & IsP ( " ; " ) : print " found two or more digits followed by a semicolon : \ " " + \ subject [ " the digits " ] + " \ " " elif subject ^ AnyOfP ( string.letters ) [ 1:3 ] >> " 1 2 3 letters " : print " found less than four letters : \ " " + \ subject [ " 1 2 3 letters " ] + " \ " " else : break
In this example :
" while True " is used to repeatedly match patterns against the input .
" break " is used when no pattern will match -- it 's time to give up .
When a successful match is made against an input , the data it matches is consumed from the input , so that any following pattern matching is applied against the next thing input .
3. Matching Inputs
The string " abcdefgh23 ; ijklmn " or the " subject " in the previous examples is a what a pattern is matched against .
It 's a " matching input " , or in Icon 's terms , a " subject " .
A matching input is just like a stream input ( an input file , for example ) , except that it manages the input for the benefit of pattern matching :
It holds input that 's already read in so that if a pattern fails to match , the held input is available for another match .
It flushes out what 's already matched so , for example , one does n't need to keep a whole file in memory to examing and / or transform it .
It holds a dictionary of matched and saved parts of the input for later use .
It allows multiple nested matches against the same input .
4. Backtracking vs. Non-backtracking Pattern Matching
( This section can be skipped if you want to quickly start working with the implementation . )
There are two underlying models of how patterns work : backtracking and non-backtracking .
A simple example of the difference between the two is the following match :
" aab " ^ ( IsP ( " a " ) | IsP ( " aa " ) ) & IsP ( " b " )
Backtracking pattern matching " backs up " when it fails and attempts any available alternatives .
Under the backtracking regime , the first " a " will be matched , then an attempt will be made to match the " b " , but the second " a " will be found and the " b " match attempt will fail .
At that point the pattern matching will back up to the second alternative of the " or " part of the pattern , and the " aa " will be matched , leading to a successful match for the " b " .
So the pattern match will succeed .
Non-backtracking pattern matching does n't back up to find an alternative of an already successful match , so when the " b " match fails , the pattern as a whole fails .
The apparent weakness of non-backtracking pattern matching is n't as serious as might at first seem the case .
For one thing , there 's often a simple rewrite of the pattern that performes the desired match .
For the above pattern , either of the following will do :
" aab " ^ ( IsP ( " aa " ) | IsP ( " a " ) ) & IsP ( " b " ) " aab " ^ IsP ( " a " ) [ 1:2 ] & IsP ( " b " )
Another pattern that illustrates the difference between the two approaches is the following :
" abcd.efg " ^ MoveP ( 1 ) [ 0 : ] & IsP ( " . " )
( [ 0 : ] in this notation matches zero or more of the pattern it qualifies . )
Again , this match succeeds under backtracking pattern matching and fails under non-backtracking pattern matching :
There are two backtracking pattern matching models of what goes on here .
In the first , all the input is first matched by " MoveP ( 1 ) [ 0 : ] " and the attempted match to " . " fails .
Then the shorter alternatives of " MoveP ( 1 ) [ 0 : ] " are tried until it matches " abcd " and the following match of " . " succeeds .
In the second model , " MoveP ( 1 ) [ 0 : ] " matches the shortest possibility and when " . " is n't found , attempts the progressively longer alternatives until it does .
Under non-backtracking pattern matching " MoveP ( 1 ) [ 0 : ] " matches all that it can , the " . " fails to match , and the pattern immediately fails .
Again , non-backtracking pattern matching can be made to work with a simple rewrite :
" abcd.efg " ^ NoneOfP ( " . " ) [ 0 : ] & IsP ( " . " )
Advantages of non-backtracking pattern matching include :
Non-backtracking pattern matching is generally more efficient , as the path through them is more straight - forward and less back - and - forth .
Backtracking pattern matching can often be optimized by a good compiler into the non-backtracking case , but doing so becomes difficult or impossible where the pattern is no logically equivalent to a simple regular expression .
Bactracking pattern matching languages often provide additional operators to direct pattern matching , largely to help avoid the use of inefficient and worthless paths .
Non-backtracking patterns are generally easier to understand , again because of the straight - through route successful matches take .
Both backtracking and non-backtracking pattern matching have their place .
Non -backtracking is an entirely adequate choice most of the time .
Backtracking is the choice when pattern matching requirements start to become complex .
The Python pattern matching implementation that accompanies this paper includes both bactracking and non-backtracking versions of the patterns .
5. A Short Reference Manual
5.1 Matching Inputs
Both matching inputs and patterns are implemented as Python objects .
Patterns do n't have any properties or methods of use to the user -- they are used when matching .
Matching inputs , on the other hand , have a variety of useful properties , and they are described here .
Matching inputs are created in one of three ways : explicit creation from a string , explicit creation from a file or file - like value , and implicit creation from a string when it 's passed as the first argument of the " ^ " operator :
MatchingInput ( string ) MatchingInput ( file ) string ^ pattern
Where " file " is referred to as the argument of MatchingInput , what 's really required is only any object that has a .read method that returns input in the same manner as does the .read method of an opened file object .
5.1.1 MatchingInput [...]
Indexing a matching input with a string value accesses the matching input 's dictionary .
keyvalue = subject [ " key " ]
( In this example and the following , " subject " is a value of type MatchingInput .
The term " subject " is taken from the Icon programming language . )
A matching input 's dictionary contains the values saved within a pattern using the SetP function or >> operator .
5.1.2 MatchingInput .
Sets
The .
Sets property of a matching input is an explicit reference to its dictionary .
All common dictionary operations can be performed on it , including the useful " .has_key " method .
keyvalue = subject .
Sets [ " key " ]
5.1.3 MatchingInput.ClearSets
Without any arguments , the .
ClearSets method clears the matching input 's dictionary , so that it has no entries .
subject .ClearSets ()
With one or more arguments , . ClearSets clears only the specified entries ( if they exist -- they do n't need to ) from the matching input 's dictionary .
subject .
ClearSets ( " key " , " value " )
5.1.4 MatchingInput .
AllMatched
The .
AllMatched property contains all of whatever was matched by the last use of the " ^ " .
If the match attempt failed ( or prior to any match ) , the value of .
AllMatched is None . .
AllMatched means you do n't need to save the whole of a pattern's match in the matching input 's dictionary .
subject .
AllMatched
5.1.5 MatchingInput.SetBufferSize
The .SetBufferSize method sets the size of the buffer used by a matching input .
Normally a matching input 's buffer is just as large as it needs to be for any current pattern matching .
However , this can be inefficient .
So .
SetBufferSize is provided to up the buffer size used .
It can be any positive value , but too too big can be inefficient , so care needs to be taken using this method .
If you do n't know , or do n't particulary care , ignoring this method is just fine
subject .
SetBufferSize ( 1024 )
5.1.6 lastMatch
The lastMatch function ( it 's not a method ) , returns the matching input object most recently passed to a " ^ " operator or Match function .
keyvalue = lastMatch ( ) [ " key " ] if lastMatch ( ) ^ AtTheEndP ( ) : ...
lastMatch has no arguments .
lastMatch is useful when you dont't have a name for what was being scanned .
For example , where " usersName " is a string value , you can go :
if usersName ^ NoneOfP ( " " ) [ 1 : ] >> " first " & AnyOfP ( " " ) [ 0 : ] : print " first name = " , lastMatch ( ) [ " first " ] if lastMatch ( ) ^ MoveP ( ) [ 1 : ] : print " other names = " , lastMatch ( ) # because of str
5.1.7 str
Python's " str " function can be applied to a matching input object .
If it is , it consumes all the remaining input from that matching input and returns it , leaving nothing for any future match .
alltherest = str ( subject ) print subject
5.2 The Match Operator
Match ( matchinginput , pattern ) matchinginput ^ pattern string ^ pattern
The pattern is applied to first argument , which can either be a string or the result of invoking MatchingInput .
If the match succeeds , the matched input is " consumed " and the following input available for a following match .
If the first argument is a matching input object , then that object can again be used to continue matching on the same input .
Alternatively , the user can invoke the lastMatch function to retrieve the matching input that was used by a previous match .
If the first argument of a Match operator is a string , then the lastMatch function is the only way to access input captured by the pattern , and the only way to continue further matching on it .
The " ^ " operator returns True or False , depending on whether it succeeds .
It 's typically used as the argument of an " if " or " while " .
The " ^ " operator updates the matching input value returned by the lastMatch function immediately prior to returning its result .
5.3 Infix Pattern Operators
Some of the basic pattern operations are implemented as infix operators .
Each of these operators has an equivalent function form .
5.3.1 Or Pattern
Match either the first or second pattern , the first pattern in preference .
pattern | pattern OrP ( pattern , pattern )
The function form of OrP can have zero or more arguments .
With zero arguments it always fails .
Otherwise if any of the argument patterns match , it matches .
5.3.2 And Pattern
Match both the first and second patterns , in that order .
pattern & pattern AndP ( pattern , pattern )
The function form of AndP can have zero or more arguments .
With zero arguments it always succeeds .
Otherwise all of the argument patterns much match , in the order given .
5.3.3 Arbitrary Match Pattern
Match zero or more instances of the first pattern , followed by one instance of the second pattern .
The minimum number of matches of the first pattern is done to satisfy the second pattern .
pattern ^ pattern ArbP ( pattern , pattern )
The ArpP pattern is useful for testing something anywhere in input data .
Note that the ArbP operator is " ^ " , just as is the matching operator .
There 's no conflict , because you get one when the first argument is a matching input and the other when both arguments are patterns .
Care needs to be taken with parenthesization when using both in an expression : " input ^ pattern1 ^ patter n2 " is in error because Python reads it as if entered " ( input ^ patter n1 ) ^ pattern2 " -- " input ^ ( pattern1 ^ pattern2 ) " does the right thing .
5.3.4 Set Pattern
Each matching input has an associated dictionary ( its " . Sets " ) property , in which parts of a matched pattern can be saved .
SetP matches the given pattern and then sets the matched text to the dictionary entry with the key " string " .
If the match fails , the dictionary entry is unchanged .
pattern >> string SetP ( string , pattern )
5.3.5 SetOne Pattern
Like SetP , SetOneP matches the given pattern and then sets the matched input to the dictionary entry with the key " string " .
Unlike SetP , SetOneP requires that only one input token be matched , and it sets the dictionary entry to the one token matched -- not to a sequence , like SetP .
If there is not exactly one token matched SetOneP fails .
If the match fails , the dictionary entry is unchanged .
pattern << string SetOneP ( string , pattern )
SetOneP is useful for matching non-text input , where the individual tokens are of importance , rather than sequences of them .
5.3.6 Within Pattern
pattern + pattern WithinP ( pattern , pattern )
Match first pattern , and then match the second pattern within what was matched by the first pattern .
The " + " pattern matches what is matched by the second pattern .
An example of WithinP 's utility is the following :
line_width = 80 while True : if subject ^ NoneOfP ( "
" ) [ line_width + 1 ] + \ ( NoneOfP ( " " ) [ 1 : ] & IsP ( " " ) ) [ 1 : ] : print subject .
AllMatched elif subject ^ NoneOfP ( "
" ) [ 0:line_width ] >> " line " & IsP ( "
" ) [ 0:1 ] : print subject [ " line " ] else : break
which does simple formatting on text input .
The " if " picks up part of a line ( 81 characters ) , matches the part of it that consists of whole words ( followed by spaces ) , and prints it on a line .
The " elif " picks up tail ends of lines and pieces with more than 80 characters that have no spaces in them .
The " else " exits when there 's no more input .
5.3.7 Except Pattern
Match first pattern , but succeed only if the second pattern does not match the whole of what 's matched by the first pattern .
ExcpeptP is useful where a complex pattern matches a little too much and it's easier to say what should n't be matched than revise the first pattern .
pattern - pattern ExceptP ( pattern , pattern )
5.4 Prefix Pattern Operators
A couple of useful pattern operations are implemented as prefix operators .
Each of these operators has an equivalent function form .
5.4.1 Test Pattern
Match the pattern , but consume no input data .
TestP is useful for " looking ahead " in the input to see what follows .
+ pattern TestP ( pattern )
5.4.2 Not Pattern
Match the pattern and then fail to match if the pattern matches , and succeed if the pattern failed to match .
On success no input data is consumed .
- pattern NotP ( pattern )
5.4.3 Once Pattern
Match pattern but if it yields more than one alternative match , use only the first one yielded .
For example ~ P [ 0 : ] ( or OnceP ( P [ 0 : ] ) ) , where " P " is a pattern , will match the largest repetition of " P " , but will not attempt to match any smaller repetitions , even if doing so might produce a successful match .
~ pattern OnceP ( pattern )
OnceP can help speed patterns up , when it 's known that the it's either the first match attempt or nothing -- useless matches are n't attempted .
OnceP only makes sense in for the backtracking implementation .
For the non-backtracking implementation there is only one alternative ever matched ( or none ) , so OnceP just invokes the pattern passed to it .
5.5 Repetition and Optional Patterns
Repetition and optional patterns are the things usually denoted by " + " , " * " and " ? " in " regex " pattern syntax .
In this implementation , those operators are n't available , so an alternative is used :
pattern [ count ]
Matches the given pattern " count " times .
" count " can be zero or more .
The pattern fails if the pattern matches less than " count " times .
pattern [ count1:count2 ]
Matches the given pattern at least " count1 " times , and no more than " count2 " .
The pattern fails if the pattern matches less than " count1 " times .
It does not attempt to match more than " count2 " times .
Either " count1 " or " count2 " can be omitted .
If " count1 " is omitted it defaults to zero .
If " count2 " is omitted , it defaults to unlimited -- it 'll match as many as their are .
Some common useful combinations are the following :
pattern [ 0 : ] # zero or more pattern [ :] # also zero or more pattern [ 1 : ] # one or more pattern [ 0:1 ] # zero or one -- i.e. optional pattern [ : 1 ] # also zero or one
There are function forms , here shown with their equivalent operator forms :
RepP ( pattern ) # pattern [ :]
RepP ( pattern , count ) # pattern [ count : ]
RepP ( pattern , count1 , count2 ) # pattern [ count1 :count2 ]
PlusP ( pattern ) # pattern [ 1 : ]
OptP ( pattern ) # pattern [ 0:1 ] NOfP ( pattern , count ) # pattern [ count ]
In the backtracking implementation each of these patterns by default attempt matching with the largest number of repetitions first , and then back down if that attempt does n't produce a successful match -- it backs down until it results in a successful match or until the minimum count is reached , after which it fails .
This behaviour can be reversed .
Where a range of itterations is specified ( i.e. where a colon is used ) there 's an additional option : as a third argument you can specify a single character string containing " s " ( or upper - case " S " ) which indicates that the smallest number of repetitions should be tried first , and then incremented until it results in a successful match or until the maximum count is reached .
For example , the following means start with zero repetitions and if that does n't work , try again with one , etc. :
pattern [ : : " s " ]
For the non-backtracking implementation the " s " option is interpreted as follows :
If " s " is not specified , find the largest number of repetitions that matches and use that .
If doing so causes a failure later on , do n't attempt any alternatives .
If " s " is specfied , only attempt the smallest number of allowed repetitions .
It 's effectively equivalent to saying : use the lower bound as the upper bound value as well .
5.6 Pattern Functions
5.6.1 Is Pattern
Match if " string " is the next thing in the input .
IsP ( string )
5.6.2 AnyOf Pattern
Match if the next input token ( character ) is one of those in " charset " .
" charset " must be a string .
To match any character , use MoveP ( 1 ) .
AnyOfP ( charset )
5.6.3 NoneOf Pattern
Match only if the next input token ( character ) is none of those in " charset " .
NoneOfP ( charset )
5.6.4 Pos Pattern
Match only if the current input position is that specified .
" position " must be an integer value .
At the beginning of matching the input position is zero , and is incremented for each input token matched .
PosP ( position )
If the value of " position " is a negative number , then match if the current position is the length of the input plus the position .
In general , PosP ( position ) with a negative position is equivalent to :
TestP ( Move (- ( position + 1 ) ) & AtTheEndP ( ) )
It might help to note that PosP ( - 1 ) is equivalent to AtTheEndP ( ) .
5.6.5 Unordered Pattern
Match if the given patterns match in any order .
UnorderedP is similar to AndP , but AndP requires that the patterns be matched in the order given .
UnorderedP can have zero or more arguments .
With no arguments , like AndP , it always succeeds .
UnorderedP ( pattern , pattern , ...)
5.6.6 AtTheEnd Pattern
Match only if there is no more input .
AtTheEndP ()
5.6.7 Move Pattern
Match the given number of input tokens .
" number " must be an integer .
Match fails if there are not the given number of input tokens left in the input .
Without an argument , MoveP matches one input token .
MoveP ( number )
5.6.8 Bal Pattern
Match as much of the input as is properly nested with respect to the given delimiters .
" delimiters " must be a string .
Each pair of characters is taken to be an opening / closing pair .
So , for example , BalP ( " ( ) [ ] {} " ) matches input balanced with respect to " ( " / " ) " , " [ " / " ] " and " { " / " } " pairs .
BalP ( delimiters )
5.6.9 Longest Pattern
Match pattern but if it yields more than one alternative match , use only the longest one yielded : the one that consumes the most input .
LongestP ( pattern )
LongestP only makes sense in for the backtracking implementation .
For the non-backtracking implementation there is only one alternative ever matched ( or none ) , so LongestP just invokes the pattern passed to it .
5.6.10 Another Pattern
Match another instance of what was previously matched and set to the dictionary entry " string " .
In other words , match " IsP ( subject [ string ] ) " , but delay the access of the dictionary entry until the actual AnotherP match is attempted .
If there is no dictionary entry with the key " string " , then the match fails .
AnotherP ( string )
5.6.11 ClearSet Pattern
Clear the matching input 's dictionary :
If no argument is given , remove all entries .
If one or more arguments are given , clear only those entries whose keys are specified .
If there 's no dictionary entry with a given key , just ignore it .
ClearSetP ( string , ...)
ClearSetP always succeeds and consumes no input .
The ClearSetP pattern is equivalent to using the .
ClearSets method of a matchingt input .
It 's provided to allow clearing to be done during pattern matching .
5.6.12 StartOf Pattern
Match if and only if the next input token is one of those in the " charset " , and either it 's the first token in the input , or the previous token is not in the " charset " .
For example : " StartOfP ( string.uppercase ) " matches at the start of a string of uppercase letters .
StartOfP ( charset )
5.6.13 EndOf Pattern
Match if and only if the previous input token is one of those in the " charset " , and either it 's the last token in the input , or the next token is not in the " charset " .
For example : " EndOfP ( string.uppercase ) " matches at the end of a string of uppercase letters .
EndOfP ( charset )
5.6.14 Succeed Pattern
Cause the pattern as a whole to succeed without matching any more input .
No matter where SucceedP appears in a pattern , it ends the matching by that pattern .
SucceedP ()
5.6.15 Fail Pattern
Cause the pattern as a whole to fail without attempting to match any more input .
No matter where FailP appears in a pattern , it ends the matching by that pattern .
FailP ()
5.6.16 Fence Pattern
Successfully match without consuming any input , but if an alternative is asked for , cause the pattern as a whole to fail .
In the non-backtracking implementation , alternative attempts are not tried , so all this function does is succeed , not consuming any input .
FenceP ()
5.6.17 Yes Pattern
Match without consuming any input .
Equivalent to AndP ( ) .
YesP ()
5.6.18 No Pattern
Fail to match .
Equivalent to OrP ( ) .
NoP ()
YesP and NoP are handy as default values of pattern variables .
5.7 Operator Precedence
The Python operators used in this implementation have different precedences .
For example , " & " binds more tightly than does " | " but less tightly than " + " or " - " .
Precedence affects how expressions are written , especially with respect to when parenthesization is needed , so here 's a quick outline of the precedence levels of these operators ( taken from the Python 2.3.3 Language Reference ) , with the least tightly binding first and the most tightly last :
| ^ & >> + - ( infix ) + - ( prefix ) [...] ( repetition )
An important consideration is that " | " is the only thing that binds more loosely than the match operator ( " ^ " ) .
Parenthesization is generally not required within a pattern on the right - hand of a " ^ " if it does n't contain " | " and does n't need parenthesization for other reasons .
6. Pattern Matching Text
The patterns and facilities defined earlier are not text - specific -- they can be applied to any kind of input stream .
They work just fine for text - specific pattern matching , but it helps to have a few extra facilities when working with text .
To support this additional functionality , there 's an extra module ( textpatterns_nb.py or textpatterns_b.py ) that implements the following patterns :
6.1 Letter Pattern
Match a single letter .
LetterP ()
6.2 Digit Pattern
Match a single digit .
DigitP ()
6.3 LineText Pattern
Match a single character so long as it's not a new - line character ( LF or CR ) .
LineTextP ()
6.4 Whitespace Pattern
Match a single whitespace character .
WhitespaceP ()
6.5 Range Pattern
Match a single character with a value no less than that of " lowbound " and no more than " highbound " .
" lowbound " and " highbound " should be single characters ( or other comparable values if the matching input is other than characters ) .
RangeP ( lowbound , highbound , excluding )
The third argument , " excluding " , is optional .
If specified it should be a string of characters .
If the single character otherwise matched by RangeP is one of the " excluding " characters , then RangeP fails to match .
Use of the third argument is effectively shorthand for :
RangeP ( lowbound , highbound ) - AnyOfP ( excluding )
6.6 Nocase Pattern
Match the string " text " ( like the pattern IsP ) but ignore the case of the text .
In other words , match if it 's the same in uppercase or lowercase .
The matched text does n't have to be all uppercase or lowercase , each character is compared separately .
NocaseP ( text )
7. Defining Your Own Patterns
It 's easy enough to assign a pattern to a name .
For example :
HexDigit = AnyOfP ( string.hexdigits )
To define your own pattern creation function only requires writing a function that returns a pattern :
def HexDigitP ( ) : return AnyOfP ( string.hexdigits )
You may need to add your own logic to a pattern returning function .
In fact the best way to do it is to define a pattern object .
A bit of work is required to define your own pattern object .
However , all the definitions are quite small , so it 's not as difficult as it might look to start with .
7.1 More on Matching Inputs
To help in defining matching inputs have methods and attributes in addition to those described earlier :
. Buffer
A buffer in which the matching input holds the input that has been read already .
It is guarranteed that there will be at least one character prior to the current input position -- allowing one - look - back matches to be done .
7.1.1 MatchingInput .
Offset
The count from the beginning of the input of the first token in .
Buffer .
. Offset
7.1.2 MatchingInput .
Pos
The current position in the input buffer , counting from the start of the input .
. Pos
The next input token ( of a matching input called " subject " ) is therefore at location : " subject .
Buffer [ subject .
Pos - subject .
Offset ] " .
7.1.3 MatchingInput .
GetText
Ensure that there are at least " count " more input tokens ( characters ) available .
.
GetText returns the " count " characters made available .
If the end of the input is reached , and there are less than " count " more characters in the input , then only those available are returned .
. GetText ( count )
7.1.4 MatchingInput .
AtTheEnd
Return
True if there are no more input characters --
False if there are .
.
AtTheEnd may read more input to be sure whether or not there are more input characters .
. AtTheEnd ()
7.2 Implementing for Non-Backtracking Patterns
So equiped with these facilities , here 's the non-backtracking definition of a slightly complex pattern -- it 's the implementation of the StartOfP pattern defined as part of the accompanying implementation :
class StartOfP ( Pattern ) : def Match ( self , subject ) : return not subject .
AtTheEnd and \ subject .
Buffer [ subject .
Pos - subject .
Offset ] in self .
charset and \ ( subject .
Pos == 0 or \ subject .
Buffer [ subject .
Pos - subject .
Offset - 1 ] not in self .
charset ) def __init__ ( self , charset ) : self .
charset = charset
The parts of the definition are :
A class definition that declares the class to be a subclass of the class Pattern .
An .__init__ method that accepts the arguments required to create the pattern .
In this case it 's just the set of characters that signify the start of what 's to be started .
A . Match method that takes a matching input as its argument and returns True or False depending on whether it matches .
In this instance , the .
Match method examines the characters both before and at the current position in the input and ensures :
that either the current character is the first in the input or that the previous character is not in the given character set , and
that there is at least one more input characters , and that it is in the given character set .
That pretty well covers it .
7.3 Implementing Backtracking Patterns
The above implementation of StartOfP works with the non-backtracking implementation but needs modification to work with the backtracking implementation .
The big difference between the two is that the backtracking implementation uses Python 's generator functionality .
Here 's the backtracking StartOfP :
class StartOfP ( Pattern ) : def Match ( self , subject ) : if not subject .
AtTheEnd and \ subject .
Buffer [ subject .
Pos - subject .
Offset ] in self .
charset and \ ( subject .
Pos == 0 or \ subject .
Buffer [ subject .
Pos - subject .
Offset - 1 ] \ not in self .
charset ) : yield None def __init__ ( self , charset ) : self .
charset = charset
The class definition and the object creation ( .__init__ ) is the same , as is the condition in the " if " statement .
The difference is how the .
Match method returns its value .
Instead of returning a True / False value , .
Match must " yield " for each successful result .
This makes it a Python " generator " .
When it returns , it signals the end of the sequence of what it 's yielding .
In the case of this StartOfP , . Match yields once , on success , and not at all , on failure .
The yield statement does n't actually yield a value .
Just the fact that it yields is sufficient to indicate a successful match .
( None is yielded to satisfy Python 's syntactic requirements . )
The change in value of the .
Pos property of the matching input delimits what input data has been matched .
Patterns such as OrP can yield a success more than once if , for example , both alternatives of the OrP succeed .
Again that 's it .
8. Pattern Matching On Other Than Text
The dynamic nature of Python 's type system means that there 's no reason for pattern matching to be limited to input streams of characters .
All of the above patterns can be applied to a stream of any type .
In particular :
The argument of MatchingInput can be a string , a Unicode string , or any object with a .read method that returns a list of input tokens .
Where " charset " or " delimiters " appears as an argument of a pattern , it can be a string , a Unicode string , or a list of tokens of any type .
Where " character " is used in a pattern 's description , it can be a string character , a Unicode character , or any token of any type .
Two interesting non-text possibilities for pattern matching are :
Processing streams of parsed XML tokens .
Processing streams of lexical token of a programming or other specification language , in the manner of the venerable " yacc " Unix utility .
But that 's another story .
9. Implementation Considerations
The implementation that accompanies this paper can readily be ported to other programming languages .
Python is a convenient first target because of the flexibility of its dynamic type system and a few other useful implementation tools .
In any language , the particularities of that language will determine in large part just how the implementation and its user - level interface will look , so what operators are used and how they fit together will change from language to language .
The requirements on any language for implementing an Icon - like pattern matching facility are the following :
There must be some form of persistent data value , either using objects as in this Python implementation , or using " closures " .
Here 's a closure - based implementation of the " StartOfP " pattern : def StartOfP ( charset ) : def Match ( subject ) : return not subject .
AtTheEnd and \ subject .
Buffer [ subject .
Pos - subject .
Offset ] in self .
charset and \ ( subject .
Pos == 0 or \ subject .
Buffer [ subject .
Pos - subject .
Offset - 1 ] not in self .
charset ) return Match
The difference from the object - based implementation is that now " StartOfP " is a function that returns another function , that the persistence of the " charset " argument to " StartOfP " is used to make it available when the Match function that is returned is called at a later time , and that there 's no more of that " self " object - oriented stuff going on .
For infix and prefix operators ( and in some languages suffix operators ) to be defined , there needs to be some form of user - defined operator overloading .
In Python there 's a somewhat limited set of operators that can be user - defined , and they can only be defined on user - defined object types ( classes ) .
So in this implementation , objects were used .
Persistence is also required for implementing matching input , but objects do that job nicely , holding a buffer and having properties that manipulate the buffer .
What would make things even nicer are the following :
A static type system , so that appropriate pattern matching operators could be defined on other than pattern values .
For example , the " IsP " pattern is irritating .
It would be nice to have a prefix operator that would do the job .
The Icon language uses " = " as a prefix operator for text matching .
A more general operator definition facility would be nice , so that operators more appropriate to pattern matching could be defined .
For example , instead of " ^ " for feeding a matching input to a pattern , a named infix operator " matches " would be more expressive , as in : if subject matches = " < " & nameP & = " > " :
The existing overloadings of the basic arithmetic operators " + " and " * " make it more difficult to use in other additional ways .
Their definitions were n't bad in the original Python language , but as the language has grown in use and in the range of its applications , early decisions such as this become less and less appropriate .
This is a phenomenon not unique to Python , but is an indication that the time is coming when it would be best to conceive of a successor to the Python language .
A static type - based operator overloading would help .
This is needed so that user - defined operators could be defined directly on types other than objects .
10 . Where To Get It
The package is available as a ZIP file : patternmatching .zip .
It includes :
patternmatching .html : this document .
PatternMatchingInPython.txt : this document as a text file .
patterns_nb.py : the non-backtracking implementation .
patterns_b.py : the backtracking implementation .
The backtracking implementation seems to run about 50 % slower than the non-backtracking implementation .
So given that , and that the non-backtracking implementation is easier to understand , it 's best to use the non-backtracking implementation when it does the job , and this backtracking one when its additional functionality is required .
textpatterns_nb.py : a non-backtracking implementation of text - specific patterns .
textpatterns_b.py : a backtracking implementation of text - specific patterns .
MatchingInput.py : the implementation of the MatchingInput class .
patternusers_nb.py : the non-backtracking version of a collection of useful functions that use patterns in their implementation .
The file describes the use of its functions , and their definitions should be short enough to explain where the documentation falls short .
patternusers_b.py : the backtracking version of the same .
text2html.py : an example of using the implementation .
This program was used to convert the text version of this document to HTML .
It uses the patterns_nb .py pattern module , but can equally use the patterns_b.py module .
In the " example1 " folder there 's another example of using the pattern matching facilities :
makeslides.py :
This program converts a text file into a set of slides using a template HTML file .
makeslides.txt and template . html : Input to the example .
slides.css and bullet.gif : Material used by the resulting " slides " .
11 . Updates
The following changes have been made since the original posting of this material :
18 August 2004 :
The lastMatch function has been added .
The str function has been added for the MatchingInput type .
A bit of reorganization has been done -- subsections have been added for each operator and function -- to make things easier to find .

Parents could be able to request information about paedophiles
Home Secretary
The treatment involving libido - reducing drugs or anti-depressants would be taken on a voluntary basis .
Parents will also be able to ask for checks on whether new partners or people dealing with their children are known sex offenders .
It would be an offence to disclose the information to others .
Sarah's Law
Convicted paedophiles will also be subjected to lie detector tests if there is a suspicion they are targeting children .
Some of them [ sex offenders ] are desperately struggling with what 's going on in their lives , and want help to be stopped
Donald Findlater , Lucy Faithfull Foundation Dr Donald Findlater
Dealing with paedophiles Can drugs help offenders ?
Home Secretary John Reid said he was introducing 20 measures aimed at strengthening the way child sex offenders were dealt with .
He said the law was being updated to allow parents and guardians who had a relationship with someone who had unsupervised access to their children to register concerns about their child 's safety with the police .
If that person was a convicted sex offender , the presumption would be that the parent or guardian should be informed , said Mr Reid .
SEX OFFENDERS CLAMPDOWN
Greater use of drugs to reduce sex drive Parents ' right to know background of new partners Extension of satellite tracking Pilot studies of compulsory lie - detector tests Requiring offenders to provide passport , e-mail and internet details £ 150,000 public awareness campaign
Woman tells how son was victim
The scheme will be piloted in three areas , at a cost of £ 2 m , as soon as legislation can be introduced - from around April 2008 .
Mr Reid said allowing everyone to have access to information about sex offenders could drive paedophiles underground .
At the moment , employers can request a Criminal Records Bureau ( CRB ) check if a potential employee is going to work with children , while private citizens cannot .
Some of the most persistent sex offenders are already offered drug treatment , but the Home Office says this provision could be increased .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Any measure that reduces the risk of children being abused is welcome
The Pulse
Send us your comments
Mr Reid said more sex offenders would be offered drug treatment on a voluntary basis as part of a £ 1.2 m package of improvements to treatment and supervision .
Lie-detector tests
Offenders will have to provide more information including their e-mail , internet and passport details to the authorities as well as informing them if they begin a new relationship with a single parent .
And the Home Office will also introduce trials of compulsory lie -detector tests in the supervision of offenders .
David Davis , the shadow home secretary , questioned how the government would ensure that information passed to parents would remain private .
He also suggested that voluntary drug treatment was ineffective .
" The headlines today are about chemical castration .
The reality is that while a voluntary scheme may be useful in some cases , it will not deal with the worst offenders who do not wish to conform , " said Mr Davis .
He also complained that a national computer system , which was promised by the government in 2004 after the inquiry into the deaths of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman , had been delayed until 2010 or 2011 .
Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesman , said he broadly welcomed the proposals as long as they could be made to work in practice .
' No honour '
Dr Donald Findlater , director of research and development at the child protection charity the Lucy Faithfull Foundation , said : " I think we have this notion that all sex offenders want to do bad things all the time .
Some of them are desperately struggling with what 's going on in their lives , and want help to be stopped .
" Some of them have been very enthusiastic about participating in lie - detector tests , and indeed would happily take pills if that will help . "
Sara Payne , whose daughter Sarah was murdered by paedophile Roy Whiting seven years ago , welcomed plans to share information on sex offenders with parents but told the BBC that drug treatment should be compulsory .
" You 're placing an honour based system on people that have already shown they have absolutely no honour .
The murder of Sarah Payne in 2000 prompted calls for new laws
" These are people that rape , molest our children , take photographs of what they 're doing .
" They 've already shown that they are the nastiest , I think the nastiest , people in the world because of what they do to children . "
The US law , known as Megan 's Law , named after Megan Kanka , seven , who was killed by a convicted sex offender , gives parents access to names and addresses of known paedophiles .
A campaign to launch a " Sarah 's Law " - a UK version of the legislation - was launched after Sarah Payne 's murder in 2000 .
CHILD SEX OFFENCES 2005 - 6 Males under 13 sexually assaulted : 1,394 Females under 13 sexually assaulted : 4,645 Females under 16 raped : 3,152 Females under 13 raped : 1,389 Males under 16 raped : 292 Males under 13 raped : 363 Gross indecency with a child : 127 Source : Home Office
Children 's charity NSPCC said it was pleased there would be no Sarah 's Law because it could drive paedophiles underground .
But Steve Bevan , from Survivors Swindon , which helps men who have been sexually abused , said people had a right to know where sex offenders were living .
Harry Fletcher , assistant general secretary of probation union Napo , said Mr Reid 's move to give parents information about sex offenders sounded " like a sop to certain tabloid papers " .
" The information is not a commodity ; it is highly sensitive and must be kept confidential , " said Mr Fletcher .
A £ 150,000 publicity campaign has also been promised by the government to remind people that 90 % of child sex abuse is carried out by someone known to the family .
Perspective from here and over there .
Women and Fear of Violence
Forget fearing old age , it seems as women grow older those on lower incomes are more likely to fear the threat of violence , a Queensland University of Technology nationwide study has found .
The Australian Active Ageing ( Triple A ) Study has shown women need and want to protect themselves against violence as they get older .
QUT Associate Professor Jan Lovie - Kitchin , from the Faculty of Health , said the study looked at older women 's perceptions of vulnerability and their expressed need to learn to protect themselves against violence .
The findings coincide with the International Week Without Violence ( October 25 - 31 ) and the national Reclaim the Night women 's march ( October 27 ) .
" It is clear that as women grow into the older years , they experience increased feelings of vulnerability , " Professor Lovie - Kitchin said .
" They need information and want opportunities to learn about ways to protect themselves against violence . "
Professor Lovie - Kitchin said being able to live free of fear and with the confidence to participate in social life beyond the home was an important part of improving the quality of life for older women .

" Fear of violence needs to be recognised as a barrier to older people 's social connectedness and the health and wellbeing of older women specifically . "
Professor Lovie - Kitchin said women on lower incomes reported feeling vulnerable when managing their money , accessing transport , and ensuring their homes were safe and secure .
" Older women might experience feelings of exposure to danger because of their smaller size and lesser strength , " she said .
" But they could also feel vulnerable because of their limited finances and lack of knowledge which might force them to depend on people they do n't necessarily trust .
She said some ideas to alleviate women 's perceptions of risk and fears of violence included providing education and information about money management , access to safe transport , and assistance with home security and safety . "
" There also needs to be recognition of the influence of media in generating feelings of exposure to danger due to age , " she said .
" Sensationalised crimes in the media are often the only form of contact with the outside environment for many older and isolated people , and can heighten their sense of defencelessness .
" While the media may negatively impact on older women 's perceptions of violence , it also has the capacity to educate and inform about protective measures for older women . "
The Triple A Study , which is being undertaken in collaboration with the National Seniors , involved 2620 adults aged 50 years and over , and looked at how different elements of a person 's life contribute to active ageing .

Robert Mugabe aims to give more ownership to indigenous people
The country , once the bread - basket of the region , is suffering crippling food shortages and rampant inflation .
Mr Mugabe blamed droughts and sanctions for their economic woes and said they faced continued hostility from the UK and her Western allies .
A bill to nationalise foreign firms , including banks and mines , is planned .
The parliamentary session is the last ahead of elections due by March 2008 .
President Mugabe said the government had been forced to intervene with price controls last month after an " astronomical " rise in the price of basic goods , and would remain committed to them to try and stabilise the economy .
Inflation is approaching 5,000 % and shops in Zimbabwe are running out of the most basic commodities .
" Our economy continues to face challenges arising from the illegal sanctions imposed by our enemies , " he told MPs .
All this had led to shortages of foreign currency , as well as erratic energy supplies , he said .
New measures
On Monday , the former head of the United Nations , Kofi Annan , spoke of a downward spiral of events in Zimbabwe , which he said was " intolerable and unsustainable " .
ZIMBABWE CRISIS
Inflation : approaching 5,000 % Unemployment : 80 % 4 m need food aid Life expectancy : 37 ( men ) , 34 ( women )
Mobiles to beat fuel queues
Economic refugees are arriving in neighbouring states like South Africa at a rate of around 3,000 a day .
Talks between the ruling Zanu - PF and the opposition MDC to find a political solution appear to have stalled , our reporter says .
The MDC wants a new constitution , but the only amendment on the parliamentary agenda could extend the president 's term to 2010 .
The constitutional bill will seek to combine parliamentary and presidential elections and a clause will also give MPs power to elect a new president if a vacancy occurs between elections .
The proposed empowerment bill stipulates that no company restructuring , merger or acquisition can be approved unless 51 % of the firm goes to indigenous Zimbabweans .
It says " indigenous Zimbabwean " is anyone disadvantaged by unfair discrimination on race grounds before independence in 1980 .
Tendai Biti , secretary general of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , says that Zimbabweans have become wary about nationalisation .
" Zanu - PF took 11 m hectares of land from members of the white community , but what did they do with it ?
" They distributed it among themselves , so the land reform programme became a vehicle for personal aggrandisement .
So everyone in Zimbabwe is sceptical , " he told the BBC's Network Africa programme .
Some firms dually listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange and London Securities Exchange include Old Mutual , NMB bank and Hwange .
Multi-national firms that may be affected by the new policy include Barclays Bank , Bindura Nickel Corporation and mining company Rio Zim .

I found this article by Hal Varian , and a sentence at the end caught my attention .
It says that although the Chinese only add 1 % of the iPod 's value , each unit exported to the US contributes about $ 150 to the bilateral deficit .
This left me wondering : could bilateral trade numbers , namely the US deficit with China , be a fiction ?
A reader asks :
No , the bilateral trade deficit is not a fiction , but it is a rather meaningless statistic .
Here is what I say about the topic in my intermediate macroeconomics textbook ( this section is new in the 6th edition ) :
The trade balance we have been discussing measures the difference between a nation ’s exports and its imports with the rest of the world .
Sometimes you might hear in the media a report on a nation ’s trade balance with a specific other nation .
This called a bilateral trade balance .
For example , the U.S. bilateral trade balance with China equals exports that the United States sells to China minus imports that the United States buys from China .
The overall trade balance is , as we have seen , inextricably linked to a nation ’s saving and investment .
That is not true of a bilateral trade balance .
Indeed , a nation can have large trade deficits and surpluses with specific trading partners , while having balanced trade overall .
For example , suppose the world has three countries : the United States , China , and Australia .
The United States sells $ 100 billion in machine tools to Australia , Australia sells $ 100 billion in wheat to China , and China sells $ 100 billion in toys to the United States .
In this case , the United States has a bilateral trade deficit with China , China has a bilateral trade deficit with Australia , and Australia has a bilateral trade deficit with the United States .
But each of the three nations has balanced trade overall , exporting and importing $ 100 billion in goods .
Bilateral trade deficits receive more attention in the political arena than they deserve .
This is in part because international relations are conducted country to country , so politicians and diplomats are naturally drawn to statistics measuring county - to - country economic transactions .
Most economists , however , believe that bilateral trade balances are not very meaningful .
From a macroeconomic standpoint , it is a nation ’s trade balance with all foreign nations put together that matters .
The same lesson applies to individuals as it does to nations .
Your own personal trade balance is the difference between your income and your spending , and you may be concerned if these two variables are out of line .
But you should not be concerned with the difference between your income and spending with a particular person or firm .
Economist Robert Solow once explained the irrelevance of bilateral trade balances as follows : " I have a chronic deficit with my barber , who does n't buy a darned thing from me . ”
But that does n’t stop Mr. Solow from living within his means , or getting a haircut when he needs it .

BEYOND the suburbs of science dwell all manner of amateur inventors , would - be Einsteins , saviours of the planet and other well - meaning crackpots .
The one thing they invariably share is a fascination with science and a less than rigorous grounding in its fundamentals .
A good number seem bent on bequeathing some marvel of engineering that can generate an endless supply of free energy — in short , a perpetual - motion machine .
Nowadays the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) refuses to review a perpetual - motion machine unless it is accompanied by a working prototype .
In the past too many inventors had used patents to convince gullible investors that their machines had been “ officially approved ” by no less an authority than the USPTO .
Other such tinkerers are sincere and often genuinely puzzled by the way their devices appear to work .
As a rule , however , there 's a belief that , somehow , the laws of physics do not apply to their particular contraption .
A year ago an Irish company called Steorn captured headlines around the world after running a whole - page advert in The Economist , claiming to have developed a machine that generated free energy .
Recently Steorn 's founder , Sean McCarthy , offered to demonstrate the device to the public .
A ten - day event , starting on July 6th , was to be held at the Kinetica Museum in London .
At the last minute , however , the demonstration was cancelled , owing to a technical defect caused ( ostensibly ) by heat from the lights used to illuminate the machine for the cameras .
A new demonstration has yet to be scheduled .
The device , called “ Orbo ” , is said to comprise a rotor , with powerful magnets around its outer surface , which spins within a casing that has magnets on its inner surface .
Mr McCarthy admits that , if Orbo really works , then it must defy the law of conservation of energy .
This law , one of the cornerstones of science , says that energy can neither be created nor destroyed , but merely changed from one form into another — from , say , heat into light , sound or motion .
Many would - be builders of perpetual - motion machines see scientific laws , like the conservation of energy , as mere dogma waiting to be overthrown by radical freethinkers .
But science had its reformation centuries ago .
A select number of its indisputable axioms have been designated as laws .
These are not man -made rules or opinions , but universal truths prised loose from nature by painstaking observation and experiment , and hammered on the anvil of experience by repeated testing .
As such , they have survived every challenge thrown at them over the centuries .
Magnets , yes .
Perpetual motion , no .
None more so than the first and second laws of thermodynamics : the science of machines and the physical processes associated with them .
There are actually four laws of thermodynamics .
For our purposes , the zeroth and the third laws are of more academic than practical interest .
Understanding how the first and second laws operate is important because they underpin so much of our everyday world , and allow us to suss out quickly what 's hocus and what 's not .
The first law of thermodynamics — essentially a restatement of the conservation of energy — deals with energy , work and heat .
A machine needs energy to work or else it just sits there doing nothing .
If it is to be useful , it can do one of two things with the energy put into it : perform work or generate waste heat — or , in the real world , a bit of both .
That means the energy input has to equal the output of work and waste heat .
In short , the energy of the total system is conserved .
The second law of thermodynamics is more subtle still .
It is built around the concept of entropy — a measure , if you will , of how energy gets dispersed .
It can be thought of as nature 's instinctive tendency towards disorder .
In other words , it defines the irreversibility of processes involving heat and energy .
Thus , according to the second law , a process can occur only if it increases the total amount of entropy involved .
It also means that heat cannot flow from something that 's cold to something that 's hot — that is to say , heat flows only along an irreversible one - way street .
Most crucially , the second law makes it clear that heat cannot be converted completely into work .
Some of the thermal energy has to be passed on to something at a lower temperature .
The implication is that any device that needs energy to work can never be 100 % efficient .
By their very definition , perpetual - motion machines are required to be at least 100 % efficient .
Thus , to continue running indefinitely , they violate either the first law ( by promising something for nothing instead of merely conserving energy ) or the second law ( by implying that they convert all their energy into work ) .
And that 's nonsense .
Remember : the first law says the best you can do is break even , while the second law adds , forget it , you can't even do that !
Keep those two principles in mind , and you 'll never go far wrong .
This column is written for mainstream , nontechie users of digital technology .
These folks are n't necessarily novices , and they are n't afraid of computers .
They also are n't stupid .
They simply want their digital products to operate as promised , with as little maintenance and hassle as possible .
So , I have steered away from recommending Linux , the free computer operating system that is the darling of many techies and IT managers , and a challenger to Microsoft 's dominant Windows and Apple 's resurgent Macintosh operating system , ...

Civilian compensation claims : a glimpse into US crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan
By Peter Symonds
14 April 2007
Hundreds of legal claims filed by civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan against the US military , which were released by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) on Wednesday , provide a small glimpse into the tragedies inflicted by US occupying forces in these two countries .
While the activities of suicide bombers and death squads feature prominently in the US and international media , the death and destruction wrought by the daily activities of US troops is virtually blacked out .
As ACLU executive director Anthony Romero explained in a press release : “ Since US troops first set foot in Afghanistan in 2001 , the Defense Department has gone to unprecedented lengths to control and suppress information about the human costs of war . ”
The Pentagon only released details of the compensation claims after the ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act request in June 2006 .
The 496 cases — 479 from Iraq and 17 from Afghanistan — cover just a tiny fraction of the civilian casualties caused by US forces .
Most victims and their families are either too terrified or do not know how to file claims , which , in any event , only cover “ non-combat ” incidents and must be submitted in English .
After analysing the data , the ACLU concluded , “ there are additional documents being withheld ” .
It “ is pressing the Defense Department to disclose them all ” .
Over a third of the submitted claims — 198 — were denied on the grounds of “ combat exclusion ” — that the incident arose “ from action by an enemy or resulted directly or indirectly from an act of the armed forces of the United States in combat ” .
Others were rejected for “ lack of evidence ” or “ lack of proof of US involvement ” .
In addition , about 10 percent were rejected on the basis that the incidents , including some corroborated by eyewitnesses , had not been reported in the US military ’s own “ SIGACT ” ( significant action ) database .
Of the 496 claims , only 164 resulted in cash payments to surviving family members .
In about half those cases , the US accepted responsibility for the death of a civilian and offered “ a compensation payment ” .
In the remainder , the Pentagon issued “ condolence ” payments — discretionary payments limited to $ US2,500 and offered “ as an expression of sympathy ” but “ without reference to fault ” .
In total , $ 32 million had been handed out in blood money — a derisory sum compared to the immense suffering the US occupations have caused .
The documents ( http://www.aclu.org/natsec/foia/log.html) provide a chilling record of hundreds of civilians — men , women and children — who have been killed or maimed in shootings and bombings , and the devastating impact on their family and friends .
The onus is on the victims to prove their claim .
The legal responses reveal the same callous indifference to Iraqis and Afghans as that displayed by the US forces involved in the incidents .
Many are simply pro forma rejections .
There is no indication of disciplinary action against those responsible for the deaths .
Because of the narrow ambit of the Foreign Claims Act to “ non-combat ” incidents , many files relate to shootings at roadblocks or checkpoints — 92 — or at vehicles that are perceived as “ threatening ” to US convoys — 42 .
On March 27 , 2006 , for example , US troops opened fire on a taxi , killing the driver and leaving a young man unconscious , blind and paralysed .
His father asked for compensation to assist his son ’s wife and small child to survive .
The claim was rejected as being a “ combat incident ” but with no explanation .
It concluded with a standard phrase : “ I am sorry for your son ’s injuries , and I wish you well in a Free Iraq . ”
Virtually any activity is regarded as “ threatening ” .
A 16 - year - old schoolboy was shot dead on February 8 , 2005 while walking near an American base .
A sniper in a watchtower apparently thought the boy ’s school bag looked like a dangerous object .
The claim was dismissed due to “ lack of evidence ” and “ loss resulting from combat operations ” .
On February 13 , 2006 , US soldiers shot dead a fisherman on his boat on the Tigris river .
He had held up his fish and shouted “ Fish , Fish ” to show he meant no harm and was killed as he bent down to turn off the motor .
His cousin was paid $ 3,500 for the boat , which drifted away and was lost , but nothing for the death of his relative , which was judged to arise from “ combat activities ” .
Others have been killed in crossfire between US and insurgent forces .
A father ’s claim for the death of his son , shot at the front door of the house on April 13 , 2005 , was denied for “ combat exemption ” .
Another father ’s claim for the death of his son , an Iraqi soldier returning on leave , in Ad Duluyiah on March 19 , 2006 , was rejected for lack of a corroborating SIGACT report .
The claimant submitted eyewitness accounts , a death certificate and legal opinion .
In another case , a man was paid $ 500 in condolence payments for the death of his brother , shot at the gate of his house during combat activities .
A number of claims relate to random shootings by US soldiers after an incident or roadside bombing .
Seven of the 17 cases in Afghanistan arose out a traffic accident on May 29 , 2006 when a US heavy truck ploughed into several cars in Kabul .
US soldiers fired into an angry crowd that gathered , killing and injuring civilians .
Among those shot dead were a 13 - year - old selling pizzas from a street cart , a student returning from school , and a man carrying parts from a mechanic shop .
Each of the seven claims were settled for between $ US4,000 and $ 7,000 .
In Iraq , shooting bystanders appears to be a common US military response to roadside bombings .
On the January 12 , 2006 , US soldiers fired randomly , killing an 11 - year - old boy , after a roadside bomb detonated next to their convoy near Samarra .
His father , an impoverished farmer , claimed compensation , but was rejected for “ lack of evidence ” and “ combat exclusion ” , although eyewitness statements and a death certificate were provided .
A particularly horrific incident involved the slaughter of a family on March 3 , 2004 in Dibig village .
US troops opened fire on a house , killing four people including the claimant ’s father , mother and brother , and injuring another 40 , including the claimant .
The mother was shot dead while sleeping and the father after he took the family ’s AK - 47 and stepped outside .
US soldiers also killed the family ’s flock of sheep , leaving the claimant without a livelihood .
In a carefully worded finding , the US military declared that the soldiers , “ may have been shooting at another house ” .
While their activity was “ not wrongful ” , it appeared “ to have been conducted negligently ” .
Compensation of $ 11,200 was granted .
The files unearthed by the ACLU are just the tip of the iceberg .
The US - led occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq have created a nightmarish existence for the local population — living in constant fear , even in conducting everyday activities , and confronting appalling social conditions .
In Iraq , the murderous activities of American forces have been compounded by a sectarian civil war between Shiite and Sunni militias , which the US war is directly responsible for inciting .
The Pentagon has systematically suppressed any information about the impact of the war .
It has refused to keep lists of civilian casualties , censors the reports of journalists embedded with its troops , and routinely rejects any evidence of atrocities published in the media .
According to the UN envoy to Iraq , Gianni Magazzeni , some 34,452 people were killed during 2006 .
However , the figure , which is based on data from Iraq ’s health ministry , hospitals and mortuaries , is likely to be an underestimate .
The most comprehensive study was conducted last year by a team of Iraqi physicians under the direction of epidemiologists from Johns Hopkins University using a standard survey method .
The study published in October in the British medical journal , the Lancet , found that the US invasion and occupation of Iraq was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 655,000 Iraqis .
Of those , 31 percent , or 186,000 , were attributed directly to coalition forces — that is , the American military or its allies killed these Iraqis .
The ACLU files start to put a human face to these statistics .
Americans drank more than 23 gallons of bottled water per person in 2004 — about 10 times as much as in 1980 .
We consumed more than twice as much high fructose corn syrup per person as in 1980 and remained the fattest inhabitants of the planet , although Mexicans , Australians , Greeks , New Zealanders and Britons are not too far behind .
At the same time , Americans spent more of their lives than ever — about eight - and - a - half hours a day — watching television , using computers , listening to the radio , going to the movies or reading .
This eclectic portrait of the American people is drawn from the 1,376 tables in the Census Bureau ’s 2007 Statistical Abstract of the United States , the annual feast for number crunchers that is being served up by the federal government today .
For the first time , the abstract quantifies same - sex sexual contacts ( 6 percent of men and 11.2 percent of women say they have had them ) and learning disabilities ( among population groups , American Indians were most likely to have been told that they have them ) .
How do you measure the horror in the Democratic Republic of Congo ?
Add up all of the American deaths in every single war we 've fought in since 1776 , including World War II and the Civil War ( 1,540,665 ) .
Now add to that the estimated deaths from the recent tsunami ( 169,752 confirmed dead , 127,294 missing ) .
Next , add to that the estimated death toll in the conflict in Darfur ( 400,000 ) .
Then , add to that the victims of genocide in Rwanda , one of the most horrific slaughters of the 20th century ( 937,000 ) .
Add all of the deaths together - and you still have a smaller number than the 3.5 million people who have died in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) since 1998 .
According to the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo , 30,000 Congolese are dying every month from the after - effects of war ( mostly from diseases that have flourished in the conflict 's wake ) , an estimated 1,000 people a day .
Thirty - eight percent of the population suffers from malnutrition .
Children as young as 7 have been recruited into rebel militia .
An estimated 3.4 million of the country 's 60 million people have been forced to flee their homes .
By the time you finish reading this article , another 10 people will have died in the DRC 's chaos .
And yet most people in the West are unaware of the magnitude of this crisis , how it happened , or what could be done about it .
The DRC - - a central African country almost the size of Western Europe -- is strategically critical to the continent .
And it is a treasure trove of natural resources the world wants .
The country contains 50 percent of Africa 's forests , and a mighty river system that , if harnessed , could provide hydro- electric power across Africa .
The DRC 's mineral riches include copper , gold , diamonds , and coltan ( an essential component of capacitors that control current flow in cell phone circuit boards ) .
The country 's natural wealth is also the cause of its blood - soaked history .
In the late 19th century , King Leopold of Belgium seized the territory for its vast supplies of rubber , ivory , and gold .
Leopold 's " Congo Free State , " created in 1885 , was one of the most repressive regimes in history .
It is estimated that up to 10 million Congolese lost their lives during his rule .
The era left an indelible imprint of violence on the country .
In 1960 , the country gained its independence from Belgium under populist leader Patrice Lumumba , who became its first and only elected head of state .
But hope for democracy ended when Lumumba was assassinated in 1961 .
The United States was instrumental in putting Joseph Mobutu in power in 1965 .
The dictator renamed himself Mobutu Sese Seko , and the country as Zaire .
Its people invented another word - kleptocracy - to describe their ruler 's ruthless , thieving ways .
After years of guerrilla warfare against Mobutu 's regime , Rwanda - backed rebels captured the capital , Kinshasa , and installed their leader , Laurent Desire Kabila , as president of the again - renamed Democratic Republic of Congo in 1997 .
Kabila promptly split with his former Rwandan supporters , sparking a fresh round of war in which the new DRC government was backed by Angola , Namibia , and Zimbabwe against Rwanda and Uganda .
In 2001 , Kabila was assassinated and his 29 - year - old son Joseph was put in charge .
Throughout the past eight years , neighbors Uganda , Rwanda , Angola , Namibia , and Zimbabwe have all sent armies into the DRC in a grab for power and natural resources .
Uganda 's presence has been especially destructive in the northeastern province of Ituri , where it has armed rival ethnic Hema and Lendu groups , enabling them to slaughter each other with a brutality reminiscent of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .
" The war is , by and large , a story of groups from the outside coming in and creating chaos , " says Peter Rosenblum , who documented human - rights abuses in the country in the 1980s and now teaches law at Columbia University .
But in Ituri , he adds , " the outside forces have succeeded in making the conflict local . "
Of the outside forces , Rwanda has been the most aggressive in recent years .
After the genocide in Rwanda , thousands of Hutus who had murdered their countrymen fled across the border to the DRC .
In 1996 and 1997 , Rwanda invaded the DRC , claiming that the Hutus inside the DRC threatened Rwanda 's security .
But the United Nations has cast doubt on Rwandan president Paul Kagame 's motives , and others are skeptical too .
" It seems Kagame needs [ the Hutus ] there to keep his country under control , " says Bushoki Batabiha , a Congolese civil - society activist who is currently a fellow at the International Peace Academy in New York .
" They 're a good scapegoat that allow him not to deal with poverty , land claims , and other issues in Rwanda .
"
In 2003 , Joseph Kabila struck a peace agreement with former rebels , bringing them in to a transitional , power - sharing government .
But in June 2004 , conflict flared up again when the border town of Bukavu was captured by a former Rwandan rebel leader , Gen. Laurent Nkudu .
And ethnic tensions continue to boil in Ituri province , where the U. N. mission in the DRC ( known by its French acronym , MONUC ) is struggling to pressure armed groups to demobilize .
For ordinary Congolese caught in the crossfire of warring militias and marauding thugs , without the kind of safety net that would come from a stable state , daily life has continued to be a chaotic struggle against violence and disease .
What could the world community have done to prevent this human catastrophe ?
The prevailing wisdom in the international community , as reflected in the United Nations , is that humanitarian intervention and peace - brokering are better approaches to conflict than military intervention .
Both the Clinton and Bush administrations have taken that stance toward the DRC 's conflict .
Still , the United Nations has not been blind to the DRC 's suffering .
U.N. troops have been on the scene since 1999 , when MONUC was set up as a monitoring body to oversee a cease - fire in the ongoing civil war .
MONUC initially had no mandate to protect civilians victimized by the conflict .
But since 2003 , the U.N. has strengthened MONUC 's role in quelling violence and disarming combatants , according to U.N. 's newly adopted doctrine of " robust peacekeeping . "
Even as some critics continue to fault the U.N. force for its relative lack of strength and size , others now have condemned aggressive behavior by U.N. troops , including allegations of sexual abuse of Congolese girls .
African nations have sent mixed signals about Western powers intervening in the DRC or any of the continent 's other conflicts .
On one hand , African leaders denounced the United States failure to act against the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .
On the other hand , most of the DRC 's neighbors have insisted that African nations should take the lead in solving regional problems .
National interests and the desire to reap the bounty of the DRC 's natural resources play a significant role in the hands - off message to the West .
Could the United States now effectively intervene ?
Some observers argue that Washington could use its economic and political clout , threatening to withhold foreign aid to the DRC 's neighbors unless they stop stirring up the violence .
In an atmosphere of relative stability , the international community then could begin to help reconstructure the country 's devastated social , political , and economic institutions .
Speaking to the French foreign press association in May 2003 , the DRC 's human - rights minister , Ntumba Luaba , said that the United States has a moral obligation to become directly involved .
He described Washington 's influence in the region , especially on Uganda and Rwanda , as so great that " the United States could resolve the situation in Congo in a matter of days ....
If the United States feels motivated to intervene in other parts of the world to save human lives , one can well ask why it has remained indifferent to the fate of 4 million people in Congo .
The United States has all the information and justification it needs to exert pressure on Rwanda and Uganda to stop their intervention . "
Luaba went on to criticize the U.S. and France for letting the DRC suffer while Washington and Paris continued to argue over the Iraq invasion , calling his people " victims of the tensions that exist between super and medium powers on the international stage .
" Although the Bush administration has taken no direct action on the DRC crisis , in March State Department officials condemned U.N peacekeepers ' alleged involvement in abuses , sexual exploitation and human trafficking in the country .
The administration 's policy toward the DRC as outlined by the State Department stresses a multilateral , diplomatic approach : " The United States supports the transitional government and encourages peace , prosperity , democracy , and respect for human rights in the D.R.C .
The United States remains a partner with the D.R.C. and other central African nations in their quest for stability and growth on the continent , and facilitated the signing of a tripartite agreement on regional security in the Great Lakes region between the D.R.C. , Rwanda and Uganda in October 2004 The United States also strongly supported U.N. efforts to create a Joint Verification Mechanism to monitor the border between the D.R.C. and Rwanda .
From the start of the Congo crisis , the United States has pursued an active diplomatic strategy in support of these objectives .
In the long term , the United States seeks to strengthen the process of internal reconciliation and democratization within all the states of the region to promote stable , developing , and democratic nations with which it can work to address security interests on the continent and with which it can develop mutually beneficial economic relations .
" Human rights groups charge that the Western powers ' attitude toward the DRC conflict falls into the category of what Salih Booker , executive director of Africa Action , calls " malign neglect . "
Dr. Rick Brennan , health director for the International Rescue Committee , says " The international response to the humanitarian crisis in Congo has been grossly inadequate in proportion to the need , " Dr. Brennan said .
" Our findings show that improving and maintaining security and increasing simple , proven , and cost - effective interventions such as clean water , immunizations , and basic medical care would save hundreds of thousands of lives in Congo .
There 's no shortage of evidence .
It 's sustained compassion and political will that is lacking .
" A scarred country trying to get back on its feet , the DRC has almost countless needs .
After years of war , it 's now at a critical juncture in its history .
The first democratic elections in 44 years are on the horizon ( originally planned for June 2005 , they 've been postponed because the electoral system is not yet in place ) .
With a stable elected government in place , the DRC could attract foreign aid from countries that are too squeamish to put their faith in the current transitional government .
But this is a chicken - and - egg problem : without the faith and support of the international community now , the DRC might not become stable enough to hold valid elections or attract any aid in the future .
During Mobutu 's regime , the Catholic Church played an important role in supporting a growing civil - society movement .
" It required an act of faith to believe that democratic change could come , and church groups tried to create a space where people could be honest about what was happening in the country , " says Rosenblum .
One of the groups that received support from the Catholic Church during that time , La Voix des Sans Voix ( Voice of the Voiceless ) , has become an influential human - rights organization ; other groups are still active too .
" There were Catholic nuns who became galvanized activists for democracy , " says Rosenblum .
Toward the end of the Mobutu era , there was considerable pressure from the international community , including from the Catholic Church , for Mobutu to open up the country to democracy .
Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya , then leader of the Zaire Conference of Bishops , headed a national conference on the nation 's future in 1991 - 92 .
But Rosenblum is quick to point out that " the Catholic church is certainly not angelic in the Congo " - for example , in Ituri , Catholic bishops have stoked conflict by supporting the Hema against the Lendu .
Local Catholic church leaders are likely to play a role in monitoring the election , when it happens .
The head of the electoral commission is a Catholic priest , Abbe Malu Malu , and Catholic lay people are being trained as election monitors .
Elections will probably take place in the first half of 2006 .
In current polls , President Joseph Kabila is running neck and neck with Etienne Tshisekedi , whose reputation rests on the spirited opposition movement he created in the Mobutu era .
Tshisekedi has broad popular support , but most DRC analysts think that he lacks the stature of a transformative leader .
" Had he been Nelson Mandela , all of this could have been solved a long time ago , " says Rosenblum .
Batabiha agrees , saying that while Tshisekedi should be given a chance , " I do n't see a big change coming from him .
" Batabiha and Rosenblum agree that elections alone wo n't solve the country 's problems .
" Whenever Congolese talk about the future , they talk about justice , " says Rosenblum .
" There 's a deep sense within the country that those who have perpetrated the violence have impunity , which needs to be addressed . "
How that will happen is a subject of contention .
The process for some kind of truth commission has been started but , says Rosenblum , is deeply flawed .
" A problem like Ituri needs to be approached on multiple levels .
You need soldiers on the streets , a ceasefire by force , and a way of dealing with justice issues , with mechanisms to put [ justice ] into place .
"
If there 's any hope for a large - scale transformation , it probably comes from two non-government sources : civil society groups and the media .
A free press , started in the waning years of the Mobutu regime , has gathered steam and is now an unstoppable force in the country .
Batabiha points out that in 2004 , eight cabinet ministers were dismissed when the press wrote passionately about their corruption .
" The power of the press is at work in the Congo , " he says .
But if the DRC is to succeed , it might need help from a higher power .
" Western countries ' development is based on a respect for human rights and a belief in the value of human beings - the Bible is the source for a lot of that , " says Batabiha .
" In the DRC , we need a leadership that believes in God . "

Editor of college paper that ran 'f ***'
Bush editorial says he'd run it again
David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Monday September 24 , 2007
Print This Email This
The editorial board of a Colorado State University student newspaper did n't mince words criticizing President Bush following a free speech debate sparked by the recent tasing of a Florida student .
" Taser this FUCK BUSH , " the entirety of a four - word column read in the student - run Rocky Mountain Collegian .
" We felt that maybe four words were more impactful than 250 , " said Dave McSwane , the paper 's editor , in a segment shown on CNN 's American Morning .
The wording of the editorial was agreed upon by the Collegian 's seven - member board .
" Our intentions were n't 'hey let 's really upset the community , " McSwane said .
" Our intentions were let 's get college students talking about freedom of speech . "
Asked by CNN's John Roberts if the wording of the piece could be characterized as vulgar or sophomoric , he said " would n't entirely disagree . "
" Free speech , you know , when you say things like this you do n't expect everyone to agree with it , " the editor added .
" While we understand that the editorial ... is upsetting and offensive to many people , " a statement from Colorado State University read , " CSU is prohibited by law from censoring or regulating the content of its student media publications . "
McSwane has been asked to appear before the university 's Board of Student Communications to defend his job , and says he " absolutely " stands by the piece .
" We wanted people to understand that free speech is something we should talk about , " he said .
" We felt that this campus , for one reason or another , has been really apathetic .
Too quiet .
We felt that the best way to spark that dialogue was to exercise it ourselves . "
The following video is from CNN 's American Morning , broadcast on September 20 .

LUXURY fashion designers are busily putting final touches on the handbags they will present during the spring - summer 2008 women ’s wear shows , which begin next week in New York City ’s Bryant Park .
To understand the importance of the handbag in fashion today consider this : According to consumer surveys conducted by Coach , the average American woman was buying two new handbags a year in 2000 ; by 2004 , it was more than four .
And the average luxury bag retails for 10 to 12 times its production cost .
“ There is a kind of an obsession with bags , ” the designer Miuccia Prada told me .
“ It ’s so easy to make money . ”
Counterfeiters agree .
As soon as a handbag hits big , counterfeiters around the globe churn out fake versions by the thousands .
And they have no trouble selling them .
Shoppers descend on Canal Street in New York , Santee Alley in Los Angeles and flea markets and purse parties around the country to pick up knockoffs for one - tenth the legitimate bag ’s retail cost , then pass them off as real .
“ Judges , prosecutors , defense attorneys shop here , ” a private investigator told me as we toured the counterfeit section of Santee Alley .
“ Affluent people from Newport Beach . ”
According to a study by the British law firm Davenport Lyons , two - thirds of British consumers are “ proud to tell their family and friends ” that they bought fake luxury fashion items .

Actor made major impact in minor roles / ' 06 quake survivor nailed hundreds of film , television parts 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Charles Lane died peacefully Monday night at home in Santa Monica at age 102 , according to his son Tom Lane .
And you really do care , only you just do n't know it .
Never mind that he was born in San Francisco and was one of the last survivors of the 1906 earthquake .
You know Charles Lane .
You just never knew his name .
He was That Guy in all those movies .
You know , that skinny guy with the glasses , the beaky nose and the white hair -- or the dark hair , depending on how far back you go .
Sometimes he was a hotel clerk .
Sometimes a reporter .
He was on the 1960s sitcom " Petticoat Junction " for five years as a cranky railroad official .
As an actor on film and television , he appeared in well over 250 roles , which means that , to avoid ever seeing him over the past 70 years , you would probably have had to avoid film and television completely .
Someone should do a Charles Lane festival .
He made some exceptional movies : " Blonde Crazy " ( 1931 ) , with James Cagney ; " Blessed Event " ( 1932 ) , with Lee Tracy ; " Employees ' Entrance " ( 1933 ) , with Warren William ; the Busby Berkeley musicals " 42nd Street " and " The Gold Diggers of 1933 " ; the renowned screwball comedy " Twentieth Century " ( 1934 ) ; the Capra classics " Mr. Deeds Goes to Town " ( 1936 ) , " Mr. Smith Goes to Washington " ( 1939 ) , " Arsenic and Old Lace " ( 1944 ) and " It 's a Wonderful Life " ( 1946 ) ; " Teacher 's Pet " ( 1958 ) ; " The Music Man " ( 1962 ) ; and " Good Neighbor Sam " ( 1964 ) .
True , he had little to do with what made these films exceptional , and , in fact , for the vast majority of them , Lane received no credit at all .
In the studio days , the guy who played the radio operator ( " Central Airport " ) or the campaign reporter ( " The Farmer 's Daughter " ) was n't identified for audiences .
He was considered part of that studio's furniture .
But credit or no credit , Lane was never furniture , and he was never wallpaper .
He was vivid -- as well as competent and precise .
Give him a job , and he got it done .
Take , for example , his appearance in " The Gold Diggers of 1933 . "
He is in one scene , as a society reporter , but the scene is significant .
For the whole beginning of the film , a mystery is made as to the true background of Dick Powell , who plays a songwriter .
Now at a Broadway opening , Lane spots him , thinks he recognizes him and tells his friends during intermission .
That 's Lane 's whole role , a small one -- but he nails it .
We know , from just a few lines from Lane , that this reporter is smart and tenacious , and that he 's not going to quit until he finds out the truth .
So the next day when we see the screaming newspaper headline , we 're not surprised .
There are two ways for a bit player to screw up .
One way , the forgivable way , is to be inconspicuous .
The other way is to act as though you 're the star of the picture .
Lane did neither .
He simply brought truth to his brief moments on screen .
With Lane , the audience understood that the reporters , clerks , salesmen and managers he played were people in the midst of their own day -- a day that just happened to intersect with the world of the movie .
As such , he had no need to be especially patient or ingratiating .
He was rarely nasty , but he usually seemed busy and impatient .
He had something he was doing , that he wanted to do , and then Gary Cooper or Barbara Stanwyck or somebody had to come over and interrupt him .
Lane was born Charles Levison in San Francisco on Jan. 26 , 1905 .
In the beginning of his career , he kept the name of Levison , but it was n't much of an issue because the name rarely turned up in the credits .
He made his first screen appearance in the 1931 film " Smart Money , " with James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson .
He played a hotel desk clerk .
In those days , film executives assumed that once you did something once , you were an expert at it .
And so Lane played a hotel desk clerk in five of his next six movies .
In the sixth , he was a luggage checkroom clerk at a railway station .
It 's usually at this point in an obituary that the actor 's " big break " is mentioned .
But no .
In his 50s , Lane was still playing the kind of uncredited role he was playing in his 20s , only now -- after 30 years in the business -- the public knew him .
People did n't know his name , but they knew him .
Most actors arrive on the public consciousness with a jolt .
Lane did something rare .
He just oozed into public awareness , until at a certain point it felt as though he 'd always been there .
Lane 's most high - profile work was in television .
He had guest roles on " I Love Lucy " in the 1950s and on a number of shows in the 1960s , including " The Lucy Show , " " Perry Mason , " " The Beverly Hillbillies , " " Gomer Pyle , " " The Twilight Zone , " " The Andy Griffith Show , " " The Munsters , " " Bewitched " and " The Wild Wild West . "
He was a series regular on the sitcom " Petticoat Junction , " as a railroad executive who wants to do away with the town 's beloved locomotive .
He often worked in comedy , though he rarely smiled .
He was usually the relentless , unsympathetic force with whom the hero or heroine had to contend , but there was also something decent and human underneath that hard surface , which was why Lane was most frequently cast in comedy .
Through the 1970s , he worked steadily , appearing on shows such as " Maude , " " Lou Grant " and " Little House on the Prairie . "
He also continued to make movies .
He made his final feature film , " Date With an Angel " in 1987 .
In 1988 , he played Adm. William Standley in the World War II miniseries " War and Remembrance . "
His final screen appearance was in the 1995 TV movie " The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes . "
Not long after he turned 100 , he was honored at the TV Land Awards , where many in the viewing audience were delighted to find out he was still alive .
Given the lifetime achievement award , Lane told the crowd , " I 'm still available . "
Do you work for a business that 's pirating software for its own internal use ?
If so , you could be in for a windfall if you report it to the Business Software Alliance ( BSA ) in time .
The BSA announced today that they are increasing their reward ceiling for accurate piracy reports to a big , fat $ 1,000,000 .
The increased reward amount is a special promotion which will be accompanied by radio and online ad campaigns ; it will expire after October .
After that , the reward returns to its regularly scheduled payload of $ 200,000 .
Why the big bucks ?
The BSA believes that $ 1,000,000 might make even the most timid person don the daring cape of the whistleblower .
" Businesses often have a million excuses for having unlicensed software on office computers .
BSA is now offering up to a million dollars for employees who turn them in , " said Jenny Blank , director of enforcement for BSA , in a statement .
Potential whistleblowers are often quiet for fear that they could not only lose their jobs but also get a reputation as a " snitch , " making it difficult to find employment later .
Now thanks to the BSA , some whistleblowers could trade in their jobs at piratical businesses for varying shots at a big jackpot .
The only catch : you need to be aware of some serious piracy goin ' down to qualify for the big payouts .
BSA 's reward guidelines ( Source : BSA )
The reward one can qualify for is determined by the size of the settlement paid by the company pirating software , or the size of awarded damages in the instance of a dispute heading into court .
To qualify for the $ 1 million , you 'll need a settlement of more than $ 15 million .
The BSA also revealed that since 2005 , when their rewards program was launched , nearly $ 22 million has been generated via settlements with businesses who were accused of pirating software .
Based on that number , we do n't think the BSA has ever paid out anything close to $ 1 million to a single whistleblower before , but the BSA has not returned our queries on this matter .
Nevertheless , with $ 22 million in settlements so far , the BSA is looking for a major boost with this program , since the requisite $ 15 million settlement would nearly double their take to date .
Big rewards for big , scary numbers
According to a study conducted by the International Data Corps ( IDC ) and cited by the BSA , the software industry lost $ 7.3 billion last year to piracy .
We criticized the IDC findings when they were released last year because they are based on questionable calculations and seat - of - your - pants methodologies that desperately try to assign dollar amounts to unknown data points .
IDC has to guess at how much software is pirated , how much would have been purchased had it not been pirated , and what the relationship of legit sales to pirated installations is .
Heck , even IDC has criticized the ways in which their studies are sometimes trumpeted , such as in 2004 , when IDC criticized the BSA 's rush to talk about total losses .
None of that is to say that piracy does n't exist or that it does n't hurt the industry , of course .
We simply lament the fact that trumped - up numbers are being used to sway legislators and public opinion on an issue that is considerably complex .
Oh , and before you nefarious types get any ideas , the BSA requires that reports detail illegal software installs ordered by management , so secretly deploying pirated AutoCAD software across your enterprise desktops on your last day at work wo n't qualify .
This could be the trend after global warming becomes an inevitable reality , or just when the scorching sun is unbearable .

Chinese workers pull trolleys through the streets of Milan
In cities across Italy tension between the Chinese and Italians is high .
The rapid influx of Chinese migrant workers and their dramatic impact on the labour market have caught Italy off guard - particularly in the northern industrial heartland .
Culture clash
Prato , Italy 's main textile manufacturing city , is at the heart of a culture clash which is transforming the way the textile industry operates .
Chinese migrants have been pouring into Prato to work in the city 's thousands of factories , warehouses and sweatshops that supply the cloth and yarns to the Italian fashion industry .
Many of the Chinese here are ' clandestini ' - illegal
Francesco Nannucci , the head of Investigations , Prato Police
Today Prato has the largest Chinese community in the country - about 25,000 people , nearly 15 % of the city 's population .
And the authorities are worried .
" Many of the Chinese here are ' clandestini ' - illegal .
We have big difficulties catching them .
And since they arrived , crime in the city has risen , " says Francesco Nannucci , the head of investigations at the Prato police .
Milan 's Chinatown holds examples of the merging cultures
The police patrol Prato's Chinatown every day - an area full of Chinese shops , services and restaurants .
Nearly all of them have sprung up in the last few years .
On one raid , ten undocumented Chinese workers were discovered in a side - street sweatshop , machine - sewing clothes .
There was a child present , beds , a bathroom and a kitchen .
They slept , cooked , worked and brought up their children in this small warehouse .
Global transformation
Up to a third of Italy 's Chinese immigrants could be illegal .

But it 's not only that fact preoccupying the authorities : it is how they work .
They are transforming the way the textile industry in Italy operates and bringing globalisation to a reluctant Italian market .
In the industrial zones on the edges of Prato , thousands of Chinese are employed in the city 's factories and warehouses - many of them now owned by Chinese bosses .
Most of them come from one city in China , Wenzhou , in the province of Zhejiang , just south of Shanghai - also a textile manufacturing region .
They come to Italy in one of two ways : by being smuggled here by criminal gangs or by arriving as tourists and overstaying their visas .
Many Italians blame them ( the Chinese ) for their economic problems
Marco Romagnoli , Mayor of Prato
Prato - along with Rome , Naples and Milan - are the target cities .
It 's where the work is and where there are established Chinese networks to absorb newcomers .
" My whole family is here : my uncle , aunt , mother , father and sister , " 18 - year - old Cheng explains , standing amongst racks of thousands of T - shirts , skirts , trousers and dresses .
" We work very hard , " he boasts .
" Sometimes day and night ! "
Pronto moda
In the workshop at the back of the warehouse Cheng and his family toil away to produce these clothes in as short a time as possible , as cheaply as possible .
They can undercut the prices - and the wages - of their Italian counterparts .
They may be paid as little as 2 euros an hour ( £ 1.50 ) , and 20 dresses might be produced for only 150 euros wholesale .
The clothes are bought by sellers from all over Italy and the rest of Europe .
Prato has become a main distribution centre for what is called " Pronto Moda " or " fast fashion " .
This is a Chinese invention : ' made in Italy ' goods produced under Chinese conditions .
Prato has also become a centre for the import of cheap clothing from China itself .
Hard times
Over the last decade Italy has suffered some hard economic knocks .
I fear that what happened in Milan could happen here in Prato
Carlo Longo , chairman , Prato Confederation of Industrialists
In Prato one - tenth of its traditional companies have folded and one in ten workers have lost their jobs .
The Mayor of Prato , Marco Romagnoli , is worried .
" The Chinese are such a strong , close - knit community and our two cultures are very different .
Many Italians blame them for economic problems .
And as the Chinese get richer they are buying up large chunks of our textile sector - using their ties with China to become even more powerful . "
Business leaders blame Italy 's high labour costs , the strong euro and weak dollar , for a dramatic drop in exports and productivity .
But they also blame the Chinese migrants flooding into Italy 's factories .
" Everybody underestimated the impact of this .
Socially it 's a disaster .
The Chinese do n't mix with us or speak the language .
It 's been a shock , " says Carlo Longo , an Italian yarn entrepreneur and chairman of the Confederation of Industrialists in Prato .
" We have to allocate a lot of resources for the Chinese in the city .
And many of them work ' black ' - they do n't pay taxes or contribute to the costs of the city .
My colleagues resent having to stick to the rules when the Chinese do n't . "
" What happens in Prato , " he adds , " is a yardstick for all Italy .
I fear that what happened in Milan could happen here in Prato . "
Growing tensions
In April this year violent clashes took place in Milan 's Chinatown between the Chinese clothing merchants there and the Italian residents and police .
Designer clothing shops adorns the Galleria Milan
This is the first time there 'd been clashes like this in Italy and they set the country on edge .
Daniele Cologna , a Milanese academic and expert on the Chinese in Italy , explains why tensions are growing .
" The Chinese are now much more visible in Italy .
They are opening up more of their own businesses .
They want to be successful and earn well .
And they are benefiting from China 's new global status .
" The Italians feel threatened by them . "
Positive signs
But there are some positive signs of how cultural harmony can be created out of a culture clash .
The textile company " Giupel " is famous in Prato for its Chinese boss - 42 year old Xu Qui Lin , who likes to be called " Signor Giulini " .
He emigrated to Italy in 1990 , started off as a waiter in Florence , became a textile worker in Prato , then bought his own company in Prato in 2000 .
He 's respected for paying his taxes and sticking to the rules - something he tries to encourage the other Chinese in Prato to do .
" I developed a model which other businesses are now copying : I employ both Italians and Chinese and they work together . "
" I also employ 300 Chinese in my factory back in China .
That way I keep costs down .
And I concentrate on quality , " he says proudly .
This summer Italy 's economy also showed some positive signs .
Its fashion and textile entrepreneurs were rewarded with their first good news in years : sales are up 3 % over the year , and orders are up by 31 % ..
The industry has had a tough lesson to learn .
To succeed it must embrace China , restructure , innovate , downsize and outsource - but also stick to Italian quality and craftsmanship .
" Made in Italy " but sometimes " Made in Italy by Chinese " .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Just blocks from where U.N. diplomats debate their interpretations of tyranny and democracy , what may be the first document to articulate the difference is going up for sale .
The version of the Magna Carta up for auction has been on display at the National Archives in Washington .
Sotheby 's will auction off one of the earliest versions of the Magna Carta later this year , the auction house announced Tuesday .
This will be the first time any version of the Magna Carta has ever gone up for auction , according to David Redden , vice chairman of Sotheby's .
The Magna Carta is expected to fetch at least $ 20 million to $ 30 million , Redden said .
Redden , who has also sold dinosaur bones , space race artifacts and a first printing of the Declaration of Independence , called the Magna Carta " the most important document on earth . "
The charter mandated the English king to cede certain basic rights to his citizens , ensuring that no man is above the law .
Many believe the Magna Carta was the first document to recognize the legal right to freedom from tyranny , an influential concept to American political philosophers -- from the founding fathers to the modern presidency .
The version to be auctioned is one of fewer than 20 known copies of the Magna Carta , which means " Great Charter " in Latin .
The document was first devised in 1215 , but not confirmed into English law until 1297 -- the year this version was issued and sealed by King Edward I .
The document is one of only two copies of the charter that exist outside of England , according to Sotheby's .
This Magna Carta and another version in Australia are the only two ever to have been privately sold .
The version up for auction rested for six centuries with the Brundell family in Deene Park , England , until being bought in 1984 by businessman Ross Perot .
Since then , the Perot Foundation has kept the copy on display at the National Archives in Washington .
The Perot Foundation plans to distribute the money from the auction to various causes such as medical research and helping wounded soldiers .
The Magna Carta will be coming up for auction during the week of December 10 .

Barcelona , Spain : Implementation of the Physical Agents ( Electromagnetic Fields ) Directive 2004/40 / EC in all Member States could effectively halt the use of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , an important tool in cancer diagnosis , treatment , and research , a scientist told a press conference at the European Cancer Conference ( ECCO 14 ) today ( Monday September 24 ) .
The Directive is due to be implemented across Europe by April 2008 .
The Directive was drafted by DG Employment , with the aim of minimising workers ' exposure to electromagnetic fields ( EMF ) .
Currently eight million MRI patient examinations per year are carried out in Europe , said Professor Dag Rune Olsen , who works in experimental radiation therapy at the Norwegian Radiation Hospital , Oslo , Norway , and is chairman of the physics committee of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology ( ESTRO ) .
" But these are likely to have to stop , since the Directive sets limits to occupational radiation exposure which will mean that anyone working or moving near MRI equipment will breach them , thus making it possible for them to sue their employers .
Even those maintaining or servicing the equipment may be affected , " he said .
A British study into operator exposure to electromagnetic fields from MRI , published by the Heath and Safety Executive in June 2007 , and carried out by Professor Stuart Crozier from Brisbane University , Australia , found that anyone standing within about one metre of an MRI scanner in use would breach the exposure limits laid down in the directive .
The Commission has accepted this , and said that it will consider the HSE report together with the study it has commissioned itself , and which is due for publication in October 2007 , when deciding whether and how to propose amendments to the directive or to extend the implementation period .
" But they may already be too late , " said Professor Olsen .
" Slovakia has already implemented the directive , on the grounds that it was based on the assumption that the limits which it sets would have no effect .
This would appear to mean that it is now illegal to carry out MRI scanning in the country . "
The directive in its present form poses particular problems to those healthcare staff who care for patients such as children , the elderly , or those who have been anaesthetised , who need help and comfort during scans .
It will also stop the use of MRI for interventional and surgical procedures , and will curtail cutting edge research .
A recent Eurobarometer ( Europe - wide opinion poll ) showed that most EU citizens felt that they were inadequately protected by authorities against the potential health risk posed by electromagnetic fields .
More than two - thirds of people interviewed said that they were not satisfied with the information they received on EMF , and one - third said that they had not been informed at all .
However , in the medical field the use of MRI may lead to more exposure to radiation rather than less , said Professor Olsen .
" MRI has to a certain extent contributed to a limit in the increase in the use of ionising radiation in medical imaging , for example , in CT scans .
This is important with respect to radiation - related cancer mortality risks and is , as such , in line with requirements laid down in EURATOM Directive 97/43 regarding optimisation and justification of medical exposure to ionising radiation , " he said .
" If the public were informed of this I am sure that they would be as keen as I am to see that MRI is allowed to continue .
The added value that MRI represents to medical diagnostics has been tremendous .
" Policy - making should be based on sound science , and to my knowledge there is no scientific evidence of long - term adverse health effects of exposure to static or fluctuating magnetic fields that are commonly found during MR scanning .
Hasty decisions without scientific support will in this case have a severe impact on medical diagnostics and must thus be avoided .
I hope that the Commission will allow a delay in implementation to enable it to examine this issue again and that the Directive could be amended to allow an EU - wide derogation for MRI , " he concluded .

Mathematicians solve 75 - year - old mystery of infinite loop 's shape .
The Möbius strip has inspired artists — such as Maurits Escher — as well as mathematicians .
M.C. Escher
Eugene Starostin 's desk is littered with rectangular pieces of paper .
He picks one up , twists it , and joins the two ends with a pin .
The resulting shape has a beautiful simplicity to it — the mathematical symbol for infinity ( ∞ ) in three - dimensional form .
" Look , " he says , as he traces his finger along its side , " whatever path you take , you always end up where you started . "
Discovered independently by two German mathematicians in 1858 — but named after just one of them — the Möbius strip has beguiled artists , illuminated science lessons and stubbornly resisted definition .
Until now , that is .
Starostin and his colleague Gert van der Heijden , both of University College London , have solved a conundrum that has perplexed mathematicians for more than 75 years — how to predict what three - dimensional form a Möbius strip will take .
The strip is made from what mathematicians call a ' developable ' surface , which means it can be flattened without deforming its shape — unlike , say , a sphere .
When a developable surface is formed into a Möbius strip , it tries to return to a state of minimum stored elastic energy , like an elastic band springing back after being stretched .
But no one has been able to model what this final form will be .
" The first papers looking at this problem were published in 1930 , " says Starostin .
" It seems such a simple question — children can make these things — but ask the experts how to model this shape and we 've had nothing . "
Lost equations
The duo solved the problem using a set of unpublished 20 - year - old equations .
" If you try to write out equations for the shape of the strip without these tools it's a formidable task , " says Starostin .
" I tried it and it did n't work . "
With the equations , the two researchers showed that the strip 's shape depends on the length and width of the rectangle it is made from .
Starostin wants to alert other scientists to the existence of these forgotten mathematical tools .
" This is the first application of this mathematical theory .
Other communities , such as experts in mechanics , do n't know of its existence . "
Scientists in many different fields might find the model useful .
" The equations apply to any rectangular strip that twists and bends , " says John Maddocks , mathematician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne .
" They might be useful for describing sheets of graphene before they are wrapped into carbon nanotubes , for example . "
The work is published in Nature Materials1 .
Sculpture and conveyor belts
Art and mathematics discovered the Möbius strip independently of one another , and in the same way — by playing with pieces of paper2 .
Many years after August Möbius presented his discovery to the Academy of Sciences in Paris , the Swiss artist Max Bill thought he had invented a new shape upon creating his 1936 sculpture , Endless Ribbon , designed to look like " flames rising from a fire " .
Since then the Möbius strip has inspired numerous artists , architects , poets and even roller - coaster designers .
Conveyor belts are manufactured as Möbius strips , because the entire area of the belt receives the same amount of wear , so it lasts longer .
The same goes for recording tapes , as it doubles the playing time .
ADVERTISEMENT
Starostin , however , has set his sights beyond Möbius strips .
" The same theory can be used to describe non-rectangular shapes — for example , in trying to model the shape of lettuce leaves and also on chemical films .
We also hope this will help us understand crumpling , " he adds .
" I want to show you something , " says Starostin , leaning forward in his chair .
" Look at this . "
He points to a holly leaf on top of his computer monitor .
" One of my targets is to work out the shape of this .
Just look how complicated it is ! "

Virtually every time management system teaches that you must prioritize your projects to make sure you ’re working on what ’s truly important instead of getting caught up in minor things .
However , few systems explain precisely how to do this .
How do you decide which task is really the most important at any given time ?
Is it the one that ’s most urgent , the one that will earn you the most money , the one that will produce the greatest long - term happiness , the one that will please your boss the most ?
If you do n’t use an intelligent method of prioritization , you ’ll lack consistency and bounce from one task to another with no rhyme or reason .
In this article I ’ll share with you a simple and effective prioritization method adapted from the military .
From a pure military ( i.e. non-political ) standpoint , the goal of any engagement is to achieve victory by inflicting the greatest damage on your enemy with the least amount of resources .
Would n’t you say this is the essence of personal time management as well ?
You want to make the greatest amount of progress towards your goals with the least amount of effort .
Objective
For prioritization to have any meaning , it ’s imperative that you have a clear objective .
For the military your overall objective may be to achieve a decisive victory .
Your personal objective may be a set of goals , your mission statement or purpose , or even a state of being .
The role of prioritization then is to help you achieve this result with as little effort as possible .
Resources
The second consideration is the resources you have available .
Military resources include troops , guns , tanks , bombs , planes , fuel , supplies , etc .
Your personal resources include time , money , your social network , your physical energy , and so on .
Time is generally your scarcest resource because it cannot be replenished .
Prioritization
In order to prioritize intelligently , we need a method that tells us how to evaluate projects in terms of their overall importance .
Which projects will help us achieve our objectives most efficiently ?
CARVER
A key component of military strategy is selecting the most important targets to attack .
But how do you know which targets are the most important ?
Centuries of warfare have provided us with a reasonably intelligent answer .
CARVER is an acronym for a military method of target selection .
CARVER stands for Criticality , Accessibility , Return ( or Recuperability ) , Vulnerability , Effect , and Recognizability .
I ’ll explain what these are in a moment .
For every potential target , we assign a value of 1 ( lowest ) to 5 ( highest ) for each CARVER factor , thereby creating a CARVER matrix .
Then by summing the six CARVER values , we can calculate a total score for each target , and those scores represent the targets ’ relative prioritization .
The higher the CARVER score , the more “ important ” a target becomes .
Now lets explore the six CARVER factors , and consider how we can apply them to personal projects .
Criticality .
How critical is the target with respect to the main objective ?
Will it move you significantly closer to your goal , or is it a relatively puny and insignificant item ?
A low criticality project might be cleaning out your garage .
It would be nice to do , but it ’s probably not going to make that much difference in your life .
Accessibility .
Can you actually reach the target , or is it so well defended that attacking it directly is impossible ?
Do you have the means to tackle this project immediately , or does it have prerequisites ?
Starting a new business might not be very accessible if you work long hours and are living paycheck to paycheck , but asking for a promotion may be very accessible .
Return .
In military operations the term Recuperability is used here , referring to how quickly the enemy can recover from the destruction of the target .
There ’s little point in attacking a target that can be rebuilt or replaced with minimal effort .
For personal effectiveness we ’ll use Return instead .
How great is the expected return on your commitment of resources ?
Developing a new passive income stream may yield a significant return , while watching the news may yield virtually none .
Vulnerability .
How vulnerable is the target ?
What amount of resources will be required to take it out ?
How vulnerable are the projects you ’re considering ?
A one - day project will score a high vulnerability rating , while a six - month project will score much lower .
Similarly , an inexpensive project is more vulnerable than an expensive one .
Effect .
If you successfully destroy the target , how widespread will the impact be ?
If you successfully complete your project , what effect will it have on your life as well as the lives of others ?
Writing a best - selling book may have a significant effect , while completing your tax return will have very little effect .
Recognizability .
Can we see the target well enough to attack it , or is it highly camouflaged or mobile ?
Is your project crystal clear or totally fuzzy ?
How easy is it to recognize the steps necessary to complete the project ?
Have you completed this type of project before , or will you have to figure out the steps as you go along ?
Clear goals with clear steps will score higher on recognizability than foggy goals with unclear steps .
Now let ’s see how we can create a CARVER matrix to prioritize certain projects .
The 1 - 5 rankings for each factor are simply for the sake of example , so your own rankings may vary .
Keep in mind that these rankings are all relative to your primary objective , mission , or purpose .
Cri Acc Ret Vul Eff Rec Total Write a book 5 3 3 1 5 3 20 Start a blog 2 5 2 5 4 4 22 Run a marathon 2 4 3 1 4 5 19 Make new friends 4 2 5 3 3 1 18
The numbers tell the story .
According to our CARVER matrix , the most important project to tackle next is to start a blog .
While it ’s among the least critical items and wo n’t necessarily produce a great return for the time invested , it ’s relatively easy and straightforward to do .
Next comes writing a book , which is a more critical long - term project ( at least for our arbitrary person making these evaluations ) , but it will also require a lot more effort to achieve .
The worst project is making new friends , its main drawbacks being that it ’s too fuzzy and ill - defined , so it might be wise to replace that one with a more specific project .
Even though we ’re just using simple addition instead of a more complex weighting of these factors , CARVER does a fairly decent job of spitting out an intelligent prioritization of projects .
It ’s really good at depicting which projects are worth the effort and which are n’t .
It also shows when you should tackle a piece of low - hanging fruit vs. initiating a really big project .
I used CARVER often when running my computer games business .
For example , my CARVER matrix suggested it would be wise to release an add - on for my top selling product instead of creating a whole new game from scratch .
Although the add - on was n’t going to sell as well as a new game , it was a fairly straightforward two - week project that produced solid results .
Feel free to adapt the basic concept of CARVER to your specific needs .
You can assign extra weight to certain factors as well as introduce additional factors like enjoyment or financial payoff .
Just be careful not to get carried away .
The point of CARVER is to select a reasonably intelligent project and then get into action .
Do n’t lose yourself in hours of analysis paralysis .
For group decisions you can even have each team member create their own CARVER matrix and then average the results .
You ’ll quickly discover whether the team leader and team members are on the same page .
By using a simple system like CARVER , you ’ll know which projects are important enough to deserve your attention and which are , relatively speaking , a waste of your time and energy .
You ’ll benefit from greater consistency in decision - making and better results for your efforts .

September 2001 verabschiedete " Anti-Terror - Paket " hat sich nach Ansicht von Bundesinnenminister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) bewährt und sollte mit kleinen Änderungen weiter gelten .
Neben der Aufklärung von Straftaten gehe es vor allem um Terror - Prävention , sagte Schäuble heute im " Interview der Woche " des Deutschlandfunks .
Die in der vergangenen Woche von den Landesinnenministern beschlossene Anti-Terror - Datei nannte der Minister eine " sinnvolle Regelung " .
Der Kompromiss sei verfassungsfest .
Das Kabinett werde den Gesetzentwurf noch im September verabschieden .
Er hoffe , dass das Gesetz zum 1 . Januar 2007 in Kraft tritt , sagte Schäuble .
Der Bundesinnenminister sprach sich erneut dafür aus , in Zukunft Mautdaten nicht nur zum Gebühreneinzug zu nutzen .
Die so gewonnenen Informationen sollten nicht nur der Aufklärung von Straftaten dienen , so der CDU - Politiker , sondern auch präventiv , zur Verhinderung von Straftaten .
Dies könne auf Grund einer richterlichen Anordnung geschehen .
Als weitere Präventionsmaßnahme forderte Schäuble einen verstärkten Einsatz der Bundespolizei zum Beispiel in Bahnhöfen .
Die stichprobenartigen Kontrollen mit Sprengstoffspürhunden könnten aufgestockt werden – " damit man eben doch vielleicht eine präventive Wirkung hat , dass die Leute sich nicht so sicher sein können , wenn sie mit einem Koffer voll Sprengstoff durch den Bahnhof laufen , dass sie nicht vielleicht doch erkannt werden " .
Auch die Gleise müssten besser kontrolliert werden , etwa durch Hubschrauberüberwachung , meinte Schäuble .
Darüber hinaus sollten Videokameras auch an " Brennpunkten öffentlicher Kommunikation " eingesetzt werden , nicht nur an Verkehrsknotenpunkten .

Marghi Dutton is 90 and losing her eyesight , but nothing was going to stop her from trekking to midspan of the Golden Gate Bridge on Sunday with the anti-war group Code Pink : Women for Peace .
She joined a crowd of about 100 demonstrators dressed in hot pink hats , shirts and scarves and fought the wind to raise her sign : " Impeach Bush and Cheney ! "
" My arms are aching , but I 'm getting energy from the drivers - so many are honking in support , " she said .
Code Pink , a national grassroots peace movement inspired by Bay Area women , organized the protest to call for an immediate end to the war in Iraq and immediate impeachment proceedings against President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
Protesters walked from the bridge to the Pacific Heights home of Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , set up camp , cooked one last carbohydrate - heavy meal and began a hunger strike .
About 40 gathered on some terraced steps near the senator 's home , along with a half - dozen police officers .
" We have about eight people who are going to stop eating , including me , " Code Pink spokeswoman Nancy Mancias said .
On Wednesday , the group plans to relocate the hunger strike to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's home on Broadway , where they will urge the San Francisco Democrat to hold a town hall meeting with constituents .
Code Pink leaders believe both lawmakers should be doing more to bring the troops home and to rally other Democrats to call for an end to the war .
" Feinstein voted for the war spending bill , and even though Pelosi did n't , she 's not doing enough to convince others to join her , " Mancias said .
This is n't the first time Code Pink has moved into the neighborhood .
For about two weeks in March , the street corner in front of Pelosi 's house was named " Camp Pelosi " as demonstrators numbering from four to 30 lived there to urge her to fight against continued funding of the war .
Before they were ordered to decamp , protesters had hoisted a banner between two trees , taped signs to trees and the curbs and gutter , erected an awning to protect themselves from the sun , and hung a clothesline of children 's clothing symbolizing Iraqi children who have been killed in the war .
Led by longtime Bay Area activist Medea Benjamin , the group is becoming a well - known rabble - rouser on Capitol Hill .
Code Pink rents a five - bedroom house on Capitol Hill to put up volunteers , who push their cause with banners , singing and hot pink couture at hearings and press conferences and in the halls of Congress .
Within its first four years , Code Pink has grown to 250 U.S. chapters and 10 international ones .
In 2004 , a Code Pink member infiltrated a presidential speech in New York and interrupted Bush by pulling off her dress and exposing pink lingerie with a handwritten message : " Fire Bush - Women say bring the troops home now . "
Their hunger strikes have drawn worldwide attention .
In summer 2006 , the group was invited to meet with members of the Iraqi parliament in Amman , Jordan , to discuss diplomacy .
Lee Gooden , a retired Air Force major who served in Vietnam , joined the group because he felt large - scale anti-war demonstrations are too factionalized into so many political causes that the message was getting diluted .
He walked with a cane on the Golden Gate Bridge on Sunday and held his other hand aloft in a peace sign as cars whizzed by honking back .
" My personal wish is we would get all our troops home by the holidays , " he said .

Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson has revealed that he has taken drugs with his son .
The extrovert billionaire says he smoked cannabis with model son Sam , now 21 , during a surfing holiday in Australia .
Sir Richard , 57 , " I went with my son on his gap year .
We had some nights where we laughed our heads off for eight hours . "

" I do n't think smoking the occasional spliff is all that wrong .
I 'd rather my son did it in front of me than behind closed doors . "
In the interview with Piers Morgan for GQ magazine , the entrepreneur also admitted trying cocaine and ecstasy .
He said : " I took ecstasy once .
But it did n't have a massive effect on me " .
Of cocaine , he said : " I suspect I 've tried it , yes . "
The businessman , reportedly worth £ 5 billion , claims Rolling Stone Keith Richards was the " first person to teach me to roll a joint " .
He said he had not tried super - strong " skunk " cannabis but insisted cannabis was okay " in moderation . "
But he added : " I think that skunk is far too strong and dangerous and it should be banned . "
But anti-drug campaigners have blasted Branson 's drug - taking as " highly irresponsible " .
Peter Stoker , director of the National Drug Prevention Alliance , said : " Richard Branson as a parent should know better than to take health - endangering drugs with his child .

In the interview , Sir Richard also described how he became a member of the mile - high club with a married woman .
He told Morgan : " I was sitting in economy on a Freddie Laker flight , next to this very attractive lady , as we headed to LA .
" We got chatting and it went a bit further .
And it was every man 's dream , to be honest .
I was about 19 , I think .
" I remember getting off the plane and she turned to me and said , ' Look , it 's slightly embarrassing but I am meeting my husband at arrivals , would you mind holding back a bit ...'.
" The problem with plane loos generally is that they are very small , and the acrobatics can't take too long because there 's no room and people start banging on the door .
" What I remember vividly is seeing four handprints on the mirror as we finished , and thinking I 'd better wipe them off . "
Asked if he thought the woman knew he was now a famous multi-millionaire airline boss , Sir Richard , 57 , said : " I am absolutely certain she does n't .
It was quite nice being anonymous , now I think about it . "
Sir Richard 's daughter Holly has been previously linked to Prince William - but the tycoon said the pair were " just good friends " .

Asked what he would think if love blossomed between the pair and they wanted to marry , he said : " I think that would be a dreadful idea .
Nothing against William , but the life the royals lead , and the responsibilities that go with it are very difficult . "
Once women won the right to vote in 1920 , the menstruation - equals - inadequacy debate ebbed for a while .
In fact , two decades later , new proof arrived that women were perfectly fit and capable — even when bleeding — and therefore should step right up and join the war effort .
When Rosie the Riveter was needed in American factories and recruits in the Women ’s Army Corps , the War Department produced films telling women of the abundance of scientific evidence proving periods are no big deal .
A 1942 American propaganda film , “ Strictly Personal , ” for example , coached novice Wacs on nutrition , rest and exercise .
In one scene , a soldier lies listlessly on her cot — “ I ca n’t drill today , I feel unwell , ” she whines — but a fellow Wac tells her to buck up .
And a voiceover “ doctor ” explains : “ That ’s Victorian stuff .
And so is that trash about nerves and sensibility during this period . ”
Menstruation , he says , “ is no excuse for absenteeism and self - coddling . ”
But then the war ended , and Rosie and the Wacs were retired — and shown a fresh batch of studies proving that children need their moms at home , that the workplace is potentially hazardous to women ’s unborn children and that women ’s cycles make them less efficient workers than men .
By 1953 , the affliction premenstrual syndrome turned up in the medical literature .
Someone cynical might suggest that research highlighting menstruation ’s distressing consequences bubbles to the surface every time the public feels anxious over women ’s expanding roles .
( Say , the possibility that there might be a menopausal woman in the White House — and yes , you ca n’t win for losing here , given that our periods allegedly drive us to distraction and their cessation does the same . )
So take today ’s hoopla over menstrual suppression with a grain of ibuprofen .
While it may be good news for the 8 percent of women who have debilitating periods ( a constellation of symptoms known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder ) , the rest of us may be puzzled by the fuss .
Sure , getting our periods can be a bother sometimes , but after the traumatic moment of menarche —
“ How can this be happening to me when the sixth - grade pool party is tomorrow and I have no idea where that tampon goes ? ” — most of us get used to it .
It just is .
This is not a particularly profitable attitude for Wyeth , angling for its share of the $ 1.7 billion annual American market for birth control pills .
It ’s also not terribly useful for Barr , which makes Seasonale , an oral contraceptive that reduces women ’s periods to once every three months .
Nor for Watson , which sells a generic equivalent .
So what ’s a poor company to do ?
Re-conceptualize menstruation as a disease in need of treatment .
And what ’s a poor menstruating woman to do ?
Get cranky with the prophets who offer to cure us of menstruation ; who minimize the complex interplay of hormones and their many roles in our bodies ; who gloss over the still unknown long - term effects of menstrual suppression ; who promise that cycle - free women are better lovers , mothers , workers .
Or just do n’t buy it .
Monks have called for political prisoners to be freed
Protest footage
Some chanted " we want dialogue " .
Others simply shouted " democracy , democracy " .
Earlier , lorries with loudspeakers warned residents that the protests could be " dispersed by military force " .
After the march finished , eyewitnesses told two news agencies they had seen several military trucks moving on Rangoon 's streets .
LATEST PROTESTS
1 . Shwedagon Pagoda .
Tens of thousands of protesters , led by monks , gathered here at start of march
2.Sule Pagoda .
Students joined the protest , passing nearby city hall
Reuters reported that eight trucks carrying armed riot police and 11 carrying troops had moved into the city centre .
The security forces stayed in the vehicles while a few hundred people looked on , AFP said .
Tens of thousands of monks and supporters had earlier marched from Shwedagon pagoda into the commercial centre of Rangoon , where they gathered around Sule pagoda and nearby city hall , witnesses told AFP .
Protesters addressed the crowd outside city hall .
" National reconciliation is very important for us ...
The monks are standing up for the people , " proclaimed poet Aung Way .
One monk told the Associated Press : " People do not tolerate the military government any longer . "
The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says monks - who have been spearheading the protest campaign - have been handing out pictures of Burmese independence hero Aung San , the deceased father of detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi .
They were also carrying flags , including some bearing the image of a fighting peacock used by students during the 1988 pro-democracy uprising , witnesses told Reuters .
Students were also openly marching , says the BBC Burmese Service .
In earlier marches they had simply formed a chain and clapped .

" Some students are in the middle of exams at this time , " one of the students told the BBC .
" But they have left their exam rooms and come out onto the streets , joining hands with the public , fighting for the country under the guidance of the monks . "
The junta , which violently repressed the 1988 protests killing some 3,000 people , finally broke its silence over the mounting protests late on Monday , saying it was ready to " take action " against the monks .
It repeated the warning on state media , ordering monks not to get involved in politics and accusing them of allowing themselves to be manipulated by the foreign media .
International reaction
At the opening of the UN General Assembly in New York , Secretary General Ban Ki-moon urged Burma 's rulers to exercise restraint in the face of the growing protests .
US President George W Bush is to use his speech - due shortly - to announce further sanctions against Burma 's ruling military junta , the White House has said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The protests will grow bigger day by day and I hope that they are not going to start killing people
Mr Tun , Rangoon
Send us your comments Accounts from Burma
The US is hoping it will encourage other nations to act and embolden the protesters on Burma 's streets , says the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington .
Close neighbour China called for " stability " , and the European Union has also urged the junta to show the " utmost restraint " and to take the opportunity to " launch a process of real political reform " .
The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , has given his backing to the monks ' call for freedom and democracy .
The protests were triggered by the government 's decision to double the price of fuel last month , hitting people hard in the impoverished nation .

NYT : 2008 candidates following ' Soviet playbook ' and carefully editing their pasts RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday May 16 , 2007 Print This Email
This " Taking a page from the Soviet playbook , the current crop of presidential candidates has taken to eliminating whole chapters of their histories , " the New York Times reports .
Hillary Clinton has managed to side - step her husband 's impeachment and the Monica Lewinsky scandal .
John McCain ignores the campaign finance reform bill he passed with Russ Fiengold that " is loathed by many of the conservatives " he is trying to court .
Mitt Romney refers to the state where he was governor ( Massachusetts ) as " a very difficult state . "
John Edwards almost never mentions the Vice Presidential run he made with Democratic party black sheep , John Kerry .
" It 's no revelation that campaigns conspicuously omit things .
There are always unpleasant facts , episodes or viewpoints that run counter to the public self a candidate is marketing , " writes the Times .
" But one of the striking features of the 2008 campaigns is the pungency of the various elephants in the various rooms .
Candidates are strenuously de-emphasizing or ignoring altogether experiences that are defining and , in many cases , extremely well known . "
Excerpts follow : # " There 's always a tension between what can be said , what should be said and what must be said , " said Edward Widmer , a historian at Brown University who worked as a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton .
" The first candidate to calibrate this tension may move to the head of the pack . "
In recent days , Rudy Giuliani , the former New York mayor , has spoken forcefully of his pro-choice position on abortion , something that placed him at odds with many conservatives in his party , and something he spoke little about until recently .
Still unspoken , for the most part : Giuliani 's delicate family situation .
His campaign
Web site includes nothing about his two children , with whom he has had strained relations .
They are , in effect , airbrushed from " Rudy 's Story " ( the heading of the biographical section on the Web site ) # READ THE FULL NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE HERE

He will leap head - first from a weather balloon 25 miles above Earth and plummet at more than 1,000 mph with only a parachute for company .
He will face external temperatures of minus 100 c while inside his carbon - fibre suit it will be a stifling 65 c - almost 150 fahrenheit .
And most amazing of all , Michel Fournier is actually looking forward to it .
The daredevil Frenchman , a greyhaired 63 - year - old former paratrooper , aims to become the first person to break the sound barrier in free - fall .
Scroll down for more
As he plunges through the stratosphere at supersonic speed , he also hopes to break three more world records - for the longest sky dive , the highest parachute jump and the highest altitude achieved by a human in a balloon .
Despite the intense cold outside , his £ 35,000 suit will heat up inside when it meets air resistance .
His crash helmet will have its own air supply and reinforced ear pads to protect him from the sonic boom as he breaks through the Mach 1 sound barrier .
Fournier was one of three candidates selected in the 1980s to take part in a
military endurance test to see whether a parachutist could descend from 125,000 ft - almost 24 miles .
The project was shelved in 1988 - but he decided to go it alone .
He hopes to make the jump over the Great Plains of Saskatchewan in Canada some time next month , weather permitting .
" I would be lying if I said I was n't afraid , but I am also very excited , " he said .
" It really is a leap into the unknown . "
After leaping from the balloon , Fournier believes he will break the 760 mph sound barrier within 37 seconds .
The lack of friction due to the thinness of the air will mean he can attain a much higher terminal velocity , and his team of scientists estimate he will reach the top speed of 1,113 mph before he is slowed down by greater air resistance .
His parachute will not open until six minutes , 25 seconds after jumping and he will finally reach the Earth after around eight and a half minutes .
The record for highest leap was set in 1960 by a U.S. Air Force test pilot , at just under 20 miles .

Tutorial Thursday
There have been plenty of occasions where I have been left wondering if I had lost everything in my Gmail account .
If you do n’t know about any of those situations that I ’m talking about , just view all of the past occurrences that we have written about .
People have lost every email in their account numerous times , and how do you know that you ’re not going to be next ?
Honestly , I do n’t think people ever really see the value in backing up their data .
In the last few months we ’ve had two hard drives completely crash leaving the data unrecoverable .
One of the drives was for our website , and it could have been really devastating if we did n’t make nightly backups .
I really do hope you realize that in the blink of an eye your data could be gone , and you should take every precaution available to protect it .
That ’s why we ’re presenting you with several different ways to backup your Gmail account , and some are easy while others can be a little more time consuming .
– Configuring POP Access –
A few of the solutions we reference below require that POP access is enabled in your Gmail account .
This is a simple process , but I thought that I would mention it before we dive into anything .
Here ’s what you need to do to enable POP :
Click Settings at the top of any Gmail page .
Open the Forwarding and POP tab .
Select Enable POP for all mail ( even mail that ’s already been downloaded ) .
Click Save Changes .
– Backup Gmail by Forwarding ( only future emails ) –
This is going to be the easiest thing that you can do , and could actually prove to be very useful .
All this entails is forwarding all of your email messages from your current account to another one .
I recommend forwarding to a Hotmail or Yahoo !
account so that it is completely separate from Google , and then if Gmail is n’t accessible for some reason , you ’ll be able to access your old mail .
Here ’s what you need to do :
Click Settings at the top of any Gmail page .
Click Forwarding and POP along the top of the Settings box .
Enter the email address to which you ’d like your messages forwarded .
Select the action you ’d like your messages to take from the drop - down menu .
You can choose to keep Gmail ’s copy of the message in your inbox , or you can send it automatically to All Mail or Trash .
Click Save Changes .
If you only want to backup emails from a certain person , or mail that contains a certain word , you can try setting up some filters ( video demo ) to do the dirty work for you .
That way the important stuff will get backed up .
– Backup Gmail with an Offline Application ( past emails and future emails ) –
The first solution that I ’m going to talk about is probably the most common .
All you have to do is setup Outlook , Thunderbird , or another email application to download the emails from your account .
Here ’s what you ’ll need to do :
Enable POP access on your Gmail account using the steps outlined in the beginning of this article .
Now all you need to do is follow Google ’s instructions on setting up your specific application .
If you ’re using Outlook 2003 there is a video tutorial available , or if you really know what you ’re doing , all you ’ll probably need is the port and server information found here .
Now once you get that all setup , your email application will begin downloading all of the email from Gmail .
If you have a lot of email in your Gmail account , the process might take a short while .
This is because Gmail only allows the download of messages in batches , and from my experience it will download a few hundred at a time .
– Backup Gmail to Another Gmail Account ( past emails and future emails ) –
This is an idea that you probably have n’t heard about before , but it is something that I ’ve recommended to other people who do n’t want to use a desktop application for backing up all of their emails .
All you have to do is setup another Gmail account , and you ’ll use Gmail ’s new Mail Fetcher to retrieve all of the messages from your main account .
First enable the POP access for your main Gmail account that you want backed up by following the instructions earlier .
Then from your secondary Gmail account configure the Mail Fetcher :
Click Settings at the top of any Gmail page .
Click Accounts along the top of the Settings box .
In the Get mail from other accounts section , click Add another mail account .
Enter the full email address of the account you ’d like to access , then click Next Step .
Enter the email address to which you ’d like your messages forwarded .
Now on this page you ’ll need to enter the following information ( screenshot below ) : Username is your email address including the @gmail.com at the end .
You can also use a Google Apps account , and if that ’s the case you still need to enter in your full email address .
The POP server needs to be pop.gmail.com for this to work .
for this to work .
Set the port number to 995 , and then make sure the SSL box is checked below .
Click Add Account .
Choose the option you desire for being able to send mail as that address .
Here is a screenshot of what step 6 looks like ( we ’re using a Google Apps account that manages our site ’s email ) :
After everything is setup , Gmail will go and retrieve all of your past emails .
For some reason , a majority of mine were sent to the spam or trash folders , but I easily moved them around after they were finished downloading .
Remember , Gmail allows bulk POP access requests in smaller batches so it might take a little while for all of your emails to get retrieved .
I do recommend setting up some filters to organize the mail as it comes in though .
– Other Gmail Backup Solutions –
You may have thought that those are the only ways possible to backup your Gmail account , but that is n’t the case .
Where there is a will , there is a way , and with the millions of Gmail users , people are bound to come up with some pretty unique stuff .
Here are a few other solutions that I found which you might see being useful :
Backup Gmail using Fetchmail
This guide is brought to you by Lifehacker , and uses the POP access that we gave instructions for above .
I would n’t exactly say it is for the faint of heart because it involves some command line work !
Backup Gmail using Google Groups
This is kinda like the mail forwarding that we walked you through above , but it ’s using Google Groups .
You are able to make your group private , so you do n’t have to worry about others seeing your mail , and it might be good to have this on another service other than Gmail .
– Overview –
There are a lot of solutions available for backing up your Gmail account , but unfortunately the best one is still not an option .
By that I mean Google offering some sort of backup solution .
If you would like that to be an option in the future , head on over to the Gmail survey and pick the “ Export message to a CD for storage ” option .
The bad thing about all of these solutions is that they make it extremely difficult to replicate the label structure that you have given your emails .
The best thing that you can probably do is either forward your emails to another Gmail account , or use the Gmail - to - Gmail POP access I discussed .
That way you can at least setup filters to be applied to the incoming messages .
They may not catch everything perfectly , but it ’s better than nothing .
Dennis Kucinich knows a fund - raising moment when he sees one .
His anti-Bush , anti-war comments in Syria have churned a wave of criticism , but he hopes to turn it into cash for his presidential campaign ( which puts him to Hawaii today ) .
His plea to suporters , just sent by e-mail :
" Today I am being attacked as a traitor and vilified for reaching out to people of the region , hearing their concerns and discussing those concerns openly in public forums .
My campaign is in need of immediate financial assistance to respond to a right wing hate machine that went into over - drive on the 6th anniversary of 9/11 , using my visit to Syria and Lebanon as red meat for their attack dogs .
Please go to http://www.dennis4president.com now to contribute . "
Kucinich continues with an explanation for why he traveled to Syria and Lebanon ( but not to Israel or to Iraq while it is being occupied -- his words -- by the United States ) :
" Elizabeth and I went to the region to determine the level of interest that exists for peace .
As the person who led Democrats five years ago in opposition to the war against Iraq , I went to
determine the impact of the war on Syria , which shares a border with Iraq and has taken in over 1.5 million Iraqi refugees .
I went to learn what the issues are that separate Syria from hopes
for peace with Israel .
I went to see for myself the impact of border security issues .
I went to learn how the U.S. is viewed by ordinary people .
I made my self available to media to discuss
my own views as to how the U.S. can take a more constructive role in the region and lead the way to peace . "
He also says he has " a special obligation " as a congressman " to determine whether the money that is spent in furtherance of U.S. policy is being spent constructively or destructively , based on lies or on truth . "
The presumptive policy here is Mideast peace , since if he were looking into the billions spent in Iraq , he might , well , you know , go to Iraq .
" As a Presidential candidate , I must learn first hand whether the opportunity for peace between nations is a pipe dream or a real possibility .
I have no authority to enter into negotiations for the U.S. , to fashion agreements , to sign treaties , or to establish policy between nations .
As President , I will be able to affect these matters more directly . "
Back to the plea for dollars : " Reason and peace should not be silenced by fear mongers or the
right wing attack machine , " he writes .
" But I need your help to answer them now .
We must not allow efforts for peace and reconciliation to be continually destroyed by those who want permanent war . "
So how much does he want ?
As much as you can give , by Sept. 30 .
" It is essential for our campaign to raise $ 250,000 to enable us to continue our message
of strength through peace , " he writes .
It will be interesting to see how this pitch works compared with his Aug. 22 request -- asking for campaign contributions in honor of his second wedding anniversary .
The goal then was $ 50,000 .
" The love Elizabeth and I share encompasses all of the reasons you support our campaign and all the reasons we exist as human beings , " Kucinich wrote then .
I 've sworn by Microsoft Streets and Trips for years , since the late 90's .
I make a point of installing the latest version of Microsoft 's mapping application all our desktop PCs for all our desktop mapping needs .
It 's also great on laptop PCs ; combined with a USB GPS receiver and a laptop , Streets and Trips is a fine navigational aid on trips .
Well , assuming you were going to take the laptop on your trip anyway , which I always do .
So I was taken aback when I noticed my wife was using Google Maps on her PC to map something .
I asked her why she was using Google Maps instead of our old pal Streets and Trips , and she said , quite matter of factly , " Because it 's faster . "
Because it 's faster ?
I tested it myself , and she 's right .
It takes about 9 seconds to launch Streets and Trips 2007 on my ( very fast ) desktop PC , compared to about 3 seconds to load maps.google.com in the browser .
It 's a mixed - up , topsy - turvy world we live in when web mapping applications are now faster and more convenient to use than their desktop equivalents .
But it 's a fact .
What 's worse , Google maps is easier to use than Streets and Trips , too .
Here 's the location of the DNA Lounge , a club owned by old - school Netscape engineer Jamie Zawinski , mapped in Streets and Trips .
Here 's how I get directions to the club using Streets and Trips :

It 's an incredible amount of work for what is probably one of the most frequent use cases for mapping software -- getting directions from point A to point B . Let 's compare the same task in Google Maps .
We 're already up 6 seconds since the browser - based app loads in 1/3 the time of the desktop application .
Here 's how I get directions to the club using Google Maps :
Click the " To here " link Type my home address and press Enter
There 's no reason Streets and Trips could n't adopt the same conventions as Google Maps .
But Streets and Trips seems to be completely stuck in the old world mentality of toolbars , menus , and right - clicking .
All the innovation in user interface seems to be taking place on the web , and desktop applications just are n't keeping up .
Web applications are evolving online at a frenetic pace , while most desktop applications are mired in circa -1999 desktop user interface conventions , plopping out yearly releases with barely noticeable new features .
This should be an unfair comparison .
Streets and Trips is free to harness the complete power of the desktop PC , whereas Google Maps is limited to web browser scripting and HTTP calls to the server .
Google Maps turns all those browser - based application weaknesses into strengths , by offering a bunch of online - enabled features that Streets and Trips does n't : satellite view , real - time traffic data , and the new street view .
Plus it 's always up to date ; we 're guaranteed to be using the latest version with the newest features .
And unlike Streets and Trips , it 's free -- or at least ad - subsidized .
Streets and Trips will still be helpful in one very specific situation : disconnected use with a laptop and / or a GPS .
But in every other case , Google Maps is superior .
It 's faster , it 's simpler to use , and it has more features .
It 's hard not to look at the facts and conclude that desktop applications -- at least desktop mapping applications -- are dead .
An articel based on a new bookprovides insights into making real lasting changes in the most difficult of situations .
The article makes the point this is not about making the ' normal ' changes that happen all the time .
It is normal to experiment , to get exited about new ideas , and we all learn from experience as we respond to new challenges .
Some of us are better at change than others but we are all resilient and creative , to a greater or lesser degree .
Younger people cope with change more easily than older people as they have not become so fixed in their ways but every one can change .
Yes is the obvious answer but the odds are against you by nine to one !
people remain sick because of how they choose to lead their lives - too much smoking , drinking and lack of exercise .
What is more shocking is that when asked to change life styles ( or die ) following traumatic heart surgery fewer than 3 % do !
But it has been found 77 % of patients stick with their lifestyle changes when they were involved with a range of therapies ( it did n't matter which ) that required them to take part in regular group conversations .
after they are released .
Normally 35 % of inmates are rearrested within six months and 65 % within three years .
Rehabilitation seems of little use .
In San Fransisco there is an exception , a city block has been had become a residence where 500 criminal live and work together with one professional staffer .
The felons run the place themselves , taking responsibility for each other , kicking out anyone who uses drugs , alcohol , or those who use threats of violence .
Although most of them are illiterate they teach each other marketable skills , run businesses and support themselves with the profits .
60 % of people who enter make it through to lead lawful productive lives ; in contrast to 6 out of 10 ' normal ' released inmates return to crime .
firm that was taken over by Toyota .
Toyota set about creating a new sense of mutual trust ( not part of the previous management style ) amongst the suspicious workers and within three months the factory was rolling out cars with hardly any defects - an incredible feat .
Workers were now being asked for their ideas on improving quality - a new experience for them .
The heart patients , the ex-convicts , and the car workers , had all proved the ' experts ' wrong .
The changes were not made because of facts , figures or ' evidence ' , or because people are rational , or that knowledge is power , nor even through fear , crisis , or authority ; but they did change , even in such ' impossible ' situations .
And that this change can occur with surprising speed even when people feel powerless or the situation hopeless .
It is not possible to sum up all the aspects of making such changes but there are .
It seems you need the influence of seemingly ' unreasonable ' people to restore your hope - to make you believe that you can change and expect that you will change .
This is an act of ' selling ' - the community , or leaders , have to make you really believe you have the ability to change .
They have to ' sell ' themselves as your partners , mentors , role models , and sources of new knowledge and specific strategies .
It takes lots of repetition , over time , before new patterns of behaviour becomes automatic and seem natural - until you can use them without thinking .
It helps to have a great teacher , coach , or mentor , to give you guidance , encouragement and direction along the way .
Change does n't just requires ' selling ' but also ' training '..
You are able to look at the world in a new way - you have literally ' changed your mind ' .
This may sound simple but the article writer assures us that it is not .
Too many people , who run our organisations , are trapped in old , ' facts , fear and force ' , thinking .
But with these keys you have all you need to get started .
To me they would work well in a school - particularly a school with numbers of students who are ' failing ' .
The ideas have much in common with the research behind the excellentdevelop by Waikato University , or the thinking behind the move towards , or the powerfulideas developed by creative teachers and schools .
The same underlying principles are the ' active ingredients ' to unlock profound change in any situation .
They are easily understood and available to be applied by anyone who wants to make a real difference .
The common belief is the importance of positive relationships that inspire hope and and self belief .

' Crack in the Dike ' : White House in ' Panic Mode ' Over GOP Revolt on Iraq White House panics in trying to appease Democrats and Republicans on Iraq .
July 9 , 2007  -- ABC
News has been told the White House is in " panic mode " over the recent defections of Republican senators on the president 's stay - the - course policy in Iraq .
Senior Bush administration officials are deep in discussion about how to find a compromise that will " appease Democrats and keep wobbly Republicans onboard , " a senior White House official told ABC News .
The official said the White House " is in panic mode , " despite Monday 's on - the - record briefing by White House Press Secretary Tony Snow , who played down any concern over the recent spate of GOP senators who have spoken out publicly in support of changing course in Iraq .
The Republican defections are seen as " a crack in the dike , " according to the senior White House official , and National Security Adviser Steven Hadley is most concerned .
Bush administration officials are currently discussing options about how to get out of " this conundrum with the Republicans , " while giving Gen. David Petraeus , commander of U.S. forces in Iraq , time to implement the troop surge strategy in Iraq , according to a senior White House official .
" We 're not retreating or announcing troop withdrawal , " the official said , but , " we need to buy more time for Petraeus . "
The White House has not reached any kind of consensus about what to do , despite the high - level discussions .
The White House suggests a much - anticipated report on the progress of the president 's policy in Iraq will likely be released Thursday , and that is the day Bush will likely comment on it .
A senior White House official told ABC News the report will be " mixed . "
The White House does believe there has been progress on the security front in Iraq , but the political progress is obviously very bad .
One official familiar with the report said there are some bizarre categories under benchmark that say " satisfactory , nonsatisfactory and unsatisfactory " .
Despite the report 's mixed conclusions about the president 's policy , senior White House officials told ABC News not to expect Bush to announce any kind of changes or new strategy .
Meanwhile , Defense Secretary Robert Gates has pressed for a pullback that would reduce the combat brigades in Baghdad by early next year .
Under his plan , those combat units that remain in Iraq would take up a more limited mission of training Iraqis , watching the borders and going after al Qaeda .
Gates believes that if the troop surge in Iraq was extended , it would further stretch the Army .
He is adamant about not extending troops again .
One White House official told ABC
News he expects Petraeus will be able to show that " momentum " is shifting in the favor of the United States by September of this year , allowing Bush to say that it is his hope that a drawdown could begin in the spring , if that momentum continues .
However , the official expects the president would make clear that this drawdown would be based on certain conditions being met , and that if the momentum was lost in the spring , then there would be no drawdown .
The official also said former Iraq commanders Gen. George Casey and Gen. John Abizaid had hoped this type of drawdown would be possible in 2006 , but did n't happen because conditions on the ground changed for the worse .
So far , however , the White House has made no decision about changing the strategy .
Moller Industries , the brainchild of inventor Dr. Paul Moller , announced recently that production would begin on the company 's M200G volantor , a UFO - esque hovercraft that apparently can " glide over terrain at 50 MPH . "
Moller , long known for his work in both hovercrafts and flying vehicles ( see the dubious Skycar ) , has been working on alternative forms of transportation for 40 years .
The futuristic looking craft is driven by the company 's Rotapower engines , and can allegedly operate up to 10 feet in altitude .
Of course , while Moller Industries offers lots of exciting talk about the future of transportation ( as well as t- shirts , models , and investment options ) to its customers , the company has never brought a vehicle to market .
Clearly , the announcement of a " Jetsons - like " craft may fuel enthusiast 's hope ( and pull in some escrow cash ) , but the actual production and sale of the $ 90,000 + vehicle has yet to be seen .
Check the video after the break to see Dr. Moller 's invention at work .

The delegation arrived at the market [ in Baghdad ] , which is called Shorja , on Sunday with more than 100 soldiers in armored Humvees ... and attack helicopters ....
Sharpshooters were posted on the roofs .
The congressmen wore bulletproof vests ....
At a news conference shortly after their outing , Mr. McCain ... and his three congressional colleagues described Shorja as a safe , bustling place full of hopeful and warmly welcoming Iraqis -- “ like a normal outdoor market in Indiana in the summertime , ” offered Mike Pence , an Indiana Republican .
-- New York Times
---
MY WIFE came into the living room wearing a Kevlar vest , helmet and night - vision goggles .
“ What are you doing ? ” I asked .
Advertisement
“ Have you completely forgotten , silly head ?
We ’re going to the market . ”
I placed my hand at my head .
I ’d been so caught up in stitching a minor wound I ’d received earlier in the day after going to an outdoor fruit stand that I had completely forgotten .
“ I ’m a dope , are n’t I ? ” I said , chuckling , slowly shaking my head back and forth .
She chuckled too , also shaking her head .
We both chuckled .
Then I winced from where a stitch popped .
Carol helped the boys get ready , putting on their sneakers and body armor .
I phoned the Indiana National Guard so that they could radio the 434th Special Air Wing at Grissom Air Force Base , which in turn scrambled two F - 14 Tomcats .
Then we hopped in the wagon .

Carol and I moved to Muncie from Detroit .
Frankly , we were tired of the noise , the dirt and the crime .
Here , you feel so safe , as long as you move very quickly through the market , keep your head down and have appropriate air cover .
Carol handed each of the boys -- 8 and 5 , and a handful , let me tell you -- a juice box , a Xanax and personalized Navy SEAL - issue GPS systems .
“ Dad ? ” said Kevin , our 8 - year - old , from the back seat .
“ Yes , Kev , ” I said .

“ Can we go to that cotton candy stand again ? ”
The F - 14s flew by low .
Each of us activated our earpieces and hand - held mini walkie - talkies , agreed on a frequency , and I slowed the car to 15 mph as Carol and the boys opened the doors and rolled out , taking cover under shrubbery near the Bibb lettuce stand ( the boys love salad ! ) .
So far , so good .
I hit the gas and spun the car and parked in a ditch that had once been a Tasty Donut before a tactical nuclear weapon had decimated it .
Great parking space , though .

I saw my neighbor , Larry , under his car , from the looks of it a spanking - new Bradley fighting vehicle .
“ Snipers today , ” Larry said with a smile .
“ Nice ride , Larry , ” I said as I dove under the car , a sniper ’s bullet exploding inches away from my foot .
“ Looks solid . ”
“ The hull is constructed of welded aluminum and spaced laminate armor , ” he said , burying his head in the dirt as another round came in .
“ The Israelis use them .
I had an Explorer , but it was blown to bits last time I went out for garbage bags . ”
“ Roomy ? ”

“ Ton of room .
Carries three crew , commander , gunner and driver , plus six fully equipped infantrymen .
Mileage is awful , but with all the space in the back , it ’s great for the market . ”
I borrowed his high - power binoculars to check on the family ’s progress .
Kevin and his little brother had successfully bought lettuce , fruit and homemade jams before a particularly well - placed rocket - propelled grenade destroyed the stand ( the owner managed to avoid the hit and began rebuilding immediately , as weekends are , obviously , his busiest time ) .
Carol , I noticed , had found cover behind the wall of a largely destroyed warehouse .
A sniper had a bead on the glint from her eyeglasses , which the afternoon sunshine had caught ( Indiana is known for its beautiful summers ) .
Advertisement
Larry asked me to cover him , and he rolled out from under the BFV and hopped in .
I activated heavy smoke bombs , and his car tore out of the field .
I made it back to my car as Larry ’s choppers came in low over the market , taking heavy fire and destroying the sniper ’s den ( about time , thank you very much ) as well as a Toys R Us that was closed for renovation .
I could see the smoke in the rear - view mirror when Carol dove onto the hood , managing to hold onto the bundles ( that woman never ceases to amaze me ) .
I hit the brakes and she got in quickly .
“ You put on face paint , ” I said , giving her a quick kiss .
“ You would n’t believe how crowded it was , ” she said , panting .
“ I saw Margie Hynes .
Boy , has she put on weight . ”

A CBU - 52B cluster bomb exploded to our left , and I hit the gas .
We could see the boys ahead , waving flares in the dense smoke .
I did n’t stop the car completely .
Kevin threw Chip in first , then jumped in himself .
Both immediately vomited from the smoke .
“ You kids have fun ? ” Carol asked .
“ Yeah ! ” said Chip .
Advertisement
“ He was holding a loaf of bread and it got blown out of his hand ! ”
“ It was so awesome , Mum . ”
We all laughed .
Really hard .
That ’s how shopping is in Indiana in the summer .
It ’s just fun .
It ’s fun and safe and hopeful and full of warm and welcoming Indianans and insurgents and snipers and bombs .
“ Oh darn , ” Carol said .

“ What is it , honey ? ”
“ We forgot milk . ”
This month we 're taking a break from installing Linux video software to report on the cool Linux video applications shown at the National Association of Broadcasters ( NAB ) convention in Las Vegas , April 21 - 26 , 2001 .
Every April , television chief engineers , station managers and everyone else with an interest in professional video gear make the trek to Las Vegas for the NAB .
With more than 115,000 attendees and 1,700 exhibits , NAB is one of the largest tradeshows in the world .
Computer enthusiasts may be more familiar with CES ( 122,000 attendees and 1,000 exhibitors ) and COMDEX ( 225,000 attendees and 2,300 exhibitors ) .
By acreage all three shows are about the same size : a million square feet .
Bring your hiking boots .
At NAB Linux was a much bigger presence than last year .
Special effects offerings included RAYZ from Silicon Grail , Shake from Nothing Real and Maya from Alias|Wavefront .
Linux Media Arts showcased the Cinelerra Quicktime video editor and the Kino DV editor .
AMD briefed video developers on getting the most from Athlon .
BOXX Technologies offered the 3DBOXX Graphics workstation .
Video board makers presented Hauppauge and DVS .
For Linux settop boxes , ATI , OpenTV and Phillips TiVo were there .
Khronos and ProMpeg Forum each made announcements of significant Linux media APIs .
And , at the NAB conference , there was a presentation on Linux and MP3 by Radio Free Asia .
“ The vast majority of high - end production shops will convert to Linux in the next eighteen months ” , says Ray Feeney , a four - time Academy Award - winner for Scientific and Engineering Achievement and the technical chair of the Visual Effects Society ( http://www.visual-effects-society.org/).
VES participants include special effects artists from ILM , DreamWorks , Pixar , PDI , Disney 's The Secret Lab and Sony.
VES members are discussing how to transition the industry to Linux .
For years SGI IRIX was the OS of choice for studio film projects , and many have n't been satisfied with the support they have received since switching to Windows .
Because Linux is open source , it is an OS for which the industry can develop motion picture features , and its ubiquity makes it much easier to find users more familiar with it than with IRIX .
“ Nobody is buying anything now ” , said Feeney at NAB , “ but once the writers ' strike situation is over there will be restructuring .
Today when people have rendering requirements they are going to Linux .
The rendering side is solved and turnkey . ”
Feeney compares the state of the art in Linux graphics workstations to where Linux servers were two years ago when first used in a major production , for rendering Titanic .
He expects Linux will dominate in two years on graphics workstations , not just servers .
ILM has already begun using Linux for workstations as well as rendering .
Feeney is also the founder of Silicon Grail , a company showing their next generation compositing tool RAYZ in the Compaq booth at NAB .
Designed for creating feature film effects , RAYZ runs on Linux , IRIX and Windows .
Production that originated on film is first digitized by a film scanner such as the Kodak Cineon .
Although each frame may be stored as a separate image file ( e.g. , in Targa format ) , to the RAYZ operator it still looks like a movie .
Effects filters are diagramed left - to - right in the graph window for ease of manipulation , and the effects results are visible in the video playback window .
Completed movies may be transferred back to film or to video tape .
RAYZ is Silicon Grail 's next generation interactive compositor based on their Chalice software .
Chalice was used on Deep Blue Sea , Prince of Egypt , Star Trek : Insurrection , Titanic , Fantasia 2000 , Men in Black and many other motion pictures .
It provides effects and color correction tools .
For a typical configuration RAYZ is expected to cost $ 9,900 .
RAYZ was in public beta at the time of NAB , for release in May ( see http://www.silicongrail.com/).
Maya Linux Screenshot
Maya from SGI company Alias|Wavefront is a widely used professional 3 - D animation and visual effects package .
At NAB , Alias|Wavefront announced Maya 4 , with enhancements and optimizations in the areas of rendering , character animation , brush and paint tools , and games - related functionality .
Enhancements to the Maya non-linear motion editing technology include time warping , character merging , drag and drop , and character set editing .
New character animation features include switching between forward kinematics and inversion kinematics , quaternion - based IK , motion trails , ghosting and a jiggle deformer to wobble character muscles .
“ Customer demand for a Linux version of Maya has driven this development ” , says Alias|Wavefront entertainment business general manager Bob Bennett .
That decision was influenced by feedback from the Technical Committee of the Visual Effects Society .
Linus Torvalds called Maya 3 “ the most complex and powerful 3 - D graphics application ever to run on Linux ” when the Linux port was announced in the summer of 2000 .
Maya was used by ILM for The Perfect Storm , by The Secret Lab for Mission to Mars , by Sony Pictures Imageworks for The Hollow Man and by many other productions .
Alias|Wavefront demonstrated Maya 4 for IRIX and Windows at NAB , due for release the end of June .
The Linux version is expected six to eight weeks later .
Prices start at $ 7,500 ( see http://www.aliaswavefront.com/).
Shake 2.4 Linux Screenshot
Shake from Nothing Real ( Venice , California ) is high - speed compositing software optimized for visual effects for feature films .
New features in Shake 2.4 include vector - based procedural paint , advanced color correction tools , a new rotoscoping node and ease - of - use improvements .
It is resolution independent and automatically handles different bit -depths ( 8 , 16 , 32 ) and resolutions ( Web , 601 , HDTV , film , IMAX ) .
Shake has been used in over 60 feature films , and since its debut , has been used in every Oscar winner for visual effects including Titanic , What Dreams May Come , The Matrix and Gladiator .
Shake runs on Linux , IRIX and Windows .
Shake 2.4 entered beta testing in February and is scheduled for release shortly after the NAB .
Prices start at $ 9,900 ( see http://www.nothingreal.com/).
Linux Media Arts ( Burbank , California ) creates turnkey video editing and media - streaming systems for video , film , audio and the Internet .
LMA president Mike Collins says , “ Our goal is to make Linux the premier multimedia editing and media production platform in the world , largely using open - source software . ”
To that end Collins says their mission right now is to create servers and editors for a new high - quality SDDI board they announced at NAB .
Until now they have been offering M - JPEG and DV systems .
At NAB LMA demonstrated their DV and Quicktime - based editing systems .
Bundled software includes Cinelerra and Kino video editors , Blender 3D , the GIMP , Corel Draw and Red Hat Linux .
Systems are based on AMD , Intel and Compaq Alpha chips .
Prices start at $ 1,395 with an AMD 1GHz processor ( see http://www.linuxmediaarts.com/).
Kino is a simple cuts - only DV video editor .
DV is the format used by most consumer digital camcorders .
Author Arne Schirmacher in Germany says , “ Kino allows you to record , create , save , edit and play movies recorded with DV camcorders .
Although it has windows and menus , it is actually a keyboard - driven program .
It uses many keyboard commands that are similar to the vi text editor . ” ( See www.schirmacher.de/arne/kino/0).
At NAB Jason Howard of LMA demonstrated Kino 0.4 as part of a suite of tools for DV to DVD production .
Howard is the developer of dvcont , a DV camera - control utility .
Other open - source DV utilities include dvgrab ( also by Schirmacher ) and dvsend .
The dvgrab utility moves footage from the camera to the computer using the 1394 protocol .
The dvsend utility moves edited material back onto camcorder video tape .
Howard is also a partner in the video production company Spectsoft ( Oakdale , California ) .
Currently a mixed Windows / Linux facility , partner Ramona Howard ( Jason Howard 's mom ) is keen to move entirely to Linux in order to have increased control over the production process .
As a video producer she encourages Jason to develop more open - source software .
Jason Howard says , “ All it takes is one person to have a passion in Linux .
That 's all of us , and a lot of soda ! ”
Howard is currently working on a transcoder utility to move footage between AVI and Quicktime to enable transferring material easily between Kino and Cinelerra .
He is also working on selectively grabbing DV camera footage based on an edit decision list ( see http://www.spectsoft.com/).
Cinelerra is a Quicktime - based video editor from Heroine Virtual .
They are well known in the Linux community for their Broadcast 2000 editor ( see “ Moviemaking in a Linux Box ? ” January 2001 ) and XMovie player .
Cinelerra was announced and shown at NAB .
It is a resolution - independent editor with over 100 real - time video and audio filters , has support for five - channel audio and is designed to run on multiprocessor hardware .
Heroine Virtual bundles its software with systems manufactured by Linux Media Arts ( see http://heroines.sourceforge.net/).
Chipmaker AMD ( Sunnyvale , California ) briefed video developers at NAB on how to take advantage of processor advances in their Athlon and Duron chips .
Audio / video development engineer Jim Bovenzi says , “ Dual processor solutions are key to maximizing performance in video applications .
Dual Athlons provide incredible performance . ” AMD demonstrated the OnAir DTV 1080i HDTV card from Sasem running on Windows XP ( see http://www.amd.com/ and www.sasem.com).
WinTV - HD is an HDTV card offered by Hauppauge ( Hauppauge , New York ) .
The Hauppauge WinTV card is very popular among Linux users .
Unfortunately , according to a Hauppauge engineer the WinTV - HD architecture is quite different .
The Linux community faces another reverse engineering job to support the WinTV - HD card shown at NAB .
Hauppauge has no plans for Linux support .
The WinTV - HD card costs $ 399 ( see http://www.hauppauge.com/).
Another Windows consumer HDTV card at NAB was accessDTV for $ 479 ( see http://www.accessdtv.com/).
The HDStationOEM is an uncompressed HDTV real - time I/O card for professional applications .
Maker DVS Digital Video ( Glendale , California ) says they offer Linux drivers .
However , the $ 40,000 price tag puts it squarely in the pro market .
In supports 1080 p and even 2 k film resolution ( see http://www.digitalvideosystems.com/).
The Linux - powered TiVo settop box sold by Phillips was on display , as was a new settop from ATI Technologies ( Ontario , Canada ) based on their ALL - IN - WONDER .
An engineering model running on a Linux PC was in their booth .
ATI offers Linux drivers for their new Fire GL4 high - end graphics card that 's $ 1,995 .
Settop developer OpenTV ( Mountain View , California ) announced their intention to support Linux ( see www.tivo.com, www.ati.com and www.opentv.com/).
3D
3DBOXX is a series of high - performance Windows and Linux workstations offered by BOXX Technologies ( Austin , Texas ) for digital applications such as film , HDTV , video and game development .
One user of 3DBOXX Linux machines is Blur , a visual effects , animation and design studio located in Venice , California .
They produced a four - minute stereo 3 - D 70 mm ride for Paramount Parks called The 7th Portal .
3DBOXX systems start at $ 2,309 .
RenderBOXX server systems start at $ 2,692 ( see http://www.boxxtech.com/).
OpenML is a new API that hopes to do for video software developers what OpenGL has done for graphics developers .
The Khronos Group consists of leading graphics and digital media companies including 3 Dlabs , ATI , Discreet , Evans & Sutherland , Intel , NVIDIA , SGI and Sun Microsystems .
The Khronos Group announced at NAB that they had completed the OpenML 1.0 Specification .
OpenML is based on the dmSDK , which SGI recently made open source , and MLdc , an abstraction layer for display devices .
Video effects software maker Discreet is helping to drive the requirements .
Neil Trevett of 3 Dlabs who made the announcement says , “ We hope to encourage an open - source implementation in Linux . ” ( See http://www.khronos.org/ and http://oss.sgi.com/.)
The release of the AAF ( Advanced Authoring Format ) software development kit version 1.0 was announced by the Pro-MPEG Forum at NAB .
The software is intended to interchange video , audio and metadata in postproduction applications ( see http://www.aafassociation.org/ and http://sourceforge.net/projects/aaf/).
Besides exhibitors , there was a Linux - specific session in the NAB conference : “ Linux and MP3 for Archiving ” .
Radio Free Asia ( www.rfa.org) broadcasts via shortwave radio and the Web in Tibetan , Cantonese , Uyghur , Burmese , Vietnamese , Lao , Khmer ( to Cambodia ) and Korean ( to North Korea ) .
RFA is a private corporation funded by the US Congress to bring news and information to populations lacking a free press .
Their first broadcast was to China in September 1996 .
RFA broadcasts 34 hours of programming per day in nine languages .
RFA production support manager A. J. Janitschek and lead technical engineer Tom Hallewell described the evolution of the RFA MP3 archive technology .
“ At Radio Free Asia we used to archive all of our audio as WAV files onto 4GB DAT tapes ” , said Janitschek .
But that was expensive , labor intensive and inconvenient to search and retrieve .
“ With our current system we can store 100 hours of archive programming on a single CD - ROM and make it available to anyone who has an MP3 player on their PC ” , added Hallewell .
RFA uses about 15 CD - ROMs to archive a month 's audio ( 1,020 hours ) .
They use three different 16 - bit encoding settings : 1 ) 32 khz , 48 kbs and 20 MB / hr for broadcast quality ( over shortwave ) ; 2 ) 16 khz , 16 kbs and 7MB / hr for long - term storage ; and 3 ) 12 khz , 14 kbs and 6MB / hr for broadcast on the Web .
RFA does n't encode their MP3 streams on a PC , but uses the Telos Audioactive Realtime MPEG Internet Audio Encoder .
This rackmount box multicasts MP3s that they capture on their Linux archive system and burn onto CD - ROMs .
Janitschek says the advantages of a hardware encoder include real - time performance and the fact that MP3 patent licenses ( to Fraunhofer and THOMSON ) are covered .
The unit sells for $ 2,800 ( see http://www.audioactive.com/).
RFA not only uses Linux to archive their content , they also are contributing to open - source software .
R- BOSS ( Radio - Broadcast Open Source System ) is a collection of digital broadcast content management applications written using Python .
Also available is their 3D - Project , a free distribution of broadcast specific 3 - D drawings , material and texture bitmap files .
For further information or to download , see http://www.techweb.rfa.org/.

And there were other Linux exhibitors at NAB .
Real Networks offered streaming and playing on Linux .
Kasenna was showing their asset management system , which supports Linux .
Thomcast Communications introduced the DCX Millennium Digital Transmitter , which can be controlled by Linux .
No doubt there were many more Linux applications that we missed .
Next month we will return to our project of upgrading our Debian Linux installation to the 2.4 kernel and XFree86 4.x GUI .
Time permitting , we will also install an ATI All - In - Wonder Radeon graphics card .
Two and a half years ago , current and past administrators of Daily Kos jointly signed an essay urging the Senate not to confirm the nomination of Alberto Gonzales .
The signers were kos , Armando , DHinMI , A Gilas Girl , Steve Gilliard , Steve Soto , Meteor Blades , Theoria , Trapper John , DemFromCT , DavidNYC , Hunter , and kid oakland .
Several dozen other bloggers from around wwwLand subsequently signed onto the effort , as you can see here .
Among other things , we said :
As the prime legal architect for the policy of torture adopted by the Bush Administration , Gonzales 's advice led directly to the abandonment of longstanding federal laws , the Geneva Conventions , and the United States Constitution itself .
Our country , in following Gonzales 's legal opinions , has forsaken its commitment to human rights and the rule of law and shamed itself before the world with our conduct at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib .
The United States , a nation founded on respect for law and human rights , should not have as its Attorney General the architect of the law 's undoing .
...
Legal opinions at the highest level have grave consequences .
What were the consequences of Gonzales 's actions ?
The policies for which Gonzales provided a cover of legality - views which he expressly reasserted in his Senate confirmation hearings - inexorably led to abuses that have undermined military discipline and the moral authority our nation once carried .
The Senate let us down and confirmed Gonzales .
But he has not let us down .
He has been everything we expected him to be and a good deal more since he stepped into the AG 's chair .
Everybody can recite the litany even if Gonzales himself can't remember squat .
Given the record of this Administration , its string of lies and its lying about lies , its efforts at cover-ups , its secret dealings , and its politicization of everydamnthing it touches for partisan advantage , Gonzales 's performance at the hearings today ( and previously ) should be no surprise .
It was as if a Mafia don had shown up to smirk his way through a Senate hearing on organized crime .
Fredo , stonewalling .
There 's a remedy for stonewalling .
We all know what it is .

Daniel Dennett On The Pope's Remarks
Well , truth be told , he did n't comment directly on the Pope 's remarks , because I heard him talk this past July at this year 's Human Behavior & Evolution Society conference at Penn .
Here 's Dennett next to me at dinner , talking to a kid who claimed to
be Brigham Young 's grandson , with Leda Cosmides looking on behind .
Dennett spoke out against the prissy way in which we 're supposed to regard religion , making the point that religion should n't be sancrosanct , but should be examined as dispassionately as other subjects .
In Dennett 's words to me at dinner :
Give religion no more respect than you ’d accord to animal husbandry .
Of course , when he said it , he was looking out across a dining room filled with a few hundred evolutionary psychologists , anthropologists , and ethologists , not a sea of homicidal nutwads .
As a friend e-mailed me today :
... I have this summary about all the anger with the Pope : “ We ’re so mad about your comments that Islam is violent that we ’re going to kill you if you do n’t apologize . ”
Dennett made a fascinating point -- and I think he 's right -- that some people believe in god , and some people believe in the belief in god .
I think of intelligent people I know , and I can't really imagine they believe , without proof , in a big Imaginary Friend in the sky .
I think they just try not to think about it too much because they find it more comfortable to recede into irrationality .
Or , as it relates to organized religion , as Dennett said in his talk :
People do the believing and leave the understanding to the " experts . "
Another reason for this might be that they need the group belongingness religion provides -- and they 'll suspend disbelief to have it , same as they do in a movie .
Unfortunately , real - world suspension of disbelief has real - world consequences .
For more on that , see the Sam Harris blog post below .
Regarding work on religious group - think , I 'll try to post David Sloan Wilson 's talk and contribution to the poster session at HBES soon .
Dennett ’s one policy recommendation –- education on world religions ( for kids ) :
Dennett explained :
Toxic religions depend on enforced ignorance of the young –- and a religon that can flourish in an informed ( citizenry ) is a benign religion .
Here 's Dennett 's book , Breaking The Spell .

It is puzzling how many intelligent people are also religious people .
I always had trouble understanding that until I lived with my wife , a practicing Catholic , for a few years .
After several long discussions ( over more than a few bottles of wine ) , I came to realize that intelligent people like her do n't really buy into religion .
They just find the alternative depressing .
Religion gives them hope , like the lottery gives people hope .

As with religion , regarding the lottery , it pays to be rational .
Here 's the relevant study by Brickman comparing lottery winners ' happiness with that of people crippled in a car crash :

Still , there are many intelligent religious people who actively think about their faith rather than blindly following .
This might be puzzling to some , but imagining that they do n't really believe what they claim to believe does n't change reality .

I really do n't understand what you are trying to say in this posting .
I think you are saying that only stupid believe in God .
Many great thinkers ( like Steven Hawking , William Buckley , and Einstein ) , far smarter than your friends , I suspect , believe .
Leibnitz argued that belief actually makes more sense than non-belief , because there are so many questions that cannot be answered if one does not believe .
The whole concept of Faith depends on believing without proof - that 's why it is called Faith .
Interestingly enough , many of your friends have an equal amount of Faith in disbelief with no more proof than the believers .
I , by the way , am an agnostic that has tremendous respect for believers because they have made a conscious leap of faith rather than a passive , uninformed one .
Who are the smart and thoughtful ones now ?

You say that as if ' believing ' gave you the answers .
> they have made a conscious

There 's nothing " conscious " about pretending your data means more than it does .
There 's nothing " passive " about watching the world closely to learn what 's real and what 's not .
Reason is the essence of consciousness , and the only advantage to being a human being .
Posted by : Crid at September 19 , 2006 10:52 AM
Faith = unquestioning acceptance in what you are told .
Thinking = rational and analytical thought about what you are told .
Pick one .
You can't have both .
Just because there are many things we do n't understand , it does n't logically mean that " God did it " .
For example , using that reasoning , if you can't explain to me in great detail how a computer works , then I can just say " God did it " .
It 's not an answer .
And if faith is so admirable , then you should apply it to all aspects of your life .
Just believe everything everyone tells you .
See how far that gets you .

Dennett 's policy recommendation is bad .
Granted , he is not recommending religious indoctrination , but if you know religion is bunk why give it any space in school .
Religion through the ages can be covered in passing in History class .
I.e . If you know Nazism is bad , do n't show the propaganda films , show what they did and why they were wrong .
And how about the religion of environmentalism ?
Should we be indoctrinating children with the latest anti-industrial green propaganda .
They are getting it in spades right now .
Ask any 17 year olds and I 'd bet 7 of 10 will tell you Capitalism is destroying the world .
How do they know ?

My family is made up of baptist preachers and church workers , there 's probably 4 grandkids out of 20 not serving in the church ( me included ) .
Growing up in Sugar Land , it became such a strange thing for me going to church that it 's confused me even to this day .
Parents seemed to use it as a way to validate that they 're bringing up their kids " right " and everyone else just seemed to enjoy what was , to me , just a glorified country club .
I 'm as analytical as one could get about all of these things , but the difference to me is that the people who seem to support certain organized religions make it what ( if it is true ) it was never supposed to be .
I 've read The Book from cover to cover and still have no clue to how it stands against progressive thinking .
That 's all they said Jesus ever talked about " be kind to others , do n't be quick to vengence or violence , think for yourselves , do n't let the priests do it for you ; you should n't judge others , but also you should n't let others judge for you what 's right and wrong " was the essence of his words - to me anyway .
I do n't consider them " holy words " ( that 's why there 's so much conflict about Jesus , a ( hu ) man , not just a voice from the sky - now THAT would have gotten some attention ) - they very well could have been the words of some translator years later for all I know .
The point is that that is all I know and I 'm willing to admit that .
Watching an entire generation of my family turn fanatical about anything from abortion to inter-racial marriage to staying out after nine led me to laughing my arse off reading a line Amy told someone " Funny how what you believe is right for him directly correlates to what would make you happy . "
Sorry if I misquoted , I 've read too many of your advice responses to remember exactly which one it was from .

The bible was actually first written down hundreds of years after Jesus and all the disciples were dead , based on campfire tales .
I think the first compilation was around 1200 ?
Then it was edited for hundreds of years by politically motivated religious leaders for their own political and financial gain .
What we have now is the result of a very long game of telephone , and you know how that usually ends up .

While canonization certainly took hundreds of years , many the texts of the New Testament are dated in the first century AD .
Posted by : Mr. Grouchypants at September 19 , 2006 2:03 PM
Right , Canada ?
Once they had a sermon called " The Great Author " and of course it was all about how the big man upstairs " inspired " the bible , but I really thought " Finally !
They 're going to answer this " only to resort to flipping through the pages and pages of translators , editors , priests , pastors , bishops , etc. that had compiled this book from seemingly nothing .
Another time I picked up the program before being dragged into another service and it had a flow chart " surrendering your will " ->" accepting " ->" dedication " ->" recruiting " ->" invest financially " and I thought it was going to be lecturing about cults and was all excited to see the hypocrisy unfold .
It was more sad than funny as it turned out that this was their interpretaion of how to be a " successful christian " .
I completely agree that religion needs to be taught in school as a subject .
Ironically , it was a bible verse that kept me from believing every word that came out of my family 's mouths " study to show thyself approved " .
And I did .
And I found out a lot more at age 17 than I ever knew growing up , much more than I would want my children to be confronted with all at once - as freeing as it was , it still has n't helped me reason with the people who to this day refused to believe anything other than what the pastor says .
Posted by : Abby at September 19 , 2006 2:22 PM
Canada - a false dichotomy of what faith is , followed by an historical statement that is only off by oh , 1000 + years .
Yeah , you 're making a great case that you 're the one who 's thinking real hard .
Abby , most pastors I know would be surprised there is any church where congregants believe what they were told .
Maybe where you are .
Look , even as a believer , I have some sympathy with how it all looks to those who do n't believe , and I think I have some small understanding of that .
But people with honest curiosity do n't go looking for things to ridicule , they go looking for good expositors who can inform them of something , even if they decide that there is no reason to adopt the ideas oneself .
When people have to ridicule - anything , not just faith - red flags go up that they might have " issues . "
( Sorry to resort to a modern cliche . )
If it 's any comfort , believers usually guess wrong , or at least overgeneralize , why people do n't believe .

Crid , I think you are confusing proof with evidence .
There is evidence for many things , even things that turn out to be untrue .
Evidence is often ambiguous .
There are many things that people could consider evidence for atheism , or evidence for faith , or evidence for belief in Curative Mushrooms .
I would suggest - and the idea is certainly not original with me - that the framing that atheism is a default logical position to which elements of faith are unnecessary additions is an inaccurate framing .
I would dare to suggest that it is an aesthetically pleasing and self - congratulatory belief shared by atheists , but one that does not accord with people as they actually are .
People all people - do actually believe things for obscure reasons , and atheists are not exempt from that .
That you are unaware of your assumptions does not mean you do n't have them .
Logical Positivism is a well - known philosophical position that has strengths and weaknesses .
It is not the philosphical version of getting down to bare metal , however .

This does n't mean we get to think whatever we want and be correct .

Not at all , it 's the correct default logical position , which is why we 're so often told that ' faith comes by hearing , ' and why Muslims pray four times a day : People need to be methodically programmed .
Even so , it 's easier than it ought to be , because atheism does n't have the built - in emotional comfort which undergirds beliefs of wish - fulfillment .
It 's cold out here .
We like it , though . >

But the construction of that paragraph suggests you need a reason to be cheerful , and if you can't find one through logic , you 'll find it through faith .
Good luck out there .

Posted by : Abby at September 20 , 2006 12:10 PM
Yes , attempting to be polite when criticising does usually bring out the prig in me .
I thought this was an intellectual discussion , not a charm contest .
The disdain for philosophy as well as theology is revealing .
My limited experience is that atheists tend to be bright people who notice that they think about things more than the next person .
This quite naturally gives them a bit of condescension about the mass of humanity .
I had n't wanted to mention it at first because it seemed too insulting , and I thought I had already been difficult enough .
Then you go and hand me the insulting point I left out , uninvited .
It is definitely my opinion that atheists are ( often ) people who do n't want to think really hard about the issues .
They are unwilling to look up other people who have asked the same questions and even devoted their lives to them .
They do n't even want to work hard enough intellectually to read what other atheists think .
It 's hard to be impressed with the argument that says " I do n't even care enought to look it up , let alone think about it .
I just know I 'm right . "
That sounds remarkably like faith , and an ill - founded one at that .
It is rather like a person who cries " I am an invincible swordsman , " then puts down the epee at the first sign of an actual opponent .
" Oh. Well .
Swordsmanships 's not everything , y' know . "
If your view is " Believing in anything seems unlikely ; I 'd rather have a good time , " then that is at least consistent .
But if that 's the case , you 've lost your ground for claiming that you are being logical and others are n't .
You can't have this one both ways .
I imagine you 'll try , though .
Posted by : Assistant Village Idiot at September 20 , 2006 5:22 PM
" It is definitely my opinion that atheists are ( often ) people who do n't want to think really hard about the issues . "
You do n't seem to think all that hard either , mister ( though I do like the way you write ) .
Believe it or not , there are alternatives to religion and philosophy for explaining the world .
Sociology , psychology , and economics will be enough to keep me busy for the next few decades ( assuming I 'll be around ) .
Posted by : Lena at September 20 , 2006 5:47 PM
" It is definitely my opinion that atheists are ( often ) people who do n't want to think really hard about the issues . "
On the contrary , it 's much easier to just swallow what you 're told and not think about it .
Atheists question the status quo .
If any intelligent person actually considers whether there 's evidence for a god and does n't just take it on " faith " -- I can't see how they could believe in god .
Sam Harris gave this great example about frozen yogurt .
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14638243/site/newsweek/
" Tell a devout Christian ... that frozen yogurt can make a man invisible , " Harris writes , " and he is likely to require as much evidence as anyone else , and to be persuaded only to the extent that you give it .
Tell him that the book he keeps by his bed was written by an invisible deity who will punish him with fire for eternity if he fails to accept its every incredible claim about the universe , and he seems to require no evidence whatsoever . "

Norman is of course the most correct of us .

Amy reasserts her original proposition as evidence of um , her original proposition .
Yes , merely repeating yourself is likely to persuade people the next time .
It shows you 're listening .
Take a polite amount of time , and then come back and write " People who believe in God just believe what they 're told .
They can't be thinking about it . "
I 'm sure that will be utterly convincing after enough repetitions .
I 'm surprised Voltaire did n't use it more .
As for psychology , Lena , that 's how I make my living .
But no one has no philosphy .
If you wo n't take a good one you 'll have a bad one by default .
If you want to be not interested , that is a choice available to you .
However , you lose thereby the standing to reject someone else's .
And the last accusation that anyone who knows me would make is that I do n't think about things enough .
You may believe I do n't think accurately .
But I 've got plenty of quantity .

" If you want to be not interested , that is a choice available to you .

Some people are way beyond " wanting to be not interested " in philosophy .
I do n't know why you think that would affect their ability to smell a steaming pile of bullshit .

There is simply no rational argument for god belief .

Posted by : Amy Alkon at September 21 , 2006 8:55 AM
Canada 's definition of faith is very strange and self - serving .
Faith is believing something you cannot prove .
The definition has nothing to do with the source of the belief ( i.e. , being told ) .
Mr. Grouchypants is right in that Hawking is not a believer in the " personal god , " but does believe that there is something beyond the universe responsible fore creation .
Amy 's final posting is polemical .
The rational reason for believing is that the beginning of the universe cannot be explained without a god of sorts .
That does not mean there is a god , but it is rational reason for believing in god .
This conclusion was good enough for Einstein , but perhaps not good enough for truly great thinkers like Alkon .

Posted by : Amy Alkon at September 22 , 2006 4:12 AM
The reason Einstein's and Hawking 's belief matter is that the premise of the post is that belief in God is not rational .
The fact that hyper-rational cosmologists believe that a god precedes creation is pertinent .
Einstein believed there was a god , he did not believe there was a " personal ' god .
I am not suggesting that you ape Einstein ( a highly unlikely prospect ) , I am suggesting that belief in god is rational , and perhaps more rational than not believing .
I also propose that dismissing the existence of god is the real monkey see monkey do thinking .
Posted by : Alex at September 22 , 2006 10:49 PM
Alex , belief in god is highly irrational .
Here 's a nibble from Einstein .
Perhaps you should stop going around smearing him .
He did n't like it .

And here 's a link ( http://www.advicegoddess.com/archives/2006/09/did_einstein_be.html) to a new post I just put up in response to your Einstein smear -- and a quote from it below : " It was , of course , a lie that you read about my religious convictions , a lie
which is being systematically repeated .
I do not believe in a personal God and
I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly .

structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it . "

It 's amazing how much athiests / agnostics generalize about Christians ( and those of other belief systems as well ) .
To think that people believe in a Creator and then " try not to think about it " is absurd .
To think that intelligent design is in any way a threat to real , good science is idiotic and disingenous at best .
History is littered with prolific scientists who were Christians .
What I find amazing is the absolute fear which you people show to * any * divergent point of view .
You answer to such views is to shut them off entirely - censorship in a word .
If you are so sure of your positions then why fear opposing views ?
Of course , here comes the objective that something is going to be forced on you .
Again , more smoke and mirrors .
Discussing two opposing viewpoints is not forcing anything to anyone .
I 'm a Christian .
I want good science - we need good science .
And we also need to let our children be free to choose whether or not they believe God or man .
But you fear to give them that choice , and you will do everything in your power to prevent it .
And this is the very thing you accuse Christians of .
I welcome any debate on intelligent design , creationism - whatever , vs evolution / molecules to man .
Can you say the same ?
NO , you cannot .
Fear .

Bob , until you have proof there 's a god , you 're irrational and primitive for believing in god , and intellectually criminal for directing your children to do so , if that 's what you do .
You can choose to believe in Santa for all I care , but the problem comes when you start making political decisions based on your fervent belief , based in nothing , that Santa exists , and those political decisions affect the lives of the rest of us .
Just for example .
I do n't believe in god for the same reason I do n't believe in , say , a giant purple vagina floating over my house .
To borrow , semi- hallucinatorily , from Richard Dawkins ( I think ) .
The difference between you and me ?
I have an evidence - based filter for what 's real and what is n't .
Hence , I do n't pussyfoot around writing long posts that have nothing to do with the real issue : THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THERE'S A GOD .

I do n't know if Einstein actually believed in God or not .
I do know he said something about believing in an afterlife because energy can't be created nor destroyed .
People are welcome to believe in God or not if they want , as long as they do n't try to use that belief to justify actions that harm other people .
Killing pro-choice or pro-life people because their beliefs and actions disagree with one 's chosen belief is what is criminally wrong .
Entire areas of the country are being taught that violence against others is good if they do n't agree with our beliefs .
That 's what 's insane .

There have been many good points brought out in this discussion , and from both " sides . "
However , I have a few thoughts that I will try to convey in a polite way .
First of all , consider this : most everyone has ( at least a slightly ) different reason for believing whatever it is he / she believes , whether that person is an atheist , a creationist , or whatever .
To say that people with " faith " ( used largely in this thread in reference to a belief in God ) are simply believing in God because that 's what they 're told to do by their pastor or just because it acts as a security blanket for them is obviously erroneous ; it may ( sadly ) be true for some , but is definitely not true for all ( take me , for example ) .
Similarly , it 's odd to say that all atheists " fear " the arguments of God- believing people .
Some might , but I rather think most do n't .
I can see that many atheists ( not all ! ) view people who believe in God as simply ignorant , or even willfully " blind to the facts . "
They may wonder how people can " bring themselves " to believe in a God when they cannot ( or would not want to ) do so themselves .
However , this is based largely on opinion , as well as what a person considers to be " solid evidence . "
To illustrate , the extreme complexity in the universe is , to some , solid evidence that a Supreme Designer was / is involved .
To others , it does n't prove such a thing at all .
Whatever the case , every person ( sound in health ) has the ability to believe whatever he / she wants to believe .
If a man wants to believe that a loving God would torment a natural - born sinner in fire for all eternity ( which , as a Christian , I cannot personally find in the Bible anywhere ) , then let him believe it .
Let him teach it to his children .
As has been demonstrated by some posters in this thread , the things taught to you as a child need not determine your beliefs and actions throughout adulthood .
That said , I think the thought behind teaching school - age children about world religions is n't necessarily a bad one , providing such a thing be done in a correct and purely objective way .
I have my own reservations about it , however , simply because I doubt ( in all practicality ) that it could be done in such a manner .
As a sidenote , I think it 's probably a good idea to leave harsh language and character - bashing out of the current discussion .
There 's a lot to be said for respecting the personal dignity of others .

“ It is hell to live without hope , and religion saves people from hell . ” - Mordecai Kaplan , Rabbi
Posted by : bcoffee at October 3 , 2006 6:15 PM
There are a number of reasons people believe in stupid things .
There 's no evidence god exists .
Do I fear god believing people ?
Sure I do .
They live irrationally and get me fired from papers when I use science and reason in my work -- as opposed to mouthing the words of the bible .
They prevent stem cell research and they do a great job of keeping contraception and the morning after pill out of the hands of those who need it -- promoting disease and teen pregnancy .
The evil Pope keeps his business going - the church being the most successful multinational corporation ever - by promoting AIDs in Africa through urging people to not use condoms .
And then , take an airplane recently ?
You think the atheists are trying to blow you up , or maybe it 's the believers ?
I 'm not afraid of people 's silly , irrational thoughts -- it 's just how they apply them to my life and the lives of others .
Mordechai Kaplan does n't speak for me .
Perhaps like the Pope , he was just promoting his business .
My life has meaning because I invest it with meaning .
There 's no evidence of heaven or hell - and this is actually discussed in Judaism .
So perhaps the guy does n't know his shit .
What is " hope " exactly ?
Personally , I have rational optimism , and I do n't believe in dumb unproven crap .
I 'd venture that I 'm happier than most people ... perhaps because I do n't waste my life , since , best I can see , I have a few decades on the planet and then I 'm worms .
Like all of you will be .
Not one of you has evidence for god or heaven or hell .
Therefore believing in it is ... well , to put it politely , highly irrational .
Posted by : Amy Alkon at October 3 , 2006 6:53 PM
When people tell you their religion or belief in gods gives their life meaning , ask them : how ?
Ask them : " What does your life mean , then ? "
And then watch them squirm .

Assistant Village Idiot :
You write like an intelligent person .
I find that usually when an intelligent person is a believer , they are not really believers in the fundamentalist sense .
My wife , for example , finds deep meaning in the Judaism she was brought up with -- for instance she took Monday off and spent the entire day in Yom Kippur ceremonies .
On the other hand , when it comes to a literal belief in a " higher " being who created the universe , she 's exactly as much of an atheist as I am .
In other words , for her there is meaning in the experience of religion that has nothing to do with literal belief .
So , Assistant , I 'm wondering where you stand because you have n't made it clear to me so far .
Do you believe that there is actually a personal God who you pray to , who hears you , and is influenced by your prayer ?
Or do you not believe that , but rather find meaning in religion while also believing in a more abstract , non-personal God which does not listen to individual prayers ?
Or do you believe nothing like either of those things , but still find that your religion has meaning ?
If you do believe in the actual existence of God , I have follow - up questions :
What is your evidence ?
Or do you believe that evidence is unnecessary ?
( You seem to imply that when you deny that atheism is a good default logical position . )

Great Idea , Dark --
I 'm going to post it as a question on my blog , too .
I find it hilarious - the belief that there 's some big guy up there who gives a shit about people 's mundane little lives .
To think so is arrogant and simply silly .

Just a drive - by ...
In response to " fear " , it 's not that I fear alternative views .
It 's that I * know * that religious belief is a symptom of dangerous thinking .
It 's dangerous for people to deveop habits of mind whose end result is religion ; these habits of mind result in other negatives ( like , say , getting the incompetent George Bush elected , denying that pollution is bad , thinking it's ok to watch 3 hours of tv each day , blaming others when you become obese ) , so we might as well cut it off at the root .
It 's equally dangerous for us to teach our kids that homeopathy can cure you , or that capitalism is the " one true way " , or that Columbus was a good guy .
Are we interested in truth ?
Or do we want a " good story " instead ?
Personally , I want to promote truth , even if it 's unplesant .
The best metric of truth I know of , is coherence - root out all the internal contradictions , make sure the evidence fits , and you can be fairly sure that you 're believing something that 's true .
But , of course , it 's provisional - if you get more evidence , or get exposed to new ideas , your beliefs may be incoherent again .
It 's an ongoing process .
This is what I wish kids were taught ... this is true " critical thinking " .

Nutmeg has it exactly right .
If you do n't believe in god , I bet you do n't believe in other dumb unproven stuff like astrology , homeopathy , and mental fork - bending .

Drifted out of this one for awhile .
Amy , your quote from Einstein supports my point - he did not believe in a personal god but he believes in that there is something beyond our ability to understand .
What surprises me is your nastiness towards the mere possibility of a god .
Nothing written here disproves the existence of a broadly defined god , because it is fundamentally something that cannot be disproved .
Your faith in no god is just as uninformed as someone 's faith in a god .
Your refusal to acknowledge this either makes you illogical or a fundamentalist .
I am starting to suspect the latter .
Posted by : Alex at October 5 , 2006 2:05 PM
Believing that the universe is beyond the scope of human understanding is n't anywhere near believing in god .
Nothing here disproves the existence of a giant purple vagina hovering over my house , but , in Carl Sagan 's words , " extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . "
It 's up to the people who believe in unproven crap to prove the unproven crap actually exists .
If my belief in god is " uninformed , " is my lack of belief in a giant purple hovering vagina and a enormous throbbing green penis right now crashing through your roof equally uninformed ?
Or is it just silly to believe in something for which there is no evidence ?
What 's clear to me -- they should be teaching logic in high schools , and you should go back and take it in summer school .
I 'm illogical for demanding proof before I believe in something ?
Right .

Faith . "
There 's some actual scientific evidence for this .
If U do n't want to see it , it 's U who professes ( negative ) faith .
" Believe it or not , there are alternatives to religion and philosophy for explaining the world .
Sociology , psychology , and economics will be enough to keep me busy for the next few decades "
Now that 's a joke .
Sociology , psychology and economics are as faith - based as religion , maybe even more so , lol .
" THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THERE'S A GOD . "
True , but that does n't prove anything .
I doubt the bacteria living in my gut would be able to prove my existence as a personal being .
" people 's mundane little lives "
How an atheist can call people 's lives " mundane " and " little " is beyond me .
Surely life is the most precious thing of all , certainly if there 's no Afterlife to look forward to ?
B.t.w . I consider myself an agnostic .

Author of secret Iraq report declares Iraqi government ' in collapse '
John Byrne
Published : Thursday September 6 , 2007

State Department official says political solution ' hopeless '
The confidential version of Congress ' Congressional Research Report on Iraq declares that Iraq 's government is " in collapse , " according to the New York Daily News ' James Meek , who first acquired the report .
The report was completed Aug. 15 for the House and Senate , as President Bush geared up for a fresh battle with Congress over his intent to ' stay the course . '
RAW STORY acquired a copy of the report from the Daily News .
It can be read here in the original ( PDF ) .
" My assessment is that because of the number and breadth of parties boycotting the cabinet , the Iraqi government is in essential collapse , " Kenneth Katzman , the author of the report , said , according to Meek .
" That argues against any real prospects for political reconciliation . "
Without a political infrastructure in Iraq , any military progress would be short - lived , he added .
As a whole , the 62 - page report is typical of those conducted by the Congressional Research Service , a nonpartisan arm of Congress tasked with investigating topics of interest to members .
The report expounds on myriad aspects of Iraq 's political , economic and security challenges .
Katzman questions the troop surge in the report .
" I would even question the military progress , " he also declared .
A top diplomat -- who remained unnamed -- told Meek any political solution to the war is now " hopeless . "
" I would agree with that , " Katzman said .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki is trying to stave off the collapse of his government while fending off rivals at a time when the country has already spun out of control .
The report said al - Maliki 's government was " collapsing . "

Today at 2:30 p.m. , the clock runs out on the latest deadline for the White House to turn over materials regarding the National Security Agency 's eavesdropping program to the Senate Judiciary Committee .
The documents were originally subpoened on June 27th and were to be turned over to the committee on July 18th .
After a request from the White House the deadline was extended until today , and now White House Counsel Fred Fielding is saying that the gathering of the documents is , " by no means complete , " and wants another extension .
Last week Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said :
... he'd wait no more .
" You have rejected every proposal , produced none of the responsive documents , provided no basis for any claim of privilege and no accompanying log of withheld documents . "
And when the White House ignores this latest deadline , what will Leahy do ?
Will he issue another sternly worded letter or will he act to find the administration in contempt of Congress ?
WASHINGTON , April 8 — House Democratic leaders , in an effort to upstage Republicans on the issue of tax cuts , are preparing legislation that would permanently shield all but the very richest taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax , which is likely to affect tens of millions of families as early as next year if it is left unchanged .
The effort , which lawmakers emphasize is still in its early stages , would exempt millions of people from the tax but would have to come up with a way to offset an enormous loss of revenue in the next decade .
Measured in dollars , it would be far bigger than Democratic initiatives to provide money for children ’s health care , education or any other spending program .
The alternative minimum tax was created in 1969 to prevent millionaires from using loopholes to avoid all federal income taxes .
Under it , affected taxpayers have to do a second tax calculation without claiming popular deductions like those for state and local taxes that they have come to rely on .
It is akin to a flat tax of 26 to 28 percent .
But the tax is expanding at a rapid pace , partly because it is not adjusted for inflation .
It can hit people with incomes as low as $ 50,000 and if left unchecked is expected to affect 23 million households during the 2007 tax year — up from 3.4 million last year .

I first saw one of Henry Darger 's paintings at a group show at the American Visionary Art Museum and was stunned by the color and composition of the work as well as the heartbreaking story that accompanied it .
Since then , I 've kept a keen lookout for opportunities to see more of his work .
No matter how much I see , I 'm always enthralled anew .
Appreciation of the art of Henry Darger is unequivocally influenced by the known facts of his life : his mother died when he was four years old after giving birth to a baby sister , whom he never saw .
When he was eight years old , his father , unable to continue caring for him , put him in an orphanage and died soon after .
Diagnosed as a disruptive trouble - maker , he was removed to various mental institutions until he ran away at age 16 .
For the next sixty - four years , he lived a reclusive life , working as a janitor in Chicago area hospitals and going to Catholic Mass daily .
Neighbors would see him going through the trash , picking out magazines and newpaper illustrations .
Finally , at age 80 , unable to climb the stairs to his rented room , he was moved to a nursing home and died shortly thereafter .
His landlord was cleaning out his room after his death and came across a startling discovery : alone in his room , Darger had created a beautiful and violent fantasy world , primarily embodied in a 15,000 page epic narrative , " The Story of the Vivian Girls , in What is known as the Realms of the Unreal , of the Glandeco - Angelinnian War Storm , Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion . "
Illustrated by several hundred large watercolors paintings as well as smaller drawings and collages , the Vivian Girls are seven preadolescent sisters , princesses , sometimes depicted as hermaphrodites , who fight against and ultimately prevail over evil deeds prepetrated by sadistic adults .
They are aided in their battles by various Christian armies and also by Blengins , dragon - like animals , both fearsome and gentle , that are absolute protectors of children .
The illustrations range from calm and pastoral to brutally violent .
Darger was apparently not satisfied with his ability to draw the human form , so he used tracings of figures from newspapers , comic books and magazine photographs to illustrate his heroines , compiling a gestural dictionary that he used over and over .
There is an otherworldliness in this combination of comic - book - like characters set against lush , panoramic backgrounds and huge cloud formations ( he was also an obsessive weather buff ) .
The sexual undertones of the work itself and the voyeurism inherent in viewing work that the artist never meant to be shown furthers the unsettling nature of the work .
The Henry Darger Center is a not - for - profit foundation created in 1997 that offers art classes and programs to people with mental illnesses and provides exhibitions of their work .

One of the hardest things to do in any IT project ( and for that matter , probably any sort of project ) is to face up to the fact it ’s gone off the rails .
Things have gone wrong .
It ’s time to stop the madness .
There are a range of reasons it can be hard to face up to this : fear of failure , inertia , being so busy with details that you lose sight of the “ big picture ” , corporate pressure to keep going no matter what .
All the reasons and variations for failing to acknowledge that a project is in trouble usually have one thing in common : denial .
Many people seem happy pretend that so long as nobody says out loud that the project is in trouble then there is n’t actually a problem .
Nobody want to burst the illusory bubble for fear of being branded negative or , worse still , being targeted as the source of the problems ( some twisted variant of “ first who smelt it , dealt it ” ) .
The denial of the obvious is so widespread it ’s a wonder that heads are n’t exploding from cognitive dissonance in IT departments all over the world .
I was working at a large construction company recently to help them procure and deploy a project management software tool .
The company was rapidly expanding and was managing about $ 200 million worth of projects each year .
The paper based processes that had worked fine when the company was smaller ( around $ 40 million per annum ) were n’t scaling well and the pressure was starting to tell on everyone involved .
If someone in management asked the type of questions people in management like to ask ( pesky things like “ Is the project on schedule ? ” “ How much money have we spent ? ” “ How much money is still in the budget ? ” ) the short answer was “ nobody knows ” .
The longer answer was some poor bastard spent about a week out of every month chasing pieces of paper that were filed god - knows - where and desperately calling around to find someone who might know the answer .
In short , you did n’t want to be involved if there was an audit at this company .
So the decision was made to go to market and find a solution .
All of the big hitters in this market responded to the tender ( thankfully we did n’t go with the German company whose acronym rhymes with CRAP – I would have quit if they ’d won the tender ) .
The early ball - park estimate for defining requirements , sending out a tender and picking a winner was 9 months .
It ended up taking 12 months to finalise but that ’s pretty damn accurate for a ball - park estimate .
The initial estimates for getting the software configured and deployed was eight months .
Two months into the design phase the timeline had been pushed out to 12 months but nobody was panicking .
At the three month mark I realised that while maybe panic was n’t called for , we needed to stop what we were doing and seriously re-assess our approach .
One of the positives of this job was that I was generally treated very well .
By that I mean I was treated like a professional .
My experience and expertise were respected .
I was actually listened to .
Most IT people who have worked in non-IT environments ( especially something as nuts - and - bolts as construction ) will tell you how rare that is .
This had a kind of downside in that I was the “ lead analyst ” and it was down to me to make hard calls like “ we ’re going off the rails . ”
Hard as it may be to believe from reading this blog , in a work situation I do n’t really revel in being the centre of attention .
And saying that there are problems with a multi-million dollar project is a great way to REALLY be the centre of attention .
From this and other experiences I have learned a few things about how to be the bearer of potentially bad news .
So here are Mr Angry ’s tips for dealing with a project that ’s running off the rails :
1. Voice your concerns sooner rather than later Trust your instincts – if you think something ’s wrong , it probably is .
Problems rarely fix themselves magically – they usually get worse if left unresolved .
While it can be daunting to admit to having problems it is usually far easier to fix them early when they ’re first making themselves felt rather than later when they ’ve spiralled out of control .
2 . Have a plan
There ’s identifying problems and then there ’s complaining .
One platitude I ’m a big believer in is “ if you ’re not part of the solution , you ’re part of the problem . ”
If you ’re going to say there ’s a problem you should be proposing a solution or at least a strategy for reaching a solution .
At the very least identify clearly why you think the project is running off the rails .
Do n’t say “ this sucks , ” say “ if we do n’t address this problem we ’re going to face nasty outcomes x , y and z . ”
3 . Accept responsibility when appropriate I ’m not saying be a sucker or be everyone else ’s whipping boy .
But I am saying it ’s transparent and bloody annoying when someone sprays blame in every direction while claiming total innocence .
If there ’s something you need to cop to , then cop to it .
But this is a situation where you really need a solution ready .
Be prepared along the lines of “ Look , I did n’t catch this earlier so we ’ve actually been developing the project in the wrong direction .
But if we do this and this then we can get things back on track . ”
4 . Do n’t let the problem be ignored
In many cases , when you report an issue the response from management can be along the lines of “ That is n’t your responsibility , just do your job . ”
The following piece of advice is aimed at anyone and everyone who considers themselves an I.T. professional : you ’re a professional .
You have a professional responsibility to not allow important issues to be swept under the carpet .
Plus , you need to cover your butt .
Do n’t kick and pout and scream but if you ’re being told to let something go , DOCUMENT IT .
Whether it ’s the minutes of a meeting or an email to your manager , make sure your concerns as well as the instruction to let it go are clearly documented .
5 . Recognise when the problem is institutional
There are cases when the problem simply is n’t going to go away and is n’t going to be dealt with effectively .
The workplace is institutionally dysfunctional .
If you ’re stuck somewhere that punishes people who identify problems then you have to accept that reality .
I recommend a two - pronged course of action : first , cover you butt ( see point 4 , above ) .
Second , GET OUT !
Seriously , this type of workplace damages your mind and soul .
Making the call that a project has gone off the rails is rarely going to be easy ( especially if it carries the connotation of “ we ’re pretty much going to have to abandon the last year ’s work . ” )
While the Chinese do n’t really use the same word for “ crisis ” and “ opportunity ” ( crisitunity ! ) in a perfect , or even pretty good , world identifying a problem is the first step to solving it .
If you or your workplace are to scared to face up to the reality of a project that ’s run off the rails , all I have to say is enjoy your death march .
Better Code Through Destruction
Larry Wall said that Perl makes easy things easy and hard things possible .
Perl is good both for writing a two - line script that saves the world at the last minute ( well , at least it saves you and your project ) and for robust projects .
However , good Perl programming techniques can be quite different between small and complex applications .
Consider , for example , Perl ’s garbage collector .
It frees a programmer from memory management issues most of the time … until the programmer creates circular references .
Perl ’s garbage collector counts references .
When the count reaches zero ( which means that no one has a reference ) , Perl reclaims the entity .
The approach is simple and effective .
However , circular references ( when object A has a reference to object B , and object B has a reference to object A ) present a problem .
Even if nothing else in the program has a reference to either A or B , the reference count can never reach zero .
Objects A and B do not get destroyed .
If the code creates them again and again ( perhaps in a loop ) , you get a memory leak .
The amount of memory allocated by the program increases without a sensible reason and can never decrease .
This effect may be acceptable for simple run-and - exit scripts , but it ’s not acceptable for programs running 24x365 , such as in a mod_perl or FastCGI environment or as standalone servers .
Circular references are sometimes too useful to avoid .
A common example is a tree - like data structure .
To navigate both directions –from root to leaves and vice versa–a parent node has a list of children and a child node has a reference to its parent .
Here are the circular references .
Many CPAN modules implement their data models this way , including HTML :: Tree , XML :: DOM , and Text : : PDF :: File .
All these modules provide a method to release the memory .
The client application must call the method when it no longer needs an object .
However , the requirement of an explicit call is not very appealing and can result in unsafe code :
## ## Code with a memory leak # use HTML :: TreeBuilder ; foreach my $ filename ( @ARGV ) { my $ tree = HTML :: TreeBuilder ->new ; $ tree -> parse_file ( $ filename ) ; next unless $ tree -> look_down ( ' _tag ' , 'img ' ) ; ## ##
Do the actual work ( say , extract images ) here ## ... ## and release the memory ## $ tree -> delete ; }
The problem in the code is the next statement ; HTML documents with no <img ... tags will not be released .
Actually , any call of next , last , return ( inside a subroutine ) , or die ( inside an eval {} block ) is unsafe and will lead to a memory leak .
Of course , it is possible to move the release code into a continue block for last or next , or to write code to delete the tree before every return or die , but the code easily becomes messy .
There is a better solution –the paradigm of “ resource acquisition is initialization ( and destruction is resource relinquishment ) . ”
( Ironically , the second half of its name is often omitted , even though it ’s probably the most important part ) .
The idea is simple .
Create a special guard object ( of another class ) whose sole responsibility is to release the resource .
When the guard object gets destroyed , its destructor deletes the tree .
The code may look like :
## ##
A special sentry object is employed ## use HTML :: TreeBuilder ; foreach my $ filename ( @ARGV ) { my $ tree = HTML :: TreeBuilder ->new ; $ tree -> parse_file ( $ filename ) ; my $ sentry = Sentry - > new ( $ tree ) ; next unless $ tree -> look_down ( ' _tag ' , 'img ' ) ; ## ## next , last or return are safe here .
##
Tree will be deleted automatically .
## } package Sentry ; sub new { my $ class = shift ; my $ tree = shift ; return bless {tree => $ tree} , $ class ; } sub DESTROY { my $ self = shift ; $ self -> { tree} -> delete ; }
Note that now there is no need to call $ tree -> delete explicitly at the end of the loop .
The magic is simple .
When program flow leaves the scope , $ sentry is reclaimable because it participates in no circular references .
The code of DESTROY method of the Sentry package calls , in turn , the method delete of the $ tree object .
This is one solution for all means ; memory will be released however you leave the block .
Finally , there is no need to code your own Sentry class .
Use Object :: Destroyer , originally written by Adam Kennedy .
As you may guess by its name , it is the object to destroy other objects :
## ##
An of - the - CPAN solution with Object : : Destroyer ## use HTML :: TreeBuilder ; use Object :: Destroyer 2.0 ; foreach my $ filename ( @ARGV ) { my $ tree = HTML :: TreeBuilder ->new ; my $ sentry = Object :: Destroyer -> new ( $ tree , ' delete ' ) ; $ tree -> parse_file ( $ filename ) ; next unless $ tree -> look_down ( ' _tag ' , 'img ' ) ; ## ##
You can safely return , die , next or last here .
## }
Because the name of the release method may vary between modules , it is the constructor ’s second argument .
Finally , you can destroy any data structure , not just objects , if you provide code to do so .
Pass in a subroutine reference or an anonymous subroutine :
## ##
An unblessed data structure with circular references ## that cannot untangle itself .
## use Object :: Destroyer 2.0 ; while ( 1 ) { my ( %a , % b ) ; $ a{b} = \ %b ; $ b{a} = \ %a ; my $ sentry = Object : : Destroyer -> new ( sub { undef $ a{b} } ) ; }
Just for fun , comment out the line with the $ sentry object and watch the memory consumption of the running script .
Using Object :: Destroyer As a Wrapper
Object :: Destroyer can make life easier for module authors , too .
If you have written a library with circular references , you may ask your clients to explicitly call a disposal method or use a new feature of Perl ( stable since 5.8 ; see Scalar : : Util ) –weak references .
Weak references do not increment reference counts of the objects to which they refer , so the Perl garbage collector can collect the referents .
In the tree example , all references from leaves to parents ( but not vice versa , or the tree will be lost ! ) may be weak .
When the final reference to the root node goes away , Perl will dispose of it , which will remove its references to all of its children recursively .
They will all reach zero , and Perl will reclaim them all down the branches of the tree to every leaf .
Indeed , some CPAN modules use this approach ( XML : : Twig ) .
However , this solution works only if weak refs are available ; this is certainly not the case for older Perl .
Secondly , this may require quite a bit of rewriting ( there are nine calls to weaken throughout the code of XML :: Twig 3.26 ) .
Alternatively , you may use Object :: Destroyer internally in your library code .
It can work as an almost transparent wrapper around your object :
## ## Object :: Destroyer as a wrapper ## package My :: Tree ; use Object :: Destroyer 2.0 ; sub new { my $ class = shift ; my $ self = bless {} , $ class ; $ self - > populate ; return Object : : Destroyer -> new ( $ self , ' release ' ) ; } sub release{ ## actual memory release code } sub say_hello{ my $ self = shift ; print " Hello , I 'm object of class " , ref ( $self ) , "
" ; } package main ; { my $ tree = My :: Tree ->new ; $ tree -> say_hello ; ## ## $ tree -> release will be called by Object : : Destroyer ; ## }
The object $ tree in the client code is actually an Object : : Destroyer object that dispatches all invoked methods to the underlying object of class My :: Tree .
The method say_hello sees no difference at all–it receives an original $ self object .
Changes to code are minimal and well localized .
The approach has a limitation , too : clients must not access attributes of the object directly ( such as $ tree -> {age} ) .
This is a bad practice in client code anyway .
Additionally , there is a small time penalty for method calls by client - side code .
Calls made from the library code itself are not affected .
Exceptions and Resource Deallocation
Resource acquisition is initialization is a powerful technique to apply to the management of various critical resources , not only memory .
It is most useful when using exceptions to handle errors .
This combination makes code quite reliable : exceptions separate normal execution logic and error handling , and RAII sentries guarantee the correct release of every sensitive resource .
Consider alarms as an example .
Assume that you have to call some potentially long - running ( or even never - ending ) code .
You do n’t want your script to hang up , and prefer to break its execution .
Alarms are just right for the task .
However , the first attempt at good code might be awkward :
## ## Alarm example 1 . Naive .
# # eval{ local $ SIG{ALRM} = sub { die " Timed out
" } ; alarm ( 5 ) ; long_running_code ( ) ; ## Cancel the alarm if code returned within 5 sec. alarm ( 0 ) ; } ; if ( $@ && $@ eq " Timed out
" ) { ##
Process the error here }
This code will work fine until long_running_code ( ) dies .
In this case , the eval block will catch the die , but not the alarm .
If this occurred in a program that must run 24 hours a day , the program would end in 5 seconds .
This next example is much better ; actually it is real - world code .
It is enough for many applications .
However , it ’s not completely bulletproof either :
## ## Alarm example 2 . A standard solution .
## eval{ local $ SIG{ALRM} = sub { die " Timed out
" } ; alarm ( 5 ) ; long_running_code ( ) ; ## Cancel the alarm if long_running_code ( ) returns within 5 sec. alarm ( 0 ) ; } ; ## Cancel the alarm if the long_running_code ( ) died . alarm( 0 ) ;
How many times will the alarm be cancelled in the following example ?
## ## Alarm example 3 . Malicious code .
## LOOP : foreach my $ arg ( 1..3 ) { eval{ local $ SIG{ALRM} = sub { die " Timed out
" } ; alarm ( 5 ) ; long_running_code ( $arg ) ; alarm ( 0 ) ; } ; alarm ( 0 ) ; } sub long_running_code{ last LOOP ; }
Oops , none .
The RAII solution is more reliable :
## ## Alarm example 4 . ## Resource is under control of Object :: Destroyer ## eval{ local $ SIG{ALRM} = sub { die " Timed out
" } ; alarm ( 5 ) ; my $ sentry = Object : : Destroyer -> new ( sub {alarm ( 0 ) } ) ; long_running_code( ) ; } ;
No matter how the code exits the eval block , Perl will destroy the $ sentry object .
That destruction will call alarm ( 0 ) .
You can manage many sensitive resources this way , including file locks , semaphores , and even locks of database tables .
## ## File lock .
## use Fcntl ' : flock ' ; open my ( $fh ) , " >$filename.lock " ; eval{ flock ( $fh , LOCK_EX ) ; my $ sentry = Object : : Destroyer -> new ( sub { flock ( $fh , LOCK_UN ) } ) ; ## ##
Actual lock - sensitive code is here .
##
It is safe to die .
## } ; ## ## Semaphore ## use Thread : : Semaphore ; use Object :: Destroyer ; my $s = Thread : : Semaphore -> new ( ) ; eval{ $s -> down ; my $ sentry = Object : : Destroyer -> new ( sub { $s -> up } ) ; ## ## Critical code is here , die is safe ## } ; ## ## MySQL database table lock .
## use DBI ; my $ dbh = DBI -> connect ( " dbi:mysql : ... " , " " , " " ) ; eval{ $ dbh - > do ( " LOCK TABLE table1 READ " ) ; my $ sentry = Object : : Destroyer -> new ( sub { $ dbh -> do ( " UNLOCK TABLES " ) ; } ) ; ## ##
Again , actual code must be here ## } ;
The code is clean , simple , and quite self - explanatory .
Simple Transactions
Everyone who works with relational databases knows how useful transactions are .
One of the features of transactions is atomicity : either all modifications of data are committed at once , or all of them are ignored .
Your data is always consistent ; it ’s not possible to leave it in an inconsistent state .
The same effect is possible in Perl code :
use Object :: Destroyer 2.0 ; my ( $ account1 , $ account2 ) = ( 15 , 15 ) ; printf ( " Account1=%d , Account2=%d , Total=%d
" , $ account1 , $ account2 , $ account1+$account2 ) ; eval { my $ coderef = create_savepoint ( \$ account1 , \$account2 ) ; my $ sentry = Object : : Destroyer -> new ( $ coderef ) ; die " before changes " if rand > 0.7 ; $ account1 += 3 ; die " after account 1 was modified " if rand > 0.7 ; $ account2 -= 3 ; die " after account 2 was modified " if rand > 0.7 ; ## ##
The transaction is considered to be committed here ## and $ sentry can be dismissed .
## $ coderef ->( ) will not be called .
## $ sentry - > dismiss ; die " after transaction is committed " if rand > 0.7 ; } ; print " Died $ @ " if $ @ ; printf ( " Account1=%d , Account2=%d , Total=%d
" , $ account1 , $ account2 , $ account1+$account2 ) ; sub create_savepoint { ##
Save references to variables and their current values my @vars ; foreach my $ ref ( @_ ) { die " Can remember only scalar values " unless ref( $ref ) eq ' SCALAR ' ; push @vars , { ref => $ ref , value => $ $ref } ; } ##
A closure to restore their values return sub { foreach my $var ( @vars ) { $ { $ var - > {ref} } = $ var -> {value} ; } } ; }
Run the script several times .
Due to rand , it will break on varying lines , but it is not possible to get a Total value other than 30 .

Senator Edwards is outlining a new national security strategy that includes the creation of a 10,000 - person civilian peace corps to stem the tide of terrorism in weak and unstable countries .
Click Image to Enlarge Heuichul Kim Former North Carolina senator Edwards yesterday outlined his plan to keep Americans safe .
Mr. Edwards 's plan , which he presented in Manhattan yesterday , comes less than a week after he called President Bush 's war on terror a " bumper sticker slogan " and said the current national security strategy has not made America safer .
Despite the criticism those comments are drawing , the Democratic presidential candidate did not back down from his position yesterday and said the president 's strategy has undermined the country 's long - term safety and led to a worn - out military .
Mr. Edwards , who has garnered strong support among anti-war Democrats , also took a swipe at Mayor Giuliani , the front - runner for the Republican nomination .
" If Mayor Giuliani believes that what President Bush has done is good and wants to run a campaign for the presidency saying ,  I will give you four more years of what this president has given you , ' then he is allowed to do that , " the former North Carolina senator said .
" He will never be elected president of the United States , but he is allowed to do that . "
The comment elicited a testy response from the Giuliani campaign , which has focused largely on the former mayor 's leadership after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and his aggressive strategy for dealing with Islamic fundamentalists .
" We are glad to see Rudy 's criticism of the Democrats not understanding the terrorists ' war on us is starting to register with them , " Mr. Giuliani 's communications director , Katie Levinson , said .
" John Edwards 's track record of predicting election outcomes speaks for itself . "
The plan Mr. Edwards presented yesterday  which he dubbed " A Strategy to Shut Down Terrorists and Stop Terrorism Before It Starts "  calls for a 10,000 - person " Marshall Corps " to deal with issues ranging from worldwide poverty and economic development to clean drinking water and micro-lending .
He said investing in those areas would shore up weak nations and help ensure that terrorism does not take root there .
That , he said , would allow the country to stop potential terrorists before they even join the ranks .
There are " thousands committed to violence " today , he said , and America needs to use all of its tools to go after them .
But he said millions more people are " sitting on the fence " about whether to join those ranks .
" We have to offer them a hand to our side instead of a shove to the other side of that fence , " he said .
Mr. Edwards proposed creating a Cabinet - level position to oversee the initiative , which he said would require international allies .
The president of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , Clifford May , said he was " skeptical " of Mr. Edwards 's proposal .
" Humanitarian aid is a good thing .
I approve of that .
But it does n't really have much to do with the causes of terrorism , " Mr. May said .
" Mohamed Atta , the lead terrorist on 9/11 , was based in Germany , was well - educated .
The causes of terrorism are several , but poverty is not one of them . "
Mr. Edwards is also proposing shifting more responsibility for tactical and operational decisions to military personnel from civilian leaders .
He said he would double the budget for military recruiting in order to reduce waivers for recruits with felonies .
According to the Edwards campaign , those waivers have skyrocketed under Mr. Bush .
Mr. Edwards has called for withdrawing troops from Iraq and has called on Congress to cut off funding for the war .
Unlike Senator Clinton , who disputed his comments that America is less safe today than it was before the so - called war on terror began , Mr. Edwards is tacking to the left .
While Mrs. Clinton is seeking to create the impression that the Democrats generally hold the same position on the war , Mr. Edwards is attempting to do the opposite .
Yesterday , he was quick to respond to critics who have cast him as lily - livered and weak on national security .
" I think what we 've seen with President Bush is that he uses this doctrine to stifle debate , " Mr. Edwards said .
" He does n't want anyone to speak out in opposition .
If you speak out in opposition , you either do n't understand the threat or you 're not a patriot . "
" It does n't help that the Republican presidential candidates seem intent on trying to one - up each other , each of them trying to be a bigger , badder George Bush , " he added .
" I think they want to be George Bush on steroids . "

So , having the right bag for the thankless , sweaty - shirted journey to yet another anonymous hotel is crucial .
And indeed , it 's good to hear that computer box - shifter PC World agrees .
The retail mammoth stocks a variety of bags including the Pakuma backpack , which it describes on its website as having been specifically " designed for endurance and travel " .
It goes on to explain that " strong and robust material has been used to make the bags to ensure you will use your Pakuma bag for years to come " .
But sadly , for one El Reg reader , Dave Goodman , who bought the purportedly sturdy bag in a PC World store , one of the shoulder straps snapped when he was returning from a biz trip in Lisbon .
Dave had only purchased it a few months previously so decided to return to PC World and request an exchange .
However , on entering the Leeds branch of PC World and explaining that he had been carrying his 17 - inch Apple MacBook Pro in the bag , Dave was bemused to hear the store 's response .
" I was told , in no uncertain terms , that the bag that I had purchased was ' incompatible with Mac laptops ' . "
The store finally backed down and granted Dave a replacement only after an extremely long - winded discussion in which he was told that " Mac laptops were too heavy " .
We contacted Pakuma to find out if Mac laptops were " incompatible " with the manufacturer 's bags .
The firm told us that its backpack " could more than cope with a 17 - inch MacBook " , and added that a Dell laptop would , in fact , be " slightly heavier " than the Apple model .
Having cleared up that confusion we spoke to PC World to find out why its staff seemed to regularly shy away from anything that was n't Windows - based .
A spokesman said : " Apple is a very strong brand for us . "
He added that staff at the Leeds store believed that Dave 's 17 - inch laptop was too big for the , er , 17 - inch bag .
" I 'm glad that the issue was resolved in - store , " he concluded .
Meanwhile Dave , who compared his experience to that of Tikka and our story about PC World 's refusal to repair the hinge on his under - warranty laptop because he had installed Linux , told us :
" Unlike with Tikka , I managed to walk out of the store with a replacement .
If it occurs again though I will be installing either XP or Vista on the MacBook first so I can demonstrate that it is a PeeCee despite being manufactured by Apple . "
As for Tikka , PC World told us it is still attempting to make contact with him to carry out the repair . ®

It has been cursed by every footballer , runner and tennis star forced to remain on the bench because of injury .
But according to a new study , the much maligned Achilles tendon turns out to have played a crucial role in human history .
Scientists say its evolution two to three million years ago allowed our ancestors to run and hunt for the first time .
That freed them from a lifetime of grubbing around for berries , insects and scavenged food – and helped give them the evolutionary edge over their ape cousins .
The findings come from a new computer model of Lucy – the oldest know human ancestor who lived 3.2 million years ago .
Lucy – or Australopithecus afarensis – was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974 and named after the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds .
Although she had many ape - like characteristics – including a protruding jaw and sloping forehead – her posture that was more human than chimp .
A team at Manchester University used a computer programme to create a virtual model of her skeleton and muscles – and then put it through its paces .
To their surprise they found that Lucy was able to walk upright as efficiently as modern people .
However , her lack of an Achilles tendon at the back of her legs meant she was unable to run , the British Association science festival in York was told .
Dr Bill Sellers , who led the study , said running was a crucial step in the evolution of ape - men to modern people .
The appearance of the Achilles heel was a major milestone for our ancestors .
“ Running changes your options – if you are a runner , hunting becomes possible , ” he said .
“ You wo n't walk down your prey , but if you are an efficient long distance runner you might be bale to run down your prey .
“ Muscles are attached to bones by tendons which are big springs that store energy .
We can make a model without tendons and it turns out its rubbish – it can't go very fast and it uses an awful lot of food to get from A to B .
“ You really can't run if you do n't have an Achilles tendon . ”
None of our closest living relatives – the chimpanzee , gorilla and orang utan – has an Achilles tendon .
None are able to run .
Dr Sellers believes the tendon evolved before two million years ago .
That was the time of Homo erectus – a tall agile human ancestor .
“ I would be very surprised if the two million year old Homo erectus could n't run because you look at the skeleton and it looks so much like a human , except for the head , ” said Dr Sellers .
“ If you look at the Lucy skeleton 3.5 million years ago , it does n't look at all like a human .
It has much shorter legs and longer arms and I think there 's every chance Lucy can't run .
“ If you can find evidence of an Achilles tendon , then that will be the point which tells you when we started to run properly and picked up those big spears and started chasing things around . ”
“ POP legend Sir Elton John wants the internet CLOSED DOWN .
Never one to keep his opinions to himself , the Rocket Man has waded into cyberspace with all guns blazing .
He claims it is destroying good music , saying : “ The internet has stopped people from going out and being with each other , creating stuff .
“ Instead they sit at home and make their own records , which is sometimes OK but it does n’t bode well for long - term artistic vision .
“ It ’s just a means to an end .
“ We ’re talking about things that are going to change the world and change the way people listen to music and that ’s not going to happen with people blogging on the internet .
“ I mean , get out there — communicate .
“ Hopefully the next movement in music will tear down the internet .
“ Let ’s get out in the streets and march and protest instead of sitting at home and blogging .
“ I do think it would be an incredible experiment to shut down the whole internet for five years and see what sort of art is produced over that span .
“ There ’s too much technology available .
“ I ’m sure , as far as music goes , it would be much more interesting than it is today . ”
Multi-millionaire Elton , who turned 60 earlier this year , has admitted in the past that he is a bit behind the times .
The Grammy award - winner was once quoted as saying : “ I am the biggest technophobe of all time .
“ I do n’t have a mobile phone or an iPod or anything . ”

How Do You Talk to a CIO ?
Last week I was interviewed by a writer from a popular business magazine .
He wanted my views on the question , “ How do you talk to a CTO or CIO ? ”
It ’s an interesting question , and what makes it most interesting to me is that I ’ve never heard anyone ask the question about any other senior executive position in a company .
I do n’t hear anyone ask the question , “ How do you talk to a CFO ? ” or “ How do you talk to a COO ? ” I do n’t even hear anyone ask the question , “ How do you talk to an HR organization ? ”
So why do you think the technology organization is singled out for this type of question ?
The answer , unfortunately , is that there ’s a layer of mystery around the IT organization ; IT is less understood than any other business organization .
In my book , Boiling the IT Frog , I compare IT people to doctors , who share some of the same problems of having to communicate complex technical information .
But as I point out in the book , good doctors will get around the communication problems by focusing on the patient implications of the information :
How will a particular treatment impact the patient ?
How long will treatment take ?
What are the risks ?
How will the treatment affect the patient ’s quality of life in the long term ?
What kind of success rate does such a treatment have ?
These are all questions that skirt around the “ how does it work ” technical core of the issue at hand , but most doctors do n’t feel the need to go into the details of how a particular treatment works , since the description of the patient impact is more relevant and more easily understood by the patient .
IT issues are just like the issues of medical treatment .
Every business is made up of hundreds of processes : some which use computers and some which do n’t .
Any IT project will affect some of those processes – some will be improved and some will be negatively impacted .
The negative impacts can range from rigidity ( making a process more difficult to change in the future ) to cost ( making a process more expensive , hopefully with a counter - balancing reduction in cost or an improvement in revenue or profitability elsewhere in the business ) .
So just as a medical procedure has an impact on the body ’s processes , an IT project will have an impact on business processes .
A good IT executive will discuss the pluses and minuses of IT projects with business executives in much the same way that a doctor will discuss various treatment options with a patient .
It ’s a high - level discussion that focuses on positive and negative outcomes , project durations , risks and success rates .
At the end of the discussion the business executives should feel like they ’ve been presented with enough information to make choices , and that ’s all that the discussion is intended to do .
A good IT executive wo n’t attempt to explain technical issues unless the business executives ask , just as a doctor wo n’t go into the medical details unnecessarily .
If a project requires an unproven technology , then that ’s important to know , but only as it impacts the risk of the project and the probability of success .
Bad IT executives talk to business executives in great detail about the technology that will be used , why it was chosen , and why it ’s the best technology for the project .
These bad IT executives do n’t seem to realize that ( a ) the business executives do n’t care , and ( b ) the business executives just get more confused and uncomfortable when they are provided all of this useless ( in their opinion ) information .
It ’s bad IT executives who make the business executives ask , “ How do you talk to a CTO or CIO ? ”
But the real answer is to replace your IT executive with someone for whom the question does n’t have to be asked .
The Flip Side
Now you may ask , “ Are n’t business executives sometimes at fault as well ? ” Absolutely .
Just as there are bad patients who try to tell surgeons how to operate , there are bad business executives who try to force specific solutions on an IT organization rather than keep the discussion at the level of benefits and costs .
In medicine we see drug manufacturers doing an end run around doctors by advertising specific drugs directly to the patient .
And in the IT industry we see technology vendors using the same end run approach to try to sell hardware and software solutions directly to business executives .
But when a patient who is sold on a new drug goes to his doctor , it ’s the doctor ’s responsibility to determine whether or not the drug is the best treatment for the patient ’s condition .
And the same thing applies when a business executive who has been sold by a technology vendor goes to his or her IT organization to request the technology .
It ’s the IT executive ’s responsibility to look at the real business problem that the business executive is trying to solve , and to recommend a solution that is optimized for the specific business need .
That might be the technology that the business executive wants , but there may be an alternative technology which better meets the real business need , has lower risk , or fits better with the overall IT architecture of the business .
If there is in fact a better alternative and the IT executive fails to convince the business executive , then one of two things is going on :
The IT executive does n’t have enough trust and support from the CEO to stand up for what ’s right , or The IT executive does n’t have the communication and political skills required for the senior IT position .
In either case the IT executive – and in fact the entire IT organization – is headed toward failure , just as a doctor will fail who prescribes drugs just because a patient wants them .
An IT organization can survive a few of these failures , but if there are any more than a few , then the quality and reputation of the IT organization will sink rapidly as the number of unconnected and uncontrolled systems grows within the business .
When non-technology people control technology choices , chaos will ensue .

Even if you never read a single thing Dave Winer wrote in his 439 years of blogging , it ’s worth taking time to study his ideas about comments on blogs ( he does n’t allow them ) .
“ …to the extent that comments interfere with the natural expression of the unedited voice of an individual , comments may act to make something not a blog… .
The cool thing about blogs is that while they may be quiet , and it may be hard to find what you ’re looking for , at least you can say what you think without being shouted down .
This makes it possible for unpopular ideas to be expressed .
And if you know history , the most important ideas often are the unpopular ones … .
That ’s what ’s important about blogs , not that people can comment on your ideas .
As long as they can start their own blog , there will be no shortage of places to comment . ”
The important thing to notice here is that Dave does not see blog comments as productive to the free exchange of ideas .
They are a part of the problem , not the solution .
You do n’t have a right to post your thoughts at the bottom of someone else ’s thoughts .
That ’s not freedom of expression , that ’s an infringement on their freedom of expression .
Get your own space , write compelling things , and if your ideas are smart , they ’ll be linked to , and Google will notice , and you ’ll move up in PageRank , and you ’ll have influence and your ideas will have power .
When a blog allows comments right below the writer ’s post , what you get is a bunch of interesting ideas , carefully constructed , followed by a long spew of noise , filth , and anonymous rubbish that nobody … nobody … would say out loud if they had to take ownership of their words .
Look at this innocent post on a real estate blog .
By comment # 6 you ’re already seeing complete noise .

I do n’t know how many times I ’ve read a brilliant article someone wrote on a blog .
By the end of the article , I ’m excited , I ’m impressed , it was a great article .
And then you get the dribble of morbid , meaningless , thoughtless comments .
If the article , for example , mentions anything in anyway related to Microsoft , you get some kind of open source nuclear war .
If the article mentions web browsing in any way , there ’s always some person without an outbound filter who feels compelled to tell you about how he uses Opera , so he does n’t have this problem , although , frankly , I could care less what Anonymous uses .

Dave is absolutely right .
The way to give people freedom of expression is to give them a quiet place to post their ideas .
If other people disagree , they ’re welcome to do so … on their own blogs , where they have to take ownership of their words .
I ’m really losing patience with anonymous posts , “ anon ” , “ anon for this one , ” people who do n’t even have the energy to sign their messages with a made up name and leave the whole signature blank .
Frankly if every anonymous post disappeared from the Joel on Software discussion group , the overall quality of the conversation would go up , way up , and the discussion would be way more interesting .
Try this as an experiment : read through the last few dozen topics on the discussion group , and imagine that all the “ anonymous ” and signed - blank posts just disappeared .
Would the quality of conversation be higher ?
Would that be a place you ’d be more likely to want to spend time in ?

James can tell you the petrogenetic peculiarities of low - alkali tholeiitic basalt after hydrothermal alteration .
But our hero James recently demonstrated that there is a significant difference between intelligence and common sense .
While casting about for ways to rid himself of a pesky wasp nest , his eye fell upon his trusty Dirt Devil vacuum cleaner .
Armed with this fearsome weapon , James attacked the wasp nest .
He sucked up all the wasps , who buzzed angrily as they struggled in vain against the wind - tunnel .
The dustbag was soon alive with their buzzing .
James now found that he had a new problem : to wit , a vacuum cleaner bag full of live , disgruntled wasps .
He had to find a way to kill them before he could safely turn off the vacuum .
And while his previous idea was merely ill - considered , his next was a moronic masterpiece .
He held the vacuum tube in one hand , a can of RAID in the other , and proceeded to spray the insecticide into the vacuum .
What our smart young scientist failed to remember is that aerosols are flammable , and vacuum cleaner motors generate heat .
The resulting explosion removed his facial hair , and scattered the dusty , angry contents of the Dirt Devil all over the vicinity .
Adding insult to injury , James was not the only one to survive with minor injuries .
The wasps proceeded to vent their spleen upon the exposed ( and slightly scorched ) skin of the scientist , who referred to the episode as " an unfortunate lapse in calculation of consequences . "

Description :
We find that income matters more in “ red America ” than in “ blue America . ”
In poor states , rich people are much more likely than poor people to vote for the Republican presidential candidate , but in rich states ( such as Connecticut ) , income has a very low correlation with vote preference .
In addition to finding this pattern and studying its changes over time , we use the concepts of typicality and availability from cognitive psychology to explain how these patterns can be commonly misunderstood .
Our results can be viewed either as a debunking of the journalistic image of rich “ latte ” Democrats and poor “ Nascar ” Republicans , or as support for the journalistic images of political and cultural differences between red and blue states — differences which are not explained by differences in individuals ’ incomes .
For decades , the Democrats have been viewed as the party of the poor , with the Republicans representing the rich .
Recent presidential elections , however , have shown a reverse pattern , with Democrats performing well in the richer “ blue ” states in the northeast and west coast , and Republicans dominating in the “ red ” states in the middle of the country .
Through multilevel modeling of individual - level survey data and county - and state - level demographic and electoral data , we reconcile these patterns .
Key methods used in this research are : ( 1 ) plots of repeated cross-sectional analyses , ( 2 ) varying - intercept , varying - slopemultilevelmodels , and ( 3 ) a graph that simultaneously shows within - group and between - group patterns in a multilevel model .
These statistical tools help us understand patterns of variationwithin and between states in a way thatwould not be possible from classical regressions or by looking at tables of coefficient estimates .
Brad Fitzpatrick , the founder of LiveJournal , who recently left Six Apart for Google has published notes on what he 's going to be working on moving forward .
It is an interesting read entitled Brad 's Thoughts on the Social Graph which contains the following excerpts
Currently if you 're a new site that needs the social graph ( e.g. dopplr.com ) to provide one fun & useful feature ( e.g. where are your friends traveling and when ? ) , then you face a much bigger problem then just implementing your main feature .
You also have to have usernames , passwords ( or hopefully you use OpenID instead ) , a way to invite friends , add / remove friends , and the list goes on .
So generally you have to ask for email addresses too , requiring you to send out address verification emails , etc .
Then lost username / password emails .
etc , etc .
If I had to declare the problem statement succinctly , it'd be : People are getting sick of registering and re-declaring their friends on every site . , but also : Developing " Social Applications " is too much work .
Facebook 's answer seems to be that the world should just all be Facebook apps .
...
Goals :
1. Ultimately make the social graph a community asset , utilizing the data from all the different sites , but not depending on any company or organization as " the " central graph owner .
Establish a non-profit and open source software ( with copyrights held by the non-profit ) which collects , merges , and redistributes the graphs from all other social network sites into one global aggregated graph .
This is then made available to other sites ( or users ) via both public APIs ( for small / casual users ) and downloadable data dumps , with an update stream / APIs , to get iterative updates to the graph ( for larger users ) ...
Non-Goals :
The goal is not to replace Facebook .
I n fact , most people I 've talked to love Facebook , just want a bit more of their already - public data to be more easily accessible , and want to mitigate site owners ' fears about any single data / platform lock - in .
Early talks with Facebook about participating in this project have been incredibly promising .
It seems to me that Facebook is the new Microsoft in that there are now a significant amount of people who are either upset at the level of " lock - in " they have created or are just plain jealous of their " wealth " who have created dedicated efforts to break their hegemony .
It 'll be interesting watching this play out .
From my perspective , I 'm skeptical of a lot of the talk about social network portability because the conversation rarely seems to be user centric .
Usually it 's creators of competing services who are angry about " lock - in " because they can't get a new user 's contacts from another service and spam them to gain " viral growth " for their service .
As for the various claims of social network overload only the power users and geeks who join a new social network service a month ( WTF is Dopplr ? ) have this problem .
A real social network is a community and users do n't change communities at the drop of a hat .
What I find more interesting is being able to bridge these communities instead of worrying about the 1 % of users who hop from community to community like crack addled humming birds skipping from flower to flower .
I 'll put it this way , when it comes to email which is more important ?
The ability to send emails to people regardless of what email service or mail client they use or the ability to import your contact list from one free email service into another when you switch service providers ?
Update
Apple and EMI announced today that the music label will begin selling all of its music through the iTunes Store , DRM - free .
During a press conference in London this morning , EMI said that all of its unprotected tracks will be available worldwide from the iTunes Store starting in May for $ 1.29 and that customers will be able to upgrade their already - purchased EMI tracks for 30 ¢ if they so choose .
EMI and Apple said that the bit rate of EMI 's tracks will be bumped up as well .
EMI 's catalog will now be available as 256 kbps AAC files , upgraded from 128 kbps .
" We believe that offering consumers the opportunity to buy higher quality tracks and listen to them on the device or platform of their choice will boost sales of digital music , " said EMI CEO Eric Nicoli during this morning 's press conference .
Customers who are not interested in the higher - quality , unprotected AAC files will still be able to buy protected tracks at 128 kbps for 99¢ apiece .
EMI said that the iTunes Store will be the first to carry its higher - quality , unprotected music .
The company will also be selling unprotected music videos through iTunes with no change in price , and plans to continue selling full upgraded albums at the existing wholesale prices .
It appears as if EMI and Apple are using the excuse of upgraded sound quality for the reason behind the individual track price bump , and not the lack of DRM .
Whatever the true reason for the price bump , this ultimately breaks the ( up until today ) very consistent pricing scheme of the iTunes Store , and opens up the doors for other artists to start pricing their tracks differently — DRMed or not .
One side effect : other music labels may now feel pressure to join EMI in dropping DRM through iTunes .
There is no doubt that the rest of the Big Four will be watching this move very closely .
Original story
EMI will announce on Monday that it will be freeing much of its catalog from the shackles of DRM .
The Wall Street Journal , citing " people familiar with the matter , " reports ( sub. required ) that Apple CEO Steve Jobs will be present at the announcement in London and that the music will be sold through the iTunes Store and possibly other online outlets .
The news comes less than two months after Apple published Steve Jobs ' famous open letter on the issue of DRM .
In his missive , Jobs laid the blame for the DRM mess squarely at the feet of the music industry and said that he would gladly sell unprotected music if only the record labels would agree .
Jobs noted that if DRM requirements were removed , " the music industry might experience an influx of new companies willing to invest in innovative new stores and players . "
( Jobs also argued that interoperable DRM schemes are inherently less secure than closed systems — a questionable assertion , at best . )
EMI and the other Big Four labels have been beset by falling revenues over the past few years .
Digital downloads are growing , but not quickly enough to offset the large declines in CD sales .
Suggestions to drop the DRM have been widespread , and the recent formation of a licensing authority — Merlin — which combines a bunch of independent labels into a " virtual fifth major " have increased the pressure for change .
In early February rumblings were heard that EMI was thinking about ditching DRM , but EMI was unable to entice the likes of Apple , Microsoft , and others .
As it turned out , EMI wanted a considerable advance payment to offset what it perceived as a " risk " : selling DRM - free music online .
EMI 's position was simple : if they sell music without DRM , then users will find trading it that much easier .
What this view ignores is the fact that DRM - free music already flows online , on P2P networks and USENET , among other places .
This happens ( in part ) because CDs are , by and large , free of DRM and easy to rip .
When more details of the announcement become available Monday , we 'll update here as necessary .

JSR - 166 helped bring Doug Lea 's concurrency framework into Java Standard Edition 5 .
This work carried forward into Java SE 6 as jsr166x , which added a number of features to the Java collections framework for concurrency .
Although the contents of Java SE 7 are still in flux , early candidates for inclusion are are already taking shape in jsr166y : a fork / join framework and a transfer queue .
InfoQ spoke with Doug Lea about these features and concurrency in Java SE 7 .
The fork / join framework is a " multicore - friendly lightweight parallel framework " that supports a style of parallel programming where problems are recursively split into smaller fragments , solved in parallel and recombined , as described in this pseudocode from A Java Fork / Join Framework :
Result solve ( Problem problem ) {
if ( problem is small )
directly solve problem
else {
split problem into independent parts
fork new subtasks to solve each part
join all subtasks
compose result from subresults
}
}
This ensures that the work can be accomplished in parallel and works well on multi-core systems :
Big ( 32 + ) multicores will be coming out in volume during the lifetime of Java 7 , and having this framework in place will allow people running them to get relatively simple speedups for computation - intensive tasks .
Right now , forkjoin works best on machines like Sun Niagaras and Azuls , which are the only current processors of the form that will soon be common .
It also works well on standard SMPs .
In general , you do n't get many speedup benefits with less than 4 processors though -- the main targets are in the dozens to hundreds of processors range .
Given a sufficiently - decomposed task size , the cost of executing the task may be exceeded by the cost of creating a thread .
Accordingly , the fork / join framework uses thread pools which can be sized appropriately to the number of available cores to reduce the swapping overhead .
To avoid straggling threads , the framework includes a work - stealing approach where a thread with no work can poach queued work from a slower - executing thread .
The A Java Fork / Join Framework paper describes the mechanisms used by the fork / join framework and shows examples of performance in multicore systems and comparisons to other similiar kinds of parallel programming frameworks .
Describing the likely usage scenarios and adoption for the fork / join framework , Doug Lea said :
Overall , I expect an adoption curve vaguely similar to other concurrency utilities .
At first only a few people who really need them will use them , but eventually , it will be hard to find programs that do n't somehow rely on them , often buried deep inside infrastructure components .
For this reason , surface syntax support might not be all that important anyway -- the kinds of library / component developers most likely to want to incorporate them are more likely to put up with awkward usage .
Ideally , there will be several layers of usages : " Do this stuff in parallel " level , where a language or tools translates into parallel - ese , while also checking for safety / liveness .
This is still partially in the realm of research though .
Arranging for parallel operations on collections .
-- map , reduce , apply , etc .
Programmers who can think about manipulating collections using aggregate all - at - once operations can use these to speed up common kinds of processing .
( This is the ListTasks , ArrayTasks , etc layer . )
Hand - crafting an efficient forkjoin solution for a given problem .
This is the layer I 'm right now concentrating on , to be sure we can support the wide range of parallel algorithms possible using work - stealing frameworks .
( Some of the currently odd - looking and under - explained methods like isQuiescent are designed for such advanced usages .
Most programs just use " fork " and " join " , but the others are there when you need them . )
Extending the framework to create new kinds of ForkJoinTasks etc .
For example , those that operate transactionally .
Only a very small number of people ( for example , perhaps the Fortress runtime library developers ) will ever need to do this , but there need to be enough base extension hooks to pull this off .
Another candidate for Java SE 7 is the TransferQueue .
TransferQueue extends the Blocking Queue interface by adding producer - side blocking where the producer transfers an object to the consumer when both are ready .
Non-blocking and timeout - style transfers are also available .
This is suitable for some kinds of message - passing applications where a hand - off can be necessary , and " to create a simpler - to - use thread pool , in which sometimes tasks must be synchronously transfered "
The transfer queue and fork / join framework may not be the only concurrency features added to Java SE 7 .
According to Doug Lea , there is an ongoing wishlist of new and request - for - enhancement features , including scalable counters , a ConcurrentIdentityHashMap , " additions to the atomics package to better support expert - mode fine - tuning of memory model effects " and algorithmic improvements to java.util .
Collections .
The jsr166y effort builds on the work done in Java SE 6 as jsr166x , which brought new collections into Java SE6 : Deque , BlockingDeque , NavigableSet , NavigableMap and ConcurrentNavigableMap ( as well as the implementing classes , ArrayDeque , LinkedBlockingDeque , ConcurrentSkipListSet , ConcurrentSkipListMap and enhancements to TreeMap ) .

Tony Tether has headed up the Pentagon 's way - out research arm , Darpa , since 2001 .
That makes him the longest - serving director in the agency 's nearly 50 - year history .
He sat down with me for an interview in his office , on the top floor of a blandly menacing Northern Virginia office building , last December .
For my story in the March issue of Wired ( online next Tuesday ) , Tether and I talked about everything from bio-terrorists to zombie rodents to thinking machines to the golf courses in Iraq .
Here 's the transcript .
Noah Shachtman :
So , again , thanks for doing this .
Let 's start with the big picture and talk a little bit about 9/11 – it '? s been five years now -?-?
and how , obviously , that has affected defense research hugely .
What do you see as Darpa 's big contributions to the war on terror ?
What do you think has been contributed so far , and what do you think is on the horizon that might be the most valuable ?
Tony Tether :
We have several efforts in use in Iraq and
Afghanistan today .
There 's been somewhat of a misunderstanding that when 9/11 unfolded that Darpa suddenly turned totally toward supplying things for the war .
Now , of course , the war made us a great deal more interested in trying to find out what the issues and problems were over there so that we could develop programs along that line .
And we have .
Those programs are long - range and , for the most part , they '?re things that wo n't really come to fruition for several years .
On the other hand , Darpa had started many things in the '90s , because we 've been looking at this global terrorist war since probably
1994 .
At that time we called it the transnational threat – ??
you know , a threat without a country .
At the same time , there was a great push to look at the way our forces were developed and move them from huge divisions , force on force , to small units of action , back to the squad ...
As it turned out , 2001 came and we went into war in both
Afghanistan and Iraq , and , after the major conflict in Iraq , really small units became the way we were orchestrating that war .
And it was probably that way from the very beginning in Afghanistan .
So the technologies that we have been developing for four or five years , some of them were already ready to go .
NS : Can you give me an example ?
TT : One of the major things we knew a small unit would need , especially in a city , was situational awareness .
Knowing what 's on the next block – not what 's 10 , 15 miles away .
So we developed â ??
we already had been developing – a small platform that we call Wasp .
It was based on a multifunctional technology approach .
This was in the Defense
Sciences Office here .
The program manager said ,
We really want things to be electric - driven because they 're very quiet , very efficient .
Though , usually , if you put just a battery on an airplane you get only
15 minutes of flight time .
But why do we have to do it that way ?
Why ca n't we make the structure of the airplane the battery ?
And if we do that we should be able to get much better performance .
Well , he developed a little thing called the Wasp , and in the initial version the wings were actually the battery .
He found that by doing it that way , rather than 15 minutes of flight time , we were able to get an hour and a half to two hours of time .
Once that happened we realized we could put sensors on it .
Then we put a comlink on it and GPS .
NS : Sure , and that drains battery time .
TT : And that drains battery time .
But we were still maintaining well over an hour of flight time .
That little Wasp is in use in Iraq today .
NS : Do you have a sense of [ how many ] ? , I mean , is it in use in tens , hundreds of units ?
S : Well , I know it 's in use in close to 200 of them .
And it 's being used by small units â ??
small units that are using it , as they consider it , like a guardian angel .
And the reason they like it is because it 's very quiet .
It can fly over them , and it can't be seen because it ' ??s so small .
And it can't be heard because it 's electric - driven .
That exactly fits into the original concept we had way back in the '90s .
NS : And how about something that maybe is n't on the battlefield right this second , but maybe just on the horizon ?
TT : Well , we are working hard .
One problem is language .
We realized that we 're either going to have to teach all of our soldiers
16 different languages or come up with the technology to do so , to help them out .
When 2001 came we had already been working on a Phraselator , which is a [ simple , ] one - way [ translation ] device .
One - way in that it has phrases in it that in any of eight different languages –
NS : Yeah , I 've tried it out .
TT : You 've tried it out .
Well , that 's good .
Did it work for you ?
NS : Yeah , it worked .
TT : Sometimes it does n't work for me , but people like them .
For some people it really works well .
But that was just sort of an interim step .
What we are developing now is a two - way .
And while we want to eventually get to the two - way translator , which is totally generic in all situations , what we 're doing now is coming up with two - way translators that are good for specific functions , like checkpoints .
Where at a checkpoint the questions and the answers are somewhat contained .
And so you can actually come up with a device that really can be a two - way translator .
NS : Really ?
And can capture more than just " yes , no " [ questions ] ?
TT : Yes , that 's right .
But if you were to ask , How 's your golf score ?
it would n't be very useful .
NS : How is the golf in Iraq , by the way ?
TT : I do n't know – ??
they 've got a lot of sand traps .
NS : [ laughs ]
TT : So that 's an example of something that will be out soon .
NS : Do you know of anything that Darpa 's working on right now that 's really game changing ?
TT : Yes – our cognitive program .
The cognitive program's whole purpose in life is really to increase the tooth - to - tail ratio
[ military - speak for the number of combat troops to the number of support troops ] .
Look at how we operate – ??
look at a force in Iraq or
Afghanistan and count how many people are really fighters and how many people are really supporters â ?? and you find that there 's a very large ratio , 20 to 1 , or maybe even higher than that .
NS : Still ?
TT : Yeah , still .
And if you say what are those 20 doing ?
Well , a lot of them are doing things at the command post like keeping the computer system up , or they 're preparing [ charts ] or the daily brief .
NS : Yeah , PowerPoint rangers .
TT : Our cognitive program's whole aim is to have a computer " learn you , " as opposed to you having to learn the computer .
We 've got the technology to the point where we can now apply it in Iraq to a system that we also developed called CPOF , Command Post of the Future .
It is a distributed command and control system .
NS : It 's a piece of software that 's being applied to it ?
TT : It will be just software that 's applied to it .
Let me give you an example of one of the first jobs it might do .
It might just keep the Command Post of the Future up , and , if it can do that , those people who are now doing that 24 - by - 7 wo n't be needed .
Another task we 're looking at having it do is a shift change â ?? at the end of a shift , a person has to take some time to put together some slides , or some kind of a briefing , so that the next person who comes in will know what went on .
This transition between shifts must be seamless , and this system could do it in spades .
It will be able to put together what happened during the day , and , more important , it will know who 's coming in on the shift and will have learned that person 's preferences .
OK ?
So that , to me , is really a game changer – ?? if that all comes to pass .
NS : I mean , I do n't have to tell you that people have been promising cognitive computers [ since .. ]
TT : Oh , forever , forever .
Since , I guess , even science fiction back in the '30s had computers being somewhat cognitive .
NS : People [ always ] thought it was just around the corner .
What makes this iteration any more likely ?
TT : Well , a lot of time has passed .
If you look at Darpa , we 're almost 50 years old now .
And if you look at Darpa 's thrust in computers , and in cognitive computers , although it 's had different names , it really started in the '60s .
You know , how to make a computer more friendly to a human .
The mouse was developed here for that very reason .
So we would have spurts .
We would take what the technology would allow us to do , and we would go as far as we could and then stop .
The last real attempt – other than this attempt now in the last four or five years – was in the ' 80s .
We had a program called the Strategic
Computing Program .
And that Strategic Computing Program showed a pyramid .
And in that pyramid were many technologies that had to be developed –??
microelectronics to get things smaller , memories larger , computers faster .
But it all was leading toward coming up with a cognitive computer , although at that time we called it artificial intelligence .
We did a great job on the component technology , but the architecture for the cognitive part went down a path that was more neural nets , expert systems .
And they were OK for what they did .
You know , if you built yourself an expert system or a neural net for a specific situation it worked quite well , but it was very fragile .
If you got off of that , it crashed .
It was back to the two - way translator for the checkpoint – ??
do n't ask me what your golf game is like .
Well , in Darpa fashion , we stopped in the late ' 80s or early '90s .
Since the '90s to now , our ability to create algorithms that can reason
\– can more abstractly reason – about a problem and come up with answers , and also remember what they did using Bayesian techniques and changing values , has really advanced .
I mean , it tremendously advanced in the past – from the '90s to , say , the early 2000s .
At the same time , computers became more powerful .
We 're on the verge of having computers with densities approaching a monkey 's brain , and it wo n't be long before we 'll have a computer with the density of transistors , or equivalent to neurons and almost human .
What we 're missing is the architecture .
So it seemed like it was time .
We had great advances in algorithms for reasoning and in algorithms that learned in general .
At the same time , the computers , the actual intrinsic hardware , was really approaching the density of a human brain .
And so it seemed like it was time to try again .
We 've had some great success .
This cognitive program I told you about is actually showing that it is learning , and it is learning in a very difficult environment .
This is the program Stanford Research runs for us .
NS : Which program is this ?
TT : It 's PAL [ Perceptive Assistant that Learns ] .
And we have other related programs .
One major research issue has to do with learning .
If you and I learn something , like baseball , and then we go play another sport , say golf , we somehow transfer that – ??
we are able to transfer some of what we learned in baseball to golf .
That 's what makes humans very resilient and flexible .
We have some research programs trying to come up with the same technique – ?? that if you had something tackle a problem and then gave it another problem , it would do better on that second problem than if it had not had the previous experience .
This technology is actually going to avoid the thing that , in the 80s and ??90s , caused AI to stop – ??
stop because it was too fragile to accept anything but the problem it was working on .
This is what gives me confidence .
I mean , we are seeing outputs now .
But why did we start it in the first place ?
Well , it 's because of what I just said .
During the
' 90s , there were a lot of great advances in reasoning and Bayesian
[ probability analysis ] processes that computer themselves had come up , and it just seemed like it was time to try it again .
Now it may have y not come up with anything .
But this is Darpa , right ?
It 's OK
for us to fail .
NS : One thing that I 've heard you talk about before , and certainly heard Donald Rumsfeld talk about , is preventing strategic surprise , preventing technological surprise .
But is that really the situation we 're in now ?
I mean , an IED [ improved explosive device ]
is n't a technological surprise .
Even a North Korean nuke is n't a technological surprise .
It 's a low - tech surprise .
TT : Yeah it is .
And maybe that 's a technological surprise in itself .
Just because something is a technological surprise does n't mean that it's a high - tech surprise .
NS : OK , fair enough .
TT : And the IED is a good example of a low technological surprise when you have very innovative , smart people who can iterate very quickly .
It 's not a weapon – ?? it 's really mind warfare .
NS : Does Darpa 's mission change at all when it 's dealing with a low technological surprise as opposed to a high technological surprise ?
TT : No .
A lot of people think that , when we look at an effort that , unless it 's going to take us 20 years to do it we 're not interested .
When we look at ideas and efforts , we look to see what the impact would be if something could be done .
And if it takes 20 years , that 's fine .
But if it takes a year , that 's fine too .
So we evaluate more by the impact of the idea than we do by the length of time it happens to take to do it .
NS : Right .
S : One area that we really are concerned with – quite frankly , I 'm a little uncertain about it , so I wo n't go into any details – ?? is quantum computing .
Quantum computing is where you create a computer that uses the fact that you can have photons or something coherently coupled –
NS : Sure , encryptions .
TT : You can get great , great parallel processing .
That is something that , if somebody else got it before us , would be a great technological surprise .
And so we 're looking into that .
NS : And that concerns you more than biological [ weapons ] development or – ??
TT : No , no .
It 's equal .
The biological , I think , is a little bit more worrisome because it 's more potentially near - term .
But the impact of the quantum computer , if it can be done , will be really , really revolutionary .
NS : But is n't it a little bit ironic that Darpa is funding
BBN [ Technologies – one of the original developers of the Internet 's precursor , Arpanet ] to do quantum computing ?
So , are n't you in some senses bringing about the thing that you 're scared of ?
TT : I know , that 's always a worry , is n't it .
And , in some cases , obviously when we are worried about a technology that we do n't want to teach the world how to do , as we 're learning how to do it , well , we put controls on it .
NS : But doesn'?t that lead to a conundrum ?
I 'm sure you 'd agree that the best science is done out in the open , right ?
TT : Not always .
NS : Not always ?
TT : No .
I mean , I think that 's the legend .
But I have not found that to necessarily be the case .
The best science is done when you get the best people together .
That does n't have to be in the open .
What you do have to do is gather a large enough population of people with different disciplines in order to make progress .
And whether you do that open source or by having a very tightly knit project , I 've not seen – ??
I can give you a fairly near - term example , and that is stealth .
Stealth was very closed , a very secure program .
Great advances were made .
Lots of science .
Materials science actually made great leaps and bounds .
And it was a very , very closed discipline for a long time .
Actually , it still is closed .
NS : Right , parts of it .
TT : Parts of it are still closed .
We deal with industry , and industry has learned over the years that it could have a very secure project , and , at the same time , at least on a one - way diode , get information from outside the program in the disciplines necessary to solve the project .
NS : But a one - way capture .
TT : It 's typically a one - way , yeah .
It has to be almost a one - way .
But you set up your project in the beginning to take all of that into account .
That 's why I have not seen a real problem
[ somewhere ] .
NS : Because , I mean , I 'm sure this is not going to come as news to you , but there are definitely people in the defense research community that are like , " Oh , my God , Darpa – ??
I tried to get information out of them , and it 's very hard . "
TT : It 's very hard .
It 's very hard .
And , quite frankly , much of the problem is that they tend to use it in a way that they either overstate it or understate it .
NS : What do you mean ?
TT : Either they overstate what we 're doing in the sense of " ?? my God . "
We say , hey , we 're doing this .
And then they try to extrapolate what we could be doing with it .
Or , we say , we 're doing this , and we 're having a problem , or something like that .
And then they focus on the problems .
It 's just not necessary .
NS : Let 's talk about the biology .
What I 've heard is that , in a lot of ways , under your tenure is when Darpa really started to take a big interest in biology .
TT : Not really .
NS : Not really ?
TT : No .
The biology program was going strong when I got here .
It started at least four years before .
The transnational threat - which
I mentioned earlier -? became the biological threat .
Just think , what is something that people who do n't have a big infrastructure could do that would be very dramatic .
Well , biologic threats come to mind .
You do n't need a big factory , right ?
And so Darpa started programs in the '90s .
The most famous one in the '90s was " ?? One Drug , Many Bugs . " ?�
Basically , that was started here ??
because we had a problem .
The bugs we were worried about , such as Ebola and some of the others , were ones that the major pharmaceuticals were never going to tackle , because there just was n't a business there .
However , if we could find a technology with which we could create a drug to take care of not only
Ebola but also the common cold , then we could have our cake and eat it , too , because the big pharmaceuticals would go make that drug , and then it would be available for the ones that our forces might see .
That has transitioned .
Back when we first started thinking " ?? One Drug , Many Bugs " ?�
everybody said absolutely not .
But now if you get an antibiotic , doctors will prescribe broad - spectrum antibiotics .
That 's one drug , many bugs .
And that really started back then .
Now , on the other hand , when we saw we were moving into using small units of action , we realized that the medical ability was n't going to be there .
If you had a squad of six people going in , you could n't have a couple of medics with them , you know , with all of the trappings – ??
so we started developing things that would allow people to take care of themselves .
NS : OK , I understand that there may have been some biology programs going on before you got here .
But certainly there 's been many more –
TT : Oh , yeah .
I kept it going .
I kept it going , yeah .
NS : And that it 's really expanded .
There 's been a fairly big expansion in terms of soldier self - care , like you were mentioning .
TT : I think it was natural .
As time went on we found more things we could do .
Yes , I agree that there 's been an expansion .
NS And I guess I was hoping you could comment just a little on how it is different .
Is there a different philosophy or a different approach when you 're dealing in biology and living systems , rather than the sorts of gadgets and computers and algorithms that Darpa is a little more used to ?
TT : When you 're dealing with things that will have to be tested on living things – animals and eventually humans – you 're much more cautious .
We spend a lot of money on creating IRBs .
Institutional review boards are boards made of people who are independent of that institution or company who really review these things to make sure that humans are n't being – you know , that it 's safe .
And they go over the protocols of what is to be done .
And then people look at that .
And you can only do those things .
They approve only certain things .
So , when you deal with biology , you just do n't take the gun out in the back and shoot it , you know .
NS : You think that slows things up ?
TT : Yes , it does .
But it 's OK .
You need to have that .
It 's a good check .
It all came from violations , if you will , from back in the
' 30s and the '40s when volunteers were not really volunteers .
You 're going to volunteer for this experiment .
NS : Sure , [ the ] Tuskegee [ Syphillis Experiment ] , sure .
Also , is there a needle that has to be threaded in terms of , we are trying to improve soldiers ' capabilities and improve biological defenses , and " Oh my God , you 're creating Frankenstein ! "
TT : Yeah , I know there 's a worry about that .
But , quite frankly , we 're not doing that .
There 's probably more hype on that .
You know the old Army saying , " be all you can be " ?
That 's really what we 're doing .
We 're making it possible for people to be all that they can be , not making them be better than they can be .
In the [ armed ] services that train people , they take these young kids ' ??
bodies , and their bodies become extraordinary in strength and endurance .
We 've got the best training in the world .
But it 's not any better than their body can be .
What we try to do is come up with techniques that allow them to maintain that level of proficiency when they go into situations that are not as clinical as the training itself .
NS : Are any of those programs looking really promising ?
TT : One in particular , but it '??s one that might surprise you .
Have you heard about our cooling glove ?
NS : I have , yes .
TT : Quite frankly , it '??s a simple idea .
When you '?? re training , the reason you can't get everything your body has , is because you come up against the thermal wall .
So , the cooling glove allows somebody , when they 're training and really , really in shape , to train longer and thereby get better .
But it was n't making them more than they can be .
It was really making them what they could be .
It was n't changing any genes or anything like that .
It has really worked out , in fact , to the point where the San
Francisco 49ers are using them .
But it 's in Iraq now – not because people are training over there , but because in Iraq heat exhaustion is a real thing .
Nature , over our evolution , has made it so that the pores of our hands and the pores on the soles of our feet are really the faucets for getting heat out and heat in .
And the simple little idea of drawing a little bit of negative pressure on your hand to keep these pores open , is really tremendous .
Now it 's both ways .
The soldiers in
Iraq are using it to cool their body down , and the SEALs are using it to get heat into their body .
NS : The cooling glove is fairly near - term .
Is there anything a little longer term that 's game - changing ?
TT : There 's one that 's really ?
over the horizon , the fact that it goes back to the testing part , too .
There 's always been this notion of the " ?? golden hour . " ?�
If you can get somebody to good medical care , where they can be given blood and all of that stuff within an hour , the survival is greatly enhanced .
Well , when you have these small units out there , and especially in places like Afghanistan and Iraq , it 's really six hours before someone can be evacuated .
So a person with great blood loss , which is what happens in wars , will die .
We had a guy with an idea .
He said , why is it that people die with
60 % of their blood gone ?
Is there any reason for that ?
What happens , what is going on ?
So we started an effort .
We went out in our normal way and challenged the community .
Look , here 's the problem :
Is there any way we can keep a person alive with 60 % blood loss for six hours as opposed to an hour ?
And we have found two amazing techniques .
NS : Tell me about them .
TT : These are techniques that could be given by a medical on the spot .
One is giving somebody a shot of estrogen .
I know that 's sort of strange , is n't it ?
And it 's the typical Darpa fashion .
Somebody said , " You know , women in general survive blood loss better than men . "
And what is one of the chemical differences between a male and a female ?
Estrogen .
Think about what had to happen in order for us to have survived for all this time and evolve .
Childbirth is a very bloody process .
If a woman had a baby 5,000 years ago , and if she could n't handle that blood loss and take that baby and go to a safe spot and all the rest of it , we would have gone away .
And if you look at what happens with a woman at childbirth , she gets a big shot of estrogen from her own body .
So we tried it .
By the way , the one difference between Darpa and the National Institutes of Health , for example , is that Darpa will take a bet on an idea to go get the data to see if the idea is worthwhile , whereas at the NIH you typically need to have the data before they give you the effort to get the data .
I 'm sure you 've heard those stories .
NS : Yeah .
TT : So we went out and gave this fellow a contract .
And , by
God , with a shot of estrogen – the control group is made of rats , mind you –
NS : Yeah , I 'm assuming .
TT : The IRB on rats is a little bit easier .
[ laughs ]
First we bled all of them 60 percent .
The rats that did n't have the estrogen all died within three hours .
Of those that were given a shot of estrogen â??
which , by the way , is very safe â ??
right after 60 percent blood loss , 75
percent of them were living after six hours .
Now that is not as good as the next technique .
One fellow had another idea .
When you have severe blood loss , your cells pass electrons .
And when you have full blood , this electron passage is somewhat tampered .
The doctors will call these the ions .
You will take vitamins to try to get rid of –
NS : Yeah , free radicals .
TT : Yeah , get rid of these free radicals .
Well , these electrons cause these free radicals .
But when you get 60 percent blood loss , these electron passages still go up .
And , he said , you know , it 's probably the electrons that are causing the people to die because they are really destroying tissue , and there 's nothing there to stop them , because you 've got only 40 percent of the blood you had .
He found that if you gave a small amount of hydrogen sulfide – this is a poison –??
NS : Oh , right , this is [ Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center biochemist ]
Mark Roth , right ?
TT : Yeah .
If you give a small amount of hydrogen sulfide , it inhibits the electron generation .
So his rats , OK , you bleed them 60
percent .
The control group all dead within three hours .
The group that you just give a little bit of hydrogen sulfide to , after 10 hours , 90
percent of them are still living .
And , by the way , in both of these cases , to resuscitate them you just give them water .
I mean you do n't have to even give them blood .
You just give them water .
NS : It 's amazing .
And also they 're not hibernating – I mean these are n't hibernators .
TT : They 're not , no .
NS : It is really amazing .
TT : Yes , it is amazing .
That 's a typical Darpa type of thing .
Now , did we make somebody more than they can be because we saved somebody from dying ?
Of course , in the estrogen , who knows what the impact of giving a guy a shot of estrogen is , but you know .
NS : Who did the estrogen research ?
TT : You know , I do n't remember .
[ Turns out it 's University of
Alabama at Birmingham surgery professor Irshad Chaudry . ]
We had six or seven efforts .
These two are really panning out .
But we have a long way to go .
We 're going to go into pigs .
Oh , the IRB .
But , quite frankly , in something like this for which you can't ever really get a human , you say , OK , get the control group .
[ laughs ]
NS : OK , bleed about 60 percent ?
Yeah , I wo n't volunteer for that one .
Let 's change gears a little bit and talk about the challenges .
TT : Challenges ?
NS : You know , the prizes [ – like Darpa 's $ 2 million all - robot rally , the Grand Challenge . ] .
TT : Oh yeah , OK .
[ Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition , Technology and Logistics ]
Ken Krieg gave us approval just a couple of days ago to have the cash prizes on the [ next Grand ]
Challenge to be $ 2 million for first place , $ 1 million for second , and
$ 500,000 for third place .
Before , we had a winner - take - all .
Now we 're going to have three places .
But these are for the people who do 60
miles in six hours , so the necessary condition is you 've got to do that , and for those people who do do it , the fastest one will get $ 2
million .
NS : Got it .
So these are for the people who got some money up front [ some of the current Challenge contestants got seed money from
Darpa ] or –
TT : You would think so .
But , you know what , one person we offered a contract to turned us down .
NS : Is that right ?
TT : Yeah , they turned us down because they got a big aerospace firm as a sponsor .
And the big aerospace firm did n't want to have anything to do with the money .
NS : Really ?
TT : Yeah . [ laughs ]
I said , are you guys sure ?
NS : This just in : " Aerospace firm turns down Defense Department contract . " ?� [ laughs ]
TT : Well , the company that won the money was a fairly small company .
But they got a big sponsor who did n't want to have a contract .
So I was [ laughs ]
OK .
NS : Do you see prizes in any way replacing the traditional
Darpa grant awards ?
Do you see it augmenting it ?
Is this just something for fun ?
Is it something crucial , or is it central ?
TT : It 's hard to find a topic .
You know , even here the only reason we had â ??
that you could n't give contracts for .
The original Grand Challenge
[ robot rally ] was really motivated by a couple things .
One , having autonomous vehicles is a valuable military capability .
But we worry a lot about the [ feedstock ] – the fact that kids today do n't really see engineering and science as a career .
And I believe that '??s because we have n't come up with any challenges or problems to excite them to go into those areas .
NS : Nothing like the moon shot .
TT : Nothing like the moon shot , no .
And the autonomous vehicle thing , we could have just given contracts probably in the beginning and not have gotten as far .
But a big motivation was that everybody in this country owns a car .
You can go buy these computers , you know .
The sensors you can buy , and even the actuators are in the handicapped market .
So anybody in the country could participate .
And the only thing they needed to have was the imagination to create the secret sauce that took the inputs from the sensors and converted it to controls for the actuators and close that loop .
That 's really why we did it .
It was that little extra dimension that allowed it to be over the edge of just having contracts .
And it was fantastic , absolutely fantastic .
The response has been incredible , absolutely incredible , worldwide .
NS : Do you see that the X Prize Foundation , for example , is going from space to many other areas ?
TT : Yeah , they 're actually going to make a business out of it .
NS : And NASA is , of course , doing prizes now , too .
Do you see Darpa doing more prizes , or do you think it 's pretty limited ?
TT : I think we 'll do more prizes .
But , again , there 'd have to be very special reasons for doing it .
Even the X Prize and the NASA
thing – ??
really what they 're doing is maybe getting something out of it technologically that they could n't have gotten out of it by just giving contracts .
They are getting a whole bunch of people interested .
NS : And for not a lot of money .
TT : Yes , but the thing is , we now have tens of thousands of people interested in autonomous robots – your AI thing again – that were n't .
And now they 're thinking about solutions .
And those solutions are going to apply to areas bigger than autonomous vehicles .
And that was really what it was about .
And , in fact , the Grand Challenge is a good example of how trying to do cognitive or AI things again is not a bad thing .
NS : Right .
Again changing gears a little bit : I remember being at a DarpaTech [ the agency 's conference ] a couple of years ago , and you said something to the effect of how nobody has a career at
Darpa ;
" We hire ideas , not careers . "
You 're now the –
TT : I 'm the longest living – not the longest living – I 'm the longest - sitting Darpa director ever .
NS : You 're the last of the Mohicans , right ?
So how do you keep the ideas fresh ?
Do you think there 's a tension between those two things ?
TT : Well , first of all , it 's the program managers at Darpa who are the important people .
And , quite frankly , that makes us different than anyplace else in the world .
People come to me from all over the world , and they look at our track record and what we 're doing , and they want to know how they can make an organization like ours .
I tell them it 's simple .
You just have to make sure the people do n't stay there very long .
NS : [ laughs ]
TT : And they do n't know how to handle that .
Because it 's not like we detail .
People are detailed here from the department , and then they go back there .
These people come from industry and universities and give up everything , because they do become government people .
And then , with no help as to where the hell they 're going and , in fact , with all of the ethics laws that come up , sometimes it 's not clear they can get a job .
So these are strange people , and I 'm sure you 've met them .
But they 're all motivated by the fact that they have an idea that they can't get done anywhere else .
And if that idea lines up with DOD
objectives , sometimes we hire them and bring them in .
They get in here , and they know the clock is ticking .
They know they probably can't get their idea completed in the time they 're here , but they can get started .
The other neat thing is , when they leave , they have started these [ good ] programs , but a new program manager comes in , and while he 's trying to get his idea through the process of getting money , he gets these other programs .
But he has the full right to take those programs , review them , and trim the tree .
So even the performers never get comfortable .
And that 's just great .
That 's what makes this place what it is .
And he may look at that previous program , and say , hey , there 's an objective other than the original one that we can now use this for .
Because he might have knowledge of something .
We can do it over here , we can use it for this .
That might even be more important than what the original objective was .
NS : Right .
OK .
All true .
But you 've been here a long time now , so how do you square that ?
TT : I do n't .
I never expected to be here this long .
I will probably hang on until the end of the administration .
The one great thing about Darpa is that nobody is there long enough to really screw it up .
And there have been people who would say you know , Tether , you 're getting there , you know .
[ laughs ]
But I really would like to be here for the 50th .
We are going to be 50 years old in February of 2008 , and we have a whole thing starting next year all leading toward that .
And I do want to be here for that .
That 's , quite frankly , my reason .
NS : You 've done a bunch [ over your career ] .
You were here at
Darpa before , you 've done industry jobs , intel jobs .
Any of those particularly prep you for this gig ?
Is there one you draw on a lot , or one that 's more analogous ?
TT : I think the industrial experience is almost a prerequisite , because when I do things here I have a feeling for the other side .
But probably the most valuable experience I had was , after
I graduated from Stanford in ' 69 , helping start a company .
There were six or seven of us in Palo Alto .
We were all technical guys â ?? in fact , my background is control theory .
We were control theory guys , who believe that every problem can be solved by putting a loop around it .
And we went out to prove that that is true .
And we did it .
I mean , we did it for the commercial world , and process control did it for the military world .
We were lucky â ??
the timing could n't have been better .
Computers were just getting to the point where you could think in real - time control .
And it really was that experience that set me up and gave me the right background for this kind of a job .
NS : I assume you 're talking about the entrepreneurial aspect ?
TT : Yeah , and the fact that we were always selling something that people did n't want .
They just did n't know that they did n't want it .
I mean , they did n't know that they wanted it .
So we had to figure out how to convince them that they wanted it .
Which is what this job is all about .
NS : How is selling to people what they do n't know they want part of this job ?
TT : Because that 's what we do here .
We develop technologies and try to transition it to people who do n't know that they really want it .
They just have n't really thought about what they could do with this new capability .
And so we have to be clever – ??
I do n't mean that in a bad way – ?? to be able to communicate in their language .
And I think we do that quite well .
Yeah , we really do that quite well .

The human body needs a diet enriched with many ingredients from the periodic table that sound less like food than like machine parts or spare change .
We must have iron to capture oxygen , copper and chromium to absorb energy , cobalt to sheathe our nerves and zinc to help finger our genes .
Other creatures demand the occasional sprinkling of tin , nickel , platinum , tungsten and even strontium .
But when it comes to lead , the 82nd item on Mendeleev ’s menu of the elements , the universal minimum daily requirement is zero .
As far as we know , neither we nor any known life form needs the slightest amount of lead to survive .
And for humans , especially infants and young children , consumption of even moderate amounts of the metal can have serious consequences .
Developing brains seem to be extremely sensitive to the effects of the metal , which is why many scientists who study lead were distraught by the latest news of lead paint ’s being used on children ’s toys .
“ I ’m not normally a rabble rouser , but I ’m disturbed by the potential enormity of this problem , ” said Jeremy R. Knowles , a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Harvard .
“ We ’re talking about millions of toys , and the possibility of an entire generation of children being exposed to gratuitous constraints on their neurological development . ”

Daily Kos reader EmilyD reports writing to her Congresswoman , Ellen Tauscher , to urge support for the impeachment of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Take a look at how Tauscher answered :
The Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the president in a non-impeachable office .
Unless convicted of an illegal act , the Attorney General cannot be removed from office without the president asking for or accepting his resignation .
However , please be assured that I will keep your thoughts and concerns in mind as I review the circumstances surrounding recent allegations of impropriety within the Justice Department .
Sincerely , Ellen O. Tauscher
Member of Congress
This is a goddamn embarrassment .
Article II , Sec. 4 of the Constitution -- THE CONSTITUTION !
The President , Vice President and all civil Officers of the united States , shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for , and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors .
I mean , you do n't even actually have to finish reading the whole Constitution to get here .
Just the first two articles out of seven .
It 's right there in black and white .
Need to hear it from a law professor instead of me ?
Fine .
He ’s Impeachable , You Know
By FRANK BOWMAN Columbia , Mo. IF Alberto Gonzales will not resign , Congress should impeach him .
Article II of the Constitution grants Congress the power to impeach " the president , the vice president and all civil officers of the United States . "
The phrase " civil officers " includes the members of the cabinet ( one of whom , Secretary of War William Belknap , was impeached in 1876 ) .
Bam .
Done .
Two seconds .
It was in the New York Times for God 's sake .
Did you ever consider calling or writing your Congressperson about something , and then talk yourself out of it figuring they 've got to know about it already ?
Let this be a lesson to you .
Sometimes it turns out that the people whose job it is to know these things do n't know s#*t .
Several Iranian bloggers , inside country and abroad , have written about their country 's nuclear crisis and the anticipated dark future which awaits it .
For most , they see the situation becoming worss and the Iranian government moving in the wrong direction .
For Alpar , a very active blogger in Tehran , the situation is one of the worst in Iran 's history [ Fa ] .
He says :
Iran is in one of its worst crisis in its history and nobody knows after going through that crisis , whether there will be still an Iran or not .
With this pointless political system , incapable government , fragile economy , lost capital , and a united world against us .. can we imagine a worse situation ?
Iran should accept United Nations resolution and stop uranium enrichment .
At least think about war
Majid Zohari , a blogger based in Canada , says we heard a lot that Iran is not like Iraq and Afghanistan and they wo n't dare to attack it [ Fa ] .
The blogger says such arguments are not based on strong rationality and are really challenged by history .
He asks who can admit that he was n't shocked by events which happened in the last five or six years .
“ In all these years we see the value of predictions is zero .
A nuclear or non-nuclear attack is so important that we can at least think about them , ” he adds .
Human Rights and Nuclear Crisis
Mohammad Ali Abtahi , a reformist politician and blogger , says that Mr Elham , the Iranian Parliament Speaker , was quoted as saying that the nuclear issue is just an excuse to impose sanctions on Iran [ Fa ] .
According to him , if this issue gets resolved then the human rights question will be raised .
Abtahi is against such kind of reasoning and says the nuclear problem is the only thing that unites the world against Iran .
The blogger says that the human rights record in many countries is worse than Iran .
Jomhour , an Iran - based blogger , challenges Abtahi's post on the human rights issue .
Jomhour says one thing which is lost in Mr Abthai ’s post is the human rights situation in Iran [ Fa ] .
He writes :
Human rights get violated regularly in the country and most of time in a legal and organized way .
Women , religious and ethnic minorities ’ rights are violated by law .
Some believe the nuclear issue is a good excuse for the Iranian government to pursue human rights violation in country , in the name of national security .
Bombs
Ardeshir Dolat believes in a near future Iranian nuclear facilities will be attacked [ Fa ] .

Have you ever wondered if those healthy fast food meals are really any better for you ?
McDonald ’s has the Fruit ‘n Yogurt Parfait , Wendy ’s offers Garden Sensations salads and at Burger King you can even get a veggie burger .
Yogurt , salad , veggie burger … these are all healthy foods .
However , new research suggests that healthy fast food meals have the same effect on your cardiovascular system as a burger , fries and a soda .
The endothelium is a thin layer of cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels .
Endothelial cells line the entire circulatory system , from small capillaries to veins and arteries to the heart .
These cells are responsible for regulating blood flow and blood pressure through vasoconstriction and vasodilation .
High - fat meals have a negative effect on endothelial function , causing endothelial dysfunction , meaning there is less elasticity of blood vessels and reduced blood flow .
Endothelial dysfunction is a marker for cardiovascular disease and can lead to atherosclerosis or high blood pressure , increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke .
Ten years ago , a study linked diet and endothelial dysfunction [ 1 ] .
Twenty healthy men and women with normal levels of total and low - density lipoprotein cholesterol were fed four randomly administered breakfasts : a high - fat meal consisting of Egg and Sausage McMuffins with fried hash browns , a low - fat meal , a high - fat meal after taking the antioxidants vitamin C and vitamin E , and a low - fat meal with the same vitamin pretreatment .
Ultrasound was then used to measure changes in blood vessel tone and blood flow in the brachial artery .
The researchers found that decreased vasodilation occurred for up to 4 hours following the high - fat meal , while no significant changes were observed in blood vessel tone and brachial blood flow after the low - fat meal , the high - fat meal with vitamins or the low - fat meal with vitamin pretreatment .
The study demonstrated the benefits of vitamins C and E , and the authors concluded that antioxidants help maintain normal endothelial function .
Today , vitamin - rich side orders are prevalent throughout the fast food industry .
Researchers now have found that these presumably healthier alternatives to a burger and fries does not significantly differ with respect to their acute impairment of endothelial function [ 2 ] .
Endothelial function , measured again using ultrasound , and cardiovascular disease risk markers were measured in 24 healthy volunteers who randomly received one of three fast food meals on three study days separated by 1 week :
Big Mac with regular side orders ( french fries , ketchup and Sprite )
Vegetarian burger with regular side orders ( french fries , ketchup and Sprite )
Vegetarian burger with vitamin - rich side orders ( salad , balsamic dressing , yogurt with fruit and Minute Maid orange juice )
Unexpectedly , all three meals resulted in decreased endothelial function .
In contrast to the study ten years ago , even consumption of the vegetarian burger with vitamin - rich side orders resulted in decreased vasodilation .
The researchers suggest that the reduced endothelial function may be attributable , at least in part , to the increase in baseline arterial diameter following a meal .
Why the conflicting results ?
The vitamin pretreatment given in the study 10 years ago was extremely high – over 10 times ( 1000 mg ) the recommended daily intake of vitamin C and over 50 times ( 800 IU ) the recommended daily intake of vitamin E [ 3 ] .
While a salad , yogurt and orange juice are good , healthy foods , they contain substantially lower levels of antioxidants .
These results come in the wake of another study finding that fast food branding makes children prefer happy meals [ 4 ] .
NewScientist reported that :
… children in the study were twice as likely to prefer the McDonalds - branded carrots as the plain - packaged ones .
This suggests that marketing savvy could perhaps convince youngsters to make healthful choices .
Some companies have already begun experimenting with this tactic by using Mickey Mouse cartoons to sell sliced fruit and placing Curious George stickers on bananas .
Last month McDonalds announced it would shift its advertising targeted to children under the age of 13 to focus on the 375 - calorie Happy Meal , which it says meets current dietary standards outlined by the government .
What does all this mean ?
It means that eating a side salad with your burger or adding carrots in your child ’s happy meal ca n’t prevent the harmful affects of fast food on the vascular system .
Eating healthy does n’t mean an apple here and a carrot there , it means a complete change in the types of meals we eat .

RIAA Boycott Month : Five Awesome Ways to Hurt the Devil
Filed under : March 9 , 2007 , 6:14 pmFiled under : Uncategorized
Gizmodo has determined that March , 2007 , will be the month of RIAA boycotting .
They have sent forth two good ways to spend this month , buying eMusic MP3s and seeing artists live .
I present to you five more ways to hurt the RIAA in March :
5 . Speak up your opinion
RIAA is hated and despised in geek community , and for a good reason .
Add to the multitude of voices your own .
Sign the Electronic Frontier Foundation petition .
Speak up on forums , blogs and message boards .
Perhaps they ignore voice of community ; but community does n’t .
4. Switch to public domain and creative commons music
There is plenty of good music licensed as public domain and especially Creative Commons ( you can find plenty of CC - licensed music at Creative Commons website ) .
Yes , this wo n’t help the artists , but that ’s why this tip is only at # 4 .
If Creative Commons will spread , RIAA will take very painful hit in the crotch .
3. Crack the DRMs
By participating in DRM - cracking community , you do n’t do anything inherently illegal .
If everybody will learn to evade DRM , it will become obsolete .
Strip Devil of his tools , and then banish him .
2. Donate to your favorite artists
Use donations to help your favorite artists .
This way , you ’ll give them the full sum .
Buying an album from RIAA album wo n’t help – out of your twenty bucks only one dollar ( at most ) will go to the musician .
1 . Buy the indendent music
Finally , support independent label .
Use RIAA Radar to find labels free from RIAA imprisonment and buy music from them .
Remember : if you wo n’t pay the RIAA , they will eventually dissolve .
Help to bring down devil incarnate of modern America .
Praying for quick yet painful downfall of RIAA ,
Heliobis .
Aaarrggghhh .
For years , I 've watched respected photographer Louis Psihoyos produce amazing images , one of which he took a great deal of time to produce , including 500 computer monitors , as seen here , and Maestro Jobs displayed a near identical image in the background behind a graphic of the new Apple TV during his presentation , as seen to the right .
AppleInsider reports
According to the complaint , both Apple and the photographer had been negotiating a license for the image in advance of the Apple TV ad campaign .
Apple backed out of any such deal , but promptly began using the imagery anyway , Psihoyos ' attorney Richard Kaudy wrote .
In doing so , he added , Apple knowingly tossed aside the " rights and feelings " of the plaintiff and deprived him of potential profits .
I can honestly say I am deeply disappointed .
I would make the educated guess that Apple did n't want to pay what Louis was asking ( which was probably high , and fair too ) because they probably wanted to use the image as their signature image to promote the Apple TV .
Further , I would make a guess that they were asking for an all - rights package , but were vague as to the extent of the use .
Yes , yes , these are guesses , but educated ones , based upon demands and insistences of clients I have encountered who wanted my images for a small figure , knowing they were going to use it for extremely broad purposes , but not wanting me to consider that in the final licensing fee .
When you encounter clients who have unreasonable expectations about what an image of yours is worth , make sure you not only stand your ground , but moreover , make damn sure your images are registered ( especially the one being negotiated ! ) so that when this happens to you , you have all your options available to you , because you registered your copyright .

If you 've got questions , please pose them in our Photo Business Forum Flickr Group Discussion Threads .
Many of the videos we post here at C&L are of politicians and pundits slugging it out , yelling over each other and trying to score a knock out punch .
While the red meat gets a lot of attention , sometimes a calm and rational discussion of important and contentious issues is just what the doctor ordered .

In this clip PBS ' Bill Moyers sits down with The Nation 's John Nichols and conservative constitutional attorney Bruce Fein from the American Freedom Agenda to discuss the crimes and abuse of power by George Bush and Dick Cheney and the need to impeach them both .
While Nichols and Fein come from different ends of the political spectrum , they are in total agreement on this issue .
Congress must put impeachment on the table because if they do nothing to stop Bush and Cheney now , we will see future presidents follow in their footsteps which would be a disaster for our country .
This is definitely worth a look ...

It has lately become a growing fashion to extend the concept of rights from human beings to animals , and to assert that since animals have the full rights of humans , it is therefore impermissible — i.e. , that no man has the right — to kill or eat them .
There are , of course , many difficulties with this position , including arriving at some criterion of which animals or living beings to include in the sphere of rights and which to leave out .
( There are not many theorists , for example , who would go so far as Albert Schweitzer and deny the right of anyone to step on a cockroach .
And , if the theory were extended further from conscious living beings to all living beings , such as bacteria or plants , the human race would rather quickly die out . )
But the fundamental flaw in the theory of animal rights is more basic and far - reaching .
For the assertion of human rights is not properly a simple emotive one ; individuals possess rights not because we " feel " that they should , but because of a rational inquiry into the nature of man and the universe .
In short , man has rights because they are natural rights .
They are grounded in the nature of man : the individual man 's capacity for conscious choice , the necessity for him to use his mind and energy to adopt goals and values , to find out about the world , to pursue his ends in order to survive and prosper , his capacity and need to communicate and interact with other human beings and to participate in the division of labor .
In short , man is a rational and social animal .
No other animals or beings possess this ability to reason , to make conscious choices , to transform their environment in order to prosper , or to collaborate consciously in society and the division of labor .
Thus , while natural rights , as we have been emphasizing , are absolute , there is one sense in which they are relative : they are relative to the species man .
A rights - ethic for mankind is precisely that : for all men , regardless of race , creed , color , or sex , but for the species man alone .
The Biblical story was insightful to the effect that man was " given " — or , in natural law , we may say " has " — dominion over all the species of the earth .
Natural law is necessarily species - bound .
That the concept of a species ethic is part of the nature of the world may be seen , moreover , by contemplating the activities of other species in nature .
It is more than a jest to point out that animals , after all , do n't respect the " rights " of other animals ; it is the condition of the world , and of all natural species , that they live by eating other species .
Inter - species survival is a matter of tooth and claw .
It would surely be absurd to say that the wolf is " evil " because he exists by devouring and " aggressing against " lambs , chickens , etc .
The wolf is not an evil being who " aggresses against " other species ; he is simply following the natural law of his own survival .
Similarly for man .
It is just as absurd to say that men " aggress against " cows and wolves as to say that wolves " aggress against " sheep .
If , furthermore , a wolf attacks a man and the man kills him , it would be absurd to say either that the wolf was an " evil aggressor " or that the wolf was being " punished " for his " crime . "
And yet such would be the implications of extending a natural - rights ethic to animals .
Any concept of rights , of criminality , of aggression , can only apply to actions of one man or group of men against other human beings .
What of the " Martian " problem ?
If we should ever discover and make contact with beings from other planets , could they be said to have the rights of human beings ?
It would depend on their nature .
If our hypothetical " Martians " were like human beings — conscious , rational , able to communicate with us and participate in the division of labor — then presumably they too would possess the rights now confined to " earthbound " humans .
But suppose , on the other hand , that the Martians also had the characteristics , the nature , of the legendary vampire , and could only exist by feeding on human blood .
In that case , regardless of their intelligence , the Martians would be our deadly enemy and we could not consider that they were entitled to the rights of humanity .
Deadly enemy , again , not because they were wicked aggressors , but because of the needs and requirements of their nature , which would clash ineluctably with ours .
There is , in fact , rough justice in the common quip that " we will recognize the rights of animals whenever they petition for them . "
The fact that animals can obviously not petition for their " rights " is part of their nature , and part of the reason why they are clearly not equivalent to , and do not possess the rights of , human beings .
And if it be protested that babies can't petition either , the reply of course is that babies are future human adults , whereas animals obviously are not .
Professor Pennell believes the scan could save lives
The scan shows up heart scar tissue , giving doctors an important warning sign of dilated cardiomyopathy or DCM , which can otherwise go undetected .
In DCM the heart becomes weakened and enlarged , and cannot pump blood efficiently .
It is the most common form of heart muscle disease at any age and many of those who die are children .
The new technique , developed by cardiologists at Royal Brompton Hospital , involves injecting a dye called gadolinium into the patient 's vein and then scanning them using MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) .
This is an important advance that will help doctors prevent lives being lost to the condition
Professor Peter Weissberg
British Heart Foundation
The gadolinium stays around in the scar tissue more than in the surrounding tissue because scar tissue has a lower blood supply than normal tissue .
And gadolinium 's special magnetic properties makes the scar tissue appear brightly on the scan and very easy to detect .
The Royal Brompton team tested the technique on 101 patients with and without scar tissue and followed them for two years to determine the effect of scar tissue on the patients ' health outcomes .
Timely care
By detecting the scar tissue , the researchers found they were better able to determine the risk of hospitalisation or death .
In turn , this enabled them to ensure patients received timely and appropriate care .
Some could be treated with drugs alone , while others required a £ 12,000 heart implant .
In the study , the scar tissue occurred in about a third of patients with DCM .
These patients were three times more likely to be hospitalised or die suddenly .
Lead researcher Professor Dudley Pennell said the scans should help guide important treatment choices .
He explained : " Prior to this technique it was difficult to decide which patients could be treated effectively using drugs alone , and which patients needed life - saving devices implanted .
" It is a costly and wasteful exercise to implant all patients with DCM when only 20 or 30 % may truly require it . "
Professor Peter Weissberg , medical director of the British Heart Foundation , which gave funding to the research , said : " This is an important advance that will help doctors prevent lives being lost to the condition . "

How the White House worked to scuttle California 's climate law 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
President Bush 's transportation secretary , Mary Peters , with White House approval , personally directed a lobbying campaign to urge governors and two dozen House members to block California 's first - in - the - nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks , according to e-mails obtained by Congress .
The e-mails show Peters worked closely with the top opponents in Congress of California 's emissions law and sought out governors from auto - producing states , who were seen as likely to oppose the state 's request that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allow the new rules to go into effect .
" The administration is trying to stack the deck against California 's efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions , " House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles , wrote Monday to the White House .
" It suggests that political considerations - not the merits of the issue - will determine how EPA acts . "
Waxman released the e-mails , which are available on the committee 's Web site , along with his letter to the White House .
The documents show that the idea to launch the lobbying effort started with Peters .
The secretary " asked that we develop some ideas asap about facilitating a pushback from governors ( esp. D's ) " - Democrats - " and others opposed to piecemeal regulation of emissions , as per CA 's waiver petition , " Jeff Shane , the Transportation Department 's undersecretary for policy , wrote to top staffers on May 22 .
It was not an unbiased outreach effort : Peters targeted officials who agreed with her agency 's opposition to California 's landmark effort to regulate auto emissions .
" Are we making any headway in identifying sympathetic governors ? "
Shane wrote on May 23 .
" ( Peters ) asked me about them again this morning . "
The release of the e-mails comes at an awkward time for the White House .
President Bush was scheduled to meet Monday night with global leaders in New York to convince them he is serious about the United States ' efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
He has convened a meeting in Washington this week to talk about climate change with the world 's 15 biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
The Department of Transportation and the White House responded to Waxman 's letter Monday with statements arguing that they did nothing wrong by urging lawmakers and governors to oppose California 's efforts to curb emissions .
" Our efforts to inform elected officials about the petition before EPA were legal , appropriate and consistent with our long - held position on this issue , " the Transportation Department said .
" For over 30 years , the Department has supported a single , national fuel economy standard as part of our effort to save fuel , ensure safety , preserve the environment and protect the economy . "
" With respect to California 's request to be allowed to set its own standards , there are a wide variety of strongly held views across the country , " said Kristen Hellmer , a spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality .
" Outreach by federal officials to state government counterparts and members of Congress on issues of major national policy is an appropriate and routine component of policy development . "
But California officials , including one of Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's top environmental aides , said the e-mails suggest the Bush administration is working behind the scenes to deny California 's waiver .
The EPA is expected to make its decision by December .
" We 're deeply disappointed to hear of confirmed reports of back - room maneuvering to deny our request , " said Mary Nichols , who chairs the state 's Air Resources Board .
" We will move ahead with our lawsuit if the EPA fails to act in the next few weeks . "
California has taken the initial steps to sue the federal government if it turns down the state 's request for a waiver under the federal Clean Air Act that would approve California 's plan to regulate greenhouse gas emissions .
The e-mails paint a picture of the administration working closely with Michigan 's powerful congressional delegation , which strongly opposes California 's new rules .
U.S. automakers fear a huge drop in sales if California and 12 other states implement the new rules - which would cut emissions by 30 percent by 2016 .
In one e-mail , Peters asks if she needs to call Rep. Joe Knollenberg , R - Mich. , who was rallying opposition in Congress to California 's proposal .
" Do I need to touch base with Knollenberg to coordinate our efforts ? " she wrote in a June 7 e-mail to her deputy chief of staff , Simon Gros .
" His staff is also going to ping other members of the automotive caucus for us , " Gros replied .
" My staff this morning called just about every auto - friendly member of this issue . "
Gros , in an interview with House investigators , said Peters personally called two to four governors to urge them to lobby the EPA .
The Transportation Department would not identify the governors , but one cited in the e-mails was Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm , a Democrat .
The documents also reveal that Peters sought - and received - approval for her effort from the White House .
Her executive assistant , Sandy Snyder , reported in a May 25 e-mail that the White House Council on Environmental Quality 's chief of staff , Marty Hall , approved the idea .
Hall was " OK with ( Peters ) making calls , " Snyder wrote .
Snyder added that Hall had spoken the day before with EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson - suggesting he may have known of the effort to lobby his agency .
Johnson , at a Senate hearing in July , said he'd talked with Peters only about extending the comment period for the waiver request .
Waxman has suggested the actions could violate the Anti-Lobbying Act , which restricts the ability of federal employees or agencies to lobby .
The law prohibits " grassroots lobbying " - efforts to get members of the public to lobby Congress .
The Transportation Department has said it did not engage in grassroots lobbying .
But Thomas Susman , an attorney at Ropes & Gray in Washington and co-author of " The Lobbying Manual , " said contacting governors - who are called " grasstops , " in lobbying parlance - is usually considered grassroots lobbying .
" In my experience , there is no distinction in the statute or any interpretations between governors and the public , " he said .
But Peters could have a legal out :
The president , vice president and Cabinet members can't be barred from speaking out or instigating grassroots actions on issues of public concern , Susman said .
The law is enforced if a " substantial " amount of money - $ 50,000 - is spent on lobbying , and it 's unlikely the Justice Department would go after members of the administration , he said .
Waxman said the debate over the legality of the actions misses the point .
Peters could have submitted comments to the EPA , stating her views , he said .
" Instead ... she apparently sought and received White House approval to use taxpayer funds to mount a lobbying campaign designed to inject political considerations into the decision , " Waxman said .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his position as early as next month , sources inside and outside the Bush administration told CNN on Friday .
White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his position soon , sources said Friday .
When contacted by CNN about his possible departure , Snow said , " I 'm not making any announcement . "
Snow told conservative talk - show host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday that " financial reasons " may prevent him for serving the remainder of his boss 's presidency .
" I 'm not going to be able to go the distance , but that 's primarily for financial reasons . "
Snow said .
" I 've told people when my money runs out , then I 've got to go . "
According to The Washington Post , Snow makes $ 168,000 as the White House spokesman .
CNN has previously reported that Chief of Staff Josh Bolten told senior White House staffers that unless they could commit to staying until President Bush leaves office in January 2009 , they should leave by Labor Day .
Snow , 52 , had been treated for colon cancer in 2005 .
In March , during surgery to remove a growth from his abdomen , doctors discovered that the cancer had returned and spread to his liver .
Five weeks later , Snow returned to the White House podium and continued to work as the president 's chief spokesman as he underwent chemotherapy .
In recent interviews , he indicated that his health situation had stabilized .
Before coming to the White House in April 2006 , Snow had worked for the Fox News Channel and hosted his own nationally syndicated radio show .
He took a significant pay cut to take the job of press secretary and has talked publicly in the past about the financial sacrifices , as well as his passion for the post .
People close to Snow said that he felt he needed to make some more money to help his family , which includes children readying for college .
Speculation on who might replace Snow has centered on his deputy , Dana Perino .
When asked about Snow 's plans to leave , Perino told CNN , " I 've got nothing on that , nor would I speculate . "
Also on Friday , Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois announced that he would not seek another term in 2008 .
Hastert stepped down from his Republican leadership post but remained in Congress when Democrats took back control of Congress in November 2006 .
And earlier this week , Karl Rove , Bush 's senior political adviser , announced he would step down at the end of the month .
He characterized his tenure in the White House as a " witness to history " as he announced his resignation Monday .

All About Tony Snow
It sort of feels like I 'm blogging all Giuliani all the time , but it's hard to resist when there 's so much good material .
From a long profile in the New Yorker ( well , duh , of course it 's long , it 's the New Yorker ) :
" Petty and vindictive " is the assessment of one of Giuliani ’s most reliable foils , Stephen DiBrienza , a former City Councilman from Brooklyn who in 1998 was on the receiving end of a memorable act of mayoral pique .
DiBrienza was chairman of the Council ’s General Welfare Committee , which oversaw the city ’s social - and human - services programs , principal targets of Giuliani ’s reforms .
One of the councilman ’s abiding concerns was the warehousing of homeless people in huge city shelters , some of which held as many as a thousand beds .
In December , 1998 , DiBrienza sponsored a bill to limit the number of beds at city facilities to two hundred , and to require that social services be made available at the shelters .
Giuliani vehemently opposed the measure , arguing that it would require the city to close down its seven largest shelters .
The Council passed the legislation , and he vetoed it .
He said that if he was forced to close the big shelters he would have to build new ones — and he would put them in the districts of the chief proponents of the bill .
The Council overrode the veto by a substantial margin .
The Mayor called DiBrienza a " limousine liberal " and a " hypocrite , " and the administration announced plans to open a homeless shelter in a neighborhood in DiBrienza ’s district .
An eviction notice was sent to a state - run psychiatric clinic housed in a city - owned building , with the explanation that a homeless shelter was coming in .
In addition to the clinic , which tended to five hundred patients a week , the building contained a senior - citizen center and a nonprofit children ’s center .
" Think about it , " DiBrienza says now .
" Here ’s a guy who would go to that length , because I beat him on passing a law that requires smaller - bed shelters .
Because we would not blink , he would throw kids , seniors , and the mentally ill out into the street .
I mean , could I have written a better script to expose the fact of what he was ? " ( emphasis added )
And just in case you have n't had enough blind loyalty , cronyism , and the elevation of incompetents under George W. Bush , check this out :
Researchers in the Department of Neuroscience at Mount Sinai School of Medicine have identified taste receptors in the human intestines .
Scientists have previously shown that the absorption of dietary sugars in the intestine is mediated by a protein – a sugar transporter – that varies in response to the sugar content of foods .
The intestine uses a glucose sensing system to monitor these variations , but until now the nature of this system was unknown .
The taste receptor T1R3 and the taste G protein gustducin are critical to sweet taste in the tongue .
Research now shows these two sweet - sensing proteins are also expressed in specialized taste cells of the gut where they sense glucose within the intestine .
" We now know that the receptors that sense sugar and artificial sweeteners are not limited to the tongue .
Our work is an important advance for the new field of gastrointestinal chemosensation - how the cells of the gut detect and respond to sugars and other nutrients , " said lead author , Robert F. Margolskee , MD , PhD Professor of Neuroscience at Mount Sinai School of Medicine .
" Cells of the gut taste glucose through the same mechanisms used by taste cells of the tongue .
The gut taste cells regulate secretion of insulin and hormones that regulate appetite .
Our work sheds new light on how we regulate sugar uptake from our diets and regulate blood sugar levels . "
These new findings , published online in the August 20th , 2007 " Early Edition " of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , may lead to new treatments for obesity and diabetes .
The two new studies are titled - " T1R3 and gustducin in gut sense sugars to regulate expression of Na+- glucose cotransporter 1 " and " Gut - expressed gustducin and taste receptors regulate secretion of glucagon - like peptide - 1 . "
" This work may explain why current artificial sweeteners may not help with weight loss , and may lead to the production of new non-caloric sweeteners to better control weight , " said Dr. Margolskee .
" Sensing glucose in the gastrointestinal tract is the first step in regulating blood sugar levels .
Having discovered the identity of the gut 's sweet receptors may open the way for new treatment options for obesity and diabetes . "
How taste receptors work
Prior to this research , the intestinal sugar sensors were unknown .
Dr. Margolskee and his colleagues Dr. Josephine M. Egan , Dr. Soraya P. Shirazi-Beechey and Dr. Zaza Kokrashvili reasoned that the sugar sensors of the tongue 's taste buds might also be there in the gut .
Sweet taste in the tongue depends on the taste receptor T1R3 and the taste G protein gustducin .
The small intestine is the major site where dietary sugars are absorbed into the body to provide energy , and maintain normal metabolism and homeostasis .
If glucose is absorbed in excess obesity may occur .
T1R3 and gustducin , critical to sweet taste in the tongue , are also expressed in specialized taste cells of the gut where they sense glucose within the intestine .
Carbohydrate ingested from meals & beverages breaks down into glucose , which stimulates the sweet - sensing proteins in these gut taste cells .
Activating the sweet -- sensing proteins of the gut taste cells promotes secretion of glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) , an intestinal hormone that plays a key role in promoting insulin secretion and regulating appetite .
This research was supported by funding from NIDCD / NIH .
Co-authors and collaborating scientists include Dr. Josephine Egan at NIA / NIH , Baltimore , MD ; Dr. Soraya Shirazi-Beechey at University of Liverpool , Liverpool , UK and Dr. Zaza Kokrashvili at Mount Sinai .
California Voting Machine Audit Results
The state of California conducted a security review of their electronic voting machines earlier this year .
This was a serious review , with real security researchers getting access to the source code .
The report was issued last week , and the researchers were able to compromise all three machines — by Diebold Election Systems , Hart Intercivic , and Sequoia Voting Systems — multiple ways .
( They said they could probably find more ways , if they had more time . )
Final report and details about the audit here .
Good blog entries here and here .
We do n’t know what California will do now .
This is no surprise , really .
The notion that electronic voting machines were somehow more secure every other computer system ever built was ridiculous from the start .
And the claims by machine manufacturers that releasing their source code would hurt the security of the machine was — like all these sorts of claims — really an attempt to prevent embarrassment to the company .
Not everyone gets this , unfortunately .
And not everyone involved in voting :
Letting the hackers have the source codes , operating manuals and unlimited access to the voting machines “ is like giving a burglar the keys to your house , ” said Steve Weir , clerk - recorder of Contra Costa County and head of the state Association of Clerks and Election Officials .
No .
It ’s like giving burglars the schematics , installation manuals , and unlimited access to your front door lock .
If your lock is good , it will survive the burglar having that information .
If your lock is n’t good , the burglar will get in .
I have two essays on this , from 2004 : “ Why Election Technology is Hard , ” and “ Electronic Voting Machines . ”
This essay — “ Voting and Technology ” — was written in 2000 .

Defense Secretary Robert Gates visited Baghdad yesterday and issued a direct challenge to the Maliki government to step up and do more -- quickly .
Unfortunately , he also appears to have gotten the administration 's policy backwards .
" Frankly , I would like to see faster progress , " Gates said .
The Pentagon chief went on to emphasize that the Iraqis should know that " this is n't an open - ended commitment " on the part of the United States military .
" Our president has said that our patience is not unlimited . "
Gates added , " The clock is ticking . "
All of that sounds very nice , but it's also entirely inconsistent with the Bush administration 's policy in Iraq .
If the White House 's rhetoric is to be believed , the clock can't be ticking -- because if it were , the " evildoers " would simply have wait for the clock to stop ticking .
It 's why our commitment to Iraq , the Bush gang says , has to remain open - ended .
If there 's a point at which the " suiciders " and " dead- enders " think we 'll leave , they 'll " wait us out . "
It 's why timelines are akin to surrender and benchmarks have to remain toothless .
Likewise , counter to what Gates said yesterday , our patience has to be " unlimited . "
If not , we 'll abandon Iraq and terrorists will fill a power vacuum that will endanger the world .
That is the administration 's worldview , is n't it ?
Dems have been saying for a year that we should at least start the clock so that Iraqis know that it 's ticking .
And Republicans have been saying for a year that this is n't even a remote possibility .
In other words , Gates went a long way to tell Iraqis and the world the exact opposite of the administration 's policy .
It 's hardly reassuring .
Much has been made this year of the presidential candidates ' increasingly sophisticated online " conversations " with voters .
But when it comes to Americans ' favorite tool for navigating the web , it turns out most White House contenders are still pretty clueless , a recent round of experiments on Google 's AdWords program suggests .
The experiments conclude that most of the presidential candidates are sitting on the sidelines as American voters search for timely information about political issues or campaign events .
The exceptions include Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , who use Google 's AdWords keyword bidding program around searches for issues and news events .
On the Democratic side , Illinois Sen. Barack Obama appears to be the only one using AdWords in the same fashion , though Edwards has purchased keywords in the past .
Just over half of all search activities on the web in the United States – 3.9 billion queries – took place on Google , according to June data from Nielsen / NetRatings .
Yahoo's search accounts for 20 percent , and 13 percent of web surfers use MSN / Windows Live Search .
Seven other search engines share the remainder of the market .
During the Ames Straw poll last Saturday , Romney appeared in the top paid results in searches for variations of the keywords " Iowa straw poll results , " which was the most searched for term that day on Google , according to the Google Trends experimental search trends tracking tool .
A search on any day on the phrase " war in Iraq , " ( a policy item that tops voters ' agenda , according to The Gallup Poll ) also yields Romney 's website as a top paid search result .
That 's a savvy move for the campaign , given that Romney scores the lowest among the leading presidential contenders in a recent Gallup poll on candidates ' ability to handle the war in Iraq .
Gallup notes that the reason for the low score is related to the fact that a fifth of Americans do n't have an opinion on how Romney would handle the issue .
And a search for the phrase " presidential debates " on Google on Wednesday morning yielded McCain 's campaign website as a paid search result .
On Tuesday morning , Obama 's campaign site also appeared ; the ad exhorted readers to volunteer at Obama events .
The candidates are missing a prime opportunity to capitalize on surges of interest online generated by news events , such as televised debates and other television appearances , says Richard Ball , founder of Apogee Web Consulting , a search - engine marketing firm based in the Baltimore , Maryland , area .
Ball recently conducted experiments on Google 's AdWords program with " Iowa straw poll results , " on Saturday , and with various versions of the phrase " you tube debate , " and " democratic debate " in July .
" I could n't believe the ( Democratic ) candidates were n't doing such a simple thing as buying keywords , " Ball said in an interview .
Ball said that he is particularly surprised because he considers AdWords advertising unusually cost - effective – candidates do n't have to pay when their ad appears on Google , only when users click through to their sites .
And in his Saturday experiment , the cost per click for reaching voters was 13 cents .
" For less than the cost of postage , a presidential candidate could have acquired a visitor to their election campaign website , " Ball wrote on his blog .
" How much would a direct - mail advertising campaign have cost to acquire 1,820 visitors to their site ?
How much would a radio or TV or print - ad campaign have cost to generate that much interest ? "
Indeed , this is precisely why the McCain campaign uses AdWords so extensively , says Eric Frenchman , chief internet strategist at the political marketing agency Connell Donatelli in Washington , D.C.
The firm handles all of McCain 's online advertising .
Frenchman estimates that the McCain campaign receives $ 4 back for every dollar spent on Google 's Adwords program .
The McCain campaign has been using AdWords since the beginning of the campaign .
" I really think ( campaigns should advertise ) around issues , " Frenchman says .
" It 's simple for people to go around buying candidates ' names , but people are looking at gas prices and the war in Iraq . "
" If candidates have a strong view on the subjects , then they need to get that across – I do n't think people are taking enough of a look at that , " he adds .
An online survey released in July confirms Frenchman 's hypothesis .
ICrossing , a Scottsdale , Arizona - based digital marketing company , used 129 issue - keyword phrases to test the candidates ' advertising across Google , Yahoo and MSN .
The study found that very few of the candidates ' names popped up when those phrases were used as search queries .
Peter Greenberger , manager of Google 's elections and advocacy team of four , also confirms this , but predicts it will quickly change .
" What I have n't seen is campaigns integrating their AdWord buys with real - time news events , initiatives and promotions , " Greenberger says .
" If you 're running a television ad in Iowa , or you 've said something clever in a debate you want to re-state , or what a ( rival candidate said ) you could do a rapid response text or image ad , and I think that 's what we 'll see as we head into the Fall campaign season . "

6 Versions of Heaven Ah , heaven .
Marx called it the carrot used by the wealthy to keep us working hard for little money .
After all , the real rewards are supposed to come much later .
But despite what Marx had to say , the notion of a happy afterlife wo n’t quite go away .
Here are six pleasant resorts the righteous can look forward to in afterlife .
1 . Heaven : Judaism
Gan Eden , the heavenly Garden of Eden , the final stage of
Olam Haba [ wiki ] ( or afterlife ) .
( Image credit : Afterlife Folklore : Judaism )
As one of the oldest and most influential religions in existence , Judaism might be expected to be the source of our most profound notions of heaven , but it is n’t .
In fact , there is no clear indication of a heaven or afterlife in the Jewish scriptures at all , which leads to a lot of debate on the subject .
Two typical positions are those of the Pharisees , who believed that there was an implied notion of an afterlife , and the Sadducees , who pointed out that there was no biblical evidence of such .
Over the millennia , Jews have come to believe in various versions of heaven , some of which occur after the Messiah comes and involve the righteous dead coming back to life .
Still , overall , Judaism is more concerned with life in the here and now .
2 . Paradise : Zoroastrianism
It was the ancient Persians who gave us the word paradise , which means a walled garden or park , and Zoroastrianism in particular gave us notions of the afterlife that were adopted and / or adapted by the Jews , Christians , and Muslims .
Zoroastrianism is also interesting because , unlike other religions , it claims that everyone will eventually get into heaven , though it might take a while .
The paradise of Zoroastrianism is attained the fourth day after death by crossing the Bridge of the Separator , which widens when the righteous approach it .
( see the next section for what happens to the wicked . )
The righteous soul crosses the bridge and is met by a beautiful maiden who is the physical and feminine embodiment of all his good works on earth .
He is then escorted into the House of Song to await the Last Day .
On this day , everyone will be purified and live in a new world absent of evil and full of youthful rejoicing .
3 . Heaven : Christianity
14th century tapestry depicting John of Patmos [ wiki ] watching descent of New Jerusalem from God ( Image credit : Kimon Berlin , Gribeco , Wikipedia )
The Christian notion of heaven is one of singing and rejoicing before God in a “ new heaven and a new earth . ”
It also reflects Christianity ’s roots in Judaism because this new heaven contains a city called New Jerusalem .
There are elaborate descriptions of the city in the Book of Revelation .
New Jerusalem has a wall and 12 gates , and on each gate is the name of one of the tribes of Israel along with an angel .
There are also 12 foundations , 1 each for the 12 apostles .
In fact , we even know the size of the New Jerusalem : 1400 miles square with a 200 - foot wall .
The structure itself is made of all kinds of precious stones , some of which have not yet been identified on this earth .
There is a river of “ the water of life , ” which flows from God ’s throne , and trees of life line the banks of the river and produce fruit every month .
Believers will have God ’s name written on their foreheads , and all pain , tears , and death will disappear forever .
4 . Paradise : Islam

The Islamic version of heaven is a paradise for those whose good works have outweighed the bad as determined by the straight path laid out in the Quran .
Heaven is a garden where the faithful lie upon couches in a climate - controlled environment surrounded by “ bashful , dark - eyed virgins , chaste as the sheltered eggs of ostriches . ”
They will drink from crystal goblets and silver vessels as “ immortal youths ” hover about them looking like “ scattered pearls . ”
The believers will be clothed in green silk and brocade and will wear silver bracelets , and they will “ drink a pure draught ” drawn from Allah ’s own source as a reward for their striving and patience .
5 . Moksha : Hinduism Eastern religions do n’t really have notions of heaven like those in the West .
Instead , they usually offer some kind of release from illusion and suffering in the present world .
The Hindu Upanishads are philosophical portions of the Vedas , Hinduism ’s oldest sacred text , and in them the notions of the self and afterlife are developed .
According to the Upanishads , our actions connect us to this world of appearances , which is in fact illusory .
What is real is Brahman , the ultimate reality that transcends our sensory experiences .
Unfortunately , we live in ignorance of Brahman and act according to our illusions .
This action ( karma ) causes us to participate in the cycle of death and rebirth ( samsara – see next section ) from which it ’s difficult to escape .
Thus , if you can escape your ignorance and realize that ultimately you are not you but Brahman itself , then you can achieve release from the cycle of death and rebirth .
This release is called moksha .
6 . Nirvana : Buddhism
The Way to Nirvana , a Thangka painting from Dharmapala Thangka Centre One of the four noble truths of the Buddha is that suffering is caused by desire , the desire to have but also the desire to be .
Desire is tanha , or a burning that keeps us caught in the web of illusion that is our ego .
The Buddha taught that desire is a flame that burns us , causes suffering , and keeps us tied to the cycle of death and rebirth because the flame continues burning into the next life .
What we hope for is Nirvana , or the extinguishing of that flame , which is also the end of suffering .
Abandon All Hope , Ye Who Enter Here : 7 Versions of Hell Walt Whitman wrote that “ the fear of hell is little or nothing to me , ” but he was Walt Whitman .
For most religious people , the fear of hell is a powerful motivation to believe in a faith , avoid sin , and generally behave .
Here are seven pretty effective motivational scenarios .
1 . Hell : Judaism
Molech ( Image credit : The Story of the Bible ( 1884 ) by Charles Foster ,
Illustrations by F.B. Schell and others )
As with their view of heaven , Jews have an ambiguous version of hell .
The Hebrew Bible makes little mention of it except as a place where the spirits of the dead reside ( Sheol ) .
There is , however , the term Gehinnom , which refers to a valley in which children were reportedly sacrificed to the god Molech .
Eventually , this valley became a refuse dump that was constantly burning , which provided a powerful metaphor for a place to send sinners .
In later Judaism , hell is a place of punishment for unbelievers , but according to the rabbinical texts , they will probably stay there for no more than a year .
2 . The Chinvat Bridge : Zoroastrianism
Chinvat Bridge ( Image credit : Theosofie.net )
The Bridge of Separation , as it ’s also known , is the one that all people must walk after they die .
For the righteous it broadens and leads to a beautiful maiden , but for the less than righteous , it turns on its side and becomes like a razor .
The ancient god Mithra is there with a scale to balance the good and evil deeds done during one ’s lifetime , and if evil deeds prevail , then the soul is tormented by an old hag before it falls off the bridge into hell .
The torments of the evil go well beyond Dante ’s imagination and focus on punishment directly related to their evil deeds .
Zoroastrian hell may be the most horrific of all , and a text called the Vision of Arda Viraf describes it in all its gory glory .
Fortunately , everyone eventually leaves Zoroastrian hell .
They are purified and join the righteous in the reign of the god Ahura Mazda .
3 . Hades : Greek
The Rape of Proserpina by Joseph Heintz the Elder ( 1598 - 1605 ) , depicting the kidnapping and rape of Persephone by Hades .
Hades is actually the name of the lord of the dead and ruler of the netherworld , but the name became so associated with the place that the two merged , so Hades is also the place the dead go .
Hades rules this world with Persephone – whom he abducted from the earth - goddess Demeter – and a number of other figures such as Thanatos , Hypnos , Charon , and Cerberus .
Hades represents the place of eternal punishment for evildoers , where the sinners are put on horrifying display .
Such example include Tityos bound while a vulture eats his liver , Tantalus thirsty and hungry but unable to eat the fruit just above his head or drink the water at his feet , and Sisyphus forced to push a rock up a hill only to have it roll back again for eternity .
4 . Hell : Christianity
Hell , depicted in Hortus deliciarum [ wiki ] a medieval manuscript ( c. 1167 )
compiled by Herrad of Landsberg .
Christian hells seems at one level to be a combination of the Jewish idea of Gehinnom , where there is eternal burning , and Hades , where there is eternal punishment .
In fact , the Greek word for hell in the New Testament is often hades , and Jesus used the word Gehenna ( a version of Gehinnom ) to indicate the place for sinners where the fire is not quenched and the worm does not die .
The Book of Revelation indicates that those whose name are not found written in the Book of Life are thrown into the lake of fire .
In fact , Death and Hades themselves are thrown into the lake of fire in the end .
In addition to these texts , Dante did much to embellish the Christian notion of hell in his Inferno .
5 . Hell : Islam
The Day of the Last Judgment , painting attributed to artist Mohammad Modabber - undated , but likely from the late 19th century .
( Image credit : Coffee - House Painting by Hadi Seyf , publ .
Reza Abbasi Museum , Mohammed Image Archive )
The Quran , the sacred text of Islam , usually speak of heaven and hell in the same passage , perhaps in order to provide a dramatic contrast .
Hell is often described as “ an evil resting place ” and the “ Fire . ”
But fire is just the beginning of the torment in hell because the fire is like a wall enclosing the wicked , and when they cry out , they are showered with water as “ hot as molten brass , ” which scalds their faces .
It gets worse .
The unbelievers wear garments of fire and are lashed with rods of iron , and if they try to escape , they are dragged back and told to “ taste the torment of the Conflagration . ”
6 . Samsara : Hinduism
Wheel of Life , depicted in a Tibetan Buddhist painting
( although the concept is similar in Hinduism )
( Image credit : photo by Henryart , Wikipedia ) Again , the Eastern religions have a very different notion of the afterlife , although in some sects of Hinduism , Buddhism , and Taoism , there are heavens and hells that are similar to Western ideas of the same .
Hindu hell , however , is traditionally a continuation of life on earth called samsara .
Samsara is the endless cycle of death and rebirth that is the result of our ignorance of the ultimate reality of the universe .
The word means “ to wander across , ” as in lifetimes , and samsara is the result of karma or actions taken in this life that will determine the nature of one ’s rebirth and the caste one is born into .
7 . The Bardo : Tibetan Buddhism
Yamantaka [ wiki ] , the Conqueror of Death , the last stop in the quest for enlightenment ( Image credit : Dharmanet.com.br )
One of the most detailed and elaborate depictions of the afterlife is from the Tibetan Buddhist text Bardo Thodol , or the Tibetan Book of the Dead .
As the title suggests , the book deals with dying or , more accurately , with the state of Between , and there are many “ betweens ” : birth and death , sleeping and waking , walking and trance , and three others within the death - rebirth between .
The Bardo Thodol teaches that after death , the soul exists in the Bardo for 49 days in a between that can lead to Nirvana or back into rebirth .
One of the factors that influences the soul ’s ultimate location is the dying itself .
A good death tends to push the soul toward enlightenment , while a bad death can move it toward rebirth in the world .
Tibetan Buddhists thus spend a lot of time and energy in helping the dying .
Just an example of how we 're winning hearts and minds ...
The Daily Star ( Lebanon ) :
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice insisted on Friday that Washington is not preparing for war against Iran , but rather is pursuing " a diplomatic course , " a policy that she claimed " is supported by all the members of [ US President George W. Bush 's ]
Cabinet and by the vice president . "
But Rice 's reassurances do little to offset the bellicose words of the lunatics who are still working in the White House and still peddling the same confused analysis to support the same flawed doctrine of " pre-emptive war " that led to the current mess in Iraq .
Iran , too , has its share of irrationality in governance .
On Sunday , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that the clock was ticking toward the destruction of Israel , the same sort of refrain that has allowed the Western media to demonize the Islamic Republic and so to prepare the ground for possible assaults by the Americans and / or the Israelis .

Kids asked to physically gesture at math problems are nearly three times more likely than non-gesturers to remember what they 've learned .
In the journal Cognition , a University of Rochester scientist suggests it 's possible to help children learn difficult concepts by providing gestures as an additional and potent avenue for taking in information .
" We 've known for a while that we use gestures to add information to a conversation even when we 're not entirely clear how that information relates to what we 're saying , " says Susan Wagner Cook , lead author and postdoctoral fellow at the University .
" We asked if the reverse could be true ; if actively employing gestures when learning helps retain new information . "
It turned out to have a more dramatic effect than Cook expected .
In her study , 90 percent of students who had learned algebraic concepts using gestures remembered them three weeks later .
Only 33 percent of speech - only students who had learned the concept during instruction later retained the lesson .
And perhaps most astonishing of all , 90 percent of students who had learned by gesture alone -- no speech at all - - recalled what they 'd been taught .
Cook used a variation on a classic gesturing experiment .
When third graders approach a two - sided algebra equation , such as " 9+3+6=__+6 " on a blackboard , they will likely try to solve it in the simple way they have always approached math problems .
They tend to think in terms of " the equal sign means put the answer here , " rather than thinking that the equal sign divides the problem into two halves .
As a result , children often completely ignore the final " + 6 . "
However , even when children discard that final integer , they will often point to it momentarily as they explain how they attacked the problem .
Those children who gestured to the number , even though they may seem to ignore it , are demonstrating that they have a piece of information they can't reconcile .
Previous work has shown that the children with that extra bit of disconnected knowledge are the ones ready to learn , which suggests that perhaps giving children extra information in their gesture could lead to their learning .
Cook divided 84 third and fourth graders into three groups .
One group expressed the concept verbally without being allowed to use gestures .
The second group was allowed to use only gestures and no speech , and the third group employed both .
Teachers gave all the children the same instruction , which used both speech and gesture .
After three weeks , the children were given regular in - school math tests .
Of those children who had learned to solve the problem correctly , only a third of the speech - only students remembered the principles involved , but that figure rose dramatically for the speech - and - gesture , and the gesture - only group , to 90 - percent retention .
" My intuition is that gestures enhance learning because they capitalize on our experience acting in the world , " says Cook .
" We have a lot of experience learning through interacting with our environment as we grow , and my guess is that gesturing taps into that need to experience . "
Cook plans to look into how gesturing could be implemented effectively in classrooms to make a noticeable improvement in children 's learning .
" Gesturing does have one clear benefit , " Cook adds .
" It 's free . "

1. Multicellularity
Ponder this one in the bath .
Chances are you ’ve just scrubbed your back with a choice example of one of evolution ’s greatest inventions .
Or at least , a good plastic copy .
Sponges are a key example of multicellular life , an innovation that transformed living things from solitary cells into fantastically complex bodies .
It was such a great move , it evolved at least 16 different times .
Animals , land plants , fungi and algae all joined in .
Cells have been joining forces for billions of years .
Even bacteria can do it , forming complex colonies with a three - dimensional structure and some division of labour .
But hundreds of millions of years ago , eukaryotes – more complex cells that package up their DNA in a nucleus – took things to a new level .
They formed permanent colonies in which certain cells dedicated themselves to different tasks , such as nutrition or excretion , and whose behaviour was well coordinated .
Eukaryotes could make this leap because they had already evolved many of the necessary attributes for other purposes .
Many single - celled eukaryotes can specialise or “ differentiate ” into cell types , dedicated to specific tasks such as mating with another cell .
They sense their environment with chemical signalling systems , some of which are similar to those multicellular organisms use to coordinate their cells ’ behaviour .
And they may detect and capture their prey with the same kind of sticky surface molecules that hold cells together in animals and other multicellular organisms .
So what started it ?
One idea is that clumping together helped cells avoid being eaten by making them too much of a mouthful for single - celled predators .
Another is that single cells are often constrained in what they can do – for example , most cannot grow flagella to move and also divide at the same time .
But a colony can both move and contain dividing cells if each cell in it takes its turn .
Researchers are now trying to reconstruct the biology of the first multicellular creatures by studying the genomes of their nearest living relatives .
“ We ’re trying to peer back hundreds of millions of years , ” says Nicole King , a molecular biologist at the University of California , Berkeley .
She and her team are studying single - celled protozoans called choanoflagellates to understand how animals came to evolve from them some 600 million years ago .
Choanoflagellates and sponges – the only surviving witnesses to this step – share a common ancestor and King has found that choanoflagellates have a surprising number of equivalents to the signalling and cell - adhesion molecules unique to animals .
Yet bigger and more complex is n’t necessarily better .
As King points out , unicellular life still vastly outnumbers multicellular life in terms of both biomass and species numbers .
“ So you could say unicellular life is the most successful , but that multicellular life is the most beautiful and dramatic . ”

2 . The eye
THEY appeared in an evolutionary blink and changed the rules of life forever .
Before eyes , life was gentler and tamer , dominated by sluggish soft - bodied worms lolling around in the sea .
The invention of the eye ushered in a more brutal and competitive world .
Vision made it possible for animals to become active hunters , and sparked an evolutionary arms race that transformed the planet .
The first eyes appeared about 543 million years ago – the very beginning of the Cambrian period – in a group of trilobites called the Redlichia .
Their eyes were compound , similar to those of modern insects , and probably evolved from light - sensitive pits .
And their appearance in the fossil record is strikingly sudden – trilobite ancestors from 544 million years ago do n’t have eyes .
So what happened in that magic million years ?
Surely eyes are just too complex to appear all of a sudden ?
Not so , according to Dan - Eric Nilsson of Lund University in Sweden .
He has calculated that it would take only half a million years for a patch of light - sensitive cells to evolve into a compound eye .
“ Eyes sparked an evolutionary arms race that transformed the planet ”
That ’s not to say the difference was trivial .
Patches of photosensitive cells were probably common long before the Cambrian , allowing early animals to detect light and sense what direction it was coming from .
Such rudimentary sense organs are still used by jellyfish , flatworms and other obscure and primitive groups , and are clearly better than nothing .
But they are not eyes .
A true eye needs something extra – a lens that can focus light to form an image .
“ If you suddenly obtain a lens , the effectiveness goes from about 1 per cent to 100 per cent , ” says Andrew Parker , a zoologist at the University of Oxford .
Trilobites were n’t the only animals to stumble across this invention .
Biologists believe that eyes could have evolved independently on many occasions , though genetic evidence suggests one ancestor for all eyes .
But either way , trilobites were the first .
And what a difference it made .
In the sightless world of the early Cambrian , vision was tantamount to a super - power .
Trilobites ’ eyes allowed them to become the first active predators , able to seek out and chase down food like no animal before them .
And , unsurprisingly , their prey counter - evolved .
Just a few million years later , eyes were commonplace and animals were more active , bristling with defensive armour .
This burst of evolutionary innovation is what we now know as the Cambrian explosion .
However , sight is not universal .
Of 37 phyla of multicellular animals , only six have evolved it , so it might not look like such a great invention after all – until you stop to think .
The six phyla that have vision ( including our own , chordates , plus arthropods and molluscs ) are the most abundant , widespread and successful animals on the planet .

3 . The brain
Brains are often seen as a crowning achievement of evolution – bestowing the ultimate human traits such as language , intelligence and consciousness .
But before all that , the evolution of brains did something just as striking : it lifted life beyond vegetation .
Brains provided , for the first time , a way for organisms to deal with environmental change on a timescale shorter than generations .
A nervous system allows two extremely useful things to happen : movement and memory .
If you ’re a plant and your food source disappears , that ’s just tough .
But if you have a nervous system that can control muscles , then you can actually move around and seek out food , sex and shelter .
The simplest nervous systems are just ring - like circuits in cnidarians – the jellyfish , urchins and anemones .
These might not be terribly smart , but they can still find the things they need and interact with the world in a far more sophisticated way than plants manage .
The next evolutionary step , which probably happened in flatworms in the Cambrian , was to add some sort of control system to give the movements more purpose .
This sort of primitive brain is simply a bit of extra wiring that helps organise the networks .
Armed with this , finding food would have been the top priority the earliest water - dwelling creatures .
Organisms need to sort out nutritious from toxic food , and the brain helps them do that .
Sure enough , look at any animal and you will find the brain is always near the mouth .
In some of the most primitive invertebrates , the oesophagus actually passes right through the brain .
With brains come senses , to detect whether the world is good or bad , and a memory .
Together , these let the animal monitor in real time whether things are getting better or worse .
This in turn allows a simple system of prediction and reward .
Even animals with really simple brains – insects , slugs or flatworms – can use their experiences to predict what might be the best thing to do or eat next , and have a system of reward that reinforces good choices .
The more complex functions of the human brain – social interaction , decision - making and empathy , for example – seem to have evolved from these basic systems controlling food intake .
The sensations that control what we decide to eat became the intuitive decisions we call gut instincts .
The most highly developed parts of the human frontal cortex that deal with decisions and social interactions are right next to the parts that control taste and smell and movements of the mouth , tongue and gut .
There is a reason we kiss potential mates – it ’s the most primitive way we know to check something out .

4. Language
As far as humans are concerned , language has got to be the ultimate evolutionary innovation .
It is central to most of what makes us special , from consciousness , empathy and mental time travel to symbolism , spirituality and morality .
Language may be a defining factor of our species , but just how important is it in the evolutionary scheme of things ?
A decade ago , John Maynard Smith , then emeritus professor of biology at the University of Sussex , UK , and Eors Szathmary from the Institute of Advanced Study in Budapest , Hungary , published The Major Transitions in Evolution , their description of life ’s great leaps forward .
They identified these crucial steps as innovations in the way information was organised and transmitted from one generation to the next – starting with the origin of life itself and ending with language .
Exactly how our ancestors took this leap is possibly the hardest problem in science , Szathmary says .
He points out that complex language – language with syntax and grammar , which builds up meaning through a hierarchical arrangement of subordinate clauses – evolved just once .
Only human brains are able to produce language , and , contrary to popular belief , this ability is not confined to specialised regions in the brain such as Broca ’s and Wernicke ’s areas .
If these are damaged others can take over .
Szathmary likens language to an amoeba , and the human brain to the habitat in which it can thrive .
“ A surprisingly large part of our brain can sustain language , ” he says .
But that raises the question of why this language amoeba does n’t colonise the brains of other animals , especially primates .
Szathmary is convinced the answer lies in neural networks unique to humans that allow us to perform the complex hierarchical processing required for grammatical language .
These networks are shaped both by our genes and by experience .
The first gene associated with language , FOXP2 , was identified in 2001 , and others will surely follow .
So why do n’t our close evolutionary relatives , chimps and other primates , have similar abilities ?
The answer , recent analysis seems to suggest , lies in the fact that while humans and chimps have many genes in common , the versions expressed in human brains are more active than those in chimps .
What ’s more , the brains of newborn humans are far less developed than those of newborn chimps , which means that our neural networks are shaped over many years of development immersed in a linguistic environment .
In a sense , language is the last word in biological evolution .
That ’s because this particular evolutionary innovation allows those who possess it to move beyond the realms of the purely biological .
With language , our ancestors were able to create their own environment – we now call it culture – and adapt to it without the need for genetic changes .

5. Photosynthesis
FEW innovations have had such profound consequences for life as the ability to capture energy from sunlight .
Photosynthesis has literally altered the planet ’s face , transforming the atmosphere and cocooning Earth in a protective shield against lethal radiation .
Without photosynthesis , there would be little oxygen in the atmosphere , and no plants or animals – just microbes scratching a meagre existence from a primordial soup of minerals and carbon dioxide .
It freed life from these constraints and the oxygen it generated set the stage for the emergence of complex life .
Before photosynthesis , life consisted of single - celled microbes whose sources of energy were chemicals such as sulphur , iron and methane .
Then , around 3.5 billion years ago , or perhaps earlier , a group of microbes developed the ability to capture energy from sunlight to help make the carbohydrates they needed for growth and fuel .
It is unclear how they achieved this feat , but genetic studies suggest that the light - harvesting apparatus evolved from a protein with the job of transferring energy between molecules .
Photosynthesis had arrived .
But this early version of the process did n’t make oxygen .
It used hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide as its starting ingredients , generating carbohydrates and sulphur as end products .
Some time later – just when is uncertain – a new type of photosynthesis evolved that used a different resource , water , generating oxygen as a by - product .
In those early days , oxygen was poisonous to life .
But it built up in the atmosphere until some microbes evolved mechanisms to tolerate it , and eventually hit on ways to use it as an energy source .
That was a pretty important discovery too : using oxygen to burn carbohydrates for energy is 18 times as efficient as doing it without oxygen .
Life on Earth became high - powered at this point , setting the scene for the development of complex , multicellular life forms – including plants , which “ borrowed ” their photosynthetic apparatus from photosynthetic bacteria called cyanobacteria .
Today , directly or indirectly , photosynthesis produces virtually all of the energy used by life on Earth .
As well as providing an efficient means to burn fuel , oxygen made by photosynthesis helps protect life .
Earth is under constant bombardment from lethal UV radiation streaming out from the sun .
A by - product of our oxygenated atmosphere is a layer of ozone extending 20 to 60 kilometres above Earth ’s surface , which filters out most of the harmful UV .
This protective umbrella allowed life to escape from the sanctuary of the ocean and colonise dry land .
“ It has altered the atmosphere and cocooned Earth in a protective shield ”
Now , virtually every biochemical process on the planet is ultimately dependent on an input of solar energy .
Take a deep breath and thank those primordial oxygen - hating microbes for their biochemical inventiveness .

6. Sex
Birds do it , bees do it – for the vast majority of species , sexual reproduction is the only option .
And it is responsible for some of the most impressive biological spectacles on the planet , from mass spawnings of coral so vast that they are visible from space , to elaborate sexual displays such as the dance of the bower bird , the antlers of a stag and – according to some biologists – poetry , music and art .
Sex may even be responsible for keeping life itself going : species that give it up almost always go extinct within a few hundred generations .
Important as sex is , however , biologists are still arguing over how it evolved – and why it has n’t un-evolved .
That ’s because , on the face of it , sex looks like a losing strategy .
Evolution ought to favour asexual reproduction for two reasons .
First , in the battle for resources , asexual species should be able to outcompete sexual ones hands down .
And secondly , because sperm and eggs contain only half of each parent ’s set of genes , an organism that uses sexual reproduction only gets 50 per cent of its genes into the next generation .
Asexuals are guaranteed to pass on 100 per cent .
Clearly , though , there is something wrong with this line of reasoning .
It ’s true that many species , including insects , lizards and plants , do fine without sex , at least for a while .
But they are vastly outnumbered by sexual ones .
The enduring success of sex is usually put down to the fact that it shuffles the genetic pack , introducing variation and allowing harmful mutations to be purged ( mutations are what eventually snuffs out most asexual species ) .
Variation is important because it allows life to respond to changing environments , including interactions with predators , prey and – particularly – parasites .
Reproducing asexually is sometimes compared to buying 100 tickets in a raffle , all with the same number .
Far better to have only 50 tickets , each with a different number .
However useful sex may be now that we ’ve got it , that does n’t tell us anything about how it got started .
It could have been something as mundane as DNA repair .
Single - celled , asexual organisms may have developed the habit of periodically doubling up their genetic material , then halving it again .
This would have allowed them to repair any DNA damage by switching in the spare set .
A similar exchange of DNA still happens during the production of eggs and sperm .
Parasites are also in the frame .
Parasitic lengths of DNA known as transposons reproduce by inserting copies of themselves into the cell ’s normal genetic material .
Imagine a transposon within a single - celled organism acquiring a mutation that happens to cause its host cell to periodically fuse with other cells before dividing again .
The transposon for this primitive form of sex would be able to spread horizontally between many different cells .
Once it arose in a population , parasitic sex would catch on pretty quickly .

7. Death
Could evolution have brought the Grim Reaper into being ?
Yes , indeed .
Not in all his guises , of course – living things have always died because of mishaps such as starvation or injury .
But there ’s another sort of death in which cells – and perhaps , controversially , even whole organisms – choose annihilation because of the benefits it brings to some greater whole .
In other words , death is an evolutionary strategy .
This is most obvious in the many varieties of programmed cell death or apoptosis , a self - destruct mechanism found in every multicellular organism .
Your hand has five fingers because the cells that used to live between them died when you were an embryo .
Embryos as tiny as 8 to 16 cells – just 3 or 4 cell divisions after the fertilised egg – depend on cell death : block apoptosis and development goes awry .
Were it not for death , we would not even be born .
Even as adults we could not live without death .
Without apoptosis we would all be overrun by cancer .
Your cells are constantly racking up mutations that threaten to make your tightly controlled cell division run amok .
But surveillance systems – such as the one involving the p53 protein , called the “ guardian of the genome ” ( New Scientist , 18 December 2004 , p 38 ) – detect almost all such errors and direct the affected cells to commit suicide .
Programmed cell death plays a central role in everyday life too .
It ensures a constant turnover of cells in the gut lining and generates our skin ’s protective outer layer of dead cells .
When the immune system has finished wiping out an infection , the now - redundant white blood cells commit suicide in an orderly fashion to allow the inflammation to wind down .
And plants use cell death as part of a scorched - earth defence against pathogens , walling off the infected area and then killing off all the cells within .
It is easy to see how an organism can benefit from sacrificing a few cells .
But evolution may also have had a hand in shaping the death of whole organisms .
The cells of all higher organisms begin to age , or senesce , after just a few dozen cell divisions , ultimately leading to the death of the organism itself .
In part that is one more protection against uncontrolled growth .
But one controversial theory suggests this is part of an inbuilt genetic ageing program that sets an upper limit on all our lifespans ( New Scientist , 19 April 2004 , p 26 ) .
Most evolutionary biologists reject the idea of an innate “ death program ” .
After all , they point out , animals die of old age in many different ways , not by one single route as apoptotic cells do .
Instead , they view senescence as a sort of evolutionary junkyard : natural selection has little reason to get rid of flaws that appear late in life , since few individuals are lucky enough to make it to old age .
But now that people routinely survive well past reproductive age , we suffer the invention evolution never meant us to find : death by old age .

8. Parasitism
The name is synonymous with stealing , cheating and stealthy evil .
But the age - old battle between parasites and their hosts is one of the most powerful driving forces in evolution .
Without its plunderers and freeloaders , life would simply not be the same .
From viruses to tapeworms , barnacles to birds , parasites are among the most successful organisms on the planet , taking merciless advantage of every known creature .
Take the tapeworm .
This streamlined parasite is little more than gonads and a head full of hooks , having dispensed with a gut in favour of bathing in the nutrient - rich depths of its host ’s digestive system .
In its average 18 - year lifespan , a human tapeworm can generate 10 billion eggs .
Many parasites , such as the small liver fluke , have also mastered the art of manipulating their host ’s behaviour .
Ants whose brains are infected with a juvenile fluke feel compelled to climb to the tops of grass blades , where they are more likely to be eaten by the fluke ’s ultimate host , a sheep .
“ They are really disgusting , but man , are they good at what they do , ” says Daniel Simberloff , an ecologist at the University of Tennessee and translator of the popular French text The Art of Being a Parasite .
“ Evolution is in large part probably driven by parasites .
It is the main hypothesis for the continuation of sexual reproduction .
How much more important can you get ? ”
The parasites that have had arguably the biggest effect on evolution are the smallest .
Bacteria , protozoans and viruses can shape the evolution of their hosts because only the hardiest will survive infection .
And humans are no exception : the genes for several inherited conditions protect against infectious disease when inherited in a single dose .
For example , one copy of the gene for sickle cell anaemia protects against malaria .
And it is still happening today .
HIV and TB , for instance , are driving evolutionary change in parts of our genome , such as the immune - system genes ( New Scientist , 22 November 2003 , p 44 ) .
Hosts can influence the evolution of their parasites too .
For example , diseases which require human - to - human contact for transmission often evolve to be less deadly , ensuring a person will at least live long enough to pass it on .
Parasites can also drive the evolution at a more basic level .
Parasitic lengths of DNA called transposons , which can cut and paste themselves all over the genome , can be transformed into new genes or encourage the mutation and shuffling of DNA that fuels genetic variation .
They have even been implicated in the origins of sex , as they may have driven selection for cell fusion and gamete formation ( see opposite ) .

9. Superorganism
LARGE numbers of individuals living together in harmony , achieving a better life by dividing their workload and sharing the fruits of their labours .
We call this blissful state utopia , and have been striving to achieve it for at least as long as recorded history .
Alas , our efforts so far have been in vain .
Evolution , however , has made a rather better job of it .
Take the Portuguese man - of - war .
It may look like just another jellyfish blob floating on the high seas , but zoom in with a microscope and you see that what seemed like one tentacled individual is in fact a colony of single - celled organisms .
These “ siphanophores ” have got division of labour down to a fine art .
Some are specialised for locomotion , some for feeding , some for distributing nutrients .
This communal existence brings major advantages .
It allows the constituent organisms , which would otherwise be rooted to the sea floor , to swim free .
And together they are better able to defend themselves against predators , cope with environmental stress , and colonise new territory .
Portuguese man - of - war jellyfish are truly superorganisms .
With benefits like these on offer , it should come as no surprise that colonial living has evolved many times .
Except that it does come with one big drawback , as the case of the slime bacteria , or myxobacteria , illustrates .
These microbes are perhaps the simplest colonial organisms .
Under normal circumstances individual bacteria glide along on lonely slime trails .
Only when certain amino acids are lacking in their environment do individuals start to aggregate .
The resulting superorganism consists of a stalk topped by a fruiting body containing spores .
But since only the bacteria forming the spores will get the chance of dispersal and a new life , why should the others play along ?
How this kind of cooperation evolved , and how cheats are prevented from taking advantage of it remains unclear for some types of colonial life .
But in one group of animals , the colonial insects , we do know what the trick is – and it ’s an ingenious one .
Females develop from fertilised eggs , while males develop from unfertilised ones .
This way of determining sex , called haplodiploidy , ensures that sisters are more closely related to each other than to their own offspring .
And this means that the best chance they can give their own genes of surviving is to look after each other rather than lay eggs of their own .
This is what provides the stability at the heart of the beehive and termite mound , and in many other insect colonies where haplodiploidy has evolved at least a dozen times .
True sociality , or eusociality as it is technically known , is found in all ants and termites , in the most highly organised bees and wasps , and in some other species , not all of which employ haplodiploidy .
And although these mini societies need careful policing to keep cheats at bay , this is probably the closest thing on Earth to utopia .

10 . Symbiosis
Crocodiles with gleaming gums , coral reefs , orchids , fish with glow - in - the - dark lures , ants that farm , new directions for evolution .
All that from swapping food – for cleaning services , for transport , for sunscreen , for shelter , and of course for other food .
Symbiosis has many definitions , but we ’ll take it to mean two species engaging in physically intimate , mutually beneficial dependency , almost invariably involving food .
Symbiosis has triggered seismic shifts in evolution , and evolution in turn continually spawns new symbiotic relationships .
Perhaps the most pivotal couplings were the ones that turbocharged complex , or eukaryotic , cells .
Eukaryotes use specialised organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts to extract energy from food or sunlight .
These organelles were originally simpler , prokaryotic cells that the eukaryotes engulfed in an eternal symbiotic embrace .
Without them life ’s key developments , such as increasing complexity and multicellular plants and animals , would not have happened .
“ There are only two things that matter in this world : respiration and photosynthesis .
Eukaryotes did n’t figure out either by themselves , they borrowed them from prokaryotes through symbiosis , ” says Geoff McFadden of the University of Melbourne , Australia .
Symbiosis has popped up so frequently during evolution that it is safe to say it ’s the rule , not the exception .
Angler fish in the deep ocean host bioluminescent bacteria in appendages that dangle over their mouths .
Smaller fish lured by the light are easy prey .
At the ocean surface , coral polyps provide homes for photosynthetic algae , and swap inorganic waste products for organic carbon compounds – one reason why nutrient - poor tropical waters can support so much life .
The algae also produce a chemical that absorbs ultraviolet light and protects the coral .
More than 90 per cent of plant species are thought to engage in symbiotic couplings .
Orchid seeds are little more than dust , containing next to no nutrients .
To germinate and grow , they digest a fungus that infects the seed .
“ Birds and animals and insects that are adapted to pollination and seed disposal , these are some of the greatest symbioses .
Without them we would n’t have most of our flowering plants , ” says Ursula Munro , an ecologist at the University of Technology in Sydney , Australia .
“ Without symbiosis we would n’t have most of our flowering plants ”
Plovers pick leeches from crocodiles ’ teeth , offering dental hygiene in return for food .
Leafcutter ants use chopped - up leaves as a fertiliser for the fungus they grow in underground chambers .
The ants cannot digest the leaves but the fungus that feeds on them produces a tasty meal of sugars and starch while breaking down the toxins in the leaves .
And there is not an animal out there , including us , that can survive without the bacteria that live in its gut , digesting food and producing vitamins .
Goldman was able to offset its sub - prime losses
While the firm 's losses caused by the sub - prime crisis were $ 1.5 bn ( £ 747 m ) , it said this was " more than offset " by hedging that mortgage bonds would fall .
As a result , the firm 's profits for the three months to 31 August rose to $ 2.85 bn from $ 1.58 bn a year earlier .
It was also boosted by the $ 1bn sale of its stake in Horizon Wind Energy .
' Stunningly good '
Goldman 's revenues for its third quarter rose 63 % to $ 12.3bn , again beating market expectations .
Analyst Adam Compton of RCM Global Investors said Goldman 's results were " stunningly good " .
Other analysts said Goldman was helped by the diversity of its investment portfolio .
" It demonstrates how diverse Goldman is both in terms of its product range , as well as its geographic diversity , " said Camilla Petersen , an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London .
I hate Robbie Williams … but I agree , I would n’t call this funny and it is pretty damn good of him to go on with the show .
I know some of some artists that have walked off for much less then this hell , even some of my favorite artists have been boo-ed off stage for not playing a particular song .

Over six thousand people have voted in the Who ’s Afraid of Robots ?
poll ( which will remain open indefinitely ) .
Many people supported this effort ( see below ) , propelling the entry to the frontpage of Digg , as I had hoped , which increased the number of voters and brought a heap of varying opinions on the matter .
The survey ’s results are quite intriguing .
The poll contained 3 possible answers :
Yes , I find the idea of intelligent machines frightening No , I do n’t find intelligent machines frightening I ’m not afraid of intelligent machines , I ’m afraid of how humans will use the technology
The third option in the poll , on fearing AI usage , has come under minor scrutiny so I ’ll briefly touch on my reasons for including it .
Most technology has the potential of being misused or abused , either intentionally or because of ignorance .
A good example is nuclear power ( bomb vs. energy provider ) .
We can assume most people would say they fear malicious use of any technology .
If we would ’ve had only a yes or no answer — the results would have been obfuscated as it would have been an ambiguous mix of the fear of intelligent machines and the fear of their application .
My goal was to discern between these two , which is important , because the first is a fear of new intelligences and the latter a fear of old ones ( ours ) .
Fear of malicious use applies to all technologies , so the third option serves as a filtering mechanism for this ‘ general ’ fear which could have nothing to do with AI whatsoever .
The result is that voters weigh which feeling is overpowering : Fear of our own follies , or fear of new kinds of intelligent beings .
For example , I fear that we might use AI technologies for malicious purposes — but —
I feel that the benefits of AI dwarf this fear ( see Science : Powered by Intelligence ) .
I do n’t fear intelligent machines themselves at all and thus I choose the second option .
Results
Before we continue , a fair disclaimer :
This survey was carried out in an informal manner .
The interpretation presented here is the speculative work of one person alone .
While giving an indication of opinions within a certain group , they do not guarantee accuracy .
The flat results are as follows :
Do you , for some reason , fear the current and / or future increase of artificial intelligence ?
16.7 % Yes , I find the idea of intelligent machines frightening ( 1002 votes )
Yes , I find the idea of intelligent machines frightening ( 1002 votes ) 27.1 %
No , I do n’t find intelligent machines frightening ( 1632 votes )
No , I do n’t find intelligent machines frightening ( 1632 votes ) 56.3 % I ’m not afraid of intelligent machines , I ’m afraid of how humans will use the technology ( 3366 votes )
The first question we need to address is :
Who are these people ?
Are they young Icelandic academics or old American - south churchgoers ?
The web connects the entire world which makes it hard to say , but we do know that the majority of the first 6000 votes came from Digg users .
I was unable to find surveys on the male to female ratio of Digg users , but Google reveals many claiming 80 - 90 % of the users are male .
This , combined with information provided by The Mu Life blog on user age statistics and the Modern Life on nationality , we can loosely speculate that the majority of our voters are American males aged 17 - 24 .
Personally , I find the results a bit surprising .
Digg is a technologically oriented site and the users are most likely tech savvy .
That being said , 16 % of voters fearing AI is quite high .
I can only imagine that this percentage would rise sharply if the poll was subjected to people with less knowledge of tech and / or science .
The combined fear factor of the poll — 73 % — is also too much fear to be considered healthy in my book .
I think many people do n’t realize AI ’s full potential ; imagine AI simply as the robot that brings us beer and washes our dishes ( and murders us in our sleep ) .
As I ’ve mentioned before , I do n’t fear AI technologies nearly as much as I fear the lack of them .
We have a lot of problems , and to solve them we need more intelligence :
We ’re on the gradient fast track from automation to intelligence , and with every step of the way we ’re opening up new possibilites for aiding humanity with all its troubles .
By building intelligent machines we ’re advancing in all scientific fields , because a machine can help us process scientific data , optimize production , minimize costs and even invent new means by which we can reach our goals .
No one can claim there ’s enough intelligence in the world . [...]
Artificial Intelligence is n’t only an incredibly powerful tool for simulating ( and thereby understanding ) the vast complexity that is our minds , but , once created the simulations become a tool applicable to a high number of problems from all corners of our existence .
Read more …
But , of course , there are some things that we need to consider carefully in these matters , especially regarding military and security applications .
Fear can be useful to make us careful , but let ’s not have fear paralyze us :
The quest for knowledge and scientific advances should prevail .
In closing remarks , there are a few very good points from both sides in the comments thread of the poll article that I recommend reading .
Last but not least , this entertaining and interesting survey could n’t have happened without the support of the following great people : KuiperCliff , Chip ’s Quips , One Man ’s Blog , Computer Science Canada blog , Smart Machines , the 9Rules gang , fellow colleagues at CADIA — and many individuals , friends and strangers .

Much western journalism in the six years since 9/11 has concentrated on terrorist groups , jihadis and suicide bombers .
But while the threat of violence remains very real , those commentators who have compared what they ignorantly call " Islamofascism " to the Nazis are guilty of hysteria : the differences in relative power and military capability are too great for the comparison to be valid , and the analogies that the neocons draw with the second world war are demonstrably false .
As long as the west interferes in the Muslim world , bombs will go off ; and as long as Britain lines up behind George Bush 's illegal wars , British innocents will die in jihadi atrocities .
But that does not mean we are about to be invaded , nor is Europe about to be demographically swamped , as North American commentators such as Mark Steyn claim : Muslims will make up no more than 10 % of the European population by 2020 .
Yet in concentrating on the violent jihadi fringe , we may have missed the main story .
For if the imminent Islamist takeover of western Europe is a myth , the same cannot be said for the Islamic world .
Clumsy and brutal US policies in the Middle East have generated revolutionary changes , radicalising even the most moderate opinion , with the result that the status quo in place since the 1950s has been broken .
Egypt is typical : at the last election in 2005 members of the nominally banned Muslim Brotherhood , standing as independents , saw their representation rise from 17 seats to 88 in the 444 - seat people 's assembly - a five - fold increase , despite reports of vote - rigging by President Mubarak 's ruling National Democratic Alliance .
The Brothers , who have long abjured violence , are now the main opposition .
The figures in Pakistan are strikingly similar .
Traditionally , the religious parties there have won only a fraction of the vote .
That began to change after the US invasion of Afghanistan .
In October 2002 a rightwing alliance of religious parties - the Muttahida Majlis Amal or MMA - won 11.6 % of the vote , more than doubling its share , and sweeping the polls in the two provinces bordering Afghanistan - Baluchistan and the North West Frontier Province - where it formed ultra-conservative and pro-Islamist provincial governments .
If the last election turned the MMA into a serious electoral force , there are now fears that it could yet be the principle beneficiary of the current standoff in Pakistan .
The Bush administration proclaimed in 2004 that the promotion of democracy in the Middle East would be a major foreign policy theme in its second term .
It has been widely perceived , not least in Washington , that this policy has failed .
Yet in many ways US foreign policy has succeeded in turning Muslim opinion against the corrupt monarchies and decaying nationalist parties who have ruled the region for 50 years .
The irony is that rather than turning to liberal secular parties , as the neocons assumed , Muslims have lined up behind parties most clearly seen to stand up against aggressive US intervention .
Religious parties , in other words , have come to power for reasons largely unconnected to religion .
As clear and unambiguous opponents of US policy in the Middle East - in a way that , say , Musharraf , Mubarak and Mahmoud Abbas are not - religious parties have benefited from legitimate Muslim anger : anger at the thousands of lives lost in Afghanistan and Iraq ; at the blind eye the US turns to Israel 's nuclear arsenal and colonisation of the West Bank ; at the horrors of Abu Ghraib and the incarceration of thousands of Muslims without trial in the licensed network of torture centres that the US operates across the globe ; and at the Islamophobic rhetoric that still flows from Bush and his circle in Washington .
Moreover , the religious parties tend to be seen by the poor , rightly or wrongly , as representing justice , integrity and equitable distribution of resources .
Hence the strong showing , for example , of Hamas against the blatantly corrupt Fatah in the 2006 elections in Palestine .
Equally , the dramatic rise of Hizbullah in Lebanon has not been because of a sudden fondness for sharia law , but because of the status of Hassan Nasrallah , Hizbullah 's leader , as the man who gave the Israelis a bloody nose , and who provides medical and social services for the people of South Lebanon , just as Hamas does in Gaza .
The usual US response has been to retreat from its push for democracy when the " wrong " parties win .
This was the case not just with the electoral victory of Hamas , but also in Egypt : since the Brothers ' strong showing in the elections , the US has stopped pressing Mubarak to make democratic reforms , and many of the Brothers ' leading activists and business backers , as well as Mubarak 's opponent in the presidential election , are in prison , all without a word of censure from Washington .
Yet on a recent visit to Egypt I found everywhere a strong feeling that political Islam was there to stay , and that this was something everyone was going to have to learn to live with ; the US response had become almost irrelevant .
Even the Copts were making overtures to the Brothers .
As Youssef Sidhom , who edits the leading Coptic newspaper , put it : " They are not going away .
We need to enter into dialogue , to clarify their policies , and end mutual mistrust . "
The reality is that , like the Copts , we are going to have to find some modus vivendi with political Islam .
Pretending that the Islamists do not exist , and that we will not talk to them , is no answer .
Only by opening dialogue are we likely to find those with whom we can work , and to begin to repair the damage that self - defeating Anglo - American policies have done to the region , and to western influence there , since 9/11 .

My longest friendship was with Edgar , a friend I met in the 6th grade .
He was , like me , a child of immigrant parents and he spoke primarily Spanish .
He loved to joke , tell stories , and that favorite of past times , sit around with your closest friends and make fun of each other .
Unfortunately , he was also one who tended toward the criminal side of life .
Since we first met , he was always getting into trouble for something , be it ditching class , smoking weed , fighting , stealing stereos , stealing cars and other things – but nothing that would make him a bad friend .
He would n’t steal from his friends , I have never in my life seen him lose his temper , he was a friend who would watch your back and who you could trust .
I remember riding my bike from Compton to his parents apartment in Gardena and later to their new spot in South Los Angeles .
He introduced me to a lot of new people .
Everywhere he moved , within months , he would know many people in the neighborhood .
Like me , he was someone who could n’t stay in the house and met new people easily .
We both would ride our bikes anywhere , on a whim .
To swapmeets , malls , hang outs , anywhere our bikes would take us .
Also , as crazy luck would have it , he had two cousins that were from the Mexican gang that claimed my neighborhood in Compton .
Eventually , he too would join that gang and become one of its lifetime members .
Like my mom , he had a family that would give him almost free reign to do as he pleased .
There were no restrictions , even at an early age , we had no curfew , no limits on where or what city we can ride our bikes to , and little supervision outside of the home .
His step dad , who had spent some time in prison and I knew only casually , would sometimes pick us up if we needed it .
One time , I think I was about 13 years old at the time , his step dad picked us up and instead of taking us immediately home , drove deeper into LA to a place I had never been before .
He left us in the car reassuring us he would be back shortly .
Hours passed , well into the night , and we were still parked .
He had an old Monte Carlo with really wide back seats , so Edgar and I fell asleep in the car , waiting for him to get back .
Then out of nowhere , he comes back to the car , asks Edgar to get in the back seat with me , and brings with him a , what looked like , neighborhood cluck head .
A cluck head is someone who is so addicted to drugs , primarily crack cocaine and has done so much of it , that they are visually drug addicts .
The people you meet in high crime neighborhoods late at night with really red eyes , dry lips , missing teeth and always begging you for change , those are cluck heads .
As soon as they got into the car , he drives a few blocks more and she gets out only to return a few minutes later .
Edgar and I are both still in the back seat but I do n’t say a word and Edgar looks like he went right back to sleep .
A few minutes go by and I hear them smoking something , I hear the burning of foil paper , the sight of a lighter , and eventually realize that they are smoking crack cocaine together .
After doing this for some time , he eventually leaves the area and takes us home .
Years later , the same step dad would be hospitalized after jumping out of his second story window while high on PCP , he believed he could fly and nobody could convince him otherwise .
The longest friendship from Compton I had was with ( lil ) Sid , he lived a few houses from my house .
Though he was a few years younger than me , we hung out alot .
He would come to my house and we would play nintendo , baseball , and craps in the front of my house .
Thinking back to those early years , I remember most his temper , whenever he would lose big he would have to go back home because he would get so frustrated with himself , sometimes in tears of anger .
As the years passed Sid got older ( and bigger , grew up to be one big guy ) and , sadly , ended up joining the neighborhood crip gang .
Though he was black , a member of a crip gang , and had a circle of friends different than mine , we continued to stay really close friends .
Sid did n’t know his father and his mother was a neighborhood walker , at all hours of the day and night she would be walking all around the neighborhood , to peoples houses , to the liquor store , to the adjacent streets , all over .
Sids mom was also , though not at the level of a crack head , a crack cocaine user .
Though I knew before , I remember hanging out with a local drug dealer when she showed up to buy crack .
She looked at me straight in the eyes and told me never to mention this to her son .
I promised her that I would not , and never did – though I am sure he already knew .
My neighbors in Compton were local crips .
The mom was as addicted to crack cocaine as you can get .
She had missing teeth , a temper like no other , a clumsy walk , always had a cigaratte or beer in her hand and if you met her elsewhere you could easily confuse her for homeless ( nonetheless , I grew up with her as a friend and neighbor , and to this day when I see her we hug and respect each other ) .
She has three sons , the older one of which was getting into trouble since I first moved into Compton ( he is now serving life in prison ) .
These friends and family upbringings I write about are not that rare in Compton .
Almost all of my friends families I had while living in Compton have something in common with these families .
Very few of them , especially my black friends , have married parents , the ones that did had a dad that beats their mom , others one that is a drug and / or alcoholic , others a dad that is currently in prison or an ex-con former gangmember ( like Edgars step dad ) – some have prostitute moms , some have parents that sell drugs and push them to sell drugs .
I remember walking into a friends house and seeing his mom sniffing cocaine right off the living room table .
It did n’t bother her either , we just walked right passed her into my friends room .
She was a neighborhood drug dealer and her son would later follow in her footsteps , all with his moms approval and backing .
In fact , all drug dealers I knew in Compton had atleast tacit approval from their parents – several had outright encouragement .
Poverty in the United States is not primarily material , it is not primarily nutritional , it is not even primarily a lack of opportunity , though some of that still remains – poverty in the United States is primarily with the family .
As the must read political scientist James Q. Wilson wrote , “ There are many families with competent single moms , but they are outnumbered by the families that are harmed by the absence of a husband .
From the ranks of the latter come high rates of crime and imprisonment , heavy rates of drug use , poor school performance , and a willingness to loot unguarded stores … .
In my opinion , the condition of the black family is the key to the persistence of a large and criminal lower class . “
It is not money , or nutrition , or greater opportunity that the poor in the United States primarily need , it is a family structure that is conducive to learning , to upward mobility , and to a crime free life .
When you have a large amount of friends and family – dads , brothers , uncles , and neighbors either in gangs or intimately tied to the gang culture , and a world filled with drugs , and crime , it is hard to see a way out and it is hard to learn the virtues necessary to get out .
Virtues like hard work , discipline , self control , and responsibility are hard if not impossible to learn in these environments and much of government assistant is wasted or counterproductive in these situations .
As far as Edgar and Sid go , Edgar was in jail the last couple of years I lived in Compton , and the last time I saw him was when I was in my last year of college , I picked him up from jail and took him to his parents house .
At this point his parents had had enough with him and refused to let him in .
He promised he is a changed man and begged them to give him one last chance but they would n’t budge .
I dropped him off with some of his homies , and that is the last I saw of him .
Shortly after , he would land in prison again , this time his last and he is not set to come out for a very long time .
Sid , on the other hand , started to do good .
After I moved out of Compton I would occasionally come back to visit and last I heard he said he was finally leaving Compton in search of a better life in Long Beach .
Unfortunately , that was the last I saw of him .
In another Compton visit I spotted his mom and eagerly asked her about Sid , with the impression that he is doing well in Long Beach .
She informed me that he had been shot and killed in LA , and with tears already in her eyes , I asked no further questions and expressed my condolences .
May he Rest In Peace .
This graph shows several examples of data sets from the Spaniard National Institute of Statistics that follow Benford ’s logarithmic law .
Data from the lottery , however , is random and uniform .
Credit : Jesús Torres , et al .
Does your house address start with a 1 ?
According to a strange mathematical law , about 1/3 of house numbers have 1 as their first digit .
The same holds true for many other areas that have almost nothing in common : the Dow Jones index history , size of files stored on a PC , the length of the world ’s rivers , the numbers in newspapers ’ front page headlines , and many more .
The law is called Benford ’s law after its ( second ) founder , Frank Benford , who discovered it in 1935 as a physicist at General Electric .
The law tells how often each number ( from 1 to 9 ) appears as the first significant digit in a very diverse range of data sets .
Besides the number 1 consistently appearing about 1/3 of the time , number 2 appears with a frequency of 17.6 % , number 3 at 12.5 % , on down to number 9 at 4.6 % .
In mathematical terms , this logarithmic law is written as F ( d ) = log [ 1 + ( 1/d ) ] , where F is the frequency and d is the digit in question .
If this sounds kind of strange , scientists Jesús Torres , Sonsoles Fernández , Antonio Gamero , and Antonio Sola from the Universidad de Cordoba also call the feature surprising .
The scientists published a letter in the European Journal of Physics called “ How do numbers begin ?
( The first digit law ) , ” which gives a short historical review of the law .
Their paper also includes useful applications and explains that no one has been able to provide an underlying reason for the consistent frequencies .
“ The Benford law has been an intriguing question for me for years , ever since I read about it , ” Torres , who specializes in plasma physics , told PhysOrg.com .
“ I have used it as a surprising example at statistical physics classes to arouse the curiosity of my pupils . ”
Torres et al. explain that , before Benford , a highly esteemed astronomer named Simon Newcomb discovered the law in 1881 , although Newcomb ’s contemporaries did not pay much attention to his publication .
Both Benford and Newcomb stumbled upon the law in the same way : while flipping through pages of a book of logarithmic tables , they noticed that the pages in the beginning of the book were dirtier than the pages at the end .
This meant that their colleagues who shared the library preferred quantities beginning with the number one in their various disciplines .
Benford took this observation a step further than Newcomb , and began investigating other groups of numbers , finding that the “ first digit law ” emerged in groups as disparate as populations , death rates , physical and chemical constants , baseball statistics , the half - lives of radioactive isotopes , answers in a physics book , prime numbers , and Fibonacci numbers .
In other words , just about any group of data obtained by using measurements satisfies the law .
On the other hand , data sets that are arbitrary and contain restrictions usually do n’t follow Benford ’s law .
For example , lottery numbers , telephone numbers , gas prices , dates , and the weights or heights of a group of people are either random or arbitrarily assigned , and not obtained by measurement .
As Torres and his colleagues explain , scientists in the decades following Benford performed numerous studies , but discovered little more about the law other than racking up a wide variety of examples .
However , scientists did discover a few curiosities .
For one , when investigating second significant digits of data sets , the law still held , but with less importance .
Similarly , for the third and fourth digits , the appearance of the numbers started becoming equal , leveling out at a uniform 10 % for the fifth digit .
A second discovery attracted even more scientific interest :
“ In 1961 , Pinkham discovered the first general relevant result , demonstrating that Benford ’s law is scale invariant and is also the only law referring to digits which can have this scale invariance , ” the scientists wrote in their letter .
“ That is to say , as the length of the rivers of the world in kilometers fulfill Benford ’s law , it is certain that these same data expressed in miles , light years , microns or in any other length units will also fulfill it . ”
Torres et al. also explain that in the last years of the 20th century , some important theoretical advances have been proven ( base invariance , unicity , etc. ) , mainly by Ted Hill and other mathematicians .
While some cases can be explained ( for example , house addresses almost always start with 1’s , and lower numbers must occur before higher numbers ) , there is still no general justification for all examples .
The scientists also explain that there is no a priori criteria that tells when a data set should or should not obey the law .
“ Nowadays there are many theoretical results about the law , but some points remain in darkness , ” said Torres .
“ Why do some numerical sets , like universal physical constants , follow the law so well ?
We need to know not only mathematical reasons for the law , but also characterize this set of experimental data .
For example , what are their points of contact ?
Where they come from ?
Apparently , they are independent .
” I hope the general necessary and sufficient conditions will be discovered in the future — many people are interested in the law , especially economists — but I also know it could be not possible ever , ” he added , mentioning Godel .
Nevertheless , scientists have been using the law for many practical applications .
For example , because a year ’s accounting data of a company should fulfill the law , economists can detect falsified data , which is very hard to manipulate to follow the law .
( Interestingly , scientists found that numbers 5 and 6 , rather than 1 , are the most prevalent , suggesting that forgers try to “ hide ” data in the middle . )
Benford ’s law has also been recently applied to electoral fraud in order to detect voting anomalies .
Scientists found that the 2004 US presidential election showed anomalies in the state of Florida , as well as fraud in Venezuela in 2004 and Mexico in 2006 .
“ The story about how it was discovered — twice — from dirty pages … it is almost incredible , ” said Torres .
“ Benford 's law has undeniable applications , and this useful aspect was not clear when the law was discovered .
It seemed to be only a math curiosity .
For me , this is an example of how simplicity can be unexpectedly marvelous . ”

Abstract
There is a paucity of facts about the effects of the recent military Surge on conditions in Iraq and whether it is paving the way for a stable Iraq .
Selective , anecdotal and incomplete analyses abound .
Policy makers and defense planners must decide which measures of success or failure are most important , but until now few , if any , systematic analyses were available on which to base those decisions .
This paper applies modern statistical techniques to a new data file derived from more than a dozen of the most reliable and widely - cited sources to assess the Surge 's impact on three key dimensions : the functioning of the Iraqi state ( including civilian casualties ) ; military casualties ; and financial markets ' assessment of Iraq 's future .
The new and unusually rigorous findings presented here should help inform current evaluations of the Surge and provide a basis for better decision making about future strategy .
The analysis reveals mixed evidence on the Surge 's effect on key trends in Iraq .
The security situation has improved insofar as civilian fatalities have declined without any concurrent increase in casualties among coalition and Iraqi troops .
However , other areas , such as oil production and the number of trained Iraqi Security Forces have shown no improvement or declined .
Evaluating such conflicting indicators is challenging .
There is , however , another way to assess the Surge .
This paper shows how data from world financial markets can be used to shed light on the central question of whether the Surge has increased or diminished the prospect of today 's Iraq surviving into the future .
In particular , I examine the price of Iraqi state bonds , which the Iraqi government is currently servicing , on world financial markets .
After the Surge , there is a sharp decline in the price of those bonds , relative to alternative bonds .
The decline signaled a 40 % increase in the market 's expectation that Iraq will default .
This finding suggests that to date the Surge is failing to pave the way toward a stable Iraq and may in fact be undermining it .

WASHINGTON , Aug. 30 — The Justice Department ’s internal watchdog disclosed today that he was investigating whether sworn statements to Congress by Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales were “ intentionally false , misleading or inappropriate . ”
The first official confirmation that Mr. Gonzales is under investigation within the executive branch over the truthfulness of his testimony came in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee from Glenn A. Fine , the inspector general at the Justice Department .
The committee ’s chairman , Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont , had requested the inquiry earlier this month .
For weeks , lawmakers from both parties have questioned whether Mr. Gonzales told the truth in sworn statements to Congress on a number of issues , including his involvement in efforts to preserve the National Security Agency ’s policy of wiretapping without warrants , as well as his role in last year ’s dismissals of several United States attorneys for what appeared to be political reasons .
It was not clear if the investigation by the inspector general was tied in any way to Mr. Gonzales ’s announcement on Monday that he was resigning from the Justice Department , effective next month .
He has offered no details for the reasoning behind his resignation or its timing , and his departure caught top aides by surprise .
And Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd has increased his lead as preferred prime minister .
He is up one point to 44 per cent , while Mr Howard has dropped one point to 39 per cent .
The bad polls come as the Government waits on tenterhooks to see whether interest rates rise tomorrow , which could further damage its standing .
Speaking in response to the internal report , Mr Howard said Labor had been running " flat out " on the issue of his age , so eventually some people would pick that up .
The extraordinary leak of highly confidential material has unnerved the Liberal Party , which now fears for the security of future research .
The report went to federal director Brian Loughnane , who is conducting an investigation into the leak , and a couple of others in the federal secretariat .
Mr Howard did not have a hard copy .
Mr Textor gave Powerpoint presentations to senior federal and state party figures .
The Crosby / Textor report , prepared in late June , strongly highlighted voters ' perception of the younger , attractive Mr Rudd , who represented the opportunity for generational change .
They saw Mr Rudd as strong and competent , " so just like John Howard , but younger " , and were disillusioned with the Liberals ' dishonesty and broken promises .
The Labor leader will today move to capitalise his appeal to younger voters when he unveils a US - style campaign website , " kevin07 " .
Mr Howard 's ministers yesterday leapt to his defence .
Senate leader Nick Minchin said he said he was " one of the most honest , straightforward politicians " Australia had had .
Senate deputy leader Helen Coonan said Mr Howard " is certainly someone who seems to me to be on top of his game " .
The Costello forces quickly moved to head off any suggestion of pressure for a leadership change .
Minister for Ageing Chris Pyne , a confidant of the Treasurer , said : " There 's absolutely no suggestion of any such change before the election " .
The blow to Mr Howard comes only weeks after a new biography of him stirred leadership talk when it reported trenchant criticisms from Treasurer Peter Costello .
Meanwhile , Mr Howard 's first biographer , David Barnett , has said the Prime Minister should step aside .
Writing in The Canberra Times , he said Mr Howard had " failed to turn around the catastrophic collapse of support for the Coalition that has occurred since Rudd became ALP leader last year " .
Mr Rudd said the internal report , which advocated that the Government attack the states , showed Mr Howard was poll - driven .
He also started to pressure Mr Howard over the election date , saying if he delayed until November it would be a sign he was " desperate " .
Crosby / Textor 's internal report said : " Kevin Rudd is someone voters appear willing — at this early stage — to make a long - term investment in , particularly for young voters …
The idea of generational change is now attractive where it was n't previously because Rudd , unlike ( Kim ) Beazley , ( Mark ) Latham and ( Simon ) Crean , looks energetic and enthusiastic . "
Mr Howard was being seen as " increasingly rattled and not responding well under pressure " .
" With the arrival of a younger leadership alternative , the age and energy of the Government has also been thrown into question , rasing questions about whether they are listening or getting arrogant , complacent and reactive , " it said .
" Rudd 's ability to to remain unfazed is a contrast not only against Beazley and Latham … but as voters have seen more recently , Rudd is politically competent and strong and able to match and even rattle John Howard . "
China is not the first country to make aid a tool in advancing its interests abroad .
The Soviet Union and the United States spent decades giving development aid to dictators in exchange for their allegiance .
Even today , American largess to Egypt and Pakistan is rooted in geopolitical calculation .
But beginning in the 1990s , foreign aid had begun to slowly improve .
Scrutiny by the news media shamed many developed countries into curbing their bad practices .
Today , the projects of organizations like the World Bank are meticulously inspected by watchdog groups .
Although the system is far from perfect , it is certainly more transparent than it was when foreign aid routinely helped ruthless dictators stay in power .
Nor is China the only regime offering rogue aid .
President Hugo Chávez has not been shy in using his nation ’s oil money to recruit allies abroad .
Indeed , Venezuela ’s ambassador to Nicaragua , explaining his country ’s large aid packages in the region , bluntly announced , “ We want to infect Latin America with our model . ”
Mr. Chávez ’s financial aid to Cuba far exceeds what the island used to get from Leonid Brezhnev during the heyday of Soviet communism , and it has dashed hopes for Cuba ’s opening as a result of Fidel Castro ’s demise and the island ’s bankruptcy .
Because of Mr. Chávez ’s artificial lifeline , Cubans will be forced to wait even longer for the indispensable reforms that will bring their society opportunities for true prosperity and freedom .
Iranian aid to Hamas in Palestine and Hezbollah in Lebanon may have increased Iran ’s influence in the region , but it is damaging to the people in those countries for the same reason that Venezuelan aid hurts Cubans .
The same can be said of Saudi Arabia ’s sponsorship , in countries like Pakistan , of religious schools that fail to equip students with the skills they need to get jobs .
One could argue that students are surely better off going to any school than being in the streets .
But why should these be the only options ?
Why ca n’t the Saudis finance education , the Chinese pay for railroads and electric grids , and the Venezuelans help Cuba ’s economy without also hurting poor Pakistanis , Nigerians and Cubans ?
Because the goal of these donors is not to help other countries develop .
Rather , they seek to further their own national interests , advance an ideological agenda or even line their own pockets .
Rogue aid providers could n’t care less about the long - term well - being of the population of the countries they aid .
States like China , Iran , Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have the cash and the will to reshape the world into a place very unlike the one where we want to live .
By pushing their alternative development model , such states effectively price responsible aid programs out of the market exactly where they are needed most .
In place of those programs , rogue donors offer to underwrite a world that is more corrupt , chaotic and authoritarian .
That sort of aid is in no one ’s interest , except the rogues .
The Growing gap
This graphic is worth careful study .
[ 1 ]
It shows oil discoveries and oil consumption since 1930 to 2008 .
The black line shows oil consumption .
Notice the peak in consumption in 1979 corresponding to the first oil crisis .
The subsequent 5 year decline in oil consumption is attributed to more fuel efficient transportation and a slowing world economy .
The grey bars show oil discoveries .
Notable grey bar features include Kuwait 's big oil field , Burgan , which was discovered in the late 30s and Ghawar , the world 's largest oil field , which was discovered in 1948 .
Note that the discovery rate peaked around 1966 .
Note also that consumption exceeds discoveries every year since 1984 .
Now there is a large gap between discoveries and production .
None of this is controversial -- it is only history .
What happens after 2008 is extrapolation and speculation .
The EIA [ 3 ] ( Energy Information Agency ) has projected a 1.6 % annual growth in oil demand which is shown in red .
Developed countries , for example the USA , Germany and Japan are not expected to increase consumption .
In fact , consumption might decrease because of efficiency gains .
But China and India both have booming economies .
Automobile ownership increased by 37 % in China and 17 % in India in 2007 .
The yellow bars represent a guess about yet - to - find oil .
The yellow bars show no declines in the discovery rate until 2021 .
That seems optimistic given the declining discovery rate in the previous decade .
Note the growing gap between discoveries and production !
The Conclusion
Oil discovered 40 years ago is the basis of current oil production .
The search for oil continues but projected oil discoveries will contribute little to projected oil production in 2030 .
The declining rate of oil discoveries makes it painfully obvious -- most of the oil has already been discovered .
The technology for finding oil has improved greatly since the major discoveries , yet little oil has been found in recent years .
THe heyday of oil discovery was from 1950 to 1980 .
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion -- most of the oil has been found .
There is a growing gap between discoveries and production .
World oil production is running flat out .
Only the Saudis claim to have the ability to produce more though some dispute this .
It is not a simple matter of turning a spigot or pumping faster .
Oil fields can be permanently damaged by attempting to produce too fast .
Soon there will be a gap between production and demand .
It Gets Worse
According to BP ( British Petroleum ) [ 2 ] world oil reserves stand at 1238 billion barrels .
At present ( 2008 ) yearly world oil production stands at 31 billion barrels .
There is enough oil to last 40 years if production holds constant and no new oil is found .
According to BP , the Middle East has 61 % of the world 's oil reserves .
Africa has 9.6 % and the Russian Federation has 6.4 % .
The two countries sharing borders with the United States , Mexico and Canada , together have only 3.2 % .
Venezeula , a short distance away via oil tanker , has 7 %
The United States possesses 2.6 % of the worlds oil reserves while it consumes 24 % of the world 's oil production .
Although the United States has only 2.4 % of the world 's oil , it produces 9.2 % .
If the production rate could be maintained , the oil will be gone in 11 years .
The figures for Canada are the same and they are worse for Mexico .
The Middle East has enough oil to last 88 years at present production rates .
Africa has 33 years .
Clearly the United States will be increasingly dependent on oil imported from those places .
It is impossible to consider oil independence in light of these numbers .
The majority of the world 's oil comes from old oil fields .
For example , Kuwait still supplies 3 % of the world 's oil from a 70 year old field .
The world 's largest oil field , Ghawar , a 57 year old oil field , still supplies 5 % of the world 's oil . �
The North Sea ( discovered in 1963 ) was exploited very quickly and is now in steep decline .
Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay ( discovered in 1968 ) is now a trickle .
Oil varies greatly in quality .
Some oil is so light and sweet ( low in sulfur ) it can be pumped directly into the fuel tank of a Diesel truck .
Some oil is more like tar and it may contain sulfur .
It 's hard to transport and natural gas may be needed to refine it into useful fuel .
The oil from Manifa , a large oil field in Iran , is an extreme example .
It contains so much sulfur and vanadium it can't be refined using today 's technology .
The average quality of oil is declining because the best quality was produced first .
Oil varies greatly in accessibility .
It is convenient to access Kuwaiti oil .
Oil tankers in the Persian Gulf load from nearby Kuwaiti oil wells .
It is inconvenient to access oil from the north slope of Alaska .
It was necessary to build an 800 mile pipeline over mountains and permafrost to reach the oil in Prudhoe Bay .
Oil drilling platforms can reach oil in mile deep water but only at great expense in money terms and in energy terms .
There is oil in the arctic but oil drilling platforms will have to deal with ice and deep water to access it .
The remaining oil will be expensive and difficult to produce , refine and transport . �

British Petroleum ( BP ) publishes the annual Statistical Review of World Energy .
The Review is widely referenced because it is convenient , complete , colorful and very well done .
However , the data do not reflect the company 's own assessments -- it is simply republished data from other sources .
One major source is the Oil & Gas Journal but its sources are suspect as well .
They get their numbers by simply asking government officials .
The numbers for the United States are probably reliable because the oil companies are regulated by the SEC ( Securities and Exchange Commission . )
The numbers for Norway and Britain are probably reliable as well .
However , the numbers for the Middle Eastern countries are whatever the countries say they are .
They treat oil reserve numbers as state secrets .
The bad news is that the Middle Eastern countries have reasons to overstate their reserves .
Planetforlife takes these numbers at face value mainly for expediency and convenience .

This is " official information from the U.S. government . "
In a decision issued today , the US Supreme Court reinvigorated the " obviousness test " used to determine whether a patent should be issued .
Ruling in the case of KSR v. Teleflex , the Court found that the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , which handles patent appeals , had not been using a stringent - enough standard to determine whether a patent was infringing .
At issue in KSR v. Teleflex is a gas pedal manufactured by KSR .
The pedal has an electronic sensor that automatically adjusts its height to the height of the driver .
Teleflex claimed that KSR 's products infringed on a patent it held .
KSR said that Teleflex 's patent combining a sensor and a gas pedal was one that failed the obviousness test , and as such , should not have been granted .
Patent law appeared to be on KSR 's side : 1952 legislation mandated that an invention could not be patented if a " person having ordinary skill in the art " would consider it obvious .
KSR argued that the US Patent and Trademark Office should have denied Teleflex 's patent , as it only combines components performing functions they were previously known to do .
However , the Federal Circuit had adopted a higher standard , ruling that those challenging a patent had to show that there was a " teaching , suggestion , or motivation " tying the earlier inventions together .
KSR had plenty of support from the likes of Intel , Microsoft , Cisco , and GM , while Teleflex 's supporters included GE , 3M , DuPont , and a number of other companies concerned that some of their patent holdings would be harmed should the Court side with KSR .
SCOTUS found KSR 's arguments convincing , ruling that the Federal Circuit had failed to apply the obviousness test .
" The results of ordinary innovation are not the subject of exclusive rights under the patent laws , " Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the Court .
" Were it otherwise , patents might stifle rather than promote the progress of useful arts . "
The Supreme Court also said that the Federal Circuit 's conception of a patent 's obviousness was too narrow .
" The Circuit first erred in holding that courts and patent examiners should look only to the problem the patentee was trying to solve , " according to Justice Kennedy 's opinion .
" Second , the appeals court erred in assuming that a person of ordinary skill in the art attempting to solve a problem will be led only to those prior art elements designed to solve the same problem . "
The end result is that Teleflex 's patent has been invalidated and more importantly , the Federal Circuit will now have to pay closer attention to a patent 's obviousness .
That may be good news for Vonage in its appeal of a court 's decision that its VoIP service infringes on three Verizon patents .
Our analysis of the patents indicates that they , too , may fail the obviousness test .
More importantly , the Supreme Court ruling is good news for a patent system in dire need of fixing .
New legislation introduced to Congress a couple of weeks ago is another attempt at a fix .
The bill would streamline the patent appeal process while switching the US patent system from a first - to - invent to a first - to - file system .
It would also cap the amount of damages that could be awarded for infringing patents .
Recent tax data shows widening gap between rich and poor in US
By Tom Carter
27 August 2007
The latest Statistics of Income ( SOI ) released by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) this month point to a marked social polarization in the US over the recent period , compounded by stagnating wages for the majority of the population and huge tax breaks for the rich .
A preliminary analysis of the SOI data reveals that over the past several years a small fraction of the top one percent of the US population has been massively expanding its share of the national income at the expense of everyone else .
The income figures cited in the report are in terms of what the IRS calls “ adjusted gross income ( AGI ) less deficit . ”
This is a figure intended by the IRS to serve as an estimate of a taxpayer ’s actual gross income that year before taxes and is based upon reported income figures submitted by taxpayers .
A taxpayer may be an individual or a household that files tax returns jointly .
According to this most recent data , which dates back to 2005 , the broad majority of those paying taxes in the US are just barely making ends meet .
In 2005 , 91 million American taxpayers , or more than two - thirds of those filing taxes , reported making $ 50,000 a year or less .
About 48 million taxpayers , more than one in three , reported making less than $ 20,000 .
Approximately 25 million taxpayers , around one in five , reported making under $ 10,000 ; while 13 million taxpayers , or one in ten , reported income between $ 5,000 and nothing at all .
The average or mean income for a taxpayer in 2005 was about $ 55,238 , compared to $ 55,714 in 2000 , adjusted for inflation .
The years 2000 and 2001 saw a sharp decline in average income in the US , largely attributed to the collapse of the “ dot- com ” market boom of the late 90s and the economic fallout from the September 2001 terrorist attacks .
Although average income has risen steadily over the past several years , it is still below the 2000 figure in real terms .
About 70 percent of the population earned below the mean in 2005 — a sign of a highly polarized society .
A large section of American taxpayers in 2005 likely found themselves either directly in poverty , or one paycheck or medical bill away from poverty .
In the same country in 2005 , the number of taxpayers drawing in $ 10 million or more stood at 13,776 , and this handful of taxpayers pulled in a combined $ 376 billion in income .
This is more than the combined income of all those making $ 15,000 or less , or the poorest quarter of all American taxpayers .
To put that another way , by sacrificing the 2005 income of these 13,776 taxpayers — around 0.01 percent of tax filings — the income of the poorest quarter of American society could have been more than doubled .
During the period between 2000 and 2005 , the number of taxpayers drawing in more than $ 1 million each went from 239,685 in 2000 to 303,817 in 2005 — a growth of 26 percent .
These figures help confirm an earlier study by Prof Emmanuel Saez of University of California - Berkeley and Prof.
Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics , which found that in 2005 , the top 10 percent of the population in the US had its largest share of income since 1928 , just before the Great Depression .
The IRS statistics , however , surely understate the real economic situation .
First of all , it is worth remembering that there presently exists an enormous “ tax gap , ” estimated at between $ 300 and $ 400 billion per year .
This is the difference between what the population should have paid in taxes and what the government actually receives .
The chief source of this gap is underreported income , primarily from the richest sections of American society .
This means that there are literally trillions of dollars , accumulated in recent years , sloshing around at the top , undeclared to the IRS .
Income is also not necessarily a good index of the general welfare of the working class , as an individual working class taxpayer ’s income will resist dropping below a certain point .
For example , once a household ’s primary breadwinner stops making enough to pay the bills at a certain job , he or she might take on overtime or a second job , a spouse could take on a new job , and so on to make up the difference .
That taxpayer ’s income could remain the same or even rise under those circumstances , even while economic hardship was increasing .
An individual taxpayer ’s reported income is not necessarily a reflection of wages .
A taxpayer ’s gross income may reflect wages from his own job or jobs as well as those of his spouse , so an income of $ 75,000 is not necessarily an indication that the taxpayer holds a job that pays the same .
These circumstances make the capital gains and dividends tax cuts enacted by the Bush administration all the more extreme .
Following the sharp decline in the stock market in 2000 - 2001 , the rich found that they had lost a significant amount of money and desperately sought a means to replenish their coffers .
In this context , the Bush tax cuts amounted to little more than throwing open the doors to the federal treasury and telling the rich , “ Help yourselves ! ”
According to an August 10 report by Citizens for Tax Justice ( CTJ ) , of the $ 91 billion in taxes that went unpaid in 2005 as a result of these cuts , more than three quarters went to that 0.6 percent making $ 500,000 or more .
This amounts to a handout of around $ 81,000 each .
According to CTJ , those making more than $ 10 million in 2005 received more than a quarter of the handouts — or an average of $ 1,876,280 each .
By comparison , CTJ reports , the poorest half of American taxpayers , those making $ 30,000 or less , received an average of $ 5 each , or 0.4 percent of the total tax breaks .
Those making $ 75,000 or less , which includes the vast majority of the population , received together a total of around 3.2 percent of the tax breaks .
It is worth pointing out that since the Democratic Party took control of Congress following the 2006 mid-term elections , no serious effort has been made to repeal these tax cuts , which continue to channel tens of billions of dollars of government tax revenue into the hands of the rich and super - rich .
According to the most recent tax data , as of 2005 the rich had nearly returned to their 2000 income levels , with the average taxpayer making over $ 500,000 per year earning approximately $ 1.7 million .
This group of taxpayers in 2005 , numbering 828,323 — around 0.6 percent of those filing tax returns — hauled in around $ 1.4 trillion in income that year .
To put the above figure in perspective , the $ 1.4 trillion in income received by the richest 828,323 taxpayers is roughly equal to the combined reported income of the poorest 81 million taxpayers , or 60 percent of the total number of returns in 2005 .
American society is becoming rapidly polarized .
For the majority of people , rising gas prices , health care costs and interest rates are increasingly a major source of economic distress .
Meanwhile , wages and benefits are stagnating or declining .
At the same time , a small group of individuals at the pinnacle of American society is cashing in on the present economic situation , raking in unprecedented sums of money for themselves .

… one of the largest municipal jail unions in the country said Monday it would endorse Democratic Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois for president .
The endorsement would be Obama 's first from a union .
…
Obama said , " It 's an honor to have the endorsement of these men and women who put themselves at risk every day to serve on the front lines of our nation 's criminal justice system . "
[ CBS News ]
I guess the title says it all .
Barack Obama is far and away the worst democratic contender when it comes to drug policy and criminal justice reform .
It is unsurprising , therefore , that people who make a living off our grotesquely bloated criminal justice system are supporting his candidacy .
Via Talkleft
Ah , the ever - expanding front lines of our criminal justice system .
Obama just keeps saying things like this .
It remains perplexing to watch the so - called " change " candidate gaze with reverence upon our massive drug war and criminal justice system .
Obama 's support from incarceration specialists is richly deserved to be sure .
Update :
At the risk of further emboldening the hysterical Obama fans in the comment section , it 's only fair to add that Barack Obama has spoken in favor of needle exchange .
Hillary Clinton , who 's otherwise sounded good on drug policy ( for a front - runner , anyway ) wants to see more proof that it works , which , at this point , is like demanding proof that the sun will rise tomorrow .
So Obama understands that issue , at least .

Leahy readies subpoenas on warrantless wiretapping Michael Roston
Published : Friday June 8 , 2007 Print This Email This The Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee strongly criticized the Justice Department for obstructing an investigation of the Bush administration 's warrantless spying program .
The statement came after the committee scheduled a hearing next week to authorize subpoenas related to the shadowy government program .
" The warrantless wiretapping program has operated for over five years outside of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) and without the approval of the FISA Court .
The Committee has continued to ask for the legal justification for this sweeping and secret program , and has continually been rebuffed by inadequate and at times , misleading , responses from this Justice Department , " said Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee , in a statement sent to RAW STORY .
" The information we have requested has been specific to the legal justification for this program and is firmly within the Committees oversight jurisdiction . "
Leahy 's statement came after his committee had announced earlier in the day that it planned to " authorize subpoenas in connection with investigation of legal basis for warrantless wiretap program , " according to the committee 's website .
The meeting will occur on Thursday , June 14 .
The Senator noted his frustration with the lack of response from the Attorney General on the earlier requests for information sent by the Committee on the program .
" The Justice Departments continued frustration of this Committees attempts to carry out its constitutional oversight function is unfortunate , " he added in the statement .
" We will continue in our pursuit of this information until we get it , so that we can carry out our constitutional duties . "
In a hearing Thursday afternoon at the House Judiciary Committee , a Justice Department official refused to turn over President Bush 's legal justification for the warrantless spying program .
" Those [ Office of Legal Counsel opinions ] reflect the internal confidential legal advice of the executive branch , " said Steven G. Bradbury , Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel .
" We are citing the confidentiality interests that the executive branch has in internal confidential deliberative advice of the executive branch . "
The program is operated by the National Security Agency and legally certified by the Justice Department .
Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) , who chairs the subcommittee on constitutional issues and is investigating the program , slammed the Bush White House 's actions in warrantless eavesdropping .
" We rejected monarchy in this country more than 200 years ago ... This President appears to have forgotten that fact , " he said in his opening statement .
" Not only has he asserted the right to go around the FISA Court and the Wiretap Act , but he has actually done so . "
Nadler went further in an earlier interview with Talking Points Memo's Josh Marshall .
" This entire warrantless wiretapping is illegal and the President and Attorney General are engaged in a criminal conspiracy .
I mean , to me this is worse than Watergate , " he said in the video interview .

Bugs can spread from patient to patient
Two recently qualified doctors believe they could have found an important weapon in the fight against hospital acquired infection - and it costs just pence .
Hospital bugs are a serious problem in the UK - a recent report estimates that these infections cost the NHS as much as £ 1bn each year .
When Drs Ryan Kerstein and Christian Fellowes were studying at Imperial College they noticed that tourniquets - used to cause veins to expand to enable blood samples to be taken or drips inserted , were being used again and again .
Around 40 million procedures using a tourniquet are performed each year .
Source of cross-infection Convinced this must be a source of cross infection , they determined to carry out their own tests and come up with a financially viable disposable tourniquet .
And their product the ' Tournistrip ' - a long strip of plasticized paper - is already generating interest and orders .
They do not know exactly how much their product will cost , but say it will be pence , rather than pounds .
We saw tourniquets being transferred from patient to patient , which we felt was unacceptable
Dr Christian Fellowes
" We came up with the idea when on the wards , as medical students , we saw tourniquets being transferred from patient to patient , which we felt was unacceptable .
" The only available alternative was a rubber glove ( often adapted by doctors for the same purpose ) , which seemed unprofessional and uncomfortable , " said Dr Fellowes .
Tests revealed bugs
They said other disposable alternatives were little used because of their cost .
Dr Kerstein agreed : " Throughout our training there was always a lot of emphasis on infection control and good clinical technique .
" Watching some of our colleagues in the hospital environment it struck us that even though their technique was stringent they were limited by the re-usable equipment available . "
So the students conducted their own small study .
Without giving any warning they bleeped colleagues and asked them for their tourniquets - taking 52 from doctors , phlebotomists and nurses .
Staff said their tourniquets had been in use for anything from two to 104 weeks and used an average of 11 times each day .
The new tourniquet is single use Quizzing their colleagues they found that all of them believed tourniquets could be a source of infection , but that just over a third had ever cleaned them .
And they found that only just over half had stopped themselves using them on patients they knew were infectious .
They grew cultures on these and found MRSA ( methicillin - resistant or multiple antibiotic - resistant staphylococcus aureus ) on three tourniquets and MSSA ( methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus ) on 30 .
They also found bug cultures on hospital keyboards .
" I think people were surprised by how many nasty bugs we were able to get , " said Dr Kerstein .
Already in demand Their ' Tournistrip ' , which has similar dimensions to a watch strap , is fastened using a quick release seal and based on wrist bands used for security at events like concerts .
Dr Alison Holmes , director of infection control at Hammersmith Hospital and lecturer at Imperial , said the ' Tournistrips ' would be a welcome addition in the fight against infection and that her hospital had already put in an order .
" Tourniquets are a vehicle for cross infection , going from person to person .
And I am delighted by this .
" They have applied simple technology to solve this problem . "
The students were finalists in the Imperial business plan competition .

Philippine - born Leandro Aragoncillo , a U.S. citizen and former Marine , pleaded guilty last year to taking the documents that included details on threats against U.S. government interests and military personnel in the Philippines .
Aragoncillo worked on the security detail assigned to the vice president from 1999 to 2002 , where he held a top security clearance .
He later took a job as an intelligence analyst with the FBI in New Jersey .
“ There ’s no doubt that you did betray a position of trust that very few people are able to occupy , ” Judge William Walls told Aragoncillo .
The case caused a political scandal in the Philippines because the documents were used by opponents of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to try to oust her .
Prosecutors have named former Philippine President Joseph Estrada , Sen. Panfilo Lacson and former House of Representatives Speaker Arnulfo Fuentebella as unindicted co-conspirators in the plot .
The investigation is ongoing .
“ I never intended to cause harm or injury to the United States , its government or its people , ” Aragoncillo said .
“ My only wish and intent was to help the poor Philippine people . ”
Prosecutors told the court Aragoncillo used a fax machine in Cheney ’s office to send documents to the Philippines .
They said up to 800 classified documents had been compromised by Aragoncillo , as well as the name of a U.S. government source .
“ This was n’t compassion , this was his ego .
Mr Aragoncillo very much liked his access , ” prosecutor Karl Buch told reporters outside the court .
Michael Ray Aquino , a former top police official in the Philippines , was sentenced to more than six years prison on Tuesday after pleading guilty to unlawfully possessing and retaining documents and information taken by Aragoncillo .
Aquino became involved through his attempts to introduce Aragoncillo to a leading Philippine opposition politician .
It is possible that in a few short weeks America will wake up to news from Europe that Al Gore has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace .
If this occurs , it will be a powerful transforming event in American politics that will bring a surge of patriotism and pride to a nation that has been torn by war , divided by partisanship , trapped in a quagmire and alienated from what Jefferson called the decent opinion of mankind .
Letâ€™s set aside for now the question of whether Al Gore runs for president â€ ” which is unlikely , though world events can change our politics in a heartbeat .
The more important matter is what happens to our national dialogue and our democracy if indeed the Nobel Prize is awarded to Gore .
From the moment his award is announced through his speech in December accepting the prize , Al Gore will be the most influential living American in defining the terms of our national debate .
From the immediate surge of media attention until the aftermath of Goreâ€™s acceptance speech there will be a profound surge of international and national attention to what Al Gore stands for , and what he has done .
For the first time since Sept. 11 , 2001 was hijacked as a pretext for the Iraq war , there will be a powerful , compelling and global discussion of the America that has been and should always be a genuine beacon of hope and light for the world .
At first there will be saturation coverage of the dangers to Planet Earth , the crisis that poses the ultimate danger comparable to , and possibly even surpassing , the threat of nuclear weapons during the Cold War .
There will be a national and global debate , led by Gore , about the â€œwar of the worldsâ€ between the corrupt and destructive oil - based energy that creates pressures for war and dangers for the earth , against the new - energy economy that would benefit citizens , consumers and the planet itself .
Within hours of the Nobel announcement there would be a global statement of American ideals , American values , American traditions and American notions that have been honored for more than 200 years , and placed under attack by George W. Bush and enabled by a submissive Congress unable and unwilling to stop him .
There would be a statement to Americans , and to the world , that the real America is the nation that respects and rallies the free nations of the world rather than the pre-emptive and arrogant power that alienates freedomâ€™s best friends everywhere .
There would be a statement to Americans , and to the world , that we are the nation that agrees with George Washington and believes torture is a crime unworthy of our society , and agrees with generations of military commanders and troops who believe that the Geneva Convention is right , good and noble and serves the safety of our troops while standing for the values of our country .
There would be a statement to Americans , and to the world , that we are a nation and a people that believe in the sacred trust embodied by our Constitution , in the 200 - year legacy of the rule of law , where the king is not the law , but the law is the king .
There would be a statement to Americans , and to the world , that we are indeed the leader of the free world , the champion in the battle of ideas , the aspirational hope of good people everywhere that is the friend of those who dream , the ally of those who hope , the partner of those who seek to build a better world and that the arrogance and corruption of recent years is not the real America .
What will happen , if Al Gore is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , is that his issues will be championed on the front pages and on the television screens , stronger than ever , across America and throughout the world .
If Gore chooses to run for president he will have an opportunity to mobilize the nation in a manner similar to Robert Kennedyâ€™s late entry in 1968 .
More likely , if Gore does not run , his issues will be championed stronger than ever by candidate Clinton , candidate Obama , candidate Edwards , candidate Richardson and the others and will be acted upon , with greater commitment , by President Clinton , President Obama , President Edwards , President Richardson or whoever is elected .
The Democrats will be stronger candidates ; the next president will be a stronger president ; the American people will feel a resurgence of the patriotism and pride when people around the world once again applaud an American leader who speaks for the authentic voice of America as world leader and beacon of hope .
The recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize cannot be predicted , but with the announcement to be made within a few short weeks , there is the real possibility of a transforming moment that will lift our spirits and our national debate at a time when Americans are cynical and distrustful of their politics and government .

Ryan Singel and David Kravets are blogging the U.S. 9th Circuit hearing on the NSA 's spying , and AT&T 's alleged complicity , reporting live from the San Francisco courthouse .
Hit ' refresh ' in your browser and scroll to the bottom for updates .
Spectators lined up outside the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco starting at noon to guarantee a seat at a much - anticipated legal showdown over the government 's secret wiretapping program .
The hearing involves two cases : one aimed at AT&T for allegedly helping the government with a widespread datamining program allegedly involving domestic and international phone calls and internet use ; the other a direct challenge to the government 's admitted warrantless wiretapping of overseas phone calls .
Jon Eisenberg , ( right ) an Oakland - based attorney , is arguing on behalf of a now - defunct Islamic charity Al - Haramain and its lawyers , who claim to have been accidentally given a Top Secret log of their own phone conversations , which they say proves the government illegally eavesdropped on them without warrants .
Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Bondy will argue for the government in the Al - Haramain challenge , while Deputy Solicitor General Gregory Garre will handle the government 's side in the AT&T case .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , which filed the challenge to AT&T , is being represented by Robert Fram , a San Francisco - based attorney .
2:10 pm PDT
The courtroom filled quickly with more than 20 attorneys in the courtroom well , and 80 spectators seated and standing .
Another 40 filed into an overflow courtroom , including Mark Klein , the former AT&T engineer who provided internal company documents to the EFF .
Those documents allegedly show that AT&T built a secret spying room for the NSA in its San Francisco internet switching center .
Garre , the Bush administration attorney , just opened oral arguments by telling the three - judge panel that it should dismiss outright the lawsuit against AT&T , and those challenging the constitutionality of the president 's warrantless and domestic eavesdropping program developed .
" Litigating this action could result in exceptionally gave harm to national security in the United States , " says Deputy Solicitor General Gregory Garr .
2:20 pm PDT
Judge Harry Pregerson ( left , in file photo ) suggests the government is asking the courts to " rubber stamp " the government 's claim that state secrets are at risk " Who decides whether something is a state secret or not ? ...
We have to take the word of the members of the executive branch that something is a state secret ? "
Garre counters that the courts should give " utmost deference " to the Bush administration .
Judge Pregerson : " What does utmost deference mean ?
Bow to it ? "
2:30 pm PDT
All three judges are giving Garre skeptical questions about the power of the state secrets privilege .
They 're also getting stonewalled a bit .
" Was a warrant obtained in this case ? " Judge Pregerson asks .
" That gets into matters that were protected by state secrets , " Garre replies .
2:45 pm PDT
Judge McKeown asks whether the government stands by President Bush 's statements that purely - domestic communications , where both parties are in the United States , are not being monitored without warrants .
" Does the government stand behind that statement , " McKeown asks .
Garre : " Yes , your honor . "
But Garre says the government would not be willing to sign a sworn affidavit to that effect for the court record .
Pregerson , by his record , is the most liberal judge on the panel , and he clearly thinks the government is just looking for a blank check for their secret program .
But the other two judges are n't thrilled either .
They seem perplexed that the government can't swear under oath that the Bush Administration is n't warrantlessly spying on domestic phone calls .
3:00 pm PDT
Government attorney Garre does n't think much of the secret documents provided to EFF by whistle blower Mark Klein – which outline a room that is capable of widespread investigation of internet packets from multiple ISPs and backbone providers .
Garre described the documents as showing the secret room " has a leaky air conditioner and some loose cables in the room . "
Expect EFF 's attorney to rebut that characterization in his upcoming arguments .
3:10 pm PDT
AT&T attorney Michael Kellogg ( right , entering the courthouse ) has taken the podium , and , not surprisingly , insists the case has to be dismissed .
He says AT&T customers have no actual proof or direct knowledge that their communications were forwarded to the government without warrants .
" The government has said that whatever AT&T is doing with the government is a state secret , " Kellogg says .
He adds , " As a consequence , no evidence can come in whether the individuals ' communications were ever accepted or whether we played any role in it . "
( Back at Wired , THREAT LEVEL 's head just exploded –klp )
3:20 pm PDT
Robert Fram is up for EFF .
He 's outlining the allegations based on the Klein documents .
" There is a splitter cabinet on the 7th floor on 611 Folsom Street .
He ( Klein ) knows , because it was his job to oversee the room .
He installed the circuits . "
Fram adds that " the splitter cabinet sends the light signal on the seventh floor where the SG - 3 study room is located . "
Fram argues that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) allows people to challenge even the most secret electronic spying , by permitting courts to hear the government 's evidence in chambers
He 's also carefully trying to say that EFF does n't want any more information on sources and methods of the NSA , arguing that the mere existence of the secret room is good enough under the law to prove the existence of surveillance , regardless of what the government does once it has the internet packets .
" We have completed the privacy violation on the handover of the internet traffic at the splitter into the secret room , which room has limited access to NSA - cleared employees , " Fram says .
" What is not part of our claim is what happens inside that room . "
3:30 pm PDT
Fram says Klein 's allegations demonstrate there is an AT&T and NSA relationship .
" We have not only alleged it ; we have proved it , " Fram argues .
Judge M. Margaret McKeown is n't convinced .
" You have n't proved what the relation is between AT&T and the government , " McKeown ( left , file photo ) counters .
" Maybe Klein is wrong and AT&T and the government can come in and say that room is available to all technicians .
But they have n't done that , " says Fram .
3:50 pm PDT
The EFF 's Fram 's attempt to argue that the existence of the secret AT&T room is enough to prove dragnet internet surveillance does n't seem totally convincing to Judge McKeown .
" There 's a Las Vegas quality to your argument , " McKeown tells Fram , alluding to the " What Happens in Vegas , Stays in Vegas " commercials .
Fram argues that Congress broadly defined surveillance in the 1978 FISA law , which was spurred by revelations in the 1970s of widespread government surveillance of American citizens .
" What Congress did is it established a protective perimeter for our privacy , " Fram says .
" Congress wanted to have some set of rights that could be clearly enforced . "
Those rules , Fram argues , means that you were part of a mass dragnet surveillance if one of your e-mail went into the room on Folsom Street , even if the government was n't targeting you specifically .
On rebuttal , government attorney Gregory Garre derides the EFF 's case .
" Plaintiffs acknowledge that the room is central to their case and that they do n't know what is going on in that room , " says Garre .
" Something else could be going on in that room .
Just to pick one , it could be FISA court surveillance in that room . "
Not that he 's saying that there * is *FISA court surveillance conducted in the secret room .
Just that there could be .
Who knows ?
Presumably , Garre does .
But he 's not saying .
On the whole , the judges seem to be leaning towards allowing this case to continue in the district court – which would be a victory for EFF and the Al - Haramain lawyers .
4:00 pm PDT
In the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation case , Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Bondy ( right , entering the courthouse ) also says the case should be tossed .
" The state secrets privilege requires dismissal of this case . "
Whether the foundation 's lawyers were spied upon , which is the subject of the case , " Is itself a state secret , " Bondy argues .
4:10 pm PDT
Expanding on that theme , the government argues that the Al - Haramain case needs to be thrown out because the secret document that the government accidentally gave the foundation is so secret that it is outside of the case .
Bondy claims the plaintiff 's memories of the document can't be allowed into the case because the only way to test them is against the " totally classified " document .
" Once the document is out of the case , which it has to be since it is privileged , the only way to test the veracity of their recollections is to compare it to the document , " Bondy says .
The lower court allowed the case to go forward based on the Al - Haramain Foundation lawyers ' memories of the document , but ruled that the document itself was not allowed into the case .
Judge Hawkins ( left , file photo ) wonders if the document is really that secret ?
" Every ampersand , every comma is Top Secret ? , " Hawkins asks .
" This document is totally non-redactable and non-segregable and cannot even be meaningfully described , " Bondy answers .
The government says the purported log of calls between one of the Islamic charity directors and two American lawyers is classified Top Secret and has the SCI level , meaning that it is " secure
compartmented information . "
That designation usually applies to surveillance information .
4:25 pm PDT
Judge McKeown : " I feel like I 'm in Alice and Wonderland . "
Eisenberg : " I feel like I 'm in Alice in Wonderland , too . "
4:30 pm PDT
Al - Haramain lawyer Eisenberg argues that the government 's rationale for dismissing the cases on state secrets grounds does n't apply to his clients , since they already know they were surveilled from seeing the secret document .
McKeown asks whether the foundation 's attorneys would have a case if the government had n't inadvertently disclosed the call log .
" We would n't have known we were surveilled , " Eisenberg replies .
" Had they not made a mistake and revealed it to the victims ... who would be out here to sue ? "
4:40 pm PDT
Oral arguments are adjourned , and people are filing out of the courtroom .
But not before Bondy , for the government , gets the last word and neatly sums up the case for the three judges .
Al - Haramain Foundation attorneys , he points out , " think or believe or claim they were surveilled .
" It 's entirely possible that everything they think they know is entirely false , " he says .

US Air Force prepares to add unmanned drones to surge Michael Roston
Published : Sunday July 15 , 2007 Print This Email This President George W. Bush 's troop escalation in Iraq is about to get some robotic help , according to Charles Hanley , the Associated Press 's Pulitzer Prize winning Special Correspondent .
" The arrival of these outsized U.S. ' hunter - killer ' drones , in aviation history 's first robot attack squadron , will be a watershed moment even in an Iraq that has seen too many innovative ways to hunt and kill , " Hanley writes in his Sunday report for AP .
The Air Force will be deploying the ' Reaper ' unmanned aerial vehicle squadron in Iraq sometime " between this fall and next spring . "
The operators or pilots of the drones will continue to be based far away in Nevada .
While drone missions in Iraq are not new , Hanley reveals the long - term planning that is being carried out to possibly make the robotic surge more permanent than the group troop escalation .
" The Associated Press has learned that the Air Force is building a 400,000 - square - foot expansion of the concrete ramp area now used for Predator drones here at Balad , the biggest U.S. air base in Iraq , 50 miles north of Baghdad , " he writes .
" It 's another sign that the Air Force is planning for an extended stay in Iraq , supporting Iraqi government forces in any continuing conflict , even if U.S. ground troops are drawn down in the coming years . "
An excerpt of Hanley 's story is provided below .

The Air Force 's 432nd Wing , a UAV unit formally established on May 1 , is to eventually fly 60 Reapers and 160 Predators .
The numbers to be assigned to Iraq and Afghanistan will be classified .
The Reaper is expected to be flown as the Predator is - by a two - member team of pilot and sensor operator who work at computer control stations and video screens that display what the UAV " sees . "
Teams at Balad , housed in a hangar beside the runways , perform the takeoffs and landings , and similar teams at Nevada 's Creech Air Force Base , linked to the aircraft via satellite , take over for the long hours of overflying the Iraqi landscape .
American ground troops , equipped with laptops that can download real - time video from UAVs overhead , " want more and more of it , " said Maj .
Chris Snodgrass , the Predator squadron commander here .
The Reaper 's speed will help .
" Our problem is speed , " Snodgrass said of the 140 - mph Predator .
" If there are troops in contact , we may not get there fast enough .
The Reaper will be faster and fly farther . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The percentage of U.S. mothers who breast - feed their babies has reached the highest level on record amid mounting evidence that it provides many health benefits to the child , U.S. officials said on Thursday .

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 74 percent of American women who gave birth in 2004 breast - fed their babies for at least some period of time , continuing an upward trend since the early 1990s .
“ We ’ve made quite a bit of progress , ” CDC epidemiologist Dr. Celeste Philip , lead author of a CDC report on breast - feeding , said in a telephone interview .
Breast - feeding rates just about reached the government ’s target of 75 percent , the report showed .
But many women did not stick exclusively to breast - feeding in the first months after birth as recommended by experts , turning instead to baby formula , the report showed .
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that women who do not have health problems exclusively breast - feed their infants for at least the first six months , with breast - feeding continuing at least through the first year as other foods are introduced .
The CDC backs these recommendations , Philip said .
The CDC report found that among infants born in 2004 , the rate of exclusive breast - feeding through the first three months after birth was 31 percent , shy of the government ’s goal of 60 percent , and through six months was 11 percent , below the government target of 25 percent .
The report detailed racial and socioeconomic disparities among women who provide their babies exclusively breast milk in these first months , with black , teen - age , rural , less - educated , lower - income and unmarried mothers less likely to do so .
PROGRESS SINCE THE 1970s
Philip said she hoped the new statistics will prompt doctors to renew efforts to persuade mothers to breast - feed their babies .
She said the CDC is working with hospitals to encourage support of breast - feeding in the days after birth .
The 2004 breast - feeding rate of 74 percent was the highest since such statistics were first kept for U.S. women in the 1950s , Philip said .
The lowest rate on record was in 1971 , when only 25 percent of mothers breast - fed their infants amid major cultural shifts occurring in the country .
By 1982 , the rate had jumped to 62 percent .
But it declined again through the 1980s and slumped to 52 percent in 1990 before increasing to 71 percent in 2000 and continuing to rise into this decade , the CDC said .
The CDC noted that breast - feeding is associated with decreased risk for many diseases and conditions , including ear infections , respiratory tract infections , sudden infant death syndrome , obesity , eczema and diarrhea .
It also is associated with health benefits to women , CDC said , including decreased risk for the most common form of diabetes , ovarian cancer and breast cancer .
“ Something I think a lot of people may not realize is that there are benefits to the mother as well as the child , ” Philip said .
Increasing cigarette taxes is an effective strategy for reducing tobacco use but there may be negative consequences especially in disadvantaged minority communities .
According to a study conducted by researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health , a dramatic rise in illegal street sales of untaxed cigarettes was reported among minority low - income persons immediately after the price increase that reinforced smoking and undermined cessation efforts .
This is the first study to examine how living in a disadvantaged minority neighborhood shapes the impact of smoking policies on individual tobacco use .
Participants in 14 focus groups in Central Harlem , New York told researchers that a large cigarette tax increase in New York City led to " a pervasive illegal cigarette market in a low - income minority community . "
In an area where smoking rates were already likely to be higher than in the general population , even those motivated to quit were lured by bootleggers selling low - price cigarettes .
" Although interest in quitting was high among the smokers interviewed , bootleggers created an environment in which discounted cigarettes were easier to access than cessation services , " said Donna Shelley , MD , MPH , assistant professor of clinical Sociomedical Sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health and the study 's principal investigator .
" Popular brands could be bought on the streets for as little as $ 5 per pack , and the phenomenon of the $ 5 man -- the commonly used term for a highly visible network of bootleggers who appeared after the tax increase -- emerged as a new source of low - cost cigarettes . "
According to the study , most smokers admitted buying cigarettes from the $ 5 man throughout the community on street corners , in busy shopping areas , outside subway entrances , and in apartment buildings .
Other accessible sources of reduced - price cigarettes , respondents noted , included " loosies " -- single , out - of - package cigarettes sold illegally at local grocery stores or bodegas .
Buying cigarettes out of state was another price - minimizing strategy .
While smokers described additional strategies to avoid price increases such as cutting down and switching to discount brands , purchasing from the $ 5 man was the principal behavioral response to the tax increase reported by respondents .
Although almost all smokers described a history of quit attempts , they noted that opportunities for reduced - price cigarettes were so prevalent that most smokers needed only to alter purchasing patterns rather than smoking patterns .
For smokers living in Harlem , smoking was an important strategy to cope with individual level stressors such as low incomes and unemployment .
" We do not dispute that cigarette taxes are an effective method for reducing tobacco use , " remarked Dr. Shelley .
" Yet , our findings support the argument that programs and policies to alter health risk behaviors are limited without addressing the structural inequalities and other pressing social factors that help sustain nicotine addiction , shape individual attitudes and behaviors , and inform community norms . "
In New York City , the tax increase was accompanied by programs specifically recommended to reduce socioeconomic disparities in smoking prevalence .
Population - based cessation services included free nicotine patches , free counseling , and pharmacotherapy at several smoking cessation clinics located in low - income communities .
Further , New York State offers a Medicaid pharmacotherapy benefit that preceded the tax increase .
Yet , according to the study , only a handful of those interviewed were aware of these resources .
" Our findings suggest that further research is needed to investigate interventions that address individual and structural barriers to utilizing cessation resources among disadvantaged populations where smoking rates are highest , and tobacco tax evasion must be addressed in a more comprehensive manner to assist low - income communities in reducing the burden of smuggling activity , " noted Dr. Shelley .
The study , which was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Legacy Foundation , will be in the August 2007 print issue of the American Journal of Public Health , published by the American Public Health Association , and is online at http://www.ajph.org

When was the last time you saw a HTML header like this ?
< head > < title > GUID

" Everything you wanted to know about GUIDs but were afraid to ask " > < meta name = " keywords " content = " GUID , UUID , globally unique identifiers , 128 - bit " > </head >
The web is a metadata - free zone .
It 's widely known that Google completely ignores metadata in its indexes .
The < meta > tag has fallen so far out of favor that it drags the whole concept of metadata down with it .
And perhaps rightfully so .
Cory Doctorow viciously deconstructs metadata in Metacrap : Putting the torch to seven straw - men of the meta-utopia :
There are at least seven insurmountable obstacles between the world as we know it and meta-utopia .
I 'll enumerate them below : .
1 . People lie Metadata exists in a competitive world .
Suppliers compete to sell their goods , cranks compete to convey their crackpot theories ( mea culpa ) , artists compete for audience .
Attention - spans and wallets may not be zero-sum , but they 're damned close .
That 's why : A search for any commonly referenced term at a search - engine like Altavista will often turn up at least one porn link in the first ten results .
Your mailbox is full of spam with subject lines like " Re : The information you requested . "
Publisher 's Clearing House sends out advertisements that holler " You may already be a winner ! "
Press -releases have gargantuan lists of empty buzzwords attached to them .
Meta-utopia is a world of reliable metadata .
When poisoning the well confers benefits to the poisoners , the meta - waters get awfully toxic in short order .
The other six reasons are equally caustic , and all have a common theme : relying on users to create accurate metadata means you 're betting on an optimistic view of human behavior .
And we all know how well that works out .
Which brings me to the complete abandonment of the < meta > tag .
Is n't it ironic that groups still advocate manually adding metadata to web pages ?
Who , exactly , is adding The Dublin Core Metadata Element Set to the < head > section of their web pages ?
Nobody , that 's who .
Manual metadata may be suspect , but automated generation of metadata is practically the holy grail .
Google 's entire 450 zillion dollar market cap is predicated on one tiny , automatically generated piece of metadata on every web page they index : PageRank .
Popularity rules the web .
It 's high school all over again : either you 're popular and people link to you , or .. well , good luck on that whole prom thing .
But popularity has some limitations .
For one thing , PageRank does n't work on an intranet .
Office documents are rarely HTML , rarely linked to each other , and you probably do n't have a large enough sample set to do any fancy statistical analysis , either .
That 's why the Google Search Appliance not only actively indexes metadata in the < meta > tag , it requires metadata to return relevant results .
It 's right in the manual .
Just try doing that with the capital - g Google .
Perhaps that 's why Tim Bray steadfastly maintains that some form of metadata is necessary to improve search results .
One of the Web 's distinguishing features is that there 's a big gaping hole where the metadata ought to be .
The Web has resources , identified by URI , and you can ask for " representations , " which come with some metadata , but the metadata is about the representation , not the resource .
Given a URI , the Web has no built - in way to ask questions about it , for example " What is this about ? " or " When does it expire ? " or " Is this suitable for children ? " or " Is this good ? "
I 'm not an advocate of the utopian semantic web , mind you , but I sure would like something that can tell the difference between a Jaguar and a Jaguar instead of telling me which one is more popular .
Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson , co-founders of 37signals ( the hot web software development company ) , spoke last night ( April 28 , 2006 ) to a group of about thirty at a free event at DePaul University CTI .
The event was put on by e , DePaul CTI 's High Tech Entrepreneurship Club .
Jason and David have been working together for several years with their first product Single File , a simple book organization product , to their latest product called Campfire , an online business chat tool .
Jason and David spoke for two hours and relayed a number of themes , but I would say the strongest by far was to :
Do Less .
Jason and David started out by laying the groundwork for their philosophy which focuses on offering less .
Less is something that they think is very powerful since less is more manageable than more .
Simple concept right ?
Nevertheless , many companies strive for more .
The guys at 37 signals believe that the days of beating the competition with more ( features , bells , whistles or flare ) are over .
According to Jason :
" The days of ' more ' are dead . "
They believe in delivering something simple and that 37signals lives and dies on solving simple problems with simple solutions within their constraints .
They went on to say that more can , more or less , get you into trouble and they explained how doing less can be applied to people , money , software , abstractions and time .
Less People
Currently , 37signals is operating with just seven employees .
David helped to clarify a misconception in business - growth of a business is not directly tied to headcount .
This is something that many business do not understand ; they often budget to increase the workforce since in the traditional business mind there is a direct correlation between company success or growth and headcount .
David put it best by saying :
" Increasing headcount ( on a schedule ) could be a symptom of a bad business . "
What David was saying is that a hiring schedule or hiring goals that are planned such as " Company X is going to increase the headcount by 200 people by year 's end " can sometimes be a sign of a bad business because Company X is basing growth on projections which are often incorrect .
It is setting the business up for lower profit margins .
He pointed out that Salesforce.com has a low profit margin because every time it adds a customer it has to add at least one employee .
He went on to point out that revenue per employee might be a better metric of the success of a business .
Less Money
Taking on money in the form of loans can get you in debt since it is easier to spend someone else 's money than your own ( reminds me of a Notorious B.I.G. song Mo' Money Mo' Problems ) .
Basically , if it is your own money you are spending , then it is going to hurt to frivolously spend it .
Less Software
Deliver less software with less features .
Keep is as simple as possible and deliver the best solution you can to solve a simple problem .
Shoot for the simplest , most effective solution .
David admitted :
" We have drank the Kool - aid pretty hard on the simplicity stuff . "
David went on to say that sometimes they over - think things too but that is when they try and take a break and do less .
Less Abstractions
As much as you love paperwork , abstractions and requirements waste time !
They are not real .
They are written on paper at the beginning of developing a product , which is when you know the absolute least about what it is you really want to develop .
Jason said :
" If you are writing up specs and you can hold it in your hand and it has weight then you are wasting your time . "
Not to mention , writing functional specs is not sexy ; it is not fun and it is not motivating .
So the guys at 37 signals say forget about it and get real .
Start with one piece of paper and five minutes .
Use the paper as a point of reference so that everyone is on the same page but then build the html wire - frames of what you are shooting for .
37 signals starts with the interface first .
Overall , this is falls in line with an agile development approach since most of the time you do not know what you really want until you are developing it and know the product better .
Less Time
Spend less time at the office and you will waste less time .
Jason pointed out that 37 signals decided to let all of its employees take Friday off over the summer and they still got all of their work done on time .
Bottom - line : Less is less .
Who would n't want to work less , do less and profit more ?
As long as 37 signals practices what it preaches and actually does work less then it is living proof that it can be done .
The idea of doing less and making more is appealing to the masses and could be an entrepreneurial battle - cry further bolstering the 37signals brand .
When asked about the future of 37signals , it appears they have twenty - year plan which focuses on changing the online space .
In the meantime , 37signals continues to be a rising star in the web 2.0 space with the execution of simple ideas for simple problems .
Additionally , Jason hinted at a new product called Sunrise that 37 signals is working on .
He called it a CRM tool but said it is not very complex so they are wondering if it is too simple in its current state .
However , he stated that they cut two - thirds of the features they originally had intended for Backpack so I will be interested to see the product when it is unveiled .
Here are my photos from the event posted on Flickr .
Also a lot what Jason and David spoke about can be found in their recently released book titled " Getting Real , " which I highlighted previously on Somewhat Frank .
July 13 , 2007  --
It was just a typical day on the job at the Pizza Hut in Angola , Ind. , for 20 - year - old Jessica Osborne when out of the blue , she received a gift that would change her life : a $ 10,000 tip from one of her customers .
" When I opened it up , I just — I thought maybe I read too many zeros and I lost my breath , " Osborne said on " Good Morning America . "
" It was amazing . "
The tip of a lifetime came from a family of regular customers .
Every Friday , Becky and her family , who asked that their last name not be used , come in and order the same thing : a Meatlovers pizza , half pepperoni , half black olives and mushrooms .
Becky said Osborne always came to the table with a smile on her face .
" She was sweet and bright and cheerful and never complained , " Becky said .
" She was just a sweet waitress . "
But Osborne had recently been let down by financial troubles that were keeping her ambitions at bay .
She had enrolled in a local college but was forced to withdraw because of a lack of financial aid .
She told Becky 's family about the textbooks she had bought and kept in the trunk of her car and her dreams to become a photographer .
" I thought , ' This is a very generous person , ' " Becky said , " and we enjoyed just talking to her , finding out about her life . "
Osborne got to know Becky and her family through their weekly pizza dinners , but she did n't realize that they had recently suffered a great tragedy .
Becky 's husband and eldest daughter were killed in a car accident , and she had been left with a large settlement .
Once Becky heard about Osborne 's broken dreams , she decided to use some of the money from the settlement to make them come true .
" We decided we needed to help Jessica and she was there , we were there , and it just seemed like the right thing to do , " Becky said .
Osborne is deciding where to go to school , relieved that she now has the money to pay for it .
For now , she 's still getting over the shock of the much more than 15 - percent tip .
" It 's unbelievable .
It does n't happen to people every day , " she said .
" I mean , I work at Pizza Hut ! "
The September issue of the Notices of the AMS is out , and it contains an article by Neal Koblitz on modern cryptography , exposing themes he wrote about in previous articles Before I get to Koblitz 's thesis I should describe the context , as I see it .
Cryptography underwent two major revolutions in the 1970s and 1980s .
The notion of public key cryptography , invented by Diffie and Hellman ( and earlier , but only in classified documents that did n't enter the public domain for decades , by Ellis , Cocks , and Williamson ) and made possible by Rivest , Shamir and Adleman , allowed parties that had never met in advance to share a secret key to communicate over an unsafe channel .
Without this technology , buying and selling things online would be extremely inconvenient and companies like amazon and ebay would probably not exist .
The other revolution , started by the 1982 series of papers by Blum , Goldwasser , Micali and Yao , was the discovery that one could provide formalof security for cryptographic problems , and that such definitions wereunder complexity assumptions , albeit , initially , via slow constructions .
Indeed , the importance of the newcannot be overstated , and , possibly for lack of accessible expositions , it has not been completely digested by all the security community .
I remember , not too long ago , reading a paper on electronic elections , listing seven or more requirements that an election protocol should satisfy , and it was clear that the list was unwieldy , redundant , and , most importantly , incomplete .
The modern definitional approach is instead to begin with a description of an ideal setting ( where every person votes in a secret ballot , then all ballots are counted and the total tally is the only information that anybody gets ) and then require that a protocol be such that .
In particular , whatever outcome or information an attackergain in the ideal setting , it can not be gained in the protocol either .
Some constructions developed by theoreticians and coming with a formal analysis are too inefficient to be used , but their development often leads to the discovery of general design principles such that , for example , public key encryption algorithms must be randomized , and should be designed so that it is not possible to construct a valid ciphertext in any other way than applying the encryption algorithm to a known message .
Indeed modern cryptography is the area of computer science where the distance between theory and practice is the least : one finds theoreticians who spend most of their time on impractical constructions designed to be " plausibility results " but who also sit on standards bodies and help create and assess widely used systems , whereas one is less likely to see the algorist preoccupied with $ O ( log n ) $ approximation algorithms also working on commercial optimization packages .
The important difference is that optimization algorithms can be validated in practice in a way that is impossible for cryptographic protocols , where one , and hence one should strive for security againstwhich is possible , within an attack model , only via a formal analysis and reductions .
Koblitz points out that sometimes proofs contain mistakes , and that there can be attacks not covered by standard models .
His reaction , however , is not that the community should be very careful about formal correctness , and explore ( as is being done ) new models that take into account timing attacks and other " grey box " accesses to the computations of the parties .
Rather , he suggests doing away with proofs , and relying more on intuition .
This is discussed in the second part of the paper ( the first part is devoted to encryption schemes and factoring algorithms via elliptic curves , the " good " interaction between math and cryptography ) , through such rhetorical devices as non sequiturs , personal attacks , and petulance .
The CRYPTO community 's typesetting abilities are not spared , nor is Oded Goldreich 's spelling .
It would seem hard to defend the idea that one is more likely to make a correct statement if the statement has no proof compared to having a proof , or that one can be secure against a wider class of attacks by relying on intuition rather than defining a class of attacks and establishing the security guarantee .
It would be like having a draft - dodger compete in an election against a war hero , and having the latter be on the defensive about his military service , but sometimes strange things do happen .
( For the Italian readers , a better reference would be from Nanni Moretti's : " Di qualcosa , D'Alema rispondi .
Non ti far mettere in mezzo sulla giustizia proprio da Berlusconi !
D'Alema , dì una cosa di sinistra , dì una cosa anche non di sinistra , di civiltà ! " ) 9/1/07 : you can now read letters to the editors by Oded Goldreich Boaz Barak , and Jon Katz , and there are more online comments [ here ] and [ here 9/5/07 : Hugo Krawczyk has also written a letter to the editors of the Notices .
The interested reader can compare what Koblitz said about Hugo 's work on HMQV to the actual HMQV paper
Federal court stikes down part of USA Patriot Act Greg Wasserstrom
Published : Thursday September 6 , 2007
Print This Email This U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero today stated that a section of the updated USA PATRIOT ACT " offends the fundamental constitutional principles of checks and balances and separation of powers , " and struck down the provision in the law allowing the government to secretly obtain personal records , the Associated Press reports .
Marrero ruled that the National Security Letter provision of the Act , permitting the FBI to demand the private information and then gag those who received the order , violated the the 1st amendment to the Constitution protecting free speech and also threatened separation of powers .
" In light of the seriousness of the potential intrusion into the individual 's personal affairs and the significant possibility of a chilling effect on speech and association - particularly of expression that is critical of the government or its policies - a compelling need exists to ensure that the use of NSLs is subject to the safeguards of public accountability , checks and balances , and separation of powers that our Constitution prescribes , " Marrero wrote .
If the ruling is to be upheld , such NSLs must be subjected to full judicial review .
" As the court recognized , there must be real , meaningful judicial checks on the exercise of executive power , " said Melissa Goodman , a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union , the organization that first challenged the law in December 2004 .
" Without oversight , there is nothing to stop the government from engaging in broad fishing expeditions , or targeting people for the wrong reasons , and then gagging Americans from ever speaking out against potential abuses of this intrusive surveillance power . "
The ruling is a setback for the Bush Administration whose broad claims to secrecy are coming under growing scrutiny .

Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , one of the most anti-war members of the House , accused the Bush Administration 's labeling of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization a prelude for war there .
" The belligerent Bush Administration is using this pending designation to convince the American public into accepting that a war with Iran is inevitable , " Kucinich said .
" This designation will set the stage for more chaos in the region because it undercuts all of our diplomatic efforts . "
Kucinich , who is mounting a second dark horse race for the presidency , has called for Vice President Dick Cheney 's impeachment .
Introducing an impeachment resolution in April , Kucinich accused Cheney of manipulating intelligence in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq and " rattling the sabers of war against Iran , " as RAW STORY reported at the time .
On Wednesday , reports emerged that the Bush administration was considering classifying Iran 's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organizations .
The Revolutionary Guard would be the first national military included on the list .
" This new label provides further evidence for Iran 's leaders that there is no point to engage in diplomatic talks with the United States if our actions point directly to regime change , " Kucinich said in a statement released by his office .
" Our nation is better served by demanding sensible and responsible diplomatic foreign policy initiatives from the Bush Administration .
" This is nothing more than an attempt to deceive Americans into yet another war - this time with Iran , " Kucinich concluded .

Introducing Django
Django is an open - source web application framework that - to quote its creators - " encourages rapid development and clean , pragmatic design . "
It is written in Python , and provides components to build high - quality web applications : an object - relational mapper , a full - featured templating system , URL dispatching , session management , authentication , and much more besides .
One valuable measure of a framework is the ease with which it can be extended to meet one 's needs .
Here we will introduce Django 's database API , and demonstrate its flexibility by extending it to support MySQL 's full - text search capabilities .
The source code included in this article is released into the public domain .
Django's Database API
Django's object - relational mapper provides a rich API for building database queries .
Django's object - relational mapper provides a rich API for building database queries .
This API insulates the application developer from the details of the SQL statements , while still allowing queries with complex selection criteria to be made in an efficient manner .
Another notable benefit of this approach is that it removes entirely the possibility of SQL injection attacks , as the application developer is no longer inserting values directly into SQL statements .
Objects are retrieved from the database with a QuerySet , which is an abstraction of an SQL SELECT statement .
QuerySets provide methods that narrow down the results to objects matching specific criteria , much like the WHERE clause in an SQL statement - in fact , behind the scenes a QuerySet builds an SQL statement as its methods are called .
QuerySet instances are obtained from a model class 's Manager instance , which is normally called objects .
Here are a few examples of the use of QuerySets :
# Retrieve the QuerySet containing all articles
articles = Article.objects.all ( )
#
Include only articles written before this year
articles = articles.filter(posted_date__lt='2006-01-01 ')
#
But leave out those written by me
articles = articles.exclude(author__exact=' Andrew ') #
And finally , sort them by rating and date
articles = articles.order_by ( ' rating ' , ' posted_date ' )
QuerySets can be filtered and sorted very cheaply , as they are lazily evaluated : these actions manipulate the QuerySet 's internal SQL statement , and the statement is not executed until you try to access the results of the QuerySet , by iteration or slicing , for example .
# Get the top five articles ; only now is the database accessed .
a = articles [ :5 ]
To extend this interface , we 'll develop a Manager subclass and a QuerySet subclass , but first we 'll briefly describe MySQL 's full text search .
MySQL and Full Text Search
MySQL has a built - in full text search engine ; while not as powerful as dedicated libraries like Lucene and Xapian , it is integrated into the database engine and query syntax , and so is easy to use from database - backed applications .
We 'll be looking here only at its support for ‘ natural language ' queries ; see the MySQL Documentation for details of its other features .
Full text search is enabled by creating a full - text index on a column or set of columns in a table .
The index will be automatically updated whenever rows are inserted , updated , or deleted , so the search results will never be out of date .
The CREATE INDEX statement is used to make the index :
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX index_name ON table_name ( column_names )
Searching is done with the MATCH ... AGAINST expression , which gives the column to search and the query :
MATCH ( column_names ) AGAINST ( ' words to find ' )
For natural language queries , this evaluates to a number representing the relevance of the row to the given query .
A full query with this expression might be :
SELECT title , MATCH ( title , text ) AGAINST ( ' Django framework ' )
AS `relevance`
FROM fulltext_article
WHERE MATCH ( title , text ) AGAINST ( ' Django framework ' )
This returns the title and relevance score of all articles that matched the words Django and framework ; by default they will be sorted in order of decreasing relevance .
Do n't worry about the repeated MATCH ... AGAINST expressions - MySQL will see that they are the same and only perform the search once .
Note particularly that the columns passed to MATCH must be the same columns that were specified when creating the index .
Extending the Database API with Search
One of Django 's design philosophies is consistency , which is important to apply to extensions as well .
To keep the full text search interface consistent with the rest of Django , it should work with Managers and QuerySets , so that it can be used in the same way .
In practical terms , that means the programmer should be able to write statements like these :
Article.objects.search (' Django Jazz Guitar ')
Article.objects.filter(posted_date__gt='2006-07-01').search (
' Django Python ' )
And these statements should return QuerySets that can themselves be filtered further if need be .
To achieve this , we will develop a QuerySet subclass called SearchQuerySet that provides the search ( ) method and builds the MATCH ... AGAINST expression into the SQL statement ; and a Manager subclass called SearchManager that returns SearchQuerySet subclasses .
Since the Manager class also provides many of the QuerySet 's methods for convenience , SearchQuerySet should also provide a search ( ) method to be consistent with this .
Here is the code :
from django.db import models , backend class SearchQuerySet(models.query.QuerySet ) :
def __init__( self , model=None , fields =None ) :
super( SearchQuerySet , self ).__init__( model )
self._search_fields = fields
def search ( self , query ) :
meta = self.model._meta
# Get the table name and column names from the model
# in `table_name`.`column_name` style
columns = [ meta.get_field ( name ,
many_to_many=False ) .column
for name in self ._search_fields ]
full_names = [ " %s. %s " %
( backend.quote_name( meta.db_table ) ,
backend.quote_name( column ) )
for column in columns ] # Create the MATCH ... AGAINST expressions
fulltext_columns = " , " .join ( full_names )
match_expr = ( " MATCH ( %s ) AGAINST ( %%s ) " %
fulltext_columns )
# Add the extra SELECT and WHERE options
return self.extra( select={' relevance ' : match_expr} ,
where =[ match_expr ] ,
params=[ query , query ] )
class SearchManager ( models .
Manager ) :
def __init__ ( self , fields ) :
super ( SearchManager , self ) .__init__ ( )
self._search_fields = fields def get_query_set ( self ) :
return SearchQuerySet(self.model , self._search_fields ) def search ( self , query ) :
return self.get_query_set ( ).search ( query )
Here , SearchQuerySet.search ( ) asks Django for the table and column names , builds a MATCH ... AGAINST expression , then in one line adds that to the SELECT and WHERE clauses of the query .
Conveniently , all the real work is done by Django itself .
Conveniently , all the real work is done by Django itself .
The _meta object in a model class stores all the ‘ meta information ' about the model and its fields , but here we only need the table name and the column names ( the SearchQuery Set instance is told which fields are to be searched when it is initialised ) .
The QuerySet.extra( ) method provides an easy way to add extra columns , WHERE clause expressions , and table references to the QuerySet 's internal SQL statement : the select parameter maps column aliases to expressions ( think of " SELECT expression AS alias " ) , the where parameter is a list of expressions for the WHERE clause , and the params parameter is a list of values that will be interpolated into the SQL statement , with the required quoting and escaping , in place of the substring ‘ %s ' .
What about SearchManager ?
As said above , it must return SearchQuerySet instances instead of plain QuerySets .
Fortunately , the Manager class was written with this sort of specialisation in mind : it has a get_query_set ( ) method that returns an instance of the appropriate QuerySet sub-class , and this method is called whenever a Manager needs to create a new QuerySet instance .
Overriding the get_query_set ( ) method to return a SearchQuerySet is trivial .
When creating a SearchQuerySet instance , it passes in the fields to search , which were provided in its own constructor .
We also wanted SearchManager to implement a search ( ) convenience method , which just delegates to SearchQuerySet.search ( ) .
Using the Search Component
We 'll now demonstrate the use of these subclasses .
Here is a simple model that represents articles posted on a web site ; so that it can be searched , we create a Search Manager instance and assign it to objects :
from django.db import models
from fulltext.search import SearchManager class Article ( models .
Model ) :
posted_date = models.DateField(db_index=True )
title = models .CharField( maxlength=100 )
text = models .
TextField ()
# Use a SearchManager for retrieving objects ,
# and tell it which fields to search .
objects = SearchManager ( ( ' title ' , ' text ' ) ) class Admin :
pass def __str__( self ) :
return " %s ( %s ) " % ( self.title , self.posted_date )
Articles have a title , body text , and the date they were posted .
We will define a FULLTEXT INDEX on the title and text columns in the database , and we pass a tuple of the corresponding field names to the SearchManager instance to declare that here .
Here 's the SQL statement that creates the index :
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX fulltext_article_title_text
ON fulltext_article ( title , text ) ;
Given a Django project , an application that defines the Article model , and a database populated with suitable articles , the full text search can be easily demonstrated with Python 's interactive interpreter :
>>> #
How many articles are there ?
>>> len( Article.objects.all ( ) )
12
>>> #
Find articles about frameworks :
>>> Article.objects.search (' framework ')
[< Article : Introducing Django ( 2006-07 - 17 ) > ,
< Article : Django on Windows HOWTO ( 2006-04-03 ) > ,
< Article : Django for non-programmers ( 2006-05-02 ) > ]
>>> #
Show the relevance score for these articles :
>>> [ ( a , a.relevance )
... for a in Article.objects.search (' framework ' ) ]
[(< Article : Introducing Django ( 2006-07 - 17 ) > , 1.0980 ) ,
(< Article : Django on Windows HOWTO ( 2006-04-03 ) > , 0.6015 ) ,
(< Article : Django for non-programmers ( 2006-05-02 ) > , 0.5842 ) ]
>>> #
Limit the results to those posted before June :
>>> Article.objects.search (' framework ') . filter (
... posted_date__lt= '2006-06-01 ')
[< Article : Django on Windows HOWTO ( 2006-04-03 ) > ,
< Article : Django for non-programmers ( 2006-05-02 ) > ]
>>> # Note that filter ( ) also returns a SearchQuerySet :
>>> Article.objects.filter (
... posted_date__lt= '2006-06-01 ') .search ( ' framework ')
[< Article : Django on Windows HOWTO ( 2006-04-03 ) > ,
< Article : Django for non-programmers ( 2006-05-02 ) > ]
Final Remarks
I 'll now let you in on a secret : since the start of June , Django has supported a search operator for queries that uses MySQL 's full text search :
# This uses the Boolean search mode , not
# natural language queries
Article.objects.filter(title__search='+
Django - Rails ')
However , the techniques demonstrated in this article can be built upon extend the database API to support any SQL feature , whether that 's supporting full text search , grouping and aggregate queries , or any other SQL feature or database - specific extension .
