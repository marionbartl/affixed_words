A German evangelical pastor who 's recreated biblical scenes from Playmobil figures has been given until 6 April to pull his website , or face the wrath of the company 's lawyers .
According to the Telegraph , 38 - year - old Markus Bomhard 's principal sin was to adapt the figures - for example by gluing breasts to Eve and melting Jesus with a hairdryer the better to attach him to a crucifix .
Playmobil said in a statement yesterday : " For private purposes - by collectors and fans - we are very tolerant of this so - called ' customising ' . "
However , the company described Bomhard 's creative adaptations as a " massive manipulation of the figures , for example reshaping their arms with a hairdryer or candle to nail them to a cross " .
It insisted : " We can not accept such transformations for safety reasons as our products are made from plastic and are flammable . "
Bomhard admitted : " It 's true that I did use a hairdryer to soften the figure for the crucifixion scene because the fingers would n't spread out properly otherwise .
Then I had to let it harden again before I could nail it to the cross . "
The pastor defended his efforts by invoking none other that Pope Benny 16 , who blessed the initiative in a missive which said : " May your project allow many children and adults access to Holy Scripture . "
We at Vulture Central 's Playmobil department await the outcome of this spat with slightly timorous anticipation .
We 'd like to state for the record that we have at no point glued jubs to figures or attacked them with hairdryers .
Mercifully , Playmobil has said it did n't mind Bomhard 's recreations , as long as the characters stayed in the original costumes .
This is presumably why Playmobible has avoided a strongly - worded parchment from the company 's legal representatives until now . ®

The Working Capital Model ( WCM ) looks at investment performance differently , less emotionally , and without a whole lot of concern for short - term market value movements .
Market value performance evaluation techniques are only used to analyze peak - to - peak market cycle movements over significant time periods .
Security market values are used for buy and sell decision - making .
Working capital figures are used for asset allocation and diversification calculations .
Portfolio working capital growth numbers are used to evaluate goal directed management decisions over shorter periods of time .
WCM tracking techniques help investors focus on long term growth producers like capital gains , dividends , and interest — the things that can keep the working capital line ( see Part One ) moving ever upward .
The base income and cumulative realized capital gains lines are the most important WCM growth engines .
The Base Income Line tracks the total dividends and interest received each year .
It will always move upward if you are managing your equity vs. fixed income asset allocation properly .
Without adequate base income : 1 ) working capital will not grow normally during corrections and 2 ) there wo n’t be enough cash flow to take advantage of new investment opportunities .
The earlier you start tracking your dependable base income , the sooner you will discover that your retirement comfort level has little to do with portfolio market value .

The Net Realized Capital Gains line reflects historical trading results , and is most important during the early years of portfolio building .
It will directly reflect the security qualification criteria you use , and the profit - taking rules you employ .
If you use investment grade value stocks and WCM buy / sell disciplines , you will rarely have a downturn in this important number .
Any profit is always better than any loss and , unless your selection criteria is really too conservative , there will always be something out there worth buying with the proceeds .
Obviously , capital gains growth should accelerate in rising markets , and cost based asset allocation assures that such gains add directly to future base income growth .
Note that an unrealized gain or loss is as meaningless as the quarter - to - quarter movement of a market index .
The WCM is a decision model , and good decisions should produce net realized income .
One other important detail : no matter how conservative your selection criteria , a security or two is bound to become a loser .
Do n’t judge this by Wall Street popularity indicators , tealeaves , or analyst opinions .
Let the fundamentals ( profits , S & P rating , dividend action , etc. ) send up the red flags .
Market value just ca n’t be trusted for a bite - the - bullet decision — but it can help .
The Total Portfolio Market Value line will follow an erratic path , constantly staying below Working Capital .
If you observe the chart after a market cycle or two , you will see that the Working Capital , Net Realized Capital Gains , and Base Income lines move steadily upward regardless of what the market value is doing !
You will also notice that the lows in market value begin to occur above earlier highs — but this may take several cycles to develop .
It ’s comforting to know that , although market value movements are not controllable , the WCM growth engines are .
We can actively manage a portfolio to produce increasing base income levels , and we can conservatively select and monitor our equities to assure that all reasonable profits are brought to the bottom line .
The market value line should never be above the working capital line , except occasionally in 100 % income portfolios .
When it gets close , a greater movement upward in Net Realized Capital Gains should be expected .
If it has n’t , you ’ve become greedy — let no profit go unrealized must become your success mantra !
Studies show rather clearly that the vast majority of unrealized gains are eventually brought to the Schedule D as realized losses — and this includes potential profits on the boring securities housed in the income side of your portfolio .
One other use for market value :
When that line is at or near an all time high , look around for a security that has fallen to a below investment grade S & P rating , and bite that bullet .
Loss taking should be done slowly , and downgraded securities should be the first to go .
What ’s different about this approach , and why is n’t it more high tech ?
There is no mention of an index , an average , or comparisons with anything except valid expectations based on securities and market cycles .
It will get you where you want to be without the hype that encourages unproductive transactions , foolish speculations , and incurable dissatisfaction .
In the WCM , market value is used as an expectation clarifier and an action indicator for the portfolio manager .
Most investors focus on market value and market indices out of habit .
Market values , realistically , are neither bad nor good .
You need to step outside the market value vs. something box , and focus on the opportunities for growth that security price changes provide .
All performance assessment lines need to be treated as learning tools instead of knuckle slappers , and they need to be looked at as inter - dependent pieces of the road map to goal achievement .
But there is one more line to add to the chart .
The Net Invested Capital Line is the pulse of your investment plan and it should beat most rapidly in the early years of portfolio building .
Steady deposits assure that opportunities are not missed and that base income attains the levels needed many years in the future .
Most investors curtail their deposits in bad markets — a major error in judgment .
The retirement phase of the investment plan should be based on a 70 % or lower withdrawal of base income .
In tax - deferred plans , the 70 % level includes Uncle Sam ’s portion .
Gotcha !
With that discipline in place , the base income line will continue to grow at a rate in excess of most recent inflation levels .

NebuAd , the company that thought slurping up ISP data to better target ads was a good idea , has closed .
Court documents filed this week in a class - action claim brought against the company show that NebuAd laid off most staff last year and now pays only a skeleton crew to wind things down in an orderly fashion .
The basic scheme was simple : pay ISPs for the privilege of inserting a box into their networks , grab URLs that customers visited , then mine them and assign users to interest categories .
Websites could then use the data to better sell targeted ads , which would command higher premiums than untargeted ones .
Unfortunately for NebuAd , customers were n't thrilled with the idea , and neither was Congress .
After a series of hearings last year , the company abandoned its approach , shut down the trials , and said that it would try something new .
But the money was n't there to continue , it appears , and the company is gone .
It 's domain name still exists , but the corporate " website " ( if one can call it that ) is a husk of its former self .
Nice website

Writing better commit messages Posted by Louis Brandy on 30 March 2009
If you and your team are in the habit of writing good commit messages , it can save everyone a tremendous amount of time and effort .
Other developers can very quickly see what you 've done .
It 'll also save tons of time tracking down commits from the past when you need to find them .
A good commit message serves exactly two purposes : it gives other developers an explanation of the commit , and it gives some documentation for future searching .
You are n't special
Everyone thinks they write great messages .
Most of the time you probably do .
But everyone , including you , phones it in from time to time .
It 's true , admit it .
I know you think you write awesome commits but if we looked at your last 100 , how many would we truly classify as awesome ?
Just for fun , try it .
I just did .
It was n't pretty .
Make " atomic " commits
This is n't really about the message , per se , but it 's too important to not mention .
A commit should be one ( and just one ) logical unit .
It should be something that someone might want to patch or revert in its entirety , and never piecewise .
If it could be useful in pieces , make separate commits .
This will result in short , clear , and concise commit messages .
Non-atomic commits make for awful run-on commit messages .
A run-on commit :
Fixed a few bugs in the interface .
Added an ID field .
Removed a couple unnecessary functions .
Refactored the context check .
Be specific .
Make it search friendly .
The worst message of all :
Fixed some bugs .
Hey wow , thanks for that .
Usually , this commit follows some previous larger commit that had a bunch of bugs .
If so , say so !
The lack of search - friendliness in the commit log can come back to haunt you .
Be more descriptive .
When you are skimming a commit log , or searching for a particular commit , these catch - all messages will be basically useless .
At the very least , name the important subsection / module of the code .
" Fixed bad allocations in image processing routines " goes a long a way .
Communicate caveats
Bad :
Added super - widget 2.0
Better :
Very rough draft of super - widget 2.0 .
Compiles but is completely untested .
Tested + working super - widget 2.0 ... but the XYZ function ( ) should be alot smarter to re-use previous computation
While your commit should never break anyone else 's build , it 's generally acceptable to commit things that are n't " patched in " and are n't necessarily fully working .
Just state the important caveats in the commit .
This is especially true if you have major line items to do .
The third example above states missing functionality for others to see ( and possibly implement ) , and it provides fantastic information when looking at the log for a particular file or module .
Just how bad is this recession ?
So bad that it has infiltrated the hip - hop scene .
In less than two months the trend in hip - hop has shifted from celebrating Barack Obama ’s election to surviving the recession .
Everyone from Cam’ron , to N.E.R.D , to Young HOV himself ( Note the stacks of Euros in this video ! ) are fronting a more sober tone and demeanor .
In 2003 , the Roots ’ drummer ? uestlove made the argument that sputtering American economies have , in the past , lead to golden eras in hip - hop and black art .
“ My theory is that nine times out of ten , if there ’s a depression , more a social depression than anything , it brings out the best art in black people .
The best example is , Reagan and Bush gave us the best years of hip - hop .
I think had Carter and then Mondale won , or if Jesse [ Jackson ] were President from ’ 84 to ’ 88 , hip - hop would n’t have been the same .
Hip - hop would n’t have existed . ”
There ’s no arguing with the quality of work that was born in the 80s , and this recession ’s rap has its charm , but I ’d much rather prefer to think of other , better times when the economy was on the up and up , hip - hop was as strong as ever , and springtime was ushered in with charcoal and a boombox .
Here are some premium cuts to remind us of the economically prosperous 1990s .
Diamond D and the Psychotic Neurotics , “ I Went For Mine ”
From Stunts , Blunts , & Hip Hop ( 1992 )
The Bronx legend Diamond D is first and foremost a producer .
He has production credits alongside The Pharcyde , The Fugees , and A Tribe Called Quest , which should give you an immediate understanding of what kind of pedigree we ’re talking about here .
In 1992 he released his debut album to an unsuspecting public that , while familiar with his fresh and delectably , jazzy beats , had not heard him on the mic .
Diamond turned out to be a natural with a steady flow and an impressive lyrical prowess .
This entire album is excellent , and any of the 23 tracks would be a decent introduction to Diamond D , but I ’ve decided to go with a song that has a good cruising rhythm and a buoyant , entrepreneurial spirit to it .
Remember when we all thought positively about that capitalist , go - get - it mentality ?
Main Source , “ Large Professor ”
From Breaking Atoms ( 1991 )
Main Source is another crucial player in early 1990s hip - hop .
The group consisted of K - Cut , Mikey D , Sir Scratch , and Large Professor .
When the group released Breaking Atoms in 1991 , many critics described it as a landmark album for its colorful , uptempo rapping , choice sampling , and overall formidable production .
“ Large Professor ” demonstrates all of these traits and even pays homage in name to its creator .
On a side note , the track “ Live at the Barbeque ” on Breaking Atoms is the first song to feature Nas .
Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz , “ Déja Vu ”
From Make It Reign ( 1998 )
With a song like “ Déja Vu ( Uptown Baby ) , ” the rest of Make it Reign could have been trash and it would still be a classic .
This is the only album from Lord Tariq and Peter Gunz .
“ Déja Vu ( Uptown Baby ) ” went platinum and the album fared pretty well on the Billboard charts .
KMD , “ Sweet Premium Wine ”
From Black Bastards ( Recorded for intended release in 1994 , actually released 2001 )
KMD , which stands for “ Kausing Much Damage ” , recorded two albums in the 90s — Mr. Hood and the cult classic Black Bastards .
Among the four members , the group included a young MF DOOM , known at the time as Zev Love X , and his younger brother .
Black Bastards was set for release in 1994 but because of its cover art the album was shelved until 2001 .
Zev ’s younger brother DJ Subroc was tragically hit by a car while the group was putting the final touches on Black Bastards .
Subsequently , Zev left the music scene for about four years before reemerging as MF DOOM .
Camp Lo , “ Luchini AKA This Is It ”
From Uptown Saturday Night ( 1997 )
Uptown baby !
Uptown Saturday
Night is probably one of the tightest albums I ’ve ever heard .
With songs like “ Black Connection , ” “ Coolie High , ” and the brilliant “ Luchini AKA This Is It ” which features production wizardry from David Willis , Will - Ski , this album continues to amass a cult following .
Take it from Wale , this album is the illest .
Leaders of the New School , “ Case of the P.T.A . ”
From A Future Without a Past ( 1991 )
Leaders of the New School are known for spawning the career of a young Busta Rhymes .
“ Case of the P.T.A. ” is a friendly , Jazzy Jeff era jam that features some excellent production from Cut Monitor Milo .
Busta absolutely kills it on his verse and the schoolyard vibe on this certainly recalls better days when we could fret over teachers and grades instead of tuition and the financial apocalypse .
“ Obama ’s acquiescence to the old regime is outrageous in part because it is politically unnecessary . ”
On January 20th of this year , George W. Bush left Washington and headed back to Texas after the inauguration of Barrack Obama .
Or are those memories merely figments of our collective imagination ?
A quick perusal of government policy has to make one wonder , is Bush still in the White House ?
According to the New York Times , the Obama administration is considering resuming the use of military tribunals to prosecute Guantanamo detainees .
Candidate Obama claimed to “ reject the Military Commissions Act . ”
Now as president , his administration makes the case for maintaining it .
It is important to remember that prior to the Bush administration , terror suspects were tried in open court where they had the right to counsel and to jury verdicts .
It seems that the Obama administration is afraid that some of the defendants might actually be acquitted .
Judges might ban evidence discovered under torture or the hearsay evidence of intelligence reports .
Defendants would have the right to question their accusers , in this case the intelligence operatives who may have participated in their torture .
“ Judges might ban evidence discovered under torture or the hearsay evidence of intelligence reports . ”
Reports of the resumption of military tribunals are not the only bad news on Guantanamo and Bush era justice .
In congressional testimony , Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced that Guantanamo detainees may be held on American soil .
The Obama administration is going where even the Bush administration dared not .
The Guantanamo apparatus was set up precisely to avoid any Constitutional inconveniences and to keep prisoners out of sight and out of mind .
They did n’t want to risk waking Americans from their slumber and possibly encourage them to oppose this clear abuse of law and morality .
Apparently Barrack Obama has less concern for American public opinion than did George W. Bush .
The reasons for Obama ’s nonchalance are obvious .
He was never called to account by self - described progressives during his presidential campaign .
The same individuals who chose to silence themselves throughout 2008 have continued to act like doormats for president Obama , who as a result has the best , cushiest catbird seat of any president in recent memory .
The acquiescence to the old regime is outrageous in part because it is politically unnecessary .
Only 21 % of Americans are willing to claim an affiliation with the Republican party .
The only good news for Republicans is that their brand can’t fare any worse than it is now .
Conversely , Obama has a 68 % approval rating that bests all of his predecessors at the 100 - day mark .
The fear of public opposition to doing the right thing is completely unwarranted .
“ Obama was never called to account by self - described progressives during his presidential campaign . ”
There is no rational political reason for the embrace of Bush policy .
Most Americans do not trust the official explanations given for the September 11th attacks .
Obama could not only close Guantanamo as he promised but he could free even those accused of planning 9/11 without fear of public disapproval outside of the Republican dead - ender crowd .
Barrack Obama is in a position to do almost anything he wants .
If he keeps the military tribunal system or moves Guantanamo prisoners to the United States it is because he wants to .
He believes in the rule of the ruling classes more than he believes in true democracy .
Challenging that belief would have made him unacceptable as a presidential candidate .
Dismantling the Bush regime would mean dismantling the prerogatives and assumptions of entitlement carried by the people who run the country .
The ruling classes like to know that no one , especially not the president , will get any big ideas about disrupting their rule .
Obama is the perfect president for them .
The names change but the system does n’t .
Perhaps the president ’s name should be changed to Bushama .
There would no longer be any excuse for confusion .
We would all know where we truly stand .

Do you ever look at your cell phone bill ?
I mean , really look at what your paying for .
I do n’t stress over it every month but since I have a family acct that includes my folks , wife cell phones and my wife ’s notebook 3g card , I take a glance at it from time to time .
It always seems strange that it bounces up and down so much from month to month even though we do n’t break out of our included minutes .
Where I have found the expense bounce is when the nieces hit us with a lot of text messages .
They are half way across the US so it ’s allowed to keep everyone in tune without need to sit with the phone to your ear while you enlightened to the latest school function .
The months there is a lot of activity in their social lives sees us breaking out of our ‘ in plan ’ texting plan .
That can add up quickly .
Why do n’t we just go to unlimited .
Well , ATT wants a ‘ unlimited ’ charge on each phone in the family plan… a item that ever family should pencil out before jumping into .
Let ’s get to the reason for this article .
Imagine if you had millions of customers .
And each customer one of those customers you could hit with a couple dimes extra charge each month .
Would an individual take the time to go through a Support phone web of options just for 20 to 30 cents extra charge .
Most likely not , so that is a safe bet you can bank that extra cash every month .
How would the average person catch that they are getting hit with an extra couple text message charges a month ?
Have two 80 + year old parents that have their Text Messaging turned off on their phones .
Or , a wife ’s 3G card acct hooked up to a notebook with no Text Messaging software installed .
Pretty sure neither of those situations would have Text Messaging traffic .
My own notebook uses a Verizon cell connection .
There was a Text Message charge from time to time …
I did nothing .
Then , one day at the mall I was walking by the Verizon Connected Store and thought to drop in ( the girls were in a store I knew would take an hour so I had some time to play with ) .
The greeter was surprised that I was there to discuss a few dimes .
They did call without much pushing thought .
You know the person on the other end of the phone was surprised too as the in - store women said “ no really , he is standing here and wants it straightened out ” .
Less than one minute later I was offered a refund / credit for the last few months charges ( 70 cents ) and have not had a miss charged Text Message on my bill since .
You milage will vary depending on the person who you grab .
Judging by the speed of the transaction , this was not a new thing to them .
The fact I have not been charged since tells us that they can control the Text Messaging .
My guess , only a guess , is that the Messages were one from them about an update which I can not receive so why pay ?!!
Lets say that the person in the store and the person they called makes $ 12 / hour ( even though the credit happened in a minute , I actually used up about 15 minutes of their time with the problem outline , calling and ‘ thanks ’ wrap up ) , then there is the correction to the bill , the credit entry and authorization , and the blocking of the miss charge happening again .
In my case , 30 cents / mo x 12 = $ 3.60 is what they stood to make on my if I did nothing .
Their labor and paperwork to correct the problem is about $ 10 if everyone was efficient .
How many people calling the cell phone companies out for their creative billing will it take to get them to stop ?
Anyone have a way to make it easier for people to request a stop / refund so more people will get the phone companies to do the right thing ?
And lastly , will our bills go up in the near future to make up for the loss in income ?
ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan 's Taliban seized control of another district in the country 's northwest just 70 miles from the capital after consolidating their hold on the Swat Valley , according to local government officials and residents .
The latest Taliban advance into the Buner district has spurred fears that a controversial peace accord , which allows the militants to enforce sharia law in Swat , has emboldened them to expand their influence .

( Fortune Magazine ) -- Gazing across the craggy canyon that is the Hull - Rust - Mahoning mine in Minnesota 's legendary Iron Range , it 's hard to believe that our planet 's most abundant element - iron - is mostly locked away in the earth 's core .
For here iron - bearing rock has shouldered its way to the surface in heroic quantities , and men and machines have carved out the world 's largest iron - ore pit .
And as it has for over a century , Range iron still forges the steel sinews of the American economy .
But more than a century of mining has left Iron Country scraped and scarred , a landscape dominated by vast quarries and basins of stony waste from processed ore - tailings , which sprawl across the land like a mighty river delta .
Now largely covered by scrub vegetation , these tailings are the remains of a struggle to wrest a living from the earth that began with the great Iron Rush of the 1880s .
Fortune hunters from far afield flocked to the rich hematite mines of the Vermilion and Mesabi ranges , which were soon minting millionaires so fast that by 1910 regional capital Duluth was reckoned to have more than any other city in the world .
Two world wars brought boom times as the Range answered the call for iron and steel to arm the nation .
And there were busts too , notably during the Depression , when output crashed from 47 million metric tons in 1929 to just 2 million metric tons in 1932 .
And all the time those tailings kept accumulating - a buildup that will continue until the ore runs out .
Then the Range will fall silent , closing a long chapter of American history .
Or maybe not .
Just west along Route 169 from the Hull - Rust - Mahoning mine , near the town of Keewatin ( pop. 1,164 ) , a vast domed structure dominates a tailings basin left by the defunct Mesabi Chief mine .
The dome can't be seen from the highway , and few Rangers ( and even fewer mining corporations ) know it 's there .
Inside sits equipment that could prove to be as significant to the region as the 1950s - era discovery of a way to extract iron from low - grade taconite rock .
The earlier technique arrived in the nick of time for the Range , for its hematite - known locally as " natural " ore - was almost depleted .
Similarly , the dome at Keewatin is home to a revolutionary process , dubbed " magnetation , " that can extract valuable iron from the tailings - just when the Range is in need of new sources of ore .
" Our process , " says Rod Hunt , 83 , who , along with mining veteran Al Fritz , 78 , co-founded upstart Magnetation Inc. , " is the equivalent of the fabled philosopher 's stone of yore .
We can't turn base metal into gold , but we can process the millions of tons of natural - ore tailings and extract the iron that got missed the first time around . "
That 's good news for the hardscrabble region ( March unemployment there was 13.5 % - the highest rate since 1992 ) and explains why Iron Range Resources , a state development agency , has backed the company with $ 2.5 million in seed money .
But magnetation technology also is good news for the iron industry globally .
U.S. Geological Survey data show that global reserves of economically recoverable iron ore could eventually run out .
" Magnetation is a transformational technology , " says former regional development consultant Mike Andrews .
" If it did n't exist , it would have to be invented . "
Behind the invention stands a grizzled bunch of veterans with more than three centuries of mining , construction , and engineering experience among them .
Magnetation 's iron men seem more like Minnesota 's answer to the Buena Vista Social Club than mining messiahs , but they apparently have developed a technology that has defied the best efforts of bigger players .
Process inventor Fritz is characteristically modest about his achievement .
" The last half - century has n't seen many new developments in mining , " he says .
" I guess we lucked onto one . "
But it was n't so much luck as dogged determination that enabled Fritz , formerly superintendent of the Hill Annex mine , to tweak the process during his retirement .
The breakthrough came three years ago when Fritz and Hunt , who first met prospecting for gold in Alaska back in the 1980s , bench - tested a prototype machine - which they dubbed the " ferrous wheel " - that finally solved the problem of creating a magnetic field capable of extracting enough of the weakly magnetic hematite to make commercially viable iron - ore concentrate .
" We were n't getting any younger , so we decided it was time to go into business , " recalls Hunt , who had the additional motive of recouping enough funds to repay the mortgage he had taken out on his house to pay for the prototype .
They were soon joined by Ed Shaughnessy , 57 , a mining project manager for 30 years when he was n't racing dragsters , who just happened to own some tailings - about 4 million metric tons of them that came his way in 1998 when the businessman who hired him to build a drag - racing strip on the tailings failed to pay up .
Next came two other Range veterans : haulage and construction contractor Tom Hammerlund Sr. , 67 , who had heard about Magnetation 's contraption through Shaughnessy , and engineer Eugene Bergstrom , 71 , who liked the sound of it so much that he sold his resort business on nearby Lake Winnibigoshish to invest in the Keewatin startup .
The big coup for Hunt and Fritz was persuading Larry Lehtinen , the youngster of the group at 53 but with 30 years ' experience in the iron and steel business , to come onboard as CEO .
A man of vision and energy in the mold of the Range 's early pioneers - like his great - grandfather Albert , who arrived from Finland in 1896 - Lehtinen has a reputation for making things happen .
Recalls Hunt : " Al and I had faith in the process , but Larry and the others got us out of the lab and into production . "
***
Magnetation 's first challenge was to show that its patent - pending technology could indeed extract the " lost " iron .
This it has done emphatically - since Feb. 23 its plant has been shipping concentrate rich enough for blast furnaces to turn it into pig iron , the raw material for steel .
Now it must compete price - wise with the world 's mining giants .
Magnetation will never match them on volume : Brazilian mining behemoth Vale ( VALE ) , the world 's largest iron ore producer , ships about 250 million metric tons annually , compared with Magnetation 's tiny initial target of 300,000 metric tons .
But Lehtinen is certain that Magnetation can compete on price .
Although he wo n't discuss costs , Lehtinen insists that Magnetation is already the lowest - cost producer in the U.S. and can match Vale , as well as mining giants BHP Billiton ( BHP ) and Rio Tinto ( RTP ) , all of which must ship their ore long distances to their main customers .
" Our raw material is all around us , " Lehtinen explains .
" It 's easy and cheap to extract , and it has already been crushed . "
Indeed , the main input is the water needed to convert the tailings into a mudlike slurry that can be fed through the magnetation process , where , as the name suggests , giant magnets separate the weakly magnetic hematite from the nonferrous elements of the tailings - mainly silica .
And thanks to Shaughnessy 's 150 - acre tailings basin , getting started was relatively easy .
" I got a whole lot of grief from my wife for those tailings , " recalls Shaughnessy , " but now they do n't look so worthless . "
Far from it .
Shaughnessy 's tailings could yield as much as a million metric tons of concentrate , worth around $ 90 million at current prices .
And Magnetation has lined up enough tailings to produce 104 million metric tons of concentrate , worth just under $ 10 billion .
WASHINGTON 
Why , after decades of battling , complaining and maneuvering over fuel economy standards , did carmakers fall in line behind the tough new nationwide mileage standard President Obama announced Tuesday ?
Because they had no choice .
The auto industry is flat on its back , with Chrysler in bankruptcy , General Motors close to it , and both companies taking billions of dollars in federal money .
Foreign automakers are getting help from their own governments .
Climate change legislation is barreling down the track , and Congress showed last fall that it had no appetite to side with Detroit any more .
Simply put , Detroit and the other companies need Washington ’s help , and they are powerless to block the rules Washington dictates .
“ They can feel the political winds changing , ” said David Doniger , a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council who has faced the car companies in court many times .
“ They need government aid to stay in business .
When you have your hand out for help , it ’s hard to use the same hand to thumb your nose at the federal government . ”
A lovely Schadenfreude moment caught on tape yesterday at the Berlin Zoo .
Evidently , the animal hugging Fräulein wanted to play with the cute , cuddly wuddly , polar bears .
So , she climbed over a fence and scaled a wall to jump into an enclosure containing four polar bears who wanted to do some hugging of their own …
Perhaps she watched Al Gore ’s polar bear propaganda piece one too many times …

For its fiscal year ending Jan. 31 , 2009 , Wal - Mart 's total sales rose 7.2 % .
Read more on WMT at CHICAGO ( Reuters )  Wal - Mart Stores ( WMT ) is awarding approximately $ 2 billion to its U.S. hourly employees through financial incentives , including handing out $ 933.6 million in bonuses Thursday , after the world 's largest retailer gained market share amid a recession .
In a memo to Wal - Mart employees obtained by Reuters , Wal - Mart CEO Mike Duke said the retailer is awarding roughly $ 2 billion to U.S. hourly employees , which includes $ 933.6 million in bonuses , $ 788.8 million in profit sharing and 401 ( k ) contributions , millions of dollars in merchandise discounts , and contributions to its employee stock purchase plan .
" While economic challenges forced others to step back , we moved forward , " Duke stated in the memo .
Duke said Wal - Mart now needs to " accelerate and broaden all of our efforts . "
As consumers seek to stretch limited budgets , they are increasingly heading to Wal - Mart 's U.S. stores for discounts on everything from food to televisions .
Wal - Mart is also aggressively touting its low prices to attract shoppers , and the retailer said Thursday that it is cutting prices on contact lenses and children 's glasses .
The efforts are helping Wal - Mart gain market share while other U.S. retailers see sales fall as shoppers avoid splurging on nice - to - have items , like sweaters or jewelry .
For its fiscal year ending Jan. 31 , 2009 , Wal - Mart 's total sales rose 7.2 % to $ 401.24 billion .
Sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year , or same - store sales , rose 3.3 % , excluding fuel , in its recently completed fiscal year , up from a 1.4 % gain in the previous fiscal year .
A year ago , Wal - Mart said it awarded almost $ 1.2 billion in financial incentives to its U.S. hourly employees , including more than $ 636.4 million in bonuses , which are based on store performance .
Wal - Mart shares declined 1 % to $ 49.95 Thursday as the S&P 500 index fell 1.3 % .
Wal - Mart is down 11 % this year , vs. a 13.2 % loss for the S&P 500 , a broad market index .

Information Repackaging : ‘ Gadgets and Gimmicks ’ of the New World Order
Jurriaan Maessen
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , May 14 , 2009
During a discussion at the 1980 Bilderberg conference in Aachen , West - Germany , one ‘ participant ’ stood up to make his case for depopulation and the third world .
The Bilderberg notes report on page 11 :
Director General of UNESCO , Amadou - Mahtar M’Bow , paid tribute to the Soviet Union and its then 60 - year old regime responsible for murdering many millions of its own people .
‘ The speaker ( a German participant ) went on to say that the leaders of the LDC ’s understood that the oil price explosion had hurt the Third World much more than the industrialized countries .
And they were beginning to see that they did not have at all the same interests as the oil - producing countries .
What they did not perhaps fully understand was what a menace the population explosion was to their countries .
It seemed that no one wanted to tell them that - neither the Catholic Church nor others .
It would be nearly impossible to feed and employ the future world population at the rate it was growing .
This had to be faced seriously ; it could not be solved by talking about “ gadgets and gimmicks . ” ’
But his fellow - transnationalists are more patient than the German participant .
They work towards a clearly defined objective : to reduce the earth ’s population in an orderly fashion .
The global warming and climate change propaganda machine has been warmed up in carefully planned stages of succession .
The gadgets and gimmicks the Bilderberger referred to in the 1980 Bilderberg get - together were already in place during the 1970s and beginning of the 1980s en were to be expanded with painstaking accuracy by the global elite in the years and decades to come .
To tackle the population problem and convincingly manufacture an ongoing crisis in order to justify their plans , they would have to find some pretext , any pretext , on the condition that it superseded nation - states for their own transnational designs .
CFR - head Richard N. Haass offers an insight into the true objective of the environmental argument in a 1991 Club of Rome document , ‘ The First Global Revolution ’ : ‘ The common enemy of humanity is man .
In searching for a common enemy to unite us , we came up with the idea that pollution , the threat of global warming , water shortages , famine and the like would fit the bill . ’
As anyone can learn , the globalists have decided long ago that the environmental debate is no longer a debate - it has been decreed that the ‘ discussion is over ’ and everyone should get to bed dreaming that man is the prime cause for global warming on the planet earth , or of any other natural calamity , as long as it serves the double purpose of the elite : to abolish nation - states in favour of a great global government , and reduce the world population .
The imagined threat of ‘ international terrorism ’ being hardly sufficient to justify the drastic measures being implemented , another common enemy has presented itself , staring back at you from the mirror .
As numerous meteorologists have testified to in recent years , their participation in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been taken and used to prove a theory that they did not support .
And then there are the thousands of meteorologists of good name and standard , who out of scientific righteousness have stepped forward and presented their facts before the public and scientific community .
But it is of no concern to the eugenicists of Unesco and the IPCC .
They have for a good long time , spanning the last couple of centuries at least , presided over the politics of eugenics and enforced its diabolical mechanisms with energy , cunning and precision .
It is not an idle use of words , when we identify eugenicists as such , for however just and noble its cloaking makes them out to be , this supposed righteousness is merely a grotesque carnival - costume intended to shade its true countenance .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
For an October 1975 ‘ International Workshop on Environmental Education ’ , UN - representative Lars Emmelin writes : ‘ The adult education effort seems to me most critical .
First , because this element - now outside the formal channels of education - will continue to be the decision makers for the next 15 to 20 years , and it is within this period that the most critical and disruptive decisions will have to be made .
We cannot afford to focus on youth and let the elders die off before changing our course , which , if time permitted , would be the most efficient way of institutions change . ’
In choosing its course for mass - indoctrination , the 1975 workshop explores various ways in which the mass media can be used to ‘ sensitize ’ the general public in accepting the UN ’s long - term ambitions .
Under the headline ‘ The Media as Environmental Educators ’ ( page 4 ) several options are being presented by one of the participants in how the media can best be used : ‘ Discussing the role of media as motivators Sandman concludes that : “ Four relatively effective kinds of environmental information are : basic ecological principles ; prescriptions for environmental action ; early warnings of anticipated problems ; and assessments of blame for environmental degradation . ” ’
During an ENESCO - conference in October 1977 held ( bizarrely ) in Soviet Russia , the Director - General of UNESCO , Amadou - Mahtar M’Bow , ‘ paid tribute to the Soviet Union and to the spectacular results achieved since the October Revolution in all areas of economic , social and cultural life , particularly in education and science , and , more especially , in environmental education . ’
Here the good Director - General pays tribute to a then 60 - year old regime responsible for murdering many millions of its own people in great death camps and deliberate mass - scale starvation - operations .
Yes , ‘ enviromental issues ’ were very high on the agenda of the USSR , very high indeed .
After having taken his hat off to his fellow - psychopath , the Director - General plunged into a long and melodious speech on the importance of the ‘ environment - issue ’ in the decades to come .
‘ The objectives and strategies relating to the environment and to development had to be linked and co-ordinated .
(…)
It would be the task of education to make people aware of their responsibilities in this connection , but in order to do so it must first be reoriented and based on an ethos of the environment . ‘
And a little further on he states : ‘ Environmental education should also promote attitudes which would encourage individuals to discipline themselves in order not to impair the quality of the environment and to play a positive role in improving it . ’
It is true , under the intentionally vague ‘ enviroment ’- umbrella one can assemble all kinds of calamities and as many solutions to combat them .
‘ Work in this programme area ‘ , the report continues , ‘ will be intensified “ in the line of the conference ’s recommendations and move into a more operational fase .
This means , among other activities , “ making aid from Unesco available to member states ( of the UN ) which would like to launch pilot projects ” ; considering a “ bank ” of experts on environmental education ; augmenting “ work in the exchange of experience , in training and in encouraging the production of teaching materials ” ; and strengthening the Secretariat and Unesco ’s infrastructure in general for the increased promotion of environmental education ..’
In the meeting , the chairman of the conference stresses that no means will be shunned in the coming propaganda war against the people :
‘ Some countries have also taken an interest , as part of in - service training activities , in the environmental education of various social and occupational categories of the population , such as factory workers , farmers , civil servants , etc .
Marked progress has been made in the preparation of audio-visual and printed teaching materials concerning the environment , and the mass media are being increasingly used for sensitizing and informing broad sectors of the public about the environment . ‘
In a follow - up conference more than ten years later ( this time in Moscow ) the Secretary - General of Unesco , Federico Mayor , discusses ‘ three levels of global education ’ in regards to the environment .
The first , he states , is the ‘ moral imperative ’ to reach as many people as humanly possible .
The second level is ‘ to harness school systems , non-formal learning and informal education to teach and learn about the global issues that shape and threaten the quality of our lives . ’
Arriving at the third and last level of global indoctrination , Mayor states : ‘ The third level concerns the means at our disposal to project a global reach for education through both simple and highly advanced existing technologies .
( … ) the daily newspaper and radio have a crucial role to play in building bridges to the wider world .
We must promote these media , defend and expand their freedom and appeal to their professionals at all levels to work with us for global education . ’
We can hardly accuse the globalists of keeping their plans secret .
At every possible UN event or brainstorm conference , they openly brag about their plans for the world in quite explicit ways .
The Secretary - General continues about the steps that have to be taken in order to build a ‘ new global perception ’ :
‘ Our first initiative would be to create a worldwide expert panel of scientists and educators to plan a global education curriculum of practical value and planetary scope . ’
The Secretary - General forgets to mention here that just such a panel was created two years earlier by the very organisation he presides over .
‘ Second , putting environmental education at the centre of all curricula from kindergarten to higher studies and training the teachers and the administrators who can carry the massage into all schools .(..)
Third , promoting a global civic education by devising teaching methods and materials that emphasize the ethics of worldwide community living . (…)
Fourth , teaching the children of the wealthier countries about the conditions of their brothers and sisters in the developing world (…)
Fifth , working with the mass media and telecommunication enterprises to produce and broadcast audio-visual packages that introduce audiences , particularly children and young people , to the great teachers of this world at al levels and in all cultures ( … ) .
‘ And finally ’ , the Secretary - General concludes , ‘ let me make a very immediate and concrete proposal : building on the broadcast of this forum scheduled for tomorrow ( … ) , to create global television learning networks on the issues of the human agenda for the next century .
This would be an experiment in informal global education at its best . ’
Under the term ‘ Information Repackaging ’ , the UN has published several manuals on this subject , teaching their cronies how to most effectively influence public opinion .
In a 1986 ‘ Manual for Repackaging of Information on Population Education ’ , the Unesco proposes ‘ strategies for integrating population education into different subject areas ’- one of these being playing into fears on the part of the population in regards to the subject of their home environment family :
‘ For instance , the effectiveness of fear appeals in changing attitudes and behaviour , such as the adverse effects of non- or limited access to education and housing facilities with more than two children , depends on the credibility of the source of information and the extent of general / public support to the message conveyed by a particular piece of information .
Fear appeals directed to the welfare of people valued by the receiver of information ( e.g. family members , close friends ) are also effective . ’
On page 37 of the manual , under the header ‘ Selective Dissemination of Information ( SDI ) ’ , the strategy is further elaborated upon :
‘ One SDI package , for instance , focuses on the integration of population education into environmental education .
The package contains materials which will help users understand the relationship between man and the environment , as well as provide insights and actual data on how to plan , teach and implement practical environment / population activities for everyday life . ’
As we know , the abovementioned ‘ gadgets and gimmicks ’ are incrementally being used in the mass media as the climate change propaganda machine is working overtime .
Using the mass media to prepare the population for globalism , is not only an ambitious plan - it reveals the deceitful spirit behind the provided information , rivalling the work of Joseph Goebbels and his Department of Propaganda .
As the following fragment from a 2007 Greek quiz show illustrates , the Bilderbergers in the 21st century are working as hard as ever to push this ‘ climate change ’- agenda , forcing businesses and governments worldwide to ‘ go green ’ and calling for world government as the final solution :

New Yorkers were worried that the planes may have been part of a terrorist attack
A Boeing 747 flies low over New York Harbor followed by an F - 16 chase plane
A plane , being tailed by two fighter jets in New York , is part of ' photo op ' , according to the Federal Aviation Administration .
Aircraft were seen flying at low altitudes over the Statue of Liberty and parts of lower Manhattan
The planes flew low over the Hudson River , near the site of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 , 2001 , and circled several times .
The event caused scores of frightened office workers , fearing a terrorist attack , to flee buildings in Lower Manhattan and Jersey City .
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters said that the Boeing 747 circling Lower Manhattan escorted by F - 16s was part of ' photo op ' being carried out by the Defense Department .
“ They ’ll do two or three spins ... and will be done by 10:30 , ” Mr. Peters said .
" It is pre-planned , pre-coordinated with everyone involved .
It 's a military flight over New York to take photos . "
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it did not know about the event .
New York City has released an advisory that the flyover was " part of an approved federal activity . "
North American Air Defense Command refused to answer questions and referred enquiries to the FAA .

The long - awaited Servicing Mission 4 for the Hubble Space Telescope has provided drama , nail - biting excitement , fist - pumping triumphs and ‘ what else could go wrong now ’ moments .
But the best way to to describe the mission is to let the amazing images from the EVAs do the talking .
Below are high - resolution images from NASA , highlighting the first three spacewalks .
The mission began with the picture - perfect , no - delay , long - awaited launch on May 11 , 2009 .
EVA # 1
The first spacewalk of the mission , performed by astronauts John Grunsfeld and Drew Feustel lasted a little over 7 1/2 hours .
They successfully installed the new Wide Field Camera 3 science instrument and a new Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit .
Both WFC - 3 and the SI C&DH passed their “ aliveness ” tests , which essentially means the devices powered on correctly .
The WFC - 3 also passed its functional test , meaning the capabilities of the instrument itself were tested .
The SI C&DH unit has also received an initial OK on its functional test , pending final review of data sent down to the ground .
A stubborn bolt threatened to thwart one of the spacewalk ’s main goals , replacing the venerable space telescope ’s workhorse optical camera with a new and improved instrument .
But after a fair amount of old fashioned elbow grease , the WFPC2 was able to be removed .
This close - up of Grunsfeld was taken by Drew Feustel , whose reflection is visible in Grunsfeld ’s visor .
Feustel is attached to the end of the shuttle Remote Manipulator System , or robotic arm .
Grunsfeld was the free - floating astronaut for the EVA .
Here , Feustel , on the end of the shuttle ’s robotic arm , carries the piano - sized WFPC3 to its new home inside Hubble .
EVA # 2
The second EVA of the mission provided some challenges to astronauts Michael Good and Mike Massimino .
However , they achieved all the objectives for this spacewalk , it just took them awhile — 7 hours and 56 minutes .
They installed three Rate Sensor Units ( RSUs ) , with a pair of gyros in each , and the first of two new battery module units .
Good and Massimino were not able to get one of the three prime RSUs into its slot but were able to install a spare , giving Hubble the new gyros it needed .
The gyros are used to change the orientation of the telescope and keep it fixed on a particular astronomical target during observations .
The spacewalkers also removed one of the original battery modules from Bay 2 of the telescope and replaced it with a new unit .
The batteries provide power to the telescope when Hubble passes into Earth ’s shadow and its solar arrays are not exposed to the sun .
Ground controllers at Goddard ’s Space Telescope Operations Control Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed preliminary tests .
EVA # 3
The third EVA of the mission went like clockwork as Grunsfeld and Feustel teamed up again .
They removed the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement and installed in its place the new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph .
They also completed an unprecedented repair of the Advanced Camera for Surveys replacing an electronic card and installed a new electronics box and cable .
To do the repairs on ACS , Grunsfeld removed 32 screws from an access panel to replace the camera ’s four circuit boards and install a new power supply .
The two astronauts used specially designed tools to do a job that was never intended to be done on orbit .
But they did it , and with efficiency .
Engineers at Goddard have already performed “ aliveness ” tests on both COS and ACS to verify they have electrical power .
However while a functional test of the ACS indicated success in reviving the instrument ’s heavily used wide - field channel , officials said early Sunday that it appears the repairs failed to resolve power problem with the camera ’s stricken high - resolution channel and it appears “ down for the count . ”
We ’ll keep you posted on any developments with ACS , and provide more high - resolution images from the remainder of the mission soon !

President Obama said it was time for the US to take a lead on innovation
President Barack Obama has set the goal of devoting 3 % of gross domestic product ( GDP ) to US science research .
President Obama made the announcement during a speech on Monday to the US National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC .
He also discussed a US public health emergency over the swine flu virus outbreak .
President Obama added that it was time for America to lead again in the area of research and development ( R&D ) .
Science is more essential for our prosperity , our security , our health , our environment and our quality of life than it has ever been before
President Barack Obama
He said the goal represented the largest commitment to scientific research and innovation in US history .
" I am here today to set this goal : we will devote more than 3 % of our GDP to research and development , " said President Obama .
" We will not just meet , but we will exceed the level achieved at the height of the space race . "
US R&D spend is currently of the order of 2.6 % , according to the most recent recorded figures .
" A half century ago , this nation made a commitment to lead the world in scientific and technological innovation , " he said in his speech .
But President Obama said investment in science had declined since that " high water mark . "
" There are those who say we cannot afford to invest in science , that support for research is somehow a luxury at moments defined by necessities .
I fundamentally disagree , " he explained .
" Science is more essential for our prosperity , our security , our health , our environment and our quality of life than it has ever been before . "
He said his administration would , over a decade , double the budgets of key agencies , including the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology .
It would also pursue the goal of a cut in carbon pollution of more than 80 % by 2050 .
" Energy is our big project , " he told the audience .
" My recovery plan provides the incentives to double our nation 's capacity to generate renewable energy over the next few years . "
The new ARPA - E agency , which was set up to carry out " high risk , high reward " research on energy , would help meet some of the country 's challenges over coming decades , he said .
He also announced a new commitment to mathematics and science education .
" Our schools continue to trail other developed countries - and in some cases developing countries .
Our students are outperformed on maths and science by their peers in Singapore , Japan , England , The Netherlands , Hong Kong and Korea amongst others , " said President Obama .
Lisbon target
He added : " We have watched as scientific integrity has been undermined and scientific research politicised in an effort to advance pre-determined ideological agendas . "
President Obama said his budget would also make permanent the US research and experimentation tax credit , which is designed to encourage technology - based companies to invest additional resources in R&D and testing .
Europe has long had an R&D intensity objective of 3 % .
The goal is known as the " Lisbon target " because it was set at a meeting of the European Council in the Portuguese capital in 2000 .
The objective to make R&D expenditure 3 % of GDP is supposed to be met by 2010 ; but although EU states have made progress to the mark , they will miss the deadline .
Currently , spending stands at about 1.84 % ( EU - 27 ) .
The UK government has set a target for GDP spend on research of 2.5 % by 2014 .
Nick Dusic , director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering in the UK , told BBC News : " President Obama backs up his rhetoric about the importance of science and engineering with additional investment in R&D and science and maths education .
" Although the UK government has made similar commitments in the past , it needs to redouble its effort if we are to compete and collaborate with the US in the future . "
Japan spends almost 4.0 % ; Korea spends more than 3.2 % ; and China is catching up fast , spending over 1.4 % of its GDP on R&D .
On the swine flu outbreak , President Obama told the audience : " Our capacity to deal with a public health challenge of this sort rests heavily on the work of our scientific and medical community .
This is one more example of why we can't allow our nation to fall behind . "

It ’s not actually old browsers that are holding back the web , it ’s old ways of thinking about the Web that are holding back the Web .
Nicholas C. Zakas explains why fixating on circumstances that you ca n’t change is n’t a recipe for success .
Earlier this week , we published two articles by Louis Lazaris : one on why old browsers are holding back the Web and another encouraging Web users to upgrade their browsers and use modern browsers other than IE .
This article presents another perspective on this issue .
Nicholas C. Zakas , a well - respected member of the developer community , goes into specifics of why we should focus on the good parts of our job so we can tolerate the bad ones and why fixating on circumstances that you ca n’t change is n’t a recipe for success .
Do you share Louis ’ or Nicholas ’ view ?
Leave a comment .
— Ed .
A couple of days ago , Smashing Magazine published an article entitled , Old Browsers Are Holding Back The Web .
The author of this article , Louis Lazaris , suggests that “ old browsers ” are holding Web developers back from creating beautiful experiences .
Old browsers , in this case , apparently referred to Internet Explorer version 6 - 9 .
That ’s right , the author groups Internet Explorer 9 into the same group as Internet Explorer 6 .
He goes on to list some of the things that you ca n’t use in Internet Explorer 8 and 9 .
Note : Louis Lazaris makes a statement that even although IE9 is a huge step forward from previous versions of Internet Explorer , it ’s already missing some of the important features that other modern browsers have and does not have auto - update like other popular browsers do , so it will become outdated relatively soon .
According to Microsoft auto - update policy , only those users will be upgraded to a newer version of Internet Explorer that have on automatic updating via Windows Update turned on .
— Ed .
Articles like this frustrate me a lot .
For most of my career , I ’ve fought hard against the “ woe is me ” attitude embraced by so many in Web development and articulated in the article .
This attitude is completely counterproductive and frequently inaccurately described .
Everyone was complaining when Internet Explorer 6 had a 90 % + marketshare .
That share has shrunk to 6.3 % today globally ( though Louis cites 0.66 % , which is true in the United States ) .
Microsoft even kicked off a campaign to encourage people to upgrade .
I can understand complaining about Internet Explorer 6 and even 7 .
We had them for a long time , they were a source of frustration , and I get that .
I would still never let anyone that I worked with get too buried in complaining about them .
If it ’s our job to support those browsers then that ’s just part of our job .
The truth is that every job has some part of it that sucks .
Even at my favorite job , as front end lead on the Yahoo homepage , there were still parts of my job that sucked .
You just need to focus on the good parts so you can tolerate the bad ones .
Welcome to life .
But then the article goes on to bemoan the fact that so many people use Internet Explorer 8 and that Internet Explorer 9 is gaining market share .
First and foremost , I would much rather support Internet Explorer 8 then I would 6 and 7 .
Microsoft forcing most people to upgrade from 6 and 7 to 8 is an incredible move and undoubtedly a blessing .
Internet Explorer 9
Internet Explorer 9 , on the other hand , is a damn good browser .
The only reason it does n’t have all of the features as Chrome and Firefox is because they rebuilt the thing from scratch so that adding more features in the future would be easier .
Let me say that again : they rebuilt the browser from scratch .
They necessarily had to decide what were the most important features to get in so that they could release something and start getting people to upgrade from version 8 .
If they had waited for feature parity with Chrome or Firefox , we probably still would n’t have Internet Explorer 9 .
The constant drumming of “ Internet Explorer X is the new Internet Explorer 6 ″ is getting very old .
Microsoft has done a lot to try to correct their past transgressions , and it seems like there are still too many people who are n’t willing to let go of old grudges .
There will always be a browser that lags behind others .
First it was Mosaic that was lagging behind Netscape .
Then it was Netscape lagging behind Internet Explorer .
Then it was Internet Explorer lagging behind Firefox .
People are already starting to complain about Android 2.x browsers .
What makes the Web beautiful is precisely that there are multiple browsers and , if you build things correctly , your sites and applications work in them all .
They might not necessarily work exactly the same in them all , but they should still be able to work .
There is absolutely nothing preventing you from using new features in your Web applications , that ’s what progressive enhancement is all about .
No one is saying you ca n’t use RGBA .
No one is holding a gun to your head and saying do n’t use CSS animations .
As an engineer on the Web application you get to make decisions every single day .
Progressive Enhancement
Louis briefly mentions progressive enhancement as a concept that does n’t even enter into the equation .
Once again , this is indicative of an old attitude of Web development that is counterproductive and ultimately lacking in creativity .
The reason that I still give talks about progressive enhancement is because it allows you to give the best experience possible to users based on the browser ’s capabilities .
That ’s the way the Web was meant to work .
I ’ve included a video of that talk below in case you have n’t seen it .
It ’s not actually old browsers that are holding back the web , it ’s old ways of thinking about the Web that are holding back the Web .
Fixating on circumstances that you ca n’t change is n’t a recipe for success .
The number of browsers we have to support , even “ old browsers ” , just represent constraints to the problems that we have to solve .
It is from within constraints that creativity is born .
The Web development community has evolved enough that we should stop pointing fingers at Internet Explorer and start taking responsibility for how we do our jobs .
Let ’s create solutions rather than continually pointing fingers .
We are better than that .
Yes , complaining is useful to get people to listen .
Microsoft is listening , so continuing to complain does n’t do anything except perpetuate an attitude that I would rather not have in Web development .
Let ’s give them a chance to right the ship without retrying them for past transgressions perpetually .
Pre-Alpha Chromium Browser Now Available March 16 , 2009
Last week I found an Ubuntu package repository for the Chromium browser , the open source project behind Google ’s Chrome browser .
I did n’t get excited until I saw this post , which shows that the packages do contain a working web browser !
Chromium for Linux is pre-alpha software , but farther along in development than I expected .
The GTK - based Linux interface looks and works just like Windows interface .
The browser rendered sites I tested it with just fine , and I have n’t been able to crash the it yet .
Lots of features , such as bookmarks , the options window , and even the about window , are simply are not implemented yet .
The big missing feature currently is the tab bar .
You can open a new tab just fine , but the tab bar is missing so there ’s no way to switch between tabs .
Like the Windows version , Chromium for Linux runs each tab in its own process .
Tab crash detection seems to not be implemented yet as killing a tab process causes the page to just stop responding .
Chromium , even in this early state , feels much faster than Firefox .
I compared the 280 Slides presentation editor running in Firefox 3 and Chromium , and the difference was like night and day .
Chromium scores very well in the SunSpider Javascript benchmark : 4.7 times faster than Firefox 3 , and 2.9 times faster than Firefox 3.1 Beta 3 .
Firefox 3.1 Beta 3 1914.6ms +/- 6.2 % Firefox 3 3082.8ms +/- 0.2 % Midori 0.1.4 1111.4ms +/- 1.2 % Chromium 657.4ms +/- 2.6 %
The Ubuntu Chromium Daily Builds PPA makes installing Chromium in Ubuntu very easy to do .
However , these packages are pre-alpha and completely untested , they may not work for you at all .
Follow the directions on the PPA page to add the software repository .
Install Chromium from the package chromium - browser ( click the link to install ) , or by running the command below in your terminal :
sudo apt - get install chromium - browser
The repository should be updated daily with the latest Chromium code .
I ’ll definitely be following Chromium for Linux ’s development from now on .
Premier Wen Jiabao left no doubt at the Communist Party summit in March that China is irked by Washington 's response to the credit crunch , suspecting that the US is engaging in a stealth default on its debt by driving down the dollar .
" We have lent a massive amount of capital to the United States , and of course we are concerned about the security of our assets .
To speak truthfully , I do indeed have some worries , " he said .
Jasbir discovered the body of her father , Sukhbinder Singh , whose photo is held by her mother
By Suvojit Bagchi
BBC News , Barnala , Punjab
Mandip Kaur , a 29 - year - old housewife from a farming family in southern Punjab , guards her husband round the clock .
" I fear he may commit suicide , " she says in broken Hindi .
Almost every village in Punjab has witnessed a suicide in their once - prosperous farming families and it is a major issue in the general election .
Ms Kaur 's 35 - year - old husband , Lakhbir Singh , a small farmer with a two - acre land holding , is a strong and neatly dressed man .
He shows no sign of irritation or discomfort when we meet him in the village of Boparai Khurd in Barnala , about 500 km ( 300 miles ) north of Delhi .
Each year before the harvest , the small farmers of Punjab , who make up nearly 85 % of the state 's farming community , borrow from local rural moneylenders at exorbitant interest rates to meet production costs , including fertilisers and electricity for irrigation .
Commodity prices are plummeting in the international market ... and farmer suicides may increase in coming months
Bernard D'Mello , deputy editor ,
Economic and Political Weekly " [ Lakhbir ] has a loan of more than 700,000 rupees ( $ 15,000 ) , which he cannot repay , " says Ms Kaur .
Defaulting on payment increases the rates of interest and a farmer is publicly humiliated in the local panchayat ( self - governing rural body ) if he fails to pay up .
" His elder brother , my father , committed suicide more than a year ago , as his loan had accumulated up to $ 20,000 , " says 15 - year - old Jasbir , who discovered her father 's body .
" I do not think I can ever repay the whole amount , " Lakhbir confesses .
The Bhartiya Kisan Union - Ekta , ( BKU - United ) , one of the largest farmers ' unions in Punjab , is urging its members not to vote in the election if they feel that none of the parties is addressing their needs .
' Major issue ' National Crime Records Bureau statistics say close to 200,000 farmers have committed suicide in India since 1997 .
The Punjab government says the state produces nearly two - thirds of the grain in India .
But the state has faced many economic crises since the the mid-1990s .
No comprehensive official figures on farmer suicides in the area are available .
Mandip Kaur fears her husband Lakhbir may commit suicide
But a report commissioned by the government of Punjab this week estimated that there had been " close to 3,000 suicides " among farmers and farm labourers in just two of Punjab 's 20 districts in recent years , agriculture ministry sources told the BBC .
The general secretary of BKU - United , Sukhdev Singh Khokri , says : " The findings of this report will snowball into a major electoral issue . "
Another government report published in 2007 suggested that " about 12 % of marginal and small farmers have left farming " over the past few years .
Among the reasons is the lack of access to credit , a facility denied by banks to farmers with no property .
" Bank loans to small farmers without collateral declined sharply as India introduced neo-liberal policies in the 1990s , " says Bernard D'Mello , deputy editor of Economic and Political Weekly .
Farmers had to approach rural moneylenders who charge exorbitant rates .
Amarjit Singh , another small farmer from Barnala whose father committed suicide a few years back , says : " My father could not read or write , so he could not calculate the amount of loan he had incurred .
" Once it reached a staggering sum , he was publicly threatened by the moneylender and committed suicide .
" If I am asked to pay my father 's debt , I will also have to commit suicide , " says Amarjit , who has also taken on loans to meet rising production costs .
Surplus
The Punjab government 's website proclaims that " India has gone from a food - deficit to a food - surplus country " largely because of the Green Revolution of Punjab .
Union man Sukhdev Singh Khokri says there will be protests
In the 1960s , it revolutionised agricultural production by introducing high - yield varieties of seeds , chemical fertilisers , insecticides and machinery .
But the 2007 report criticises the revolution and its surplus of crops .
Independent researcher and activist Ranjana Padhi says : " Since everyone had money , labourers were replaced by tractors and unemployment increased , while productivity steadily declined . "
As production costs have risen , food prices have slumped .
Traditionally , the government buys grain from farmers and distributes it in the open market .
Sukhpal Singh , a senior economist at Punjab Agricultural University , feels farmers had to bear government prices that were too low and failed to take into account " risk factors like crop failure or soil maintenance " .
Poor prices internationally restricted the government from a higher buying rate for farmers .
Amarjit Singh " will commit suicide " if he has to pay his father 's debts
Another factor is the subsidies in place in areas such as Europe .
German non-governmental organisation Foodwatch says the European subsidies are responsible for large - scale unemployment and poverty among farmers in Africa , Asia and Latin America .
The issue is pending with the World Trade Organisation but talks on the issue have repeatedly failed .
Bernard D'Mello feels the worst is yet to come given the recent recession .
" Commodity prices are plummeting in the international market as a result of recession , which will depress the price in Indian markets as well and farmer suicides may increase in coming months , " he says .
Punjab Agriculture Minister Sucha Singh Langah says the state government has increased farming subsidies to all categories in recent years .
But the Election Commission has put further projects on hold pending the polls .
Meanwhile the farmers ' unions are co-ordinating a joint protest to highlight the plight of farmers .
Amarjit Singh will be one taking part .
" We will stop everything in the state for two days , " he says .

Police are focusing on finding the remains of eight - year - old Victoria " Tori " Stafford now that two suspects have been arrested and charged with the Woodstock , Ont. girl 's murder .
" Our work is far from over , " Ontario Provincial Police Det. Insp. Bill Renton said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon .
" We wo n't stop until we can locate Victoria .
I can't stress the importance and significance of returning her to her loved ones . "
A police helicopter was seen circling the Guelph area .
Police sources told CTV
News they are looking for the child 's body .
Renton did not divulge many details about the developments in the investigation , saying the matter is before the courts .
He would not comment on questions at the news conference regarding possible motives behind the abduction .
However , he confirmed the identities of the two suspects :
Michael Thomas C.S. Rafferty , 28 , has been charged with kidnapping and first - degree murder .
Terri-Lynne McClintic , 18 , is charged with kidnapping and being an accessory after the fact .
They appeared in court Wednesday morning and were both remanded in custody until May 28 .
Renton said he does n't anticipate making any further arrests .
Witnesses say Rafferty was crying during his court appearance .
Victoria 's uncle appeared to approach the suspect after his court appearance but police quickly separated the two men .
Victoria went missing on April 8 and was last seen walking away from her school with an unidentified woman .
A surveillance camera in the area caught the woman and child walking together .
Investigators have previously released a composite sketch of a suspect but despite a number of tips from the public , have failed to locate any trace of the child .
Renton said that the surveillance video was " one piece of evidence that has brought us to where we are . "
The female suspect , who was arrested first on an outstanding warrant , is said to be helping police locate the body .
Renton said McClintic and Victoria 's mother Tara McDonald " are familiar " with each other .
However , he would not say if the suspect ever met Victoria .
Although the suspects know Victoria 's parents , police do n't believe they knew who their daughter was at the time she was kidnapped , sources say .
Facebook
A friend of Rafferty told ctvtoronto.ca she had n't seen or spoken to the suspect for awhile -- but she confirmed that the man lived in Guelph as recently as 2006 .
The woman , who did not want to be identified , said Rafferty last updated his Facebook page on April 8 , the day Victoria went missing .
" At 10:01 a .m. he wrote ' Everything good is coming my way ' , " she said .
The suspect , who grew up in Richmond Hill , Ont. and attended George Brown 's culinary arts program in Toronto , does not list anyone with the last name of Stafford or McClintic on his Facebook friends list .
Craig Racini , whose girlfriend lives next door to the female suspect in Woodstock , said his suspicions were raised after he saw the surveillance video .
He said two women moved next door about two months ago and that one of the women recently cut her hair short .
Racini said that when he asked her why , she said it was because she got bubblegum stuck in her hair .
Racini said " no comment " when he was asked if he called in the tip to police .
He said he does n't know a lot about his neighbours but said that he does n't believe a man lives in the house .
He would n't say exactly what made him suspicious but said that there were " little clues they were giving . "
A woman who lives on Tennyson Street , a few homes away from where Rafferty was arrested , says her son had a scary encounter on the street about two weeks before Victoria went missing .
Her 10 - year - old son told her then that he was approached by two people in a car but ran away before anyone spoke to him .
She said the incident made her pay close attention to Victoria 's case and that she and several other people living on Tennyson had posted pictures of Victoria in the front windows of their home and on the sides of their cars .
' Devastated '
Victoria 's father Rodney Stafford told CTV Toronto he is " devastasted " but he is not going to believe any rumours he hears until he hears it straight from the police .
" I do n't know where to go from here , " he said .
" I 'm waiting to hear from the police .
There 's lots of stuff out there and I can't believe any of it until it comes directly from police . "
Friends and family of the missing child are also said to be gathering at the home of Tara McDonald , the girl 's mother .
Renton said police notified Victoria 's parents Tuesday night about the development .
" Investigators never get used to convey messages like this to loved ones , " he told reporters .
" We all wanted ( her ) home safe and sound . "
Victoria 's aunt Rebecca Stafford said Wednesday on a Facebook group dedicated to finding her niece that she is closing down a portion of the online social networking site to help stop the spread of rumours .
" As we 've all heard , there has been police progress in this investigation .
Since we are not sure of what is happening , out of respect for my family , I have closed down the wall temporarily , " she wrote .
" The rumour mill has already been put into overdrive this morning and we are anxiously awaiting the answers to the same questions you are asking .
" Thank you for understanding my desire to protect my family from further uncertainty , " she added .
" Thank you for all your support during these very trying times . "
Victoria 's legacy
Police said they were saddened by the news , and were hoping for a happy conclusion to the case .
In the 42 days since Victoria has gone missing , police received thousands of tips and leads , said Oxford Community Police Chief Ron Fraser .
He defended the Oxford police , who headed the case before the OPP took over , saying that officers made the case a priority from the very beginning .
Oxford police have been criticized for not issuing an amber alert and calling the investigation a " missing person 's case " as opposed to an abduction .
But Fraser said police acted quickly and notified the public almost immediately .
Fraser called the police investigation " exhaustive " but said there are still many questions .
" We 're left with hundreds of questions that will hopefully be answered in a court of law , " he said at the news conference .
He said that Victoria 's legacy is now a cautionary tale to parents everywhere .
" Because of Victoria Stafford , every child in this city and across the country will be a little safer because of the heightened awareness to protect our children , " he said .
Coming out of Starbucks , minding her own business , Janeane Garafalo was ambushed with with questions about her comments regarding the Tea Party protesters being “ racist rednecks . ”
She handled herself well and turned the table by pointing out some of the offensive signs and asking , several times , “ Why were they not protesting for the last eight years under the Bush spending ? ”
Might I also point out the irony that it was Greta Van Susteren who aired the video .
That ’s right , Van Susteren , who recently denounced ambush journalism when she was watching over Todd Palin at the White House Correspondents Dinner .

The brazen hijacking of merchant ships and yachts by Somali pirates has forced the world to take notice of a country that ’s been in a violent downward spiral for decades .
Is there any hope for Somalia ?
What is the situation in Somalia ?
It ’s chaos .
Somalia , in fact , is only nominally a nation .
Some 1.3 million of Somalia ’s 9 million citizens are “ internally displaced , ” living in squalid refugee camps or roaming the country , homeless , searching for food .
About 3.2 million Somalis now depend on food rations , fewer than a quarter of its children go to school , and its maternal mortality and illiteracy rates are among the highest in the world .
Warlords and armed gangs control much of the country .
Since neighboring Ethiopia invaded Somalia in 2006 , at least 10,000 innocent civilians have been killed .
“ Somalia is the longest - running instance of complete state collapse in the post - colonial era , ” says Somalia expert Prof.
Ken Menkhaus of North Carolina ’s Davidson College .
Why is it in such a shambles ?
The former British colony in the Horn of Africa has not had a functional government since 1991 .
Two regions in the north , Somaliland and Puntland , have broken away and operate independently , while rival warlords and Islamist factions rule the rest .
The Somali government that ’s officially recognized by the international community , the Transitional National Government , until recently operated in exile because of the violence .
The U.S. supported Ethiopia ’s 2006 incursion , which was designed to oust the Islamic Courts Union , the Islamist coalition that had taken over much of the country .
During its six - month reign , the authoritarian Islamic Courts actually brought more stability to Somalia than it had known for years ; many Somalis had welcomed it , just as war - weary Afghans embraced the Taliban in the 1990s .
But the U.S. said the Islamists had links to al Qaida and were harboring terrorists responsible for the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that left 224 dead .
How did the Ethiopian invasion go ?
The incursion touched off a guerilla war that killed thousands and drove nearly 1 million people out of Mogadishu , the capital .
Amnesty International last year charged Ethiopian forces with a litany of human - rights abuses , including gang rapes , throat - slitting , and eye - gouging — a reign of terror that pushed more Somalis into the Islamist camp .
In January , Ethiopia withdrew its troops , having utterly failed in its mission to buttress the transitional government .
Many Somalis cheered Ethiopia ’s retreat , but the country was left with yet another power vacuum .
Who has filled that vacuum ?
Some of the same Islamists who were ousted by the Ethiopians .
In fact , the man who once led the Islamic Courts Union , Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , is now the leader of the U.N. - backed transitional government .
He may be the West ’s best hope for taming a growing militant Islamic insurgency — which gained traction during the Ethiopian occupation .
A radical offshoot of the Islamic Courts called al - Shabab ( “ the Youth ” ) is now deemed a major terrorist threat by the U.S. , which says Somalia has been attracting a growing number of jihadists from other places .
Al - Shabab is considered ruthless even by Islamic terrorist standards .
Late last year , the group kidnapped a suspected spy and slowly sawed off his head with a dull knife , videotaping the entire episode .
How do pirates fit into this mess ?
The chaos and lawlessness on the waters off Somalia are an extension of the conditions on land .
Amid the deprivation and turmoil , piracy is an appealing option for Somalia ’s desperately poor fishermen and farmers .
Pirate attacks have tripled over the past three years , to an average of more than three a week .
The pirates target anything that floats , from private luxury yachts to freighters , and hold crews and cargo ransom .
An estimated $ 100 million was paid in ransoms in 2008 .
“ All you need is three guys and a little boat , and the next day you ’re millionaires , ” says Abdullahi Omar Qawden , a former captain in Somalia ’s long defunct navy .
After the attack last month on an American ship that ended with a dramatic Navy rescue of the captain , the U.S. and other nations stepped up their patrols of the vast shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden .
Even so , since that incident pirates have seized several more ships with dozens of hostages .
Are the pirates allied with Islamic extremists ?
Not actively .
They appear to have no agenda other than making money .
But the pirates do pay a share of what they make to Islamic forces that control some of the coastal havens from which they operate .
“ Government officials , warlords , and Islamists are all getting their share , ” says Andrew Mwangura of the Seafarers Assistance Program , a shipping trade group .
Most international observers say that if Somalia is going to be saved , the solution is going to have to come from Somalis , perhaps in the form of a Sunni Awakening ­ –type movement led by more moderate elements .
Past efforts at international intervention have failed , from U.N. peacekeeping missions to the American assault on a Mogadishu warlord in 1993 , made famous in Black Hawk Down .
Until some effective central government emerges , Somalia will remain a land of desperate poverty , violence , and a Darwinian struggle for survival .
“ We need doctors .
We need food .
We need shelter , ” says refugee camp doctor Hawa Abdi .
“ But for that , we need peace . ”
Somalia ’s ruling class
Thanks to the thriving piracy trade , all along Somalia ’s craggy coast once - quiet fishing villages are being transformed into Mafia - style dens of greed and vice .
In the new social pecking order , the pirates are on top .
Flush with cash , they are building palatial homes next to tin-roof shanties , drive the biggest cars , and , in a polygamous culture , claim the most wives .
The village of Eyl is now lined with new buildings and filled with Land Cruisers , laptops , and global positioning devices .
An entire industry has grown up around the pirates , with restaurants to feed the kidnapped crews who , as potential trading assets , must be cared for .
Prostitution is also thriving .
In the tiny coastal village of Hobyo , all but four of the town ’s 80 fishing boats are now being used for hijacking .
“ When I see the men sharing the money , I feel envy , ” says 11 - year - old Hassan Ali , as he plays in the water near a hijacked Greek chemical tanker .
“ I pray that piracy will not end before I become a man . ”
The Netanyahu government has yet to make clear how it will negotiate Israel has told the European Union to stop criticising Benjamin Netanyahu 's government or risk being excluded from future Middle East peace negotiations .
A foreign ministry official called EU envoys in Israel after a commissioner in Brussels suggested freezing a move to upgrade EU - Israeli relations .
The commissioner said Netanyahu should commit to talks with the Palestinians .
The warning comes ahead of the first European trip by Avigdor Lieberman , Israel 's new foreign minister .
Israeli media say the warnings have been issued by the deputy director for European affairs at the Israeli foreign ministry , Rafi Barak .
His main target the EU External Affairs Commissioner Benita Ferrero - Waldner .
If these declarations continue , Europe will not be able to be part of the diplomatic process
Rafi Barak
Is Israel heading for clash with US ?
The UK embassy in Tel Aviv has confirmed it was contacted by Mr Barak but refused to disclose details of the conversation .
" We want the European Union to be a partner but it is important to hold a mature and discreet dialogue and not to resort to public declarations , " Rafi Barak reportedly told diplomats , according to a report in Haaretz .
He concluded by " warning " that Europe 's influence in the area would be undermined .
" Israel is asking Europe to lower the tone and conduct a discreet dialogue , " Rafi Barak is quoted saying .
" However , if these declarations continue , Europe will not be able to be part of the diplomatic process , and both sides will lose . "
Correspondents say it is far from clear whether Ms Ferrero - Waldner was expressing an official view of the European Union towards Israel .
Israeli officials have told the BBC that they requested a month - long postponement of a ministerial - level meeting in May which discusses the EU - Israeli Association agreement regulating bilateral ties .
The postponement " is to allow the new government time to formulate its policies " before the meeting , foreign ministry officials said .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far refused to back the principle of a Palestinian state while Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has said the Israeli - Palestinian peace process is a " dead end " .

Wolfram|Alpha officially launched Monday – and by the looks of it , the computational engine is the nerdy kid the other kids only talk to when they need help with a physics exam , not a rival to the cool , well - rounded brainiac Google .
Take a look at the top 100 rising searches on Google via Google Trends .
Here 's a sample from Monday : ethan zohn , Swizz Beatz , cif southern section , eyebrow muscle , embarrassing family photos , whole body imaging , bachelorette , dachshund , west virginia governor , csk vs kkr , and heteropaternal superfecundation .
Wolfram|Alpha does n't do a single one of those better than Google does .
In fact , there 's not one on the top 100 it does better than Google .
Granted this is a skewed sample of pop culture - driven searches , but as a search engine you have to at least try .
The best one can say about Wolfram| Alpha in these results is the unintended humor in Wolfram 's suggestion that " sausage hound " is a narrower term than dachshund .
Moreover , when Wolfram fails , it fails ungracefully .
Why did n't Wolfram contract with a search engine , say Yahoo or Dogpile or Altavista to take over the query when its computational engine fails ?
Instead , if Wolfram can't computer your query , it leaves you with a blank page .
That 's like talking to a robot that understands a few verbal commands .
That 's fun for a couple of minutes at a technology expo , but not something you want to do every day .
Perhaps a better model is for Wolfram to notice what searches work , publish them as static pages for Google to search and throw some display ads on the page .
That way , if someone does want to know the mass of a proton divided by an electron , then Wolfram| Alpha 's answer will be the top result in Google for that query .
The technology is quite nice , but Wolfram| Alpha 's ability to crunch data and compile answers to a very narrow set of questions is a feature of a search engine – not a whole one to itself .
Microsoft or Yahoo or Google will probably buy it at some point , and find a way to integrate it into more traditional search results .
In the meantime , if you want to see search results that are often better for popular queries look to Kosmix , which is spending more time figuring out how to present information , than how to solve physics equations .
There 's going to be a lot more money and friends in the former .

There is no limit to the brazenness of the elite !
There are now AAA rated bonds based on poor people receiving vaccinations !
That ’s right .
Interest payments on these “ Vaccine Bonds ” are guaranteed by France , Italy , Norway , South Africa , Spain , Sweden and Britain .
Who buys these bonds ?
The International Finance Facility for Immunisation says the following about the initial offering in 2006 :
The bonds were priced comparably to other sovereign / supranational issuers and were bought by a broad range of investors – both geographically and by investor type – including several central banks , pension funds , fund managers , and insurance companies .
Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs lead - managed this inaugural bond issue .
Individuals who have supported the IFFIm initiative include His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI ; Her Majesty Queen Rania Al - Abdullah of Jordan ; Cardinal Renato Raffaele Martino ; Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams ; Chief Rabbi , Dr Jonathan Sacks ; Iqbal Khan of the Muslim Council of Britain ; Ramesh Khalidi of the Hindu Forum ; Indrajit Singh OBE of the Sikh Council of Britain as well as Bono and Bob Geldof .
I could n’t make it up if I tried .
There have also been retail offerings of the “ Vaccine Bonds ” in Japan in 2008 and 2009 .
There are a number of documents on the web site .
I ’m going to need to take some time to look through this .

SAS SSD market size - as interpreted by Micron Editor :- September 3 , 2015 - If you 're interested in the possible size and direction of the SAS SSD market - here 's some data supplied to me today by Micron .
This was in response to some questions I asked yesterday about a growth figure " 59 % " which they had quoted in a press release ( in August ) about their first new SAS SSDs developed as part of their collaboration agreement with Seagate .
SAS SSD market - a view based on Micron 's marketing assessments of various data sources revised in August 2015 Metric 2015 2019 CAGR Revenue ( $ M ) 1,973 3,730 17 % Gigabytes ( M ) 1,828 11,700 59 % Units ( M ) 2.4 5.1 21 % Memory companies like Micron create , suck in and analyze thousands of analyst hours of raw and structured statistics about components and drives .
And although - just as for anyone else - the fine details of such projections and interpretations can turn out to be wrong - it 's nevertheless very helpful to understand some of the publicly viewable raw data which drives the thinking behind related product plans .
.
.
.
.
how fast can your SSD run backwards ?
SSDs are complex devices and there 's a lot of mysterious behavior which is n't fully revealed by benchmarks , datasheets and whitepapers .
Underlying all the important aspects of SSD behavior are asymmetries which arise from the intrinsic technologies and architecture inside the SSD .
Which symmetries are most important in an SSD ?
That depends on your application .

Today - if you 're in a big company in a traditional market - and hoping to do something equally big in the SSD market - then $ 1 billion may not be enough - but $ 5 billion may be too much .

Although 3.5 inch form factor SSDs are a niche market today - historically this form factor revealed a lot about the different types of application for high performance storage drives in legacy servers .

$ / TBW sounds initially like a plausible SSD cost evaluation metric - but it breaks down at the boundary analysis where it hits RAM SSDs - at which point it can give you the wrong answer .
There are many other misleading metrics like this in the SSD cost evaluation literature .
And you'd be surprised how many of them originate from leading SSD companies .
Clarifying SSD
Pricing - where does all the money go ?

Going back to where I started with FITs at the SSD component level versus fault tolerance at the SSD system level .

I read with mounting horror Aaron ’s post about the Ruby conference , and the various things that he linked to from it .
Unfortunately , it ’s an old and familiar story .
Unfortunately , it reminds me of attitudes in another community I used to be very involved in – Perl .
Attitudes within
Perl seem to have changed an awful lot in the last 10 years .
I ’m sure a lot of that had to do with the discovery that Allison Randall was smarter than any half - dozen of the rest of us put together .
But , too , it had a lot to do with the examples of folks like Larry Wall and Casey West , who demonstrated by their actions that it was possible to be brilliant , but still be professional .
This is a message that many boys ( I hesitate to call them men ) within the Ruby community have n’t grasped yet .
Having been involved in the planning of ApacheCon for the last seven years , I ’m also horrified that the planning committee for a ( seemingly ) respectable conference would accept a talk that made no secret of the fact that it would use jokes about pornography to make its points .
I ’ve written before about how pornography is treated as acceptable for public discourse .
That was 6 years ago .
At least in the technical circles * I* work in , this attitude has lessened , but not vanished , in that time .
It is far less common for me to hear reference to porn in every day technical discussion than it was back then .
I do n’t assume that the people in question believe , as I do , that pornography itself is damaging .
I think it has more to do with the realization that some discussions simply do n’t belong in professional settings .
When someone spends good money to travel and attend your conference , they deserve to be treated with professionalism and respect , not treated to a stream of pornographic images and sexual innuendoes .
And this is n’t just about alienating the women in your audience .
Turns out that some heterosexual men actually believe that objectifying women is n’t a good thing .
But even if you do n’t accept that belief , you owe it to your audience to treat them with professional courtesy , and recognize that they are paying a LOT of money to attend a technical conference , not a peep show .
Shame on Matt for putting together this presentation .
Double shame on GoGaRuCo for accepting this talk .
Shame on the decent men in the audience ( assuming there were any ) who did n’t get up and walk out after the first slide .
Shame on the chauvinistic boors who are defending Matt in the various forums where this is being discussed .
Turns out , in the real world , it actually matters if you ’re a jerk .
It ’s time for the Ruby On Rails community to grow up and realize that being professional is n’t a weakness .
But it would be grossly short - sighted to merely point the finger at them and not take a close look at the attitudes within our own communities – be they technical or otherwise – and seriously reconsider our common courtesy in the work place .
Kid 's teacher have DWI ?
Texas law may keep it a secret Bill would seal school workers ’ criminal records
If a bill before the Texas House on Thursday passes , you will never be able to find out from your school district .
The legislation , pushed by the Association of Texas Professional Educators and other educator groups , is being sold as a means of protecting teachers from identity theft and to ensure their privacy .
But the measure is being fought by Texas newspapers and broadcasters because it would specifically exempt a public school employee ’s criminal history from being disclosed .
The bill also would make secret a school employee ’s birth date , making it almost impossible to positively identify an individual against a check of criminal court records or the state ’s sex offender database .
Jennifer Canaday , a lobbyist for the Association of Texas Professional Educators , said teachers have a right to worry about release of the information districts collect under a new state fingerprinting law because the criminal history information is based on a national crime database .
Sometimes the information is wrong , she said .
In other instances , she said , the database also includes the names of people who were acquitted at trial or saw charges against them dropped .
“ Most people would treat everybody on that list as a criminal , and that would be really unfair , ” Canaday said .
It was never the intent of the Legislature in 2007 that the information gathered by fingerprinting would be used by anyone other than school district personnel and the State Board of Educator Certification , she added .
Ken Whalen , executive vice president of the Texas Daily Newspaper Association , said date of birth is important for citizens and journalists who want to compare the names of employees against other lists and verify identification .
The Dallas Morning News last year reported that the fingerprint checks had found more than 5,000 public school employees in Texas with criminal backgrounds — about 4,300 misdemeanors and more than 900 felonies .
Whalen said there is no known instance of someone having their identity stolen as a result of a Public Information Act request .
The battle over release of this information began last year when the Austin district reported that the new fingerprint checks had found 310 employees with criminal histories .
The district fought public information requests from Austin reporters .
Attorney General Greg Abbott ’s office ruled that information on individuals was not public because the criminal background checks had been done using a federal crime computer exempt from disclosure .

People really love Tetris , and I am not kidding , people really ca n’t get over that classic game , and the colorful bricks keep popping up in so many different forms , including actual home furniture design concepts or Tetris plates .
Artists Diego Silvério and Helder Filipov have created a beautiful furniture design that uses the Tetris bricks we have all known to both love and hate .
This cool concept is actually pretty practical if you take a minute ; it utilizes the different shapes in order to provide great storage space in an efficient and colorful way .
The different bricks combined show many different options and ways for gamers to also have a great looking room and profess their utmost love for the original Tetris game .
Even though you are a gaming geek , it does n’t mean you have to leave in a complete mess and not have some modern design furniture .
Thanks so much for the images and heads up Diego Silvério , these are absolutely beautiful !

DOSE :
3 hits smoked Cannabis ( plant material )
BODY WEIGHT : 120 lb
Hello , my name is Daniel , and I would like to tell you about my first experience with the recreational drug Marijuana .
Im now writing this after having smoked Marijuana about six times , spaced over three or four weeks .
I wanted to talk about the first experience in particular because of its effects on me , and how it changed my views on reality and this experience we go through known as life .
As well as perhaps a reference for the Marijuana experience .
First , let me tell you a little about myself , where I am , and the settings I was in , and general settings I m in now , so let me just give you a little summery .
Im fifteen years of age ( nearly sixteen ) , and live in the United States , where I attend school ( my first Marijuana experience was during the summer , no school ) .
Ive meditated on and off throughout my life , and have studied Philosophy , Computer Sciences ( Game Design , Programming , Web Design , Hardware , so on ) , Physics , and other topics that have sparked my interest .
My sister teaches English , and my brother works various jobs , and aspires to be a Biochemical Engineer .
Hes ten years older than I , and the one who exposed me to Marijuana .
My Grandmothers house , where my experience took place , is only a short walking distance away .
My brother has a room upstairs where we partake of the drug .
My brother Gabe is a very nice , clean cut guy , a typical college kid , and probably one of the best people Ive ever had the fortune to know .
Hes been through quite a few dramatic situations , leaving him to be the person he is today .
He uses logic for everything he does , from deciding a major for college , to what kind of television show he wants to watch when relaxing , to pissing the right way , and while nobody is perfect , he certainly tries his best .
An open mind and logic probably describes him well , even if I disagree with some of his assumptions and opinions .
Now that Ive given you a little information of my surroundings , lets get to the actual experience .
It was late one day when I decided Id go up to my Grandmothers house to hang out with my brother upstairs in his room for awhile .
I crept my way up the carpeted stairs on my bare feet , opened the door , and turned to my right into his door - less room which had the scent of incense .
He was listening to music quite loudly on his computer as he browsed the Internet , two speakers with a subwoofer for thump and for quality pounded my ears .
He turned it down slightly , turned his rolling computer chair to me and we spoke for awhile , talking of current events , things happening to us as of late , the usual bullshit you encounter when talking to a friend or brother or whomever .
Our conversations are a little more dark , though .
We talk of organized religion at times , politics , science , interesting stuff , not usually he said that she said that he said bullshit .
He told me he was going to poke some smot , and pulled out his bong from behind the computer .
He smoked Marijuana quite often ( well , once every couple days , if he had some ) , and every couple times I was up there he would have some Cannabis to enjoy , hed smoke it , and I never participated .
We joked about how hed get me high , and for a first - timer , wed use ice in the bong to cool it off .
Gabe decided that hed do that anyway , went to the bathroom , dumped the water out of his Styrofoam cup , and put the ice in the bong .
I made a remark which I dont recall , sparked his thinking that I wanted to try it , and asked me if I wanted to .
For the first time since I saw him and other relatives I knew smoke years ago , I gave an answer to that question I never have before .
I said yes .
The second I did , I knew I was going to be experiencing something amazing , and my Adrenal Glands did , too .
My heart pumped , and my fingers shook .
He put the bong on the computer table and loaded a full bowl into it .
He put the lighter to it , flicked it on , and the embers from the Marijuana burned .
He sucked into the bong as it filled with smoke , pulled out the bowl , and inhaled the smoke that gathered in the bowl .
To a first - timer whod never seen this in detail , this contraption looked scary .
I got the basic principle behind it , though .
He handed me the bong .
I put the lighter up to the bowl , tried to light it , and didnt hit the bowl .
My fingers were shaking to damn badly !
He laughed and said  You want me to light it ?  embarrassed , I nodded for him to .
I put my lips inside the main tube , and pressed hard so the tube secured around my mouth , he fired up the lighter , put it into the Marijuana , and told me to suck in .
I sucked in , smoke filled the chamber , he told me quickly to pull out the bowl and suck in .
I pulled it out , and sucked in with the rest of the lung power I had left .
I had made it through the worst part .
The smoke filled my lungs , and it felt great , the familiar oxygen gas that normally filled my lungs was replaced by a thicker batter , swirling around inside my lungs .
I let the smoke go from my nostrils and partly my mouth .
My brother worked on his second hit at the time this was going on .
A feeling of pride overcame me .
Ive seen people cough when smoking , I didnt cough at all , it felt fine .
All the others are pussies I thought .
He handed me the bong again , and said hold it in after inhaling this time , better effect .
I took his advice .
He told me it was already going , so I put it to my mouth , sucked in , the chamber filled with smoke , I pulled out the bowl , and sucked in again .
The smoke filled my lungs .
I held it for the longest time ( long for me ) , it was a big hit .
I felt a burning sensation in my lungs , forcing me to exhale , along with a hardy cough lasting several times .
 Damn it  I thought ,  Im not a badass after all , now I know why people cough .
Gabe finished his hit , and handed it to me again .
Still with some burning in my lungs from the second hit , I decided Id do it again .
Put my mouth to the bong , took the hit , held it , and blew out .
Even more violent coughing this time .
Gabe took a hit , and signaled the bong to me for another hit , and I declined with na , I m good .
He smiled , turned his head away from me put his hand to his mouth like he was whispering something to someone , and whispered pussy , still smiling .
I put my hand up to my mouth in the same gesture , and said fuck that guy .
He laughed , as did I .
Itd been about two and a half minutes since we first hit the bong , perhaps a little longer .
I asked him how long it would take for me to feel the effects , he replied it should take about five minutes or so for you to start feeling it , and with that continued browsing the Internet .
I sat on his bed , occasionally getting up and walking around looking at his room to kill time .
Another minute passed , then another .
That s when it hit me like a bullet .
My vision , it was my vision first .
Id move my eyes , look around at different places , the wall , the bed , Gabe looking at his computer , didnt matter what I looked at .
Every time I d move my eyes , it lagged .
Like watching frames of a movie slowly , like flipping through a slideshow .
This was amazing , my vision had changed , and my brain was interpreting movement of my eyes differently .
Id look at the dresser , or the cushy chair , regardless , it looked amazing .
I also felt as if I was out of my body looking at these things , still in my body , but with such emphasis on my vision , the other senses didnt seem as strong , giving the feeling of being out of my body .
Not literally , but you get the picture .
Things warped and changed dimension .
Thats when the most amazing , and , for lack of a better word , holy experience Ive ever felt happened .
I started feeling like I was being tickled very lightly all over my body .
From head to tow , a tingling .
This evolved from the slight tingling to slight pressure .
It felt as if thousands of fingers were pushing on every fabric of my body .
Arms , head , stomach , and the lower extremities ( legs yes , I speak of legs ) .
This felt amazing , so amazing I couldnt help but giggle .
Minor giggling , not just out of the blue , but meaningful giggling from the feeling of tiny fingers poking me over my body .
But even that didnt last long .
It evolved once more .
Now electricity flowed through me .
It was slow at first , still slight fingers poking , then more and more , it felt like electricity running through my body in rings .
And I dont mean zapping every part of me at the same time .
It started at my stomach , and rings of current zipped outward through my arms , legs , and so on , in sync with each other .
Slowly , zap , a ring of current ran down my arms legs , et cetera , zap , another one , and then faster , and faster , rings of current ran down my extremities as fast as you can blink , until it became one continuous current zapping my body .
I could even hear it !
I had to sit down , so I went to the bed for a nice sit .
This was too much to bear , I broke out laughing hysterically , and nearly choking at times I d laugh so hard .
I really have to give my regards to this part of the experience , it was such an amazing feeling that I have tried , and probably failed , to accurately describe in words , if I believed in God , this would be like him making your body his house .
My brother was smiling , I couldnt tell if it was from the weed , or from him seeing his little brother stoned .
Im assuming a bit of both .
He smiled a big wide smile and said ,  If you think this is funny , wait until you hear this !
He turned on some Bill Hicks , which I could barely hear from the electricity sounds I heard as the current charged me while I laughed .
Bill ranted and raved as the crowd laughed and cheered , and I didnt care .
I could barely hear it anyway .
Maybe Gabe thought I was laughing even harder when he turned Bill on , or maybe he knew I didnt hear it at all from being so stoned .
Whatever he thought , I didnt hear it , and I was too busy with the electricity tickling me .
After awhile , I m guessing five minutes , maybe ten , it subsided a little bit .
I felt around with my hands , the motion was delayed !
It was more choppy  than delayed .
Like watching a strobe light , you see someone walking , instead of a stream of movement , you see them in one place , then two feet further , then two feet further .
Like that , it was delayed slightly , and felt choppy  as I described , as well as blocky .
It was a very amazing thing to feel , and being so , I couldnt stop moving around to feel the motion .
Id slide out of my new cushy fold - up chair on the floor , and feel the odd motion , and do it again while rubbing my hands on my pants , or doing the hand washing motions .
Gabe decided we should so something , and we agreed on a movie .
The conversation we had was interesting , instead of remembering it fully it echoed in my head , and distorted itself , sometimes forgetting what I said , but never what he said .
It was time we went down stairs .
So we went down the carpeted stairs , delayed chunky motion making it feel amazing , and I plopped on the couch .
He put in Underworld Two , a movie we rented earlier , and we started watching it on his home entertainment center .
The sound was amazing , it felt like it had depth , that it was there in the room with me , surrounding me , and was real .
Granted , surround sound never sounds crappy , but this experience made it that much better .
I was so busy with the delayed motion , electricity , echoing sounds in my head from us talking , or sitting a glass down or whatever , and stop motion vision made me very unable to focus on the movie , I couldnt have cared less about it , I was having fun in this experience , far too much to care about a movie .
But for the sake of experimentation , I decided to see if I could focus on it , and I could , with added intensity , too .
I felt like I was there in the movie , getting thrown around by the Werewolves without the harmful pain associated with it .
I also found out I could come down from the high , and return to the normal world at any time .
But I decided not to , to experience the amazing things I was at the time .
I closed my eyes , laid back on my couch , and snoozed for a moment , thinking .
Shapes and images were very clear and easy to see in my mind at this point .
The shapes and images I experienced were n't unlike what you 'd see at night when you look into the darkness and see a neon lights , same idea here , but very vivid and crisp .
These shapes were actually ' there ' , it was n't just me reflecting upon them and imagining what they 'd look like , it was as if they were floating under my eyelids .
I have studied Sacred Geometry , and being so , many of the memories of such shapes appeared , as well as geometrical patterns I 've never encountered before .
Imagining things took much less effort , as detail seemed to fill in naturally , and any images I might remember , something I stared at and kept in my mind through my life , so on , were very vivid .
In typical memories ( at least for me ) , images are fuzzy , and missing detail , shirts will only have color , no words or details unless I remember the specific details of the occasion .
But in this experience , it was more like seeing the actual thing , whether I actually remembered the detail , or it was just my mind ' filling ' it in , the detail was there .
I swished my head back and fourth on a pillow on the couch , and with the motion delay , it felt like wet sand rubbing against my head , with crashing wave sounds .
After focusing , I could feel I was just slowly moving my head back and fourth , and the crunching sound of my hair against the pillow case was causing the sound effects .
I easily went into the sand and wave swishing again , and stayed there for awhile .
The motion made me feel as if I were waking up , from this reality , and entering a new one , like I was sleeping in this dream , and was waking up from it into the world , and Marijuana was the key to doing it .
Have you ever been in a dream and could feel yourself moving in the real world in your bed ?
It was like that , but waking from the reality were in here and now to a new one .
I contemplated a great many things during this time and easily so , being that time seemed to slow down .
No matter what I did , everything moved slowly .
I decided since I was so weary at the time that I d go home .
I said my goodbyes to Gabe , put my broken sandals on , and started the journey home .
To tell you the truth , the idea of walking home in the dark in a somewhat woody area was much scarier than actually doing it .
I was wondering if being stoned would make me hallucinate , it didnt .
The shadows seemed to flow more wildly , and it felt very mystical , but nothing more .
The entire three - hundred foot journey wasnt anything special .
I went inside , shut the door , and walked to my room without a seconds notice .
It was late , I was tired , and even though I wanted to stay up , I decided not to , sleep was more important .
And Id probably be able to experience this amazing occurrence again .
So I fell asleep with this knowledge .
I fell asleep surprisingly easy , perhaps from being so relaxed .
Getting poked by millions of fingers simultaneously can do that to you .
My dreams were very vivid and wild compared to the normal .
And were for days after that .
I woke up the next morning , and felt a little unfocused throughout the day , kind of the aftereffects of smoking Marijuana I assume .
It wasnt something I could pinpoint , it was something very faint , but I was still a little fuzzy from the previous night .
I did my stuff , the day passed like any other , I went to bed again .
When I woke up the next day I felt refreshed and completely back down to the normal .
New things happen every time I smoke Marijuana , and the stronger the dose , the more interesting it is .
On the highest dose I took , everything turned into 2D objects .
People turned into puppets , everything else props with strings attached .
I might perhaps write about them sometime .
But for now , this is the report of my first experience on Marijuana .
I hope Ive given you an idea of my amazing experience , and even though words are more inert than actually experiencing it for yourself , I hope Ive conveyed the bulk of what happened for you .
All in all , this was an amazing experience for me , and something I think everyone should try at least once .
It s changed the way I look at things forever , and shows that your perception is nt the only way to see through the looking glass .
I hope Ive given you some information , or perhaps just a good time with this story of my first experience .
But anyway , thanks for reading , and may your experiences in life be as incredible as mine have been .
( Editors note : For the opposing argument on Twitter quitters , take a look at Twitter Quitters Just Do n't Get It . )
A study by Nielsen Online states that more than 60 percent of new Twitter users give up on the service a month after signing up .
This does n't surprise me .
The more I use Twitter , the more I realize it is n't for everyone .
Why ?
Because most people really do n't care what you 're doing .
And you do n't care what they 're doing , either .
Twitter has gotten oodles of media attention lately , and I 'm guessing that many users are signing up just to see what the ruckus is about .
If Oprah and Ashton Kutcher use Twitter , it must be worth checking out , right ?
But once the newbies spend a few days telling the world what they 're doing in 140 - character bursts -- or reading mind - numbing " I 'm - at - the - market " updates from friends and family -- the novelty wears off in a hurry .
I signed up a few weeks ago , and so far my reactions are mixed .
I 've been following an eclectic mix of people and publications , including colleagues , friends , magazines , and even a few celebrities .
I 've discovered that Twitter is a good way to learn about new things , such as interesting articles and potential story topics .
On the down side , I 'm getting links to more articles than I could ever read .
It 's another case of information overload .
( Could it be that I just do n't get it ?
My colleague Robert Strohmeyer thinks so . )
Celebrity tweets ?
I 've learned the movie director Kevin Smith had sex with his wife last weekend , that Kim Kardashian ( why is she famous again ? ) has launched a lookalike contest , and that Jack Dorsey , the guy who invented Twitter , travels a lot .
I 'm really jealous about that last one .
But after browsing these hourly updates from the rich and famous , I 've found that I really do n't care what they 're doing .
Even if I enjoy their work ( e.g. Kevin Smith ) , I neither want nor need to know the minutiae of their daily lives .
Friends ?
A similar story .
One female friend of mine posted a series of updates about her menstrual cycles .
" Aunt Flow has arrived , " one read .
The others were more graphic .
If there 's such a thing as sharing too much information , that was it .
Yes , I know that all I have to do is remove the annoying , narcissistic , and dull from the list of people I follow .
And I 've done a little of that .
I 'm not trying to trash Twitter , which I think is valuable social networking tool for personal and professional use .
But I get why Twitter 's retention rate is below 40 percent , while Facebook and MySpace have retention rates near 70 percent , according to Nielsen .
Twitter , by design , lacks the depth and features of other social networking sites .
It looks like many users are n't finding a valid reason to stick around .
And it 's nice to know that those whose lives are as boring as mine see the benefits of using Twitter to keep in touch with clients .

If that example of hiring practice was followed by American companies throughout the United States , perhaps ex-convicts nationwide would have an easier way of becoming productive members of society and perhaps we would see a lower recidivism rate .
That , however , is a story for another day .
On Wednesday , however , former George W. Bush White House aide Felipe Sixto was sentenced to 2 1/ 2 years in prison for stealing nearly $ 600,000 from a U.S. Government funded organization .
The Center for a Free Cuba describes itself as " an independent , nonpartisan institution dedicated to promoting human rights and a transition to democracy and the rule of law " in Cuba .
The U.S. Agency for International Development regularly provides the center funds for travel , rent and equipment such as computer laptops and shortwave radios .
Felipe Sixto pleaded guilty December 19 to theft and acknowledged that he overcharged the organization more than $ 579,000 when purchasing radios and flashlights with federal funds .
Sixto had asked for home confinement or probation , however , U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton sentenced him to 30 months in prison , three years supervised release and fined him $ 10,000 .
Judge Walton compared Sixto to Bernie Madoff , who recently pleaded guilty to ripping off thousands of investors of billions of dollars stating , " The mentality that brings you before this court is the same .

On October 27 , 2006 , he was sentenced to 18 months in prison .
He is currently appealing the ruling .-
The former comptroller and funding officer for the now defunct Coalition Provisional Authority , pleaded guilty to conspiracy , bribery , conspiracy to commit money laundering , possession of a machine gun , and being a felon in possession of a fire arm .
On January 30 , 2007 Stein was sentenced to nine years in prison and ordered to forfeit $ 3.6 million .
There are a plethora of other Bush / Cheney government representatives that are currently being investigated and could face criminal charges and even more who have been sentenced to no jail time .
The Bush administration also hired many people to work for their government who were already convicted of crimes .
If that example of hiring practice was followed by American companies throughout the United States , perhaps ex-convicts nationwide would have an easier way of becoming productive members of society and perhaps we would see a lower recidivism rate .
That , however , is a story for another day .

7 Year - Old Discovers Racist Couch
Furniture shopping : Everyone ’s done it … a sturdy new coffee table , a firm yet all encompassing easy chair for the TV room – or a full - size , extra cozy couch the whole family can enjoy .
Canadian couple Doris Moore and her husband Douglas decided to make such a purchase – and chose a lovely , brand - new , brown leather set : Couch , loveseat and chair …
What they did not purchase was the particular shade of brown they got .
The tags , boldly appearing on each piece , told the Moores in no uncertain terms that the color of their comfy new set was actually “ Nigger - brown . ”
Enough to shock even the staunchest bigot where they stand … but that was n’t the worst part – it was their 7 year old daughter who discovered the flagrantly fiendish flub .
Curiously poking around just after the delivery men left , little Olivia asked mommy what the word meant .
Ms. Moore then got on the phone and began a journey find who was responsible for the insulting label .
A Chinese software company called Kingsoft Corp. acknowledged that the issue was created by a translator program it had written – one that would make the English speaking world understand what they were printing on their furniture ’s labels .
Kingsoft apologized and indicated the “ N ” word was simply misspelled .
It was supposed to be “ Niger ” coined after the river of the same name – which is dark brown in color .
The Moore ’s however , are n’t satisfied .
They retained counsel and are looking for more than just a simple apology .
“ Something more has to be done .
We do n’t just need a personal apology , but someone needs to own up to where these labels were made , and someone needs to apologize to all people of color , ” Moore said .
“ I had friends over from St. Lucia yesterday and they would n’t sit on the couch . ”

The Cycle for Health logo , via the Buckminster Fuller Challenge Web site .
Yesterday , The City Fix wrote about the winners of the 2009 Buckminster Fuller Challenge , a design competition to “ support the development and implementation of a strategy that has significant potential to solve humanity ’s most pressing problems . ”
At The City Fix , we were interested in sustainable transport ideas , so it was nice to hear that MIT students took home the top prize for their electric vehicle - sharing program .
But one of the “ honorable mention ” teams also caught our eye for their socially responsible “ pedal - powered ” initiative to merge the use of recycled bicycles with healthcare delivery in rural East Africa , particularly Uganda .
[ WHAT ’S THE BIG IDEA ? ]
Cycle for Health is a pedal powered catalyst that when placed into a failing rural East African transport system mobilizes medical resources , personnel and patients .
The initiative capitalizes on thousands and thousands of bicycles left unused in the garages , apartment buildings and streets of North America by recycling them to rural African communities to save lives .
The initiative is an immediate need for rural communities with ample medicine and skilled professionals not being delivered or accessed because of poor roads and the limited use of motorized vehicles .
When advanced care is many miles away , timely diagnosis , treatment and drug delivery is critical , especially true in the case of pregnant women and HIV / AIDS , Malaria and TB patients .
In the rural setting , mild delays in initial care dominos small , treatable problems into serious ailments , resulting in a long , costly journey for advanced care at city hospitals .
[ HOW IT WORKS ]
To treat this rural health care problem at its root cause , Cycle for Health collects idle bicycles in North America , packages them with spare parts and tools , and ships them in purchased 40 ft. containers to community based organizations ( CBOs ) in rural East Africa .
The fully stocked , containerized bicycle workshop becomes instant storage and workshop space upon arrival .
The non-governmental organization ( NGO ) First African Bicycle Information Organization ( FABIO ) , trains recipient CBO staff to repair , refurbish and remodel recycled bicycles into ambulances , goods carriers and off road transporters .
The bicycle designs are marketed to hospitals , health care organizations , NGOs , and women development groups as a resource to mobilize their resources and improve their services .
Cycle for Health is a breakthrough in its comprehensive package of materials and trainings .
Where current aid programs see bicycles as a donation dropped into a needy community , Cycle for Health envisions recycled bicycles as a capital to start sustainable small scale bicycle enterprises which improve mobility of medical resources , create jobs , and enhance quality of life .

37 Signals recently joined the group of companies using Erlang by porting the poller service of the Campfire chat system :
Last Friday we rolled out the Erlang based poller service into production .
There are three virtual instances running a total of three Erlang processes .
Since Friday , those 3 processes have returned more than 240 million HTTP responses to Campfire users , averaging 1200 - 1500 requests per second at peak times .
The Erlang code replaces a C based system :
It 's safe to say the Erlang poller is pretty fast .
It 's also much easier to manage 3 Erlang processes than it was the 240 processes that our C poller required .
InfoQ reported previously about Erlang use in the Ruby space .
Engine Yard is one of the leaders in this area , with some of their tools and systems built in part with Erlang or on messaging systems written in Erlang .
A recent Erlang conference , Erlang Factory , saw talks by EngineYard 's Ezra Zygmuntowicz and GitHub 's Tom Preston - Werner ( some videos of the talks are available online ) .
Tom Preston - Werner ( InfoQ has a video interview with Tom on GitHub and Erlang ) , talked about Erlectricity , a library that allows to connect Erlang and Ruby ( slides from Tom 's talk ( PDF ) ) .
Erlang 's way of connecting to other languages and system works via a network protocol , and Erlectricity takes care of both the Erlang and the Ruby side , ie .
mapping Erlang types to Ruby types and vice versa .
The slides also contain information about BERT and BERT - RPC , which appear to be more efficient binary encodings for sending Erlang terms across the wire .
Tom also recently released the source for egitd , an Erlang - based git daemon , which GitHub used ( although it recently switched to a hacked version of the regular git daemon ) .

Here is more bad economic news from Asia .
Yet those countries do n't have banking crises as many other nations do .
So what exactly is up ?
The usual story is that these nations are " heavily dependent upon exports . "
But if I may wear my Don Boudreaux hat for a moment ( or more ) , is not the state of Kentucky also heavily dependent upon exports ?
Is not the Cowen household heavily dependent upon exports ?
Why is being dependent on exports so especially bad for parts of Asia ?
One answer is that Asian exports , which travel great distances , are often consumer durables and such purchases are especially easy to postpone .
Services are often more robust .
Another answer is that many Asian producers have chosen high fixed costs in a way that requires steady or rising revenue over time .
That is their version of being highly leveraged without taking on much explicit debt .
Again a central lesson of this depression will be how many different ways there are to leverage .
Last week I was surprised to read this :
“ For a long time , Harvard had a negative 5 position , ” she said .
“ That
means that 105 percent of the assets are invested at most times . ”
So far it seems that the least leveraged parts of the world — all things considered — are South America and sub-Saharan Africa .
Brazil , Chile , and Peru are a few of the countries which , in relative terms , are suffering least .

How Many Strips of Bacon are There in a Jar of Bacon Bits ?
By Rob Cockerham | May 12 , 2003
How Much is Inside Bacon Bits ?
How much is inside bacon bits ?
During World War 2 , strict meat rationing made it almost impossible to get a full - sized meal in the morning .
Tiny versions of mealtime favorites were introduced to the breakfasting public .
Cinnamon Toast Crunch® replaced cinnamon toast , salmon eggs replaced chicken eggs , and demitasses of espresso took the place of coffee cups .
Unquestionably the favorite miniature product to come out of this crisis was the bacon bit .
For years , bacon - flavored bits have been sold in jars and used on top of salads to add a meaty crunch .
Recently Oscar Mayer began selling these little bags of real bacon bits .
The bag claims to contain 3 ounces ( 85g ) of bacon bits , but bacon is traditionally measured in strips , not ounces .
How many strips of bacon are inside ?
On Friday night , we decided to find out .
Steve , Elise and I were over at Tom and Amy 's house .
The plan was to cook some bacon up , and see how many cooked strips of bacon it took to total 3 ounces .
We dumped the Bacon Bits package onto the scale ; 2.995 ounces of bacon bits .
How is that for accurate packaging ?
We used Oscar Mayer bacon for the comparison .
This one pound package was US$ 5.99
Bacon is sold in packs of these long raw slices .
You can also get individually - wrapped single slices for kid 's lunches , also known as Small - Fry or Go-Pork .
Tom carefully sliced open the packet .
The first step in preparing bacon strips is to peel the slices apart from one another .
If they do n't peel apart easily , try soaking them overnight in baby oil .
Bacon strips usually have red areas and white areas .
The red areas are meat .
The white areas are fat .
Carefully cut away any blue or orange areas before cooking .
Tom was in charge of frying .
As the bacon cooked , the fat on the bacon reached its melting point and turned into liquid , leaving the pure , healthy pork meat behind .
While the bacon strips were cooking , we arranged the bacon bits into rectangles on a cookie sheet .
It looked like they might have been chipped from about 12 slices .
The bacon sizzled in a twisted heap .
I wanted to measure the hot , liquefied bacon grease , but the plastic measuring cup could n't handle the heat .
It melted through and dripped all over the place before we it over the sink .
Luckily the bacon fat seemed to enhance the flavor of everything it dripped onto !
The biscuits were zesty !
The salmon was exquisite !
The Nylabone was brimming with goodness , and the croissants were delicious !
If this happens to you , remember that replacement pork fat is easy to find in the supermarket .
It is called " lard " .
Tom carefully arranged the bacon on a sheet covered with aluminum foil .
Steven supervised .
At the scale , the cooked bacon had lost a considerable amount of weight .
Each cooked slice was down to 0.235 ounces ( 6.7 grams )
I slowly added cooked bacon to the scale until it registered nearly 3 ounces .
Twelve slices weighed 2.985 ounces !
We had our answer !
As soon as the measuring was over , Tom and I were free to enjoy the cooked bacon .
A few years ago , I could not have even imagined enjoying bacon except in the morning time , but thanks to the Bacon 24 * 7 marketing campaign , and their computer - animated Sir Francis character , I do n't even hesitate .
Bacon is delicious anytime !
12 slices is 63 % of the pound of bacon , and since the package of bacon bits was only $ 1.89 , you 'd have to find raw bacon selling for $ 2.99 a pound to justify frying and Cuisinarting your own bacon bits .
Good luck getting your food processor kashered , by the way .
Price Package Size Cooked yield Price per cooked oz .
Price per slice Bacon Bits $ 1.89 3 oz. 3 oz . $ 0.63 31 ¢ Raw Bacon $ 5.99 16 oz. 4.75 oz $ 1.30 63 ¢
As you can see from this chart , the Oscar Mayer package of bacon bits are a good price for their weight .
Bacon is priced like diamonds :
The smaller the pieces , the cheaper they are per ounce .
If you ask me , the tiny bits just make them easier to eat on the go !
A team of atmospheric chemists say they have moved closer to what is considered the " holy grail " of climate change science ; the first - ever direct detections of biological particles within ice clouds .
The team , led by Kimberly Prather and Kerri Pratt of the University of California at San Diego , Scripps Institution of Oceanography , sampled water droplet and ice crystal residues at high speeds while flying through clouds in the skies over Wyoming .
While it has long been known that microorganisms become airborne and travel great distances , this study is the first to yield direct data on how they work to influence cloud formation .
Analysis of the ice crystals revealed that the particles that started their growth were made up almost entirely of either dust or biological material such as bacteria , fungal spores and plant material .
Biological particles ( bacteria , pollen , fungi ) act as nuclei for formation of ice in clouds .
Credit : NCAR" If we understand the sources of the particles that nucleate clouds , and their relative abundance , we can determine their impact on climate , " said Pratt , lead author of the paper .
The effects of tiny airborne particles called aerosols on cloud formation have been some of the most difficult aspects of weather and climate for scientists to understand .
In climate change science , which derives many of its projections from computer simulations of climate phenomena , the interactions between aerosols and clouds represent what scientists consider the greatest uncertainty in modeling predictions for the future .
" By sampling clouds in real time from an aircraft , these investigators were able to get information about ice particles in clouds at an unprecedented level of detail , " said Anne - Marie Schmoltner of NSF 's Division of Atmospheric Sciences , which funded the research .
"
By determining the chemical composition of the very cores of individual ice particles , they discovered that both mineral dust and , surprisingly , biological particles play a major role in the formation of clouds .
" Aerosols , ranging from dust , soot , and sea salt to organic materials , some of which travel thousands of miles , form the skeletons of clouds .
Around these nuclei , water and ice in the atmosphere condense and grow , leading to precipitation .
Scientists are trying to understand how the nuclei form , as clouds play a critical role by both cooling the atmosphere and affecting regional precipitation processes .
The ICE - L team mounted a mass spectrometer onto a C - 130 aircraft operated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , Colo. , and made a series of flights through a type of cloud known as a wave cloud .
The researchers performed in - situ measurements of cloud ice crystal residues and found that half were mineral dust and about a third were made up of inorganic ions mixed with nitrogen , phosphorus and carbon -- the signature elements of biological matter .
The second - by - second speed of the analysis allowed the researchers to make distinctions between water droplets and ice particles .
Ice nuclei are rarer than droplet nuclei .
The team demonstrated that both dust and biological material indeed form the nuclei of these ice particles , something that previously could only be simulated in laboratory experiments .
" This has really been kind of a holy grail measurement for us , " said Prather .
" Understanding which particles form ice nuclei , and which have extremely low concentrations and are inherently difficult to measure , means you can begin to understand processes that result in precipitation .
Any new piece of information you can get is critical .
" The findings suggest that the biological particles that get swept up in dust storms help to induce the formation of cloud ice , and that their region of origin makes a difference .
Evidence is increasingly suggesting that dust transported from Asia could be influencing precipitation in North America , for example .
Researchers hope to use the ICE - L data to design future studies timed to events when such particles may play a bigger role in triggering rain or snowfall .
Results of the Ice in Clouds Experiment - Layer Clouds ( ICE-L ) , funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , appear May 17 in Nature Geoscience .
The research was also supported by NCAR .
Paper co-authors include Paul DeMott and Anthony Prenni from Colorado State University , Jeffrey French and Zhien Wang of the University of Wyoming , Douglas Westphal of the Naval Research Laboratory in Monterey , Calif. , Andrew Heymsfield of the National Center for Atmospheric Research , and Cynthia Twohy of Oregon State University .
YANGON ( Reuters ) - Authorities in Myanmar have arrested an American after he swam across a lake to the residence of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi , who is under house arrest , and spent two days in her compound .
Security personnel are seen at the junction of University Avenue , in which the residence of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is located , in Yangon May 27 , 2008 .

The official Kyemon daily said Thursday that John William Yeattaw was arrested while swimming in Inya Lake in Yangon early Wednesday .
Under interrogation , Yeattaw said he arrived in Yangon on a tourist visa Saturday and swam across the lake to Suu Kyi ’s compound Sunday night .
He said he had secretly entered the house and stayed there until Tuesday night , the newspaper said .
Suu Kyi won an election in 1990 but never took power after the country ’s generals nullified the vote .
She has spent more than 13 of the past 19 years under one form of detention or another .
Anyone wishing to visit her needs permission from the military authorities , who have run the country for four decades .
Contacted by Reuters , a U.S. embassy official who asked not to be identified said : “ We just read about it in the official paper and we have n’t been contacted by any official about it so far . ”
Asked about Yeattaw ’s motivations , he replied : “ I have no idea . ”
People familiar with Suu Kyi ’s residence said it was unlikely Yeattaw could have remained in the compound for two days without her knowledge .
The newspaper said the authorities had confiscated Yeattaw ’s passport , a black haversack , a torch , a pair of pliers , a camera , two $ 100 notes and some local currency .
The lake is located at the heart of an elite residential area , home to the U.S. ambassador and the U.S. embassy .
Peddlers of bogus anti-virus try to scare people into buying Makers of fake anti-virus software are exploiting search engines to drive people to sites peddling ' scareware ' .
Using popular and mis-spelled search terms , the criminals divert people to sites that are seeded with fake warnings about virus infections .
The pop -up warnings claim that a visitor 's PC is riddled with malicious programmes and spyware .
Research suggests some criminals are making as much as $ 10,000 a day from fake security software .
Cashing in Computer security firm Finjan carried out the research into the techniques sellers of ' scareware ' use to get their fake software in front of web users .
" They are misleading people with evidence that their machine is infected with viruses and they are encouraging them to download and buy software that basically does nothing , " said Yuval Ben-Itzhak , chief technology officer at Finjan .
Studies suggest that ' scareware ' is catching on among some hi-tech criminals .
A report by the Anti-Phishing Working Group , released in March 2009 , found 9,287 bogus anti-malware programmes in circulation in December 2008 - a rise of 225 % since January 2008 .
Scareware peddlers exploited the death of actress Natasha Richardson .
" The reason they are making so much money is the new techniques they are using , namely search engine optimisation , " he said .
Mr Ben -Itzhak said a campaign to push scareware typically involves two groups of hi-tech criminals .
One group compromises webpages and injects them with popular search terms , the other sells the fake security software .
Some seed pages with popular keywords such as " Obama " but others use terms associated with recent events .
Some tried to cash in on the death of Natasha Richardson by using words taken from news stories about the actress 's death .
Using these popular terms mean the pages appear high up in results when people carry out a keyword search .
Anyone clicking on a booby - trapped page is then instantly re-directed to the site hosting the links to the fake security software .
Once they arrive , visitors are bombarded with pop-ups warning that their PC is infected .
To clear up the infection , users are told , they must download and pay for anti-virus software which typically costs about $ 50 ( £ 34 ) .
The scareware sellers are exploiting top search terms
Through its research , Finjan got access to the web - based systems that one group of ' scareware ' peddlers used to manage their search engine campaigns .
It found that , over a 16 - day period , more than 1.8 m people were re-directed to the sites pushing the ' scareware ' .
Of those visiting the sites 7 - 12 % installed the fake software and 1.79 % paid $ 50 for it .
Some of the proceeds from this is handed back to those who inject the search terms into webpages , netting them about $ 10,800 ( £ 7,467 ) a day for their work .
Mr Ben - Itzhak said people should be very wary of any pop-up window claiming to find evidence of an infection .
" It 's impossible to scan your local disk without installing software , " he said .
A spokesman for Google said it tried to combat efforts to trick its indexing system into crediting a page with more popularity than it deserved .
" In cases in which we feel that sites are attempting to manipulate rankings , we make adjustments to counterbalance and also discourage those efforts , " said the spokesman in a statement .
" Certain actions such as cloaking - writing text in such a way that it can be seen by search engines but not by users - or setting up pages / links with the sole purpose of fooling search engines may result in removal from our index , " he added .

Elderly motorists have led the stampede to cash in on the £ 2,000 car scrappage scheme which starts today , according to the UK 's largest dealership .
Fed up with earning next to no interest on their savings , they are opting to take advantage of the offer and pay in cash for a new car .
Dealers say that small , cheaper models are particularly popular replacements .
Trevor Finn , the chief executive of Pendragon , said many dealers were reporting that the majority of motorists registering interest in the scheme were retired .
One Citroen dealership in Reading he visited last week told him that three - quarters of inquiries came from older drivers – a trend experienced by many other dealers , he said .
The scheme is designed to kickstart moribund car sales and revive struggling carmakers .
Motorists who own a car more than 10 years old can trade it in to qualify for a £ 2,000 discount on a new model .
The discount is funded jointly by the government and the industry .
The scheme , which is more limited compared to most on offer on the continent , lasts for nine months or until the £ 300 m pledged by the government to fund its share runs out .
Finn said : " A high proportion of the people who have applied are people who are on fixed incomes , particularly retired people who have had cars for a long time and are paying in cash .
They are n't getting much of a return on their savings .
But they can help counter this by getting a £ 2,000 valuation . "
The business secretary , Lord Mandelson , said this morning that the scheme was a " wonderful bargain " for motorists and good news for workers across the car industry .
Critics , though , have claimed that the £ 2,000 saving will be quickly eroded by the depreciation in value of new cars .
Finn admitted that he had originally been sceptical about the effectiveness of the scheme , mainly because consumers would only benefit from a £ 1,000 discount in many cases .
Most manufacturers and dealers are already offering discounts of £ 1,000 or more .
Because motorists do not receive any payment for the old car they hand in , the scheme only makes sense if the old model is worth less than £ 1,000 .
" The idea has got some traction , " he said .
" I started off being sceptical but , having seen more of the marketing and having the initial feedback , it 's clear that the scheme is driving showroom enquiries . "
Edmund King , the president of the AA motorists body , said 250,000 car owners would be interested in taking up the offer .
" There will be an initial rush to the showrooms , " he said , " but as details come through to the mass of motorists , you will see another wave of interest after two or three months . "
Last week , Pendragon invited customers to register to have their old car valued on its car retailers ' websites , www.stratstone.com and www.evanshalshaw.com.
Finn said 5,000 people had registered their details .
Dealers have already started selling old cars to scrap merchants .
Cartakeback bridges the gap between the car dealers and the scrapyards and claims to deal with about 70 % of the cars heading for the scrapheap in Britain .
Its manager , Graham Price , said : " The indications are that several thousand vehicles have been pre-sold under the scheme .
There does seem to be interest from the public , judging by the end - of - life vehicles coming our way . "
He said the volume of cars being scrapped was down about 15 - 20 % this year but he expected that to be offset by the scheme .
" The scrappage scheme will certainly redress that , but it does appear to be borrowing business from the future . "
Car scrapyards , mostly family - run business , are a little discussed beneficiary of the scheme .
A car , broken down into scrap metal , fetches about £ 150 with much of the recyclable material heading for Turkey , India and the Middle East .
The price is volatile , depending on the demand for raw materials and was twice as high last summer .
However , prices are higher than they were in last autumn , when a scrapped car fetched just £ 50 .
Under government regulations , 85 % of a vehicle must be recycled , going up to 95 % in 2015 .
Between 1.5 m and 2 m cars are taken off the road each year .
WHAT is your carbon legacy – not the emissions you are personally liable for , but those of your descendants ?
Ask Paul Murtaugh , a statistician at Oregon State University in Corvallis .
If you have a child , he says , you and you partner are each responsible for half its emissions .
If that child has kids , one - quarter of their emissions are down to you , and so on .
How it adds up depends on population trends and emission changes in the future .
Murtaugh used UN population projections , which say that after 2050 , birth rates in all countries will be 1.85 children per woman , on …
Today I was looking around what kind of helper tools a Perl programmer might need , that is not necessarily for writing Perl code .
One of the other fields we frequently visit is databases .
We need to write SQL statements , looking into the structure and the content of databases and checking what are the values there , sometimes even designing a schema .
On one hand there are command line interfaces for every database and there are specialized desktop or web based tools to look at databases which are very powerful .
So we might not need anything else .
On the other hand we have DBI , lots of DBD packages and a number of nice extensions of DBI for building code that can access databases .
Maybe we can build some add - ons to Padre that will make our life even easier .
So I 'd like your ideas on the subject .
What kind of SQL or database related desktop tool would you like to have for your development ?
Just to start the list , let me write down the trivial things I could come up with ( trivial in thinking about them , not the development ) :

BBC Somali Service
The dusty streets of Kismayo in Somalia echoed to the sound of a vehicle with loudspeakers summoning residents to a new form of public " entertainment " earlier this month .
People were being invited to see a man have his hand chopped off in a public park in the city .
The young man , Mohamed Omar Ismail , had been found guilty of stealing goods from another man 's house .
That afternoon , hundreds of local people flocked to Freedom Park in order to see the amputation .
After a long wait , Mr Ismail was brought out in front of the people and an official started to read out the court decision from a piece of paper .
Clothes theft " The Islamic Sharia court of Kismayo district confirms that Mohamed Omar Ismail has been found guilty of stealing , " the official announced .
" Mr Ismail stole 10 pairs of trousers , 10 shirts , eight other items and a bag .
The value of all the items is estimated to be $ 90 . "
The official quoted a chapter from the Koran known as Surah Maida , verse 38 , which is about stealing and relevant punishment .
He said that the verse decreed that punishment for stealing was that the right hand of the thief should be cut off .
A local journalist who witnessed the events unfold saw a shocked - looking Mr Ismail brought into the park .
His right hand was held up to the crowds .
It was then laid on a table and severed immediately and without ceremony at the wrist .
Bloody hand dangled
The eyewitness told of his horror as the bloody body part was dangled by its index finger in front of the crowd to prove that punishment had been meted out .
Mr Ismail is now recovering from his injury in Kismayo General Hospital , where he is being guarded by the Islamist militia who punished him .
Mohamed Omar Ismail reportedly insists he did not commit the burglary
They do not allow him to talk to the media .
But according to an independent source , Mr Ismail insists he did not commit the burglary for which he lost his hand .
He said he was still appalled at what had happened to him and the terrible pain he had suffered .
Although there have been several executions and a number of public floggings meted out in the swathes of central and southern Somalia currently controlled by hardline Islamists , this is believed to have been just the second amputation this year .
Michelle Kagari , of Amnesty International 's Africa programme , said : " Punishments like these illustrate the extent to which violence still substitutes for the rule of law in many areas of Somalia . "
She said she wanted the United Nations to take concrete steps to stop such human rights abuses , and that an independent commission of inquiry or similar mechanism should be set up to investigate .
' Due process ' Amnesty International has also called on the fragile Somali transitional government - and the militias which currently run Kismayo and other parts of the south - to publicly condemn all human rights abuses , including punishments carried out without due process of law .
It is believed to have been the second amputation in Somalia this year
But the Somali government is more preoccupied struggling to withstand the latest onslaught by the opposition radical alliance of the Islamic party ( Hisbul - Islam ) and al - Shabab .
On Sunday , fighters from the al - Shabab group , which is linked to al - Qaeda , took the key town of Jowhar from government forces .
A spokesman for the group said Sharia would be imposed there .
Earlier this year , the Western - backed moderate Islamist government based in Mogadishu announced the introduction of Sharia law throughout the country .
But this failed to appease the hardliners , who follow the Wahhabi school of Islam , based on a more rigid reading of Islamic texts , rather than the mainstream Sunni faith practised by most Somalis .
Alien culture Amputations and the recent stoning to death of a 13 - year - old mentally disabled girl are shocking displays of al - Shabab 's interpretation of Islamic law .
And their writ extends into everyday life .
Correspondents say Somalia is sliding deeper into chaos
Now , women who do not wear hijab in al - Shabab - run areas are prohibited from leaving their homes .
They are instructed to cover themselves from head to toe .
No part of their body is permitted to be seen in public .
This culture is alien to many Somali women , particularly those in rural areas who work in farms or herd goats , sheep and cattle .
These women work very hard under the scorching sun and wearing such dresses makes their already difficult life harder still .
But their fear of the new administrators means they have no other option but to comply .
There are reports that local women , who are not well off , are going to tailors and markets to buy these dresses .
The robes are locally known as jalaabiibs and cost between $ 12 and $ 15 ( £ 9.70 ) .
Amnesty International say opposition leaders in Somalia carry out punishments without any oversight or accountability .
But the harsh punishments and killings that take place are unlikely to end while the government , the Islamists and now the Ethiopians struggle to control the country .

Kate and Leo help last Titanic survivor
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet , together with director James Cameron , have donated $ 30,000 to help pay the nursing home fees of Millvina Dean , the last survivor of the Titanic .
The Titanic stars reached out to the 98 - year - old after an appeal was made by Don Mullan , an author and photographer .
Mullan had been selling a limited - edition shot , entitled Still Surviving , of Millvina ’s hands signing an autograph in order to raise funds for her nursing home bills .
He then decided to ask help from the people who worked on the Titanic film .
“ If we can not take care of this gracious and very special lady , now in her 98th year , then all our concern about the Titanic is but a sham , ” Mullan told the Irish Independent .
“ Millvina Dean must be allowed to live out the remainder of her days without any worry or concern about meeting the costs of her welfare . ”
He added : “ There are people including director James Cameron and actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and Canadian singer Celine Dion who have made enormous profits from the Titanic story and I believe they can and , morally , should help . ”
Dean was only nine weeks old and the youngest passenger of the ill - fated ship that set sail for America from Southampton , England in 1912 .

A state of mind where cognitive intelligence does n’t function is medically considered insanity .
Just not on Wall Street .
The first people in history to discover a way of sending the entire human race broke are now feeling under - appreciated .
Anyone would think it was 2006 .
It is n’t .
One of the big issues for this second Flight Of The Golden Pheasants is the issue of pay .
( The first Flight Of The Golden Pheasants was the parade of Nazi oligarchs escaping the Russians in 1945 , driving the contents of mansions through the bomb craters )
People who were making $ 20 or 30 million a year are obviously feeling pretty hard done by .
Other people retire on 5 % of that money and live very well , but not these guys .
If keeping up with the Van Der Joneses means following them into the grave , they ’ll do it .
There are a few minor hazards to employing this day labor .
A “ buck ” in Wall Street , aka Death Valley , parlance , is a million .
So hiring an idiot is n’t cheap .
Nor is it likely , according to Banking executives and recruiters say talented financiers — the driven , hyper - numerate , slightly ruthless ones with a preternatural knack for making money in bull markets and bear — are always in high demand .
But given the tumult in the industry , it ’s a buyer ’s market right now .
Leaving out the insult to vocabularies regarding the use of the word “ hyper- numerate ” to describe people who do n’t question securities assets valued to the point of insanity cubed , buyer ’s market may be an understatement .
So far over a trillion dollars has been lost and another two trillion are looking like they ’re going the way of the Dodo .
The question is now whether these self pitying museum specimens are what are required for a totally different world .
The flight of miserable millionaires , however , continues .
Some are being picked up by smaller banks , who are n’t affected by the salary cap .
Others are thinking of condescending to accept cash salaries to avoid the bonus issues .
Interestingly , at no point has the concept of actual value for money being obtained from the Illuminati of the financial world .
Their historical redefinition of the concept of total failure apparently is n't an issue .
It seems to be accepted that they because cost that much they must be worth something .
A brain drain is feared , as these unsung super Einsteins head for the prairies .
As NYT piece above says , losing the morons who created the global Ground Zero is actually pretty bearable , with at least some benefits .
1 . There wo n’t be a run on Kleenex by investors .
2 . The average IQ of New York will go up by about 100 points at least for each Wall Street refugee .
3 . Troughs will be taken out of restaurants .
4 . The rats will run out of role models .
But there are grounds for social anxiety , even so .
Where will they go ?
What if they open hot dog stands , or something , and crash the hot dog market ?
What if they accidentally start selling used cars and drive the world back to horses and carts ?
What if they break into media , and start doing reality shows about themselves , and destroy an invaluable educational medium for the next generation ?
Desperate gerbils do desperate things .
These particular small rodents also do nothing right .
Keep watching the sewers , folks , in case they break cover .
The very Ex “ Masters Of The Universe ” are busy trying to return to the glory days when anyone had any money .
So they 're trying to go somewhere where they 'll get paid for being themselves , and the skies are not cloudy all day , and people can't read news .
Somewhere like other banks and financial institutions .

I did n't set out to be a mantis photographer but like a lot of my life it just happened .
For years I 've used Nikon SLR equipment and one of my desires was to buy a great macro lens , but the one I wanted was US $ 1200 , a bargain even I was able to resist .
So one of the pleasures of buying the Canon G1 was discovering that macro photography came as standard -- and learning that with a Lensmate and Hoya Close - up Filters , I could get even closer .
Fortunately , I had it all together by the time this small preying mantis entered our garden .
He 's about an inch and a quarter long and was very tolerant .
He 's in the first seven pictures in Mantisland .
Times passes until one day it 's announced that there 's a mantis on the toaster .
I took a few shots with marginal results and then placed her on our Korean step chest with some of the artifacts that Leela has collected over the years .
She was calm , moved deliberately and held her positions for quite some time ( the mantis , although it does rather describe Leela as well ) .
The two pictures I choose from the lot are my personal favorites of all the preying mantis photos .
She is about three inches long .
I was assuming my mantis days were over when I sat outside on the terrace one day , opened the newspaper and had a baby mantis hop onto my hand .
He was by far the most difficult of the mantises to shoot .
He was hopping everywhere , especially onto the camera when I got close .
Plus he was small , brown and nondescript , with little contrast or visual interest .
So I put him on a flower , whose petals he matched in size , and on the cricket cage I used in the adult mantis picture , simply for scale .
He 's about half and inch long .
So now I 'm really done .
I 've shot the three stages of life -- baby , teenager and adult .
And then I walked out to feed our goldfish and found this veteran staring into the stockade .
Like the other adult , he 's about three inches long .
There are generally two approaches to taking macro shots with the G1 and G2 cameras : Use the dedicated Canon Macro Lens or choose Close - up Filters .
Both solutions require an adapter .
The 250D Canon Macro Lens mates with the LA - DC58 adapter ( 58 mm ) which screws on to the camera body .
From everything I read , it 's a good - quality lens that 's made for the task and the camera .
It should give you better pictures at an equivalent size than multiple layers of glass , but I have not tested it .
I use the Hoya Close - up Filter Set which offers three filters in three diopters -- +1 , +2 and + 4 .
These are 49 mm filters and you 'll need the 49 mm Lensmate adapter .
The entire set is approximately half the cost of the Canon macro lens .
How clear are the Hoya filters ?
You can decide for yourself .
The first seven mantis pictures and the baby pictures were taken through four layers of glass -- three close - up filters stacked ( strongest one nearest the camera lens ) and a UV filter .
In retrospect , I should have removed the UV filter and perhaps the +1 Hoya and reduced the glass to two layers , but I 'm happy with the quality of the shots .
Time passes : Since I wrote that paragraph , I 've had to replace all my macro filters because of theft .
Rather than buy the 3 - pack , I purchased a B+W +5 and added a Hoya +10 Macro Lens with front threading .
With those two lenses I have the option of +5 , +10 or +15 ( with wafer - thin depth of field ) .
I 'm very satisfied with the new combination .
Less fuss and more versatility .
Whatever choice you make , you will quickly discover that your depth of field is very shallow and you 'll get many photos where even the smallest animal or plant is not entirely in focus .
That can be a good or bad thing .
I tend to solve this problem by taking lots of shots .
And the parts that are out of focus I call art .

In the past we 've given plenty of examples of how DRM hurts paying customers instead of the people it is meant for .
Still , many software companies prefer to see their customers as potential ' thieves ' but what they do n't realize , however , is that they are actually breeding pirates instead of stopping them .
Meet Mark , an IT guy at a small company who occasionally has to renew licenses for the software utilized by the business .
Recently , he had to activate a copy of PaperPort , the scanning and document management software from Nuance .
In order to free up another activation slot , he had to uninstall the old one first while being online .
Like most activation licensed software , this does n’t always work properly .
To resolve the issue Mark contacted Nuance ’s support .
To his surprise however , they did n’t want to help him straight away , instead asking him to take pictures of the CD in order to prove that the company owned a legitimate copy .
“ I could n’t believe my ears , ” Mark told Torrent Freak .
“ After arguing with support for a while on how ridiculous it was , I still had to have the license within the day .
To make a long story short I finally got them to unlock 2 licenses after 2 days of repeated calls and sending the picture of the CD multiple times . ”
Upset at how he was treated by customer support , Mark decided to send an email to Nuance ’s CEO Paul Ricci to inform him that alienating customers like this is not going to help him sell more products .
The picture of the CDs that Mark had to supply was also sent to Ricci .
Dear Mr Ricci ,
Our company has been using your product for nearly a decade .
We have estimated that it is safe to say we have spent $ 3000 over the years on your product .
We are by far not the biggest customer but in today ’s economy we think every customer counts .
We recently bought several PaperPort 11 licenses which we have used .
We have upgraded our computers and the procedure is to uninstall paper port ( While online ) in order to free a license for the new computer .
Sadly this did not work .
My efforts at consulting with your technical support department were very time consuming , confusing , and ultimately pointless .
To my surprise , they wanted me to take a PICTURE of the CDs we have .
As an IT professional , I found this archaic exercise in futility to be absolutely appalling .
Not only do your anti-piracy methods completely fail ( There is no known anti-piracy method that works to this day , anything can be downloaded ) but they cost me ; the legitimate customer time and frustration .
Attached is the picture I had to send in .
This is to let you know that we are completely disgusted with your company ’s procedures , and are no longer going to do any business with Nuance .
Just to let you know , being a computer engineer , I can guarantee you these statistics : Pirates Stopped = 0
Legitimate Customers totally alienated = Thousands .
You may want to take a look at your stock trends of late , Mr. Ricci .
Perhaps this poor customer service MIGHT explain some of that .
Here ’s the Picture Mark sent , along with a personal note .
Ricci received the email in good order , and passed it on to the chief marketeer at Nuance , who wrote back to Mark .
“ I appreciate your note and will use it as a flashpoint for us to reevaluate this processes that you have correctly pointed out as archaic , ” was his reply , and he offered some free copies of PaperPort , PDF and OmniPage “ as a gesture of goodwill . ”
Nuance has clearly recognized that they made a mistake and although it ’s probably too late for some customers , we hope they ’ve learned from it .
Mark said that in hindsight his email to Ricci might have been a little bit over the top .
But , it did make them realize that they were making a mistake , asking people to take pictures of their CDs .
“ I was very upset and under a lot of pressure .
My job is to solve problems in the quickest amount of time .. and taking pictures of CD ’s or sticking them in a copier is n’t something anyone should ever have to do with their software , ” Mark said .
“ It just does n’t make sense . ”
Bookabooka does n't host any e-books on its site , but instead allows students to rent their textbooks to their peers .
Renting is conducted via traditional " snailmail " and it is mandatory that the textbooks are originals .
Bookabooka acts only as an intermediate , connecting the students together and does n't handle the shipping or returns of the textbooks .
Despite these " small " differences between TPB and Bookabooka , The Finnish book publishers ' associationis convinced that Bookabooka is breaking the copyright legislation and threatening their business .
Annual school textbook sales in Finland were worth more than € 100 M in year 2007 .
TTVK demands ( PDF , in Finnish ) that the service must be shut down by Friday this week or they 'll sue the company .
Bookabooka 's founders have already stated that they wont respond to the threats , but instead will keep the service running .
( The Frisky ) --
In a recent column on the Huffington Post , " Why I 'm Single , " writer Lea Lane lists all the reasons that she 's still single .
Why ?
So she can send the URL to all the nosy , possibly well - meaning busy - bodies who keep asking her why she is n't in a relationship .
" Crappies " are women who whine to others on why they can't find a partner .
Lane presents a persuasive case ; it almost made me wish for the days I , too , had the whole bed to myself .
She 's one of what I 'll call the " Happies , " women who are perfectly content with their single status .
They do n't want for a companion ; they love their solitude and have enough friends , hobbies , and passions to keep themselves busy .
Although , most Happies , like Lane , are " open to options , and do understand the beauty and wonder -- and blessing -- of a good relationship , " they neither actively seek one nor passively hope and pray one comes their way .
The Happies say they do n't need a relationship to be content , and , by God , they mean it .
On the other side of the single lady spectrum , you 've got the " Crappies . "
They 're the single ladies with really crappy attitudes .
Take , for example , Jezebel 's Megan Carpentier , who responded to Lane 's column with a list of her own , a list that not only does n't make me a little nostalgic for my single days , it makes me sort of , well , sad -- for her .
I 'm sad for the Crappies , because , as much as they say , like Megan , " I 've made my peace with being single because I do n't have to pretend I do n't drink from the carton or sleep with one of those face masks on or watch ' Murder She Wrote ' too late at night , " they 're whining to everyone who will listen about how much it sucks that they can't find a guy who wants to date them .
They 're so committed to not compromising , to not being flexible , to not stepping a centimeter outside their comfort zone , or , God forbid , turning off their guilty pleasure TV , they refuse to actually GO OUT , mingle , maybe even meet someone nice .
No , they 'd rather stay in , whine , and have their friends write testimonials on their blogs about why they'd be so great to date .
In an attempt to hide their loneliness from themselves -- because they 're sure not hiding it from anyone else -- the Crappies adopt an air of self - righteousness .
" I 'm probably alone because I dated when I wanted to , " they tell themselves , " and got into relationships when I wanted to , and got out of them when I needed to . "
As if people who are n't alone are a bunch of morons who got stuck in bad relationships that they never wanted to be in and do n't have the strength to get out of .
" I 'm alone because I eschewed goal - oriented dating and ' trying to find someone , ' " they brag .
Because , wow , there 's nothing worse than actually being pro-active , particularly when the goal is happiness .
That kind of stuff is for losers !
That kind of stuff is for self - hating women who subscribe to " The Rules ! "
Except it is n't .
Ladies , if you 're single and truly happy to be so , more power to you !
There 's no reason in the world you need to make a list or explain to anyone why you 're not in a relationship .
But if you 're a woman who is unhappily single and would love nothing more than having someone to share your life with , it 's time to quit whining , stop making self - righteous excuses , turn off your TV , get out there , and meet people .
There 's no shame in being goal - oriented and dating with purpose .
There 's no shame in opening your mind , being flexible , and learning to compromise .
Spread the word you 're on the market , tell your friends , tell your friends of friends , let your co-workers , family , and entire social network know you 're looking for dates .
Take care of yourself , dress well , look good every time you go outside .
Smile at people when you 're out and about , make small talk in check - out lines , keep your radar up at all times .
You never know when the right person for you will be rounding the next corner .
But bear in mind , YOU are n't perfect , and there 's not going to be a perfect person for you .
If you refuse to settle for anything less , you 're going to be lonely for a very , very long time .
If you are n't prepared to open your mind a little , you might as well stay in with your " Murder She Wrote " and your crappy attitude .
But , for the love of God , quit your whining .
The rest of us do n't want to hear it anymore .

Seven million jobs needed to return to pre-recession employment levels
by Lawrence Mishel and Heidi Shierholz
Before this recession runs its course , it will have become the longest and deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression .
Tomorrow , the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its April employment report , detailing how the labor market fared during the 16th month of the recession .
Today , the latest labor market data available are for March 2009 , 15 months into the recession that officially began in December 2007 .
In order to see how this recession stacks up against previous post - war recessions , we compare labor market indicators at the start of recessions to their values 15 months later .
This document will be updated tomorrow to reflect the new April data .
While the current unemployment rate — 8.5 % in March — is not at an historical high , it has increased much more rapidly during this recession than in other post - war recessions .
Table 1 shows the unemployment rate at the start of each recession over the last 50 years along with the unemployment rate 15 months later .
The unemployment rate increased 3.6 percentage points in the first 15 months of the current recession , a far steeper increase than any of the previous recessions .
In particular , during the first fifteen months of the deep recession of 1981 / 1982 , the unemployment rate increased only 3.2 percentage points .
In other words , while the unemployment rate was higher during the early 1980s than it is today , it was also much higher going into the recession .
U.S. workers in the early 1980s saw a smaller increase in unemployment than what workers are experiencing today .
Figure
A shows this graphically ; the unemployment rate at the onset of the current recession was at a lower level lower than both the 1981 and 1990 recessions .
But it has increased much more dramatically .
Table 2 shows total nonfarm employment at the start of each recession over the last 50 years along with employment 15 months later .
Employment has decreased much more during this recession — 3.7 % — than in prior recessions .
In particular , during the first fifteen months of the recession of 1981 / 1982 , employment declined by only 2.9 % .
Figure B shows this graphically ; employment loss during the first eight months of this recession was relatively mild compared to previous recessions but then it fell off a cliff and now far surpasses the employment loss of the early 1980s .
Furthermore , while the labor market has shed 5.1 million jobs since the start of the recession , it is important to keep in mind that in those 15 months , the population has continued to grow .
Just to keep up with population growth , the economy must add approximately 127,000 jobs every month , which means 1.9 million jobs , should have been added over this period .
In other words , the economy is now 7 million jobs below what is needed to maintain pre-recession employment levels .
Total hours worked in the economy is a more comprehensive measure of labor market weakness than employment because it captures both job loss and reductions in hours for workers who keep their jobs .
Table 3 shows an index of aggregate weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls at the start of each recession over the last forty years along with its value 15 months later .
Again , aggregate hours during the current recession are falling at a faster rate than in previous recessions ; over the course of this recession , aggregate hours have fallen 6.4 % , whereas in the first 15 months of the recession of 1981 / 1982 , aggregate hours fell by 5.7 % .
Underemployment is a more comprehensive measure of labor market slack that includes not just the unemployed , but also “ involuntarily ” part - time workers ( workers who want full - time work but ca n’t get the hours ) and marginally - attached workers ( jobless workers who want a job but are not actively seeking work and are therefore not counted as officially unemployed ) .
Underemployment data as currently measured are only available since the mid-1990s , so it is not possible to compare the current recession to the recession of 1981 on this measure .
Table 4 shows underemployment over the current recession .
In particular , the number of involuntarily part - time workers has nearly doubled since the start of the recession , from 4.6 million to 9.0 million .
Over this time , the underemployment rate has increased from 8.7 % to 15.6 % , so that now 24.4 million people — one out of every six US workers — are either unemployed or underemployed .
Figure D shows the components of underemployment over the course of the recession ; the sharp increase in involuntarily part - time workers is apparent .
In March , nearly one out of every four unemployed workers had been unemployed for more than six months .
One of the reasons jobless workers are getting stuck in unemployment for long periods is the dramatic reduction in job openings since the start of the recession .
There were 4.3 million job openings in December 2007 but only 3.0 million job openings in February 2009 ( the latest data available ) .
In February , there were 12.5 million unemployed workers , which translates to more than four unemployed workers per job opening .
By comparison , at the start of the recession , there were 1.7 unemployed workers per job opening , less than half of the current figure .
Table 5 compares unemployment for various demographic subgroups over the recession of 1981/ 1982 and over the current recession .
In almost all categories , the increase in unemployment over the current recession has been steeper .
A key factor to note is that while unemployment rates and increases are much larger in all recessions for workers with lower levels of schooling and for blue - collar workers , the current recession has seen bigger increases in unemployment among white collar and college - educated workers than earlier recessions .
The depth and severity of this recession means that workers who have historically been relatively sheltered from economic downturns are also experiencing adverse labor market outcomes .
College - educated workers have seen their unemployment rate more than double over this recession , while in the first 15 months of the recession of 1981 / 1982 unemployment for people with a college degree increased by only half of a percentage point .

I sit in a Beverly Hills Salon waiting my turn to get the first interview with “ Mis. Led ! ” the hot new female rapper to hit the airwaves .
She is the image of Hollywood style as three salon employee buzz around her like a group of overly expresso ’d bumblebees .
The only thing that makes this different from Jennifer Lopez or any other superstar that has graced this hot spot is that our new star has a BCBG outfit matched up with a pair of classic Air Jordans .
It is a fitting throwback to days when female rappers like Salt & Pepper dominated the airwaves and now seems to be making a comeback with Mis.
Led !
leading the charge .
Half Puerto Rican and half firecracker Mis. Led !
unleashes on crowds with her new single “ Go Hard Go Fast ” which comes out this week on ITunes .
“ My roots are in Harlem and no matter how much sweetness I give a track that Harlem edge is always just under the surface , ” stated Mis. Led !
“ The new song is a futuristic jam about flirting and yet remaining independent to your soul . ”
This star is no stranger to soulful melodies getting her influences from such groups as “ Black Sheep ” and “ De La Soul ” .
She likes to keep it “ rugged but real ” .
A self professed “ Tomboy ” who decided in her teen years to “ become who I wanted to be and not what others told me to be . ”
She hopes to be a positive role model for teens in the same realm that Miley Cyrus has become a worldwide influence to young girls .
She stated , “ Girls need to know that they can be extraordinary in everything they do .
Do n’t be afraid to shine either in the classroom or just hanging out . ”
Her new single “ Go Fast Go Hard ” is a collaboration with veteran Virginia rapper VA Streetz who ’s first single this year “ Off Top ” bounced to the top of many internet sales charts .
This new single has all the making of another hit for the teenage masses .
As I wrap up my interview I casually ask the hostess what the cost of Mis .
Led ’s trip to the salon was going to cost her .
The lady told me , “ I ’m not at liberty to tell my dear , but let ’s just say that the taxes alone on the bill would make you sweat . ”
I bet she ’s right .
I guess I ’ll do my sweating on the dance floor to Mis .
Led ’s new hit because it ’s definitely in my budget .
For those of you who do n't already know , these are the rules that are in effect in every relationship .
1 . The female always makes the rules .
2 . These rules are subject to change at any time without prior notification .
3 . No male can possibly know all the rules .
4 . If the female suspects that the male knows all the rules , she must immediately change some or all of the rules .
5 . The female is never wrong .
6 . If the female is wrong it is because of a vagrant misunderstanding which was a direct result of something the male said or did wrong .
7 . If rule number six applies , the male must immediately apologize for causing the misunderstanding .
8 . The female can change her mind at any given point in time .
9 . The male must never change his mind without express written consent of the female .
10 .
The female has every right to be angry or upset at any time .
11 . The male must remain calm at all times , unless the female wants him to be angry or upset .
12 . The female must under no circumstances let the male know whether she wants him to be calm , angry or upset .
13 .
Any attempt to document these rules could result in bodily harm .
14 .
The female always gets the last word !

These rules are subject to change as the female sees fit .
" Squeezed : What You Don't Know About Orange Juice " is a forthcoming secret history of the orange nectar .
For example , I did n't know that OJ 's popularity was seeded by its use as a Vitamin C delivery system for World War II troops .
Or that the whole Florida imagery surrounding the drink is mostly a myth these days and that the majority of it comes from Brazil .
The Boston Globe interviewed the author , Alissa Hamilton ( photo by Bart Nagel ) :
What is n't straightforward about orange juice ?
HAMILTON : It 's a heavily processed product .
It 's heavily engineered as well .
In the process of pasteurizing , juice is heated and stripped of oxygen , a process called deaeration , so it does n't oxidize .
Then it 's put in huge storage tanks where it can be kept for upwards of a year .
It gets stripped of flavor - providing chemicals , which are volatile .
When it 's ready for packaging , companies such as Tropicana hire flavor companies such as Firmenich to engineer flavor packs to make it taste fresh .
People think not - from - concentrate is a fresher product , but it also sits in storage for quite a long time …
So parse the carton for us .
For example , what is the phrase " not from concentrate " really about ?
HAMILTON : In the ' 80s , Tropicana had a hold on ready - to - serve orange juice with full - strength juice .
Then this new product , reconstituted orange juice , started appearing in supermarkets .
Tropicana had to make decisions .
Storing concentrate is much cheaper than full - strength juice .
The phrase " not from concentrate " was to try to make consumers pay more for the product because it's a more expensive product to manufacture .
It did n't have to do with the product being fresher ; the product did n't change , the name simply changed .
Tropicana did n't want to have to switch to concentrate technology .
Guido has had a call round the centre - right think - tanks and found that traditional support for sound money policies is now non-existent .
Even the Institute of Economic Affairs ’ shadow MPC unanimously supports quantitative easing .
The IEA is London ’s spiritual home of Friedrich von Hayek and Milton Friedman , and it was the IEA which in the middle of the 1976 global monetary crisis produced a pamphlet by Hayek ; Denationalisation of Money .
Guido has an original edition , it was in this groundbreaking work that Hayek argued that the government monopoly of money must be abolished to stop recurring bouts of inflation and deflation .
How he must be turning in his grave to see the IEA advocate what he spent his life opposing .
Sound money was the traditional cry of conservatives the world over , Cameron even used the phrase in his speech to the Conservative Party conference as recently as last year .
It is clear however that Osborne and Cameron have , in the face of a wider intellectual retreat , given up on sound money and are going along with quantitative easing – a mistake as momentous as their acceptance of Gordon ’s spending levels .
In all of Westminster ’s Wonkland surveyed by Guido , only Madsen Pirie of the Adam Smith Institute is opposed to QE ( also known as printing money ) .
Policy Exchange ’s newly hired chief economist , Andrew Lilico , told Guido there was no other choice .
Lilico also told Guido that if QE was successful inflation and interest rates would be as low as 10 % each in a couple of years – some success .
So Guido is looking forward to James Tyler ’s speech tonight at Policy Exchange .
Little known outside the City ’s money markets – in which he is one of the largest and most invisible players – he is going to sound the cry for sound money in terms that Hayek would approve .
All is not lost – Russian and Chinese economic policy makers have read their Hayek – and are said to be preparing to propose a new , more Hayekian monetary order after this credit crisis has abated .
Sometimes it takes a crisis to precipitate a solution …
Amazing video of brand new suburban homes being razed by bulldozer .
Apparently , Guaranty Bank of Austin took over the homes in foreclosure - four in a suburban Texas development and another 12 in one suburb in California - and is knocking them down ostensibly to promote a " safe environment " for neighbors , and more likely because it is cheaper to destroy them them to keep them on their books .
This may be just the tip of the iceberg .
Once desired , suburban and ex-urban communities with cul - de- sacs , McMansions , and long commutes could be on their way to becoming the blighted and abandoned communities of tomorrow , accelerating the process Chris Leinberger documented in his eye - opening Atlantic essay of March 2008 .
A large and apparently growing share of mortgages are underwater according to this analysis in the Wall Street Journal , so we may expect more of this .
The economic crisis appears to be reshaping America 's economic geography in ways that work against the Sunbelt 's cities of sand and sprawl where real estate development became much more than a way to house workers , but a key driver of economic development itself .
Long ago , I asked my colleague , the esteemed urbanist and architect David Lewis , what he thought was the biggest issue of urban revitalization of our time .
He responded without hesitation that the eventual decline of sprawling , shoddily constructed , exurban communities would make the urban cores of cities like Philadelphia or even Detroit - with their compact infrastructure , dense neighborhood footprints , and authentic and historic structures - look like a walk in the park .
Not to mention that this entire development cycle is a giant waste of resources and a potential drag on long - run economic competitiveness and prosperity .

Beziers are easy - to - define curves .
Since one of their applications is in computer graphics , they were covered at GDC 09 by Squirrel Eiserloh .
Squirrel , by the way , gives a great presentation , and I ’m cribbing a lot from the approach his presentation used .
( Here ‘s a presentation on interpolating position , but it ’s not the one Squirrel used at GDC ) .
This article covers the just the beginning of Squirrel ’s talk .
I will probably cover more of it later .
( In this article , I do n’t even tell you what a Spline is ! )
Linear Beziers
All Bezier curves can be thought of as ways of describing the motion of a virtual pen as it travels from one point to another .
In its simplest form , the path from the start point to the endpoint is a straight line .
To describe a point moving along a line , you take a weighted average of the two endpoints .
In the beginning , time 0 , the pen is at the start point , [ x 1 , y 1 ] .
At time 1 , it ’s at the end , or [ x 2 , y 2 ] .
At time 0.5 , at the midpoint : [ ( 0.5 ) x 1 + ( 0.5 ) x 2 , ( 0.5 ) y 1 + ( 0.5 ) y 2 ] .
To find where you are at any other time t between 0 and 1 :
[ ( 1 - t ) x 1 + ( t ) x 2 , ( 1 -t ) y 1 + ( t ) y 2 ]
As t moves from 0 to 1 , the pen ’s position moves from the starting point to the endpoint .
This sliding weighted averaging is yet another example of linear interpolation , which was almost the title of this article .
Quadratic Beziers
This step contains the critical idea , which lets you build higher - order Beziers out of smaller ones .
The technique for drawing quadratic Beziers is to is linearly interpolate between a starting point and an endpoint , just as above , except that this time the start point and the endpoint are moving .
They have their own start points and endpoints , and use linear interpolation as above .
As you can see here , the start point ends at the same place the end point begins .
Let ’s call the start point [ x a , y a ] and the end point [ x b , y b ] .
Then the path the pen follows is this :
[ ( 1 - t ) x a + ( t ) x b , ( 1 - t ) y a + ( t ) y b ]
Since the start point and the end point are moving themselves , x a ( and the rest of those ) are variable , not constant .
Their movement is described in terms of their start points and endpoints , [ x 1 , y 1 ] , [ x 2 , y 2 ] , and [ x 3 , y 3 ] .
[x a , y a ] = [ ( 1 - t ) x 1 + ( t ) x 2 , ( 1 -t ) y 1 + ( t ) y 2 ]
[ x b , y b ] = [ ( 1 - t ) x 2 + ( t ) x 3 , ( 1 -t ) y 2 + ( t ) y 3 ]
The the position of the pen at time t comes from substituting these :
[ ( 1 - t ) ( ( 1 - t ) x 1 + ( t ) x 2 ) + ( t ) ( ( 1 - t ) x 2 + ( t ) x 3 ) ,
( 1 -t ) ( ( 1 - t ) y 1 + ( t ) y 2 ) + ( t ) ( ( 1 - t ) y 2 + ( t ) y 3 ) ]
= [ ( 1 - t ) 2x 1 + 2 ( t ) ( 1 - t ) x 2 + t2 x 3 ,
( 1 - t ) 2y 1 + 2 ( t ) ( 1-t ) y 2 + t2y 3 ]
Cubic Beziers and beyond
The key idea was taking two Beziers , in this case linear , and interpolating between them to create a meta-Bezier , in this case a quadratic Bezier .
You can use this idea to make a Bezier out of four points instead of three , by making a quadratic Bezier out of the first three points , then another quadratic out of the last three , and interpolating between those two to get a cubic Bezier .
This is the most common kind of Bezier in computer graphics .
Here ’s the math , sans motivation :
[ ( 1 - t ) 3 x 1 + 3 ( t ) ( 1 - t ) 2 x 2 + 3 ( t ) 2( 1 - t ) x 3 + t3 x 4 ,
( 1 - t ) 3y 1 + 3 ( t ) ( 1- t ) 2y 2 + 3 ( t) 2( 1-t ) y 3 + t3y 4 ]
Every GDC article I write has the goal of helping us do a better job at IMVU .
Since I want my articles to be relevant to a wider audience , I ’m separating out the IMVU tie-ins .
What follows is the IMVU - centric section of this post , which wo n’t be relevant to everyone .
For the rest of you , please enjoy the fuzzy kitten .
How can we use this at IMVU ?
Since most of our art is user - generated , it ’s the content creators , not us , who would want to learn about splines if they wanted to incorporate moving parts .
I expect that they already have tools that handle this kind of math for them .
But there ’s another use – the particle system .
Beziers – and later , splines – provide a simple , intuitive way to let users define curves .
Just place and drag around the control points , and the particles know how to curve from the beginning to the end .
There might be a good way to expose Bezier controls to content creators to help them define particles in their furniture or clothes .

BBC News , Rome
Rome 's underground Christian , Jewish and pagan burial sites , the Catacombs , date back to the 2nd Century AD .
There are more than 40 of them stretching over 170 km ( 105 miles ) .
But , until now , they have never been fully documented , their vast scale only recorded with handmade maps .
That is now changing , following a three - year project to create the first fully comprehensive three - dimensional image using laser scanners .
It is not a virtual image , it is not animation - what you are seeing is real data
Dr Norbert Zimmerman
A team of 10 Austrian and Italian archaeologists , architects and computer scientists have started with the largest catacomb , Saint Domitilla , just outside the Italian capital .
The tunnels , caves , galleries and burial chambers of Saint Domitilla stretch for about 15 km ( 9 miles ) over a number of levels .
At a time when Christians , in particular , were persecuted , the Catacombs became a relatively safe place to bury the dead .
The soft , volcanic tufa rock was an especially workable , yet durable , material that was burrowed out over the course of nearly three centuries .
Yet , because of concerns about safety , only about 500 m ( 1,640 ft ) are accessible to the public today .
Scanner
The new , moving , images of this entire underground system will change all that and open up this beautiful subterranean world in a way that it has never been seen before .
The scanner sends out millions of light pulses that bounce off every surface
The leader of the project , Dr Norbert Zimmerman of the Vienna Academy of Sciences , was behind the idea to use laser scanners to record every part of the Catacombs .
His scanner , which looks like a cylinder on a tripod , stands a metre or so high and is a piece of kit you usually find in the construction industry .
Gone are the days when archaeologists just used shovels , brushes and sieves to unearth the past .
The scanner has been placed in hundreds of different locations in the Catacombs .
It turns slowly , sending out millions of light pulses that bounce off every surface they come into contact with .
The light pulses rebound back into the scanner and are recorded on a computer as a series of white dots , known as a " point cloud " .
Gradually , every wall , ceiling , and floor is bombarded with the dots , enabling the computer to build up a picture of each room .
Paintings which have not been seen in nearly 2,000 years are now visible
Eventually , the computer completes a 360 - degree , three - dimensional , moving image of that room , with every surface looking like it is made up of small white dots .
At the same time a camera on the scanner takes a picture of each surface .
That information is also fed into the computer enabling colour to be added to " fill in " the dots .
' Real data '
When the process is finished , it looks like an actual film of the particular room in question .
In all , four billion dots were recorded , enabling practically the whole catacomb to be documented in this way .
Only a handful of small spaces were left out because it simply was not possible to get the scanner in .
The final result is astonishing .
The catacombs of Saint Domitilla stretch for about 15 km ( 9 miles )
On a computer screen , you can now see the whole underground complex .
Using different buttons on the key pad , you can zoom in on the tunnels .
You can travel " through " walls , down corridors and into chambers , giving the first real sense of its beauty , scale and detail .
Paintings on walls , which have not been seen in nearly 2,000 years , are now visible - their colours vivid and clear .
" It is not a virtual image , it is not animation - what you are seeing is real data , " says Mr Zimmerman .
I ask him why he did not just video the whole thing .
" Well , you could have filmed each room .
But that would not have given you the ability to ' travel ' through the catacomb in a way that the scanned images allow , " he says .
" Its moving , 3D flexibility , gives you the chance to compare areas , to assess the ways the Catacombs were developed over time , to analyse how and why those who built them did what they did , " he adds .
" That 's never been possible before . "
' Big job '
Mr Zimmerman and his team have nearly completed their work on the Saint Domitilla catacomb .
It is now back to Vienna to study the images in more detail .
Mr Zimmerman believes it would take years to map all of the Catacombs Dr Zimmerman says much of the work will be made available to the public .
Examining the images from the Saint Domitilla catacomb alone will keep them busy for the next year or so .
He has no plans to scan all the Catacombs .
" That is a big job , but it may well be needed if we are to really understand this incredible historical phenomenon and if we are to make a proper detailed study whilst these caves are still intact . "
" We will publish our findings to reveal , for the first time , just how impressive these tombs were and how the people of that time went to so much effort to bury their dead , " he says .

Someone stomped that boy nearly half to death .
And that is the thing with last week ’s trial of Charles Porter , which triggered an event that should not pass from our consciousness without noting its very , very rare occurrence .
Charles Porter is a 13 - year veteran of the Denver Police Department who one night last spring , on a gang - unit detail , believed he ’d seen Juan Vasquez , a 16 - year - old boy , swigging an alcoholic beverage in northwest Denver .
When he flipped on his flashing lights , the boy ran .
The chase was a short one .
In the end , the boy lay prone and handcuffed on the ground with several of his ribs smashed , his kidneys half - pulverized and his liver lacerated .
The cops , a month later , came for one of their own and arrested Porter on a felony charge of second - degree assault .
He went to trial a little more than a week ago .
A jury acquitted him Thursday .
Of course it did .
I would have fallen straight over had the verdict gone the other way .
Juries simply do not convict cops for the things they do on the streets , even when the misconduct is captured on videotape .
I long ago gave up fretting about the rightness or wrongness of this .
It just is .
The jurors in this case — and God bless them for their service — I believe felt they were sticking up for law and order in this town when they came back with their verdict .
Then , too , maybe they just figured the guy did n’t do it .
Here is why I ’m going with the former :
In Porter ’s case , two of his fellow officers , at least one junior to him , did that very , very rare thing , something I have never witnessed in all my years covering trials , including a few involving cops :
They testified against — yes , ratted out — their brother officer .
These two officers , both of whom were at the scene , looked the jurors in the eyes and swore under oath that Porter jumped up and down on the boy ’s back , turning his insides to virtual mush .
“ Officer Porter grabs hold of the fence with both hands , ” Officer Luis Rivera , who was partnered with Porter that night , testified .
“ He jumps up , raises his knees and lands with both feet on the kid ’s back . ”
He then demonstrated the jumping to the jury , the loud thud of each jump reverberating through the courtroom .
Back in their squad car , Rivera said he questioned Porter as to why he jumped on the kid .
“ Officer Porter said , ‘ I do n’t know why I do that .
It ’s just something I do lately .
I guess I just like the way they sound . ’ ”
A police officer testifies against you or me in such a manner , it is time to get our personal affairs in order ahead of reporting to jail .
“ There were other scenarios we could see that would have resulted in the same sort of injuries to the juvenile that would not necessarily have involved Officer Porter , ” the jury foreman told The Post after the verdict .
Other scenarios ?
It turns out the jury was vastly more interested in inconsistencies in the 16 - year - old ’s testimony than the consistency of the testimony of the two police - officer witnesses .
“ When you look at how ( the boy ) testified versus other statements he made , there were far more inconsistencies in his testimony , ” the foreman continued .
“ He had mentioned that it was more than one officer that committed the abuse .
He was the only one who said that in any of the testimony . ”
Of course , blame the kid .
How dare he not remember perfectly every detail from those moments when he was getting his guts stomped flat .
So they walked Charles Porter .
Yet someone stomped that boy nearly half to death .
In Denver more and more , such questions are always left just to hang , along with the stench of such asinine behavior , the smell of which now clings to every good cop on the beat .
No one is ever held accountable — well , if you do n’t count the taxpayers of the city and county of Denver , who in recent years have paid out multiple millions of dollars for bad , stupid and near - criminal police behavior .
Juan Vasquez and his family , you may know , in October got nearly $ 1 million richer from taxpayer money , courtesy of the Denver Police Department .
Here ’s to sticking up for law and order .

Kerstin Sjoden reports .
A win-win situation .
That 's what author Anders Rydell , who wrote a book about the Swedish piracy movement , calls the pending verdict in The Pirate Bay trial , due in on Friday .
Four men associated with the defiant BitTorrent tracking site are on trial for contributory copyright infringement .
Sam Sundberg and Anders Rydell ( right ) wrote the book , The Pirates - The Swedish File Sharers Who Plundered Hollywood .
Courtesy Anders RydellRydell followed The Pirate Bay for two years and he 's certain that no matter what , the pirates will come out on top .
If they win , it will be a sign that file sharing is not illegal .
If they lose , they 'll be martyrs .
Wired.com spoke to Rydell about the trial outcome .
Wired.com :
What would you say this trial is actually about ?
__ Rydell : __
On one level it's about a small technical detail , and about how much responsibility a service provider should take for illegal use of the service provided .
But there is a wider and more symbolic aspect , where a whole young generation is on trial .
This is a generational issue , a conflict between different ways of looking at and spreading culture .
Wired.com : Did anything about the trial surprise you ?
__ Rydell : __ I was surprised that The Pirate Bay site did n't clearly state their ideals and their view on copyright – the unlimited spreading of culture and media information .
They seemed to hold back and avoid the issue .
I think they feared it would be considered proof of intent to facilitate copyright infringement and that they would be judged on that .
Personally , I think it was a mistake .
The courtroom would have been a perfect arena to express their views .
Wired.com : Instead , they appeared a bit gutless ?
__ Rydell : __ Yes .
I think many people were disappointed , though their motives are understandable on a personal level .
They risk being in debt for the rest of their lives .
Wired.com : Musicians and songwriters have kept a low profile .
What 's your opinion on that ?
__ Rydell : __ I think it 's a huge credibility problem for the record companies that their spokesmen almost always are lawyers .
At least in Sweden , they 're up against non-profit pirates driven by ideological beliefs .
The lawyers are professionals ; they speak on their clients ' behalf and get paid for doing so .
In an argument , the pirates always win the credibility contest .
But I think we 're missing out on an important aspect :
The copyright holders need to start arguing their case .
Wired.com :
What do you expect will be the outcome of the trial ?
__ Rydell : __ Most people think that the defendants will be convicted in the district court .
Here , the main focus is usually the question of intent , but the problem is the technical evidence , and to show that there has in fact been a main crime .
During the trial , it was n't made clear whether the BitTorrent files used as evidence actually came from The Pirate Bay .
On a larger scale , the outcome of this trial wo n't be able to stop the ongoing development .
File sharing has made it easier to access culture , and business models are being adjusted to fit the new reality .
I 'm convinced that the business models will change faster than the laws .
In the end , we 'll have legislation with no real function , except for scaring people .
Wired.com : What would a conviction mean for The Pirate Bay ?
__ Rydell : __ Probably nothing , since the servers are not located in
Sweden .
I actually think this a win-win situation for The Pirate Bay .
If they 're convicted , they 'll be martyrs and the " piracy " movement will continue working for what they believe in , even more strongly .
If they win , the signal to the public is that file sharing is n't illegal and
The Pirate Bay will basically have achieved its goal .
On a personal level , of course , they can lose and be in debt for the rest of their lives .
Wired.com :
Do you see any signs of a compromise between the copyright industry and the pirates ?
__ Rydell : __
It 's important not to oversimplify ; there is no strict line between two sides .
Swedish studies show that half the musicians are file - sharing illegally themselves .
Many musicians , filmmakers and artists are annoyed that the copyright organizations tend to speak for all of them , while they themselves may feel closer to the piracy movement .
Recently we 've seen new services , such as the music streaming service Spotify , that many pirates like and use .
But the strong copyright organizations , like American film companies , have no plans to compromise .
Wired.com :
Why has Sweden become such a hot spot for piracy ?
__ Rydell : __ Sweden is historically a country of engineers .
We have a long tradition of export - based industry , with companies like
Ericsson , Volvo and Saab .
In the early '90s the country suffered one of its worst economic crises , and a lot of that industry disappeared .
Politicians decided that IT was the thing that would bring us out of the crisis .
Millions of Swedes got PCs through their jobs and the government made heavy investments in broadband infrastructure before even knowing what it was good for .
So Sweden got a very good internet and communication system early on .
Wired.com :
Why did you write your book ?
__ Rydell : __ Sam and I started working on the book after the raid against The Pirate Bay in 2006 , and realized early on that the Swedish piracy movement was unique ; it was the first time that pirates stood up for their ideals and expressed a will to change the system .

The Pirates - The Swedish file sharers who plundered Hollywood by Anders Rydell and Sam Sundberg , was released in January 2009 .
The book is not translated into English .
Consumers are n't the only ones angry about Time Warner Cable 's ( TWC ) plans to charge for Internet access based on usage .
Some politicians are also starting to campaign against the cable giant 's pricing experiments , which will begin in Austin and San Antonio , Texas ; Rochester , N.Y. ; and Greensboro , N.C. later this year .
" I do n’t like it at all , " Greensboro Mayor Yvonne Johnson said .
" I ’m not a happy camper about it .
I think it ’s bad for their customers and it ’s bad for the city . "
" Just at a time when access to information is driving our economic recovery , Time Warner is moving to stagnate the 21st Century technology needed to rebuild America , " said N.Y. Congressman Eric Massa .
We expect to hear more of this .
There 's probably nothing politicians can do directly :
There are no laws we know of requiring Time Warner Cable or any Internet provider to sell access for a flat fee .
And anyway , this is capitalism , and the cable company should be able to charge whatever it wants for any service -- with the risk of losing business .
( And if Time Warner is successful , this could boost its revenues and set an industry precedent . )
But politicians can raise hell .
And Time Warner -- which is now making its product more confusing , tedious , and expensive -- desperately can not afford to lose customers to competitors , especially Verizon and AT&T .

JFK assassination film hoax
A simple introduction
On November 22 , 1963 , U.S. President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed while traveling down Elm Street , Dallas , Texas , in an open car in a motorcade .
Everyone agrees about that .
Many people think that agencies of the U.S. Government have lied about or covered up details of the assassination .
For three decades , people thought the best proof of foul play was a 27 - second home movie of the assassination taken by a Dallas dressmaker , Abraham Zapruder .
It shows JFK ’s head being blasted backwards and to his left :
This seems to tell us that the shooter was in front of the car on the right side , on the “ grassy knoll ” ( small hill ) next to Elm Street .
But the U.S. Government insisted that JFK was shot by just one man hiding in a building far behind the limousine .
Things get more complicated when we look at the film frame - by - frame .
As the bullet hits , JFK ’s head first moves forwards :
This makes things confusing .
There seemed to be three possible explanations :
1 . He was hit by two bullets at almost the same time ( one from behind and then one from the front ) .
2 . He was hit from behind , and a jet of brain matter exploding from the front caused his head to recoil backwards .
3 . He was hit from behind and some sort of muscle reaction caused his head to fly backwards .
People tried to figure this out for three decades .
Instead of clearing up the mystery , Zapruder ’s film just made things more confusing .
In the 1990s , researchers started to realize that there was a fourth possible explanation .
Zapruder ’s film might also be a part of the lies and cover - up that agencies of the U.S. Government had weaved around the JFK assassination !
The Zapruder film was scientifically examined .
It was found that , while most of it looks completely genuine , some of the images are impossible .
They violate the laws of physics .
They could not have come from Zapruder ’s home movie camera .
Zapruder ’s film is a very good forgery .
It is almost perfect .
Some mistakes took almost 40 years to find .
It was scientifically proven that Zapruder ’s film could not be just changed a little bit .
For any of it to be altered in this way , the whole film must be created .
The whole film is a fake !
A movie film is just a strip of little photos ( “ frames ” ) .
The fake film was made by cutting and pasting real photos and film frames together to make new frames .
Because the Zapruder film is only 27 seconds long , less than 500 photos needed to be made .
The forgers had at least several months to create them .
Most were not published for a year after the assassination .
This would require sophisticated photographic work , but well within the technological capabilities of 1963 and 1964 .
People had been creating high quality fake photos since the 1850s !
But what about the people who watched Zapruder ’s film in the days after the assassination ?
Film experts believe that a real film of the assassination was quickly altered on the evening of the assassination , using machines that could create Hollywood - style special effects ( like Mary Poppins , created in 1964 ) .
Since the film was not shown on television , no one knows exactly what these people saw .
But we do know that they described a film that is different to the film published in November 1964 as the “ Zapruder film ” !
In May 2003 , scientists and researchers presented their latest findings at a conference in Duluth , Minnesota .
This has now been described in a book , The Great Zapruder Film Hoax , published in September 2003 .
The entire conference can also be viewed on YouTube .

The fast - forward mistakes
The blur mistake
The sign mistake
The lamppost mistake
The wound mistake
The blood mistake
A 2007 report by the International Committee of the Red Cross concluded that medical professionals helped the CIA torture detainees held at Guantánamo Bay prison and other " black sites " overseas , and said their participation in the abuse amounted to a " gross breach of medical ethics .
The report was kept secret until recently .
Snip from New York Times story :
Based on statements by 14 prisoners who belonged to Al Qaeda and were moved to Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , in late 2006 , Red Cross investigators concluded that medical professionals working for the C.I.A. monitored prisoners undergoing waterboarding , apparently to make sure they did not drown .
Medical workers were also present when guards confined prisoners in small boxes , shackled their arms to the ceiling , kept them in frigid cells and slammed them repeatedly into walls , the report said .
Facilitating such practices , which the Red Cross described as torture , was a violation of medical ethics even if the medical workers ' intentions had been to prevent death or permanent injury , the report said .
But it found that the medical professionals ' role was primarily to support the interrogators , not to protect the prisoners , and that the professionals had " condoned and participated in ill treatment . "
At times , according to the detainees ' accounts , medical workers " gave instructions to interrogators to continue , to adjust or to stop particular methods . "
The Red Cross report was completed in 2007 .
It was obtained by Mark Danner , a journalist who has written extensively about torture , and posted Monday night with an article by Mr. Danner on the Web site of The New York Review of Books .
Much of its contents were revealed in a March article by Mr. Danner and in a 2008 book , " The Dark Side , " by Jane Mayer of The New Yorker , but the reporting of the Red Cross investigators ' conclusions on medical ethics and other issues are new .
This is a follow - on fictional treatment to the three previous essays on secession available in my archives starting with " Good Morning , Mr. President . "
“ Any people anywhere , being inclined and having the power , have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government , and form a new one that suits them better .
This is a most valuable , a most sacred right — a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world .
Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government may choose to exercise it .
Any portion of such people , that can , may revolutionize , and make their own of so much of the territory as they inhabit . ”
~ Abraham Lincoln , ( speech in Congress January 1848 )
Idaho started the ball rolling and seceded from these united States .
A total dissolution of America quickly followed as schisms and fissures erupted across North America .
The collapse of the Mexican government caused a tidal wave of immigration to wash in to the southwestern portions of the former country .
The great financial collapse of the world economy centered on the fiscal and monetary mischief in DC and Wall Street added yet more fuel to the fire .
To tarnish the American reputation even more , hundreds of thousands of American troops were left stranded and penniless around the globe as the economic meltdown in America reduced the dollar to Zimbabwean valuations .
To make matters worse , the government in DC instituted blanket loyalty oaths as a precursor for repatriation of returning soldiers who had managed to get home .
This in turn caused entire National Guard and reserve units to return to their homes and assist in the buildup of forces in those states to fight the various doomed attempts by the central government to bring the rebellious states to heel .
The US followed in the footsteps of every other empire ; corruption , decay and imperial overreach both at home and abroad .
The District of Columbia still maintains a tenuous rump government known as the United States Socialist Republic ( USSR ) in control of the New England / Virginia states but power brownouts / blackouts , food shortages and insurgent activity have caused ambitions to whither to reunite the nation .
Rumors of gulags , reeducation camps , oppressive domestic population controls and blanket censorship remain a common narrative for refugees escaping from the USSR .
Repeated military strikes and adventures to bring the nation back to its original 2009 configuration failed and consequently , managed to cause the divisibility to exponentially expand .
Total combat losses for USSR forces are unofficially estimated at 156,000 killed and wounded and a half - million missing in action .
Excepting attempts by USSR guerillas to form pockets of resistance and insurrection , the entire effort has failed .
There is some speculation FSA and Alaskan acquisition of nuclear devices on former US bases within their respective borders caused the USSR to pause and retreat but this remains unconfirmed .
The country has fractured into both natural and uneasy alliances .
The west coast states formed a tight Green Coalition alliance in what is now Pacifica .
Idaho , Wyoming , Utah , Montana and Nevada have formed the Free State Alliance ( FSA ) confederation with very close relations with the Alaska Republic .
An immense brain - drain from Pacifica to the FSA has resulted from the ecotopian experiment .
The Dakotas remain on the fence as to whether they will join them or sign on with the Midwestern Alliance .
The Lakota Sioux will remain their own nation regardless .
The American South and Southwest are still in the throes of a multi- sided civil war .
Hawaii has reverted back to its roots with the inauguration of King Kamehameha VI and the annexation of all non-Hawaiian property back to the native islanders .
Quebec has broken away and fighting remains sporadic in the western Canadian provinces as the national government continues to press for its supremacy over the rebel Canadian states in the west .
There are reports of insurgent materiel and support from the Free State Alliance to British Columbia but these reports remain unsubstantiated .
Mexico has splintered into approximately ten separate states with alliances between the various 31 states that comprised Mexico ebbing and flowing on a daily basis .
While the USSR maintain strict drug prohibition , the decriminalization of drug laws in Pacifica and the Free State Alliance has significantly weakened the strength of the Mexican drug cartels to finance their activities .
Fears of meddling on the part of China , Russia and Middle Eastern states have appeared to be exaggerated as those nations grapple with their own economic and social collapse difficulties .
The rapid expansion of oil drilling unfettered by confiscatory taxation and regulatory nonsense from DC has caused an economic boom that may prove to leave both the Alaska Republic and the FSA as the North American " Tigers " economically .
The following interview was granted by Governor Lutrin of Idaho and broadcast on Voice of Liberty .
" Good morning , Governor . "
" Good morning , John . "
" Ten years ago , I suspect no one would have seen this transpire the way it has .
No one would have suspected that the map of America would be this different .
Do you think that this has been the outcome the Founders would have wanted ? "
" Hamilton would be apoplectic but I suspect that Jefferson would be pleased and , of course , Tom Paine and Sam Adams would see this as inevitable .
Why it took so long for the rotten structure to sunder itself , I will never know .
Mind you , I did not come into office anticipating this chain of events . "
" Has it been a rough ride for Idaho and the FSA ? "
" Quite frankly , we sensed that there was nothing easy about the fateful decision to get DC out of our state and out of our lives .
I was embarking on a journey that my great - great - great grandfather witnessed in South Carolina in 1860 and we were praying for better results .
To say that we were stepping into a void is an understatement .
Not everyone in the state agreed with our course of action but I was convinced the people hired me not only to represent them but to exercise my own moral compass and judgment much like the Founders when they seceded from the United Kingdom .
The death and destruction we suffered was tremendous as a result of both insurgents and US [ now USSR ] armed forces employed against us .
Possibly the only thing that kept us from getting overwhelmed was the disproportionate number of US troops deployed overseas and the concomitant crisis where the currency collapse caused many of them to be stranded in Indian country abroad .
That , of course , led to some bitterness .
Idaho had a reputation as a rather well - armed bastion but the ensuing guerilla conflict against the Federal forces was far more than they anticipated .
There were even several assassination attempts against me … "
" One of which you thwarted by killing the assassin yourself … "
" Well , I have always considered it sociopathic to outsource my self - defense to others so carrying a weapon was a daily routine even before the conflict …
I have to tell you that we would not have prevailed if other states such as Montana and Wyoming among others had not joined the fray .
I have to say that the number of murdered civilians by Federal forces tipped the war in our favor .
I can never mend those families but the massive indiscriminate firepower and total disregard for civilian casualties turned the tide against the Federal forces .
I would think that the failures of military effectiveness in Iraq and Afghanistan would have been a consideration but the war on Americans in their own country became a very bitter contest .
Federal units may have owned the roadways but once they started to step into the wilderness or hinterlands even in large formations they were picked apart and annihilated . "
" There are rumors of Federal forces still in Idaho and the FSA … "
" Very true but those incidents are getting more and more scarce as time passes .
Ironically , after the major hostilities ceased nearly six months ago , almost half the Federal forces in the region deserted and joined us once we had enjoined a treaty for repatriation of families and guarantees against reprisals with the DC government during secret talks . "
" Why were the talks secret ? "
" Six months into the conflict , currency collapses and corruption in DC had so stymied and hampered the war effort both here and abroad , they had no choice but to negotiate but they dare not do so in public or they would have lost electoral support and you know where a politicians ’ bread is buttered .
We got plenty of concessions and I was able to look the President in the eye and tell him : u2018 No , you ca n ’t !’.
We could have avoided the bloodshed if we had simply been granted a civil divorce per our request in the first place . "
" How would you characterize life in Idaho and the FSA now ? "
" Life is difficult especially for those who have lost family , homes and fortunes .
But we are rebuilding and we are free .
We now have our own private banking system employing real gold & silver to back the specie .
We have shut down and sold all Federal government property and are currently starting the second year cycle to bid out all Federal and State lands to private individuals and investors .
There is zero government money going into the education system .
Each of the Confederation members in the FSA , and Alaska for that matter , are experimenting with different levels of state governance .
In Idaho and Montana , for instance , all the timber interests subscribe to a private consortium for firefighting .
Would you invest in a timber enterprise that did not seek to protect their own investment ?
So we think the incentives are more reality - based instead of the perverse and corrupting laws DC forced upon us .
We have left it up to the counties and subsidiary units to figure out what works best .
The Federal Register has no weight here and all the courts are being privatized .
The only gun law remaining on the books is if the gun is used in the commission of a crime .
We have also imposed term limits on all politicians to one term in their lifetime .
Government is a nasty habit and it will take more than a year to kill the addiction but we feel that the competitive laboratories the states are creating will give us a running start to find the best path .
This is the greatest failure of DC rule ; it allowed no freedom of choice in so many areas of our lives .
We are now free to choose , fail and prosper .
We do n’t have all the answers .
For instance , we have eliminated all our drug laws on the books and have decriminalized possession , sale and production .
Utah has not , so we will see how that works out .
The remaining part - time politicians in the statehouse are even offered personal bounties for reducing or eliminating budget items .
I would much rather give a politician five percent of a one million dollar program than spend the money on the program in to perpetuity .
We are also basing their salaries on an inverse ratio .
In other words , the more money they vote to spend out of taxpayer ’s pockets , the lower their salaries and compensation .
Would I like to close the doors to the statehouse permanently ?
Sure , but we are n’t there yet . "
" Governor , one term means you are out next year .
What are your plans ? "
" To mind my own business . "
“ When all government , in little as in great things , shall be drawn to Washington as the Center of all power , it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated . ” ~ Thomas Jefferson

here is yet another way to try and make your Intel graphics card to work under Ubuntu Jaunty , by reverting to the xorg driver of Ubuntu Intrepid
1 .
System > Administration > Software Sources
Add
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/siretart/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
sudo apt - key adv -- recv-keys -- keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xce90d8983e731f79
2. Install the old Intel driver :
sudo apt - get update && sudo apt - get install xserver - xorg - video - intel - 2.4
3. Restart X by typing this in a terminal :
sudo / etc / init.d/gdm restart and see if the graphics performance from Intrepid is restored .
If the above workaround does not work for you , then you can go back to the Ubuntu Jaunty xorg :
1. Go to System > Administration >
Software Sources , on the second tab remove the 2 lines you added in step 1 from above .
2. Install the Xorg Intel Jaunty driver back :
sudo apt - get update && sudo apt - get install xserver - xorg - video - intel
3 . After installing xserver - xorg - video - intel , restart the computer with :
sudo reboot
You can see people posting the results of this workaround , here

As you can see , it helped a lot of people but obviously not all .
phyx for pointing the link
We already posted 2 solutions to help you with the Intel graphics driver in Ubuntu Jaunty and those 2 workarounds helped a lot of people : 1 . By whitelisting the Intel driver ( Intel graphic drivers 965 ( x3000 or x3100 ) ) 2 . Experimental video drivers repository
But of course , those did n't work for everybody , soGo to , on the second tab click " " and add the following lines :
Then , import the appropriate GPG key :
For Windows Vista users , more than 12,000 movie titles and television episodes are now available to be streamed onto your PC , and watched instantly via Netflix through Windows Media Center .

Microsoft has added Netflix accessibility directly in the Windows Media Center application , providing a Netflix section under the TV + Movies tab .
This means that users are able to not only stream movies and TVs instantly through the application , but also manage both their instant and DVD queues , and search / filter searches through the entire Netflix library without having to open up a browser to access the site first .
To further enhance the experience , these Netflix actions can also be controlled using any Windows Media Center - compatible remote control , allowing you to instantly watch movies without having to add them to your queue , and easily rewind and fast - forward during playback , thus transforming your personal PC into your own mini home entertainment system .
Claims of savings from health information technology , prevention , pay for performance , and comparative effectiveness research are politically attractive .
Their political appeal lies largely in the embrace of widely supported goals , including better health and improved quality of medical care .
In theory , these reforms — more research , more preventive screenings , and better organized patient data — sound like benign devices to moderate medical spending .
For many purposes , such reforms are substantively very desirable .
But these reforms are ineffective as cost - control measures .
Similarly , studies in the 1990s by the Congressional Budget Office and General Accounting Office found that single payer was the most cost effective way to get to universal comprehensive coverage .
So have repeated analyses by the Lewin Group of both State - based single payer proposals over the past 15 years , and in their recent comparison of congressional proposals for the U.S .
As Dr. Himmelstein is testifying today :
With President Obama and congressional leaders vowing to pass a health reform bill by the end of the year , a prominent Harvard - based health policy analyst warned a House subcommittee Thursday that the leading incremental models for reform , including those patterned after the Massachusetts plan , are incapable of containing skyrocketing health care costs or providing quality , affordable care to all .
" A single - payer reform would make care affordable through vast savings on bureaucracy and profits , " Himmelstein said in his statement .
" As my colleagues and I have shown in research published in the New England Journal of Medicine , administration consumes 31 percent of health spending in the U.S. , nearly double what Canada spends .
In other words , if we cut our bureaucratic costs to Canadian levels , we 'd save nearly $ 400 billion annually - more than enough to cover the uninsured and to eliminate co-payments and deductibles for all Americans . "
A national health insurance program would slash the enormous paperwork burden on hospitals , doctors and patients , Himmelstein said , resulting in hundreds of billions in savings that could be redirected to patient care .
Half - measures like those proposed by the Obama administration and key lawmakers like Senators Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) and Edward Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) , many of which mirror aspects of the Massachusetts reform of 2006 , can't match the savings of a streamlined , publicly financed system , he said .
Even if a " public plan option " emerges as part of the House and Senate reform bills , Himmelstein said , it wo n't be sufficient to challenge the inefficiencies and wastefulness of a multi- payer system : " A health reform plan that includes a public plan option might realize some savings on insurance overhead .
However , as long as multiple private plans coexist with the public plan , hospitals and doctors would have to maintain their costly billing and internal cost tracking apparatus .
Indeed , my colleagues and I estimate that even if half of all privately insured Americans switched to a public plan with overhead at Medicare 's level , the administrative savings would amount to only 9 percent of the savings under single payer . "
Citing his direct experience with the Massachusetts plan , which is facing critical financial problems , Himmelstein commented : " Prevention , disease management , computers and a health insurance exchange were supposed to make reform affordable .
Instead , costs have skyrocketed , rising 23 percent between 2005 and 2007 , and the insurance exchange adds 4 percent for its own administrative costs on top of the already high overhead charged by private insurers .
As a result , 1 in 5 Massachusetts residents went without care last year because they could n't afford it .
Hundreds of thousands remain uninsured , and the state has drained money from safety - net hospitals and clinics to keep the reform afloat . "
While the conventional wisdom in Washington is that single - payer national health insurance is " not feasible " and therefore " off the table , " public opinion polls have shown solid majorities continue to support such an approach .
In a survey published by the Annals of Internal Medicine a year ago , 59 percent of U.S. physicians said they favored government action to establish a national health insurance program , a 10 - percentage - point leap from only five years prior .
Richard Bradley reports :
Harvard has already halted the hiring of junior faculty and announced an early retirement program for tenured professors , and for the first time ever is considering laying off tenured professors .
And why might Harvard be laying off tenured professors ?
Because it ’s down to its last $ 25 billion , of course .
Bradley adds a bit to what we know about Harvard ’s financial mismanagement :
According to the university ’s 2008 financial report , in the next 10 years it must pay various private investors some $ 11 billion in capital commitments .
Where will that money come from if , as seems likely , endowment growth over those years is minimal or nonexistent , and alumni’s own strained budgets limit their generosity ?
These are the famous capital calls from Harvard ’s private - equity investments , which previous HMC managers assumed could be met out of earlier private - equity payouts .
Or something .
But now — and for the foreseeable future —
Harvard is facing a massive liquidity crunch :
HMC “ took the university right to the edge of the abyss , ” one alumnus , a financier who is privy to details of the university ’s balance sheet , told me .
I asked what he meant .
“ Meaning , you ’re out of cash .
“ That , ” he added , “ is the definition of insolvency . ”
Er no , actually it ’s the definition of illiquidity , but never mind .
The point is that Harvard has run out of liquid assets , and that ’s going to have huge effects on its institutional psyche — and possibly even on the job security of tenured professors .
My guess is though that no one with tenure will be laid off involuntarily .
And maybe Harvard ’s alumni might start giving a lot more now than they have in the past .
After all , until recently , any giving from alumni was dwarfed by the investment gains of the endowment , and so the incentive to add another drop to the bucket was greatly reduced .
Now , by contrast , cash from alumni is desperately needed to meet the university ’s annual liquidity requirements .
It might even feel better , giving money when you know it ’s going to actually be spent , rather than giving money simply to augment some gargantuan endowment .

Bolivia 's President Evo Morales says three foreigners have been killed after he ordered police to thwart a planned assassination attempt against him .
Security forces killed three alleged international mercenaries in the city of Santa Cruz , Mr Morales said .
He said intelligence reports had warned of an assassination plot by a group comprising foreign attackers .
Arriving in Venezuela for a summit , Mr Morales said two people had been arrested over the alleged plot .
Santa Cruz is a hotbed of opposition for Mr Morales , pictured
The three were killed in a half - hour shootout at the hotel in Santa Cruz , some 900 km ( 620 miles ) east of the capital La Paz , Mr Morales said .
" Yesterday , I gave instruction to the vice president to move to arrest these mercenaries and this morning I was informed of a half - hour shootout at a hotel in the city of Santa Cruz , " said Mr Morales .
" Three foreigners are dead and two arrested . "
He added that the alleged plot had been to kill him , Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera and a cabinet minister .
Foreigners killed
There were conflicting reports about the nationalities of those killed , with some reports saying they were from Hungary while others said they were from Romania and Ireland .
Some police sources said there were Bolivians among the alleged plotters .
The two who survived were arrested and taken to the country 's capital La Paz for interrogation .
Government sources said the group had links with extreme right - wing groups , associated with the opposition to Mr Morales ' leftist government , says the BBC's Bolivia correspondent Andres Schipani .
Speaking in La Paz , Mr Garcia said the men had been carrying guns and grenades and attacked police as they were approached , adding that documents about the alleged assassination attempts were found after the shoot - out .
Earlier reports suggested unknown assailants had attacked the home of the Roman Catholic Cardinal Julio Terrazas of Santa Cruz with dynamite .
Interior vice minister Marcos Farfan said Wednesday 's blast , which caused structural damage but no injuries , a " terrorist " act .
On Thursday of this week Mr. DeMint decided to throw a fit on the floor of The Senate in an effort to remove language from the stimulus bill that he referred to as " hostile to religion " .
Mr. DeMint is an idiot , but more on why later .
When I initially set out to write this piece the plan was to focus my anger on one particular Senator , Republican Jim DeMint of South Carolina .
First , there are a few other members of the Senate who need to be called out for their irresponsible and moronic actions , they actually supported DeMint 's uninformed attempt to amend the stimulus package for purely political reasons with a complete disregard for the American public .
At the top of the list is the all - time worst senator ever - Joe Lieberman .
Right behind the Jerk Extraordinaire are the two worst Democratic Senators currently serving in Washington , Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Evan Bayh of Indiana - both of whom we 've ripped into in the past here at The Stonecipher Report .
Glad to see those two keeping up the good work .
In addition to those three , we may have to add two more Democratic Senators to the short list of Republicans in disguise , both are from North Dakota - Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan .
They both voted for DeMint 's amendment and therefore have alerted the people of North Dakota that they care far more about public perception and cheap political tactics than they care about the actual welfare of their constituents .
Then of course there are the 37 other GOP senators who followed DeMint 's lead , but that was to be expected .
These are the remaining members of The Senate who believe that the past eight years have been just great .
Normally , I would cite what exactly my opposition to any legislation was before ripping into those who supported it , but that would cause most readers to become preoccupied with the issue and not the names involved as they continued to read .
In this case it is important to make sure that no one forgets which senators supported the moronic DeMint amendment - Joe Lieberman , Ben Nelson , Evan Bayh , Byron Dorgan , Kent Conrad and a bunch of Republican Senators .
Well , with that ugliness out of the way , it 's time for more ugliness : the idiocy behind the DeMint Amendment introduced on Wednesday .
Basically it all began with Pat Robertson ( I know , shocking ) .
His right - wing , non-profit law firm , the American Center for Law and Justice ( ACLJ ) released a statement claiming that the Democrats had slipped anti-religious and even anti-Christian language into the stimulus package bill .
To make a long story short , there is a provision in the bill that would prohibit Universities that receive stimulus money from using that money to build anything that would primarily be used as a religious facility , like a chapel ... or a mosque .
This is standard legislation , which has been a part of many Congressional bills for the past four decades .
In fact , in 1971 the Supreme Court OKed it .
This is not radical or controversial language , it is nothing more than a routine and simple guarantee that our tax dollars are not spent on the next Baha 'i temple .
Ya know , that separation of church and state thing .
Here 's the specific bit of language that is causing a stir :
No funds awarded under this section may be used for ... modernization , renovation , or repair of facilities ( i ) used for sectarian instruction , religious worship , or a school or department of divinity ; or ( ii ) in which a substantial portion of the functions of the facilities are subsumed in a religious mission .
Absolutely nothing in the above statement says that religious universities are ineligible for stimulus funds as many on the Right are claiming .
And not a word of the above language implies that Bible study or prayer will be banned by any institution that accepts stimulus money as Jay Sekulow , chief counsel for the ACLJ said .
The scope of the right - wing outcry about this is incredible .
A Google search for anti-religious stimulus returns literally millions of results with titles like " Democrats even hide anti-religion " legislation " in their so - called stimulus " , " Stimulus Bill Includes Hidden Anti-Christian Bigotry Section " or " Conservative Groups Lose Battle on Religious Discrimination " .
Reading all of this would lead one to believe that the Democrats ' sole mission was to destroy religion , but of course , as with most right - wing hysteria , a mountain is being made out of a molehill .
Or , more accurately in this case , a mountain is magically being crafted out of thin air .
None of this would be all that bad ( or surprising ) if it was simply a bunch of right - wing nuts on the lunatic fringe running around and hyperventilating about it .
Actually , that would be pretty standard , but now that this language has come dangerously close to being removed from one of the most important bills passed in the past decade , and now that the semi-mainstream media like FOX News is making an effort to link this language to some sort of secret , dark , anti-freedom of religion plan being slipped in by Barack Obama and the Democrats , it is time to shine the spotlight on these people .
If the 43 Senators who voted in favor of the DeMint Amendment actually understood what they voted for then our government is constantly teetering , just seven Senate votes away , on the edge of the abyss of complete and utter insanity .
On the other hand , if these jokers did not understand what they voted for , and simply saw something that looked good politically and said " OK " to it without figuring out what they were actually agreeing to , then they should all be removed from Congress immediately .
The actions of these 43 senators are reprehensible , and we should all take note of who they were .
So once again , in case you do n't remember who voted for Jim DeMint 's idiotic amendment yesterday , it was Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) , Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) , Evan Bayh ( D - IN ) , Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) , Kent Conrad ( D - ND ) and the following 37 Republicans :

HAMLIN , N.Y. ( AP ) --
State police say a man riding stolen all - terrain vehicles taunted them by cell phone , claiming he was using an untraceable phone and was too smart to be caught .
Turns out he was wrong on both counts .
Troopers have charged 25 - year - old Cory Dodson of Hamlin , near Rochester , with aggravated harassment for threatening to shoot a trooper during a series of phone calls in late February .
They say Dodson told a dispatcher he and his friends were riding stolen ATVs and claimed they were " way too smart " to get caught and the phone he was using could n't be traced .
Investigators say they were able to link the seven calls to Dodson , who was arrested March 6 .
Police did n't know Friday if he has a lawyer .
SUVA , Fiji , April 13 ( UPI ) --
Fijian soldiers have been granted the power to shoot civilians who express dissent over emergency rule imposed by the island 's president , observers say .
President Ratu Josefa Iloilo has declared a 30 - day state of emergency , expanding police powers and curbing the media after installing armed forces chief Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama as prime minister over the weekend , the Dominion Post reported Monday .

Iloilo has suspended the country 's constitution , and reports indicate residents were being detained without charge under emergency regulations , which give soldiers immunity from prosecution for using weapons to break up processions , meetings or assemblies , the newspaper said .
Bainimarama insists he wants to cleanse Fiji 's political system of corruption in order to create a society that is fair to both native Fijians and Indians , promising to hold elections in 2014 , the BBC said .
" They further isolate Fiji from the international community , they run the very grave risk of Fiji 's economic and social circumstances further deteriorating and , of course , to suggest that an election will be held in 2014 is nothing more than a sham , " Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith told the broadcaster .

CNBC ’s Rick Santelli argued last week that President Barack Obama ’s mortgage bailout plan would force hard - working Americans to pay for their neighbors ’ mistakes .
| Composite image by POLITICO Obama 's test : a nation of Santellis
When CNBC ’s Rick Santelli argued last week that President Barack Obama ’s mortgage bailout plan would force hardworking Americans to pay for their neighbors ’ mistakes , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs dismissed him as a know - nothing derivatives trader out of touch with Main Street .
But if the White House simply dismisses Santelli ’s point , it may do so at its peril : A Rasmussen poll released Monday found that 55 percent of those surveyed thought federal mortgage subsidies to those most at risk of losing their homes would be “ rewarding bad behavior . ”
Advertisement
Santelli ’s “ Network ” - style diatribe has already spawned a Facebook group and plans for “ tea parties ” protesting the bailout in major cities including Chicago and Washington .
Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey ’s group FreedomWorks has spun off a site called angryrenter.com to organize those who do n’t own their homes to oppose the mortgage plan .
And it ’s not just Republicans who are complaining .
Although Obama still floats on air among Democrats generally , he ’ll need to use Tuesday night ’s unofficial State of the Union address to build support for his housing plan even among members of his own party .
According to the Rasmussen poll , even 49 percent of Democrats oppose mortgage subsidies like the ones Obama has proposed .
Among them : Lynn Powers , 39 , a Bethesda , Md. , resident who describes herself as a “ liberal Democrat ” who has been hardworking , prudent and responsible — and now feels “ like a fool . ”
“ We were in the market , ” she says .
“ We put out eight bids and got outbid every time .
It was very upsetting for us .
I want to see some accountability and responsibility across the board .
The only way for me to have an affordable home , and I ’m not looking for a McMansion at all , is if we let the chips fall , in a sense .
This is still the bubble — the prices have to come down .
You ca n’t just subsidize some of the people .
I do n’t know how you deleverage .
It is going to be painful , but this is also hurting the people who behaved responsibly . ”
What does she mean by “ responsibly ” ?
“ People who did n’t overbuy .
Who stuck to their guns .
Who read their contracts , ” she says .
She and her husband wound up buying a 600 - square - foot studio and moved to a rental when they had their daughter , now 18 months old .
“ My husband and I paid for our cars in cash , ” she says .
“ We have no credit card debt .
We have no student loans .
I do n’t buy Starbucks , but that ’s because they ’re non-fair trade , nonenvironmental . ”
When they tried to buy a house , she said , “ We just felt outgunned . ”
And now , she says , “ I feel very outgunned as a citizen . ”
Another Maryland resident concurs : “ I am an Obama supporter , campaigned for him , baked cookies for him ; my husband and I are Democrats all the way , but this is the issue that gets our goat . ”
Echoing Santelli ’s complaint , a Silver Spring , Md. , mom who did not want her name used adds : “ I ’m not sure why we should work and pay for someone else to have a granite countertop or an extra bathroom . ”
When asked about people who had n’t overreached but had lost their down - ­payment money when the value of their homes had dropped , she replies , “ We put money in a 401 ( k ) , and we lost that money , and no one is going to give it back . ”
Rep. Bruce Braley ( D - Iowa ) , who founded the House Populist Caucus , says the president has actually gone “ to great lengths ” not to reward people who have been irresponsible , and that the plan is really an effort to stem another wave of foreclosures in order to stabilize the housing market , which would be to everyone ’s benefit .
Michigan Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm , also a Democrat , agrees : “ This is not directed at those who did n’t play by the rules , ” she says .
“ It ’s directed at trying to fix a system so everyone can stay in their homes and so that everyone ’s community is not negatively affected by the foreclosures that are popping up all over that neighborhood . ”
Still , notes Braley , “ I just do n’t think that that message has been said often enough and loud enough that people are starting to accept it as a justification of this plan . ”
Braley says he expects the president to “ go into more detail about how average homeowners are going to benefit on this ” during his speech to a joint session of Congress .
Like Braley , Alyssa Katz , author of “ Our Lot : How Real Estate Came to Own Us , ” a book due out in June about the making of the mortgage crisis , says she does not believe the message has come through clearly enough yet — and that the administration needs to do more to make sure it does .
“ Ultimately , yes , it ’s about homeowners , but it ’s about the stability of the financial markets , ” she says .
“ We have to give up this illusion that it ’s about you and me .
We have to accept , sort of blindly , the notion that we have to do this for the sake of the nation .
Whether you ’re lucky and get aid or you already lost your home and you ’re screwed , we ’re all in this together . ”

General Motors started building the first pre-production Chevrolet Volt electric vehicles today .
The significant milestone marks the first time engineers are assembling a vehicle that looks like the car slated to start rolling off an assembly line next year .
These cars , known as integration vehicles , are key to the Volt 's development because they are used to refine things like driving dynamics .
They also get shaken down and beaten up to ensure the range - extended EV is road - ready .
So far all we 've seen are prototypes and test mules based on the Malibu and Cruze like the one we drove last month .
The cars GM started building today at its technical center outside Detroit are the real deal .
" The purpose for the integration vehicle builds is two - fold , " GM spokesman Rob Peterson told Wired.com .
" First , they validate our production design , vehicle safety and performance capabilities .
Just as important , the build activity provides valuable insight into the final vehicle assembly process to ensure a high - level of build quality and manufacturing efficiency when production begins in November 2010 . "
Engineers will assemble the first of the integration vehicles by hand , a process that will take about two weeks .
Production will ramp up to a rate of 10 a week by mid-July , and Peterson says GM plans to have 80 cars on the road by fall .
Early next year , GM will begin building " several hundred " more pre-production vehicles at the Detroit - Hamtramck Assembly plant that will produce the Volt we 'll see in showrooms by the end of 2010 .

Wasserman Schultz announcing last year that she and her puppet would not be supporting Miami - Dade Dems against Cuban congressional fascists
The folks in Tallahassee seem to love him -- the media , his fellow Dems , even Republicans who respect the way he plays the game .
Gelber 's biggest problem is that regular folks are sick of the game altogether .
Gelber may be smart and quick - witted .
But in the minds of most , he 's still just another Tallahassee politician .
And those guys are a dime a dozen .
( And that 's when you 're paying the sticker price . )
As you may know I have decided to step back from my U.S. Senate bid .
I wanted to let you know the reasons .
When Governor Crist announced he would be a candidate for US Senate , he created a domino effect that opened up every seat on the cabinet .
At a time when our state is facing its greatest challenges , ironically , we have our greatest uncertainty and dislocation .
But I believe this is also an opportunity - – the chance to set a new course that avoids the mistakes of the past and tracks a better future for our families .
It makes little sense -- when we do face the prospect of real change in Florida -- for me to participate in a potentially divisive primary for U.S. Senate that will only serve to diminish our chances against a very formidable and well - known Republican nominee .
I also believe that we have a historic opportunity here in Florida to reshape the political landscape and more importantly , bring fundamental change to Tallahassee .
I have had a number of conversations with Senators Graham and Nelson , and CFO Alex Sink , about how we can best unify our party and move forward with a slate of candidates that can communicate our vision for a better Florida , and I look forward to continuing these discussions .
It looks like there wo n't be a progressive in the race for Florida 's open Senate seat after all .
At tonight 's Jefferson Jackson Dinner state Senator Dan Gelber withdrew , presumably to run for Attorney General .
That leaves a corrupt Democratic Party hack with virtually no chance to win , Kendrick Meek , as theopponent to either Charlie Crist or Marco Rubio .
Two weeks ago in the Scott Maxwell predicted that in the end it would be a race between Meek and Crist .
He never thought Gelber had any chance .
Another startlingly mediocre Democratic House member , Corrine Brown of Jacksonville , is also making noises about running for the Senate seat .
It 's unlikely she 'll make the jump though .
Meek has wrapped up all the Inside the Beltway support and has raised a fortune .
What a tragedy !
Dan Gelber sent a letter to supporters this morning explaining his decision and hinting at his future plans :

Microsoft killed Netscape , but Google wo n't be as easy to bring down .
And if Android Desktop Edition or Android Netbook Edition is in the works , things may get hairy for Redmond .
Perhaps Microsoft was right all along .
In the 1990s , it saw the new kid on the block , Netscape , as a threat , and did what it could to destroy the upstart .
With Google , the ' Softies wo n't be so lucky .
Most of you have heard the story about Netscape Communications , but let me summarize for the newcomers : Netscape was the first serious improvement to the Internet browser , and it grew like crazy , pretty much dominating the scene overnight .
Then out of the blue , Marc Andreessen ( the man credited with developing the product ) decided to blow smoke about how this would eventually lead to the end of Microsoft .
He was vague as to how it would lead there , but Microsoft determined that it had something to do with thin - client , browser - based computing somehow taking over everything .
Microsoft went into high gear , bought up a slew of little Internet companies and a minor browser company , and rolled out Internet Explorer as a freebie .
This was important .
The business plan for Netscape was based on selling the browser , but Microsoft was going to give away Explorer forever and bundle it with every new system .
That was pretty much the end of Netscape , which eventually morphed into Mozilla 's Firefox , a nonprofit browser that makes its money off its little Google search box .
The destruction of Netscape was awesome , Microsoft 's " peak oil , " as it were .
The company was under the gun after that from various antitrust initiatives , and has never really been the same since .
Now it is indeed vulnerable despite its overwhelming market share .
The new kid on the block today is Google , and everyone knows it .
But Google did n't make Netscape 's mistakes .
The company has never claimed to be targeting Microsoft .
Google mostly says it is interested in search and whatever else its minions create .
Its approach is far different from that of any company Microsoft has ever encountered .
First , Google has remained warm and fuzzy , with its cute name , cute logo , and cute gimmicks .
Microsoft has never owned a fleet of jets featuring a 767 .
But to remain warm and cuddly , the 767 is called the Google party plane .
Yay , a party !
The company also took a lesson from the early days of Yahoo , when keeping it simple was the key to success .
Google just does search better than anyone else , and that 's it for now .
Of course , there are Google Docs , Gmail , and other " cloud computing " initiatives that Microsoft is watching warily .
Just as Microsoft throws its weight behind the notion of the cloud , Google says it will build a client - side version of Gmail so people can go through their mail the way an Outlook customer can .
Before that it rolls out the beta of an entirely new smartphone .
It 's one little thing after another .
Nothing quite consolidated , just little experiments .
All along I keep hearing talk about a Google OS , probably based on Linux .
Yet there 's no real evidence that the company would do such a thing .
Still , it is on the phone ; what would it take to port to a netbook ?
Well that 's what a lot of people are beginning to ask .
Linux suffers from a flavor - of - the - month complex , where the best Linux distro comes and goes .
For years , the Linux community has resigned itself to not competing with Windows and the Mac OS  this despite the fact that the Mac OS is , like Linux , Unix - based .
What if Google tried to be that competition ?
With its resources , could Google take over the OS business and push Microsoft up into the miserable enterprise computing scene , where it could take the place of the old dinosaurs while Google and Apple get to do all the fun stuff ?
And how would Google make money from this effort ?
Linux is open - source , after all , and selling copies or even licensing Linux is problematic .
Well , how about a Google - branded computer ?
I 've always wondered why Microsoft , the dominant software company , could never manage a branding program for its OS that was more than a crummy sticker stuck on a machine as an afterthought .
Where is the " Microsoft Windows Computer by HP , " for example ?
Had Microsoft followed a branding strategy with a reference design computer ( in collaboration with Intel or AMD ) that could be licensed , the company would n't have gotten into trouble for bundling Internet Explorer , for example .
That approach would have changed the way the game was played .
But Microsoft long since missed that boat .
Google can still release an Android Desktop or Android Netbook , or whatever .
I 'd like to see it .
The topper would be offering Microsoft an opportunity to do MS Office for Android .
That would be rich .
This possibility all stems from the fact that Microsoft seems to have lost its way , coasting on its main cash cows and unable to do anything else confidently .
To end on a positive note for Microsoft , I 've believed for years that the company can effectively counter all this momentum by itself embracing Linux and doing a fully supported MS - Linux as a kind of competitive jujitsu .
It 's the only long - term solution to this slow death we seem to be observing .
Meanwhile , look for Google to step things up shortly .
Using NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope , an international team of astronomers have found that at least 1 in 100 white dwarf stars show evidence of orbiting asteroids and rocky planets , suggesting these objects once hosted Solar Systems similar to our own .
Team member Dr Jay Farihi of the University of Leicester will present this discovery on Monday 20th April at the European Week of Astronomy and Space Science conference at the University of Hertfordshire .
White dwarf stars are the compact , hot remnants left behind when stars like our Sun reach the end of their lives .
Their atmospheres should consist entirely of hydrogen and helium but are sometimes found to be contaminated with heavier elements like calcium and magnesium .
The new observations suggest that these Earth - sized stars are often polluted by a gradual rain of closely orbiting dust that emits infrared radiation picked up by Spitzer .
The data suggest that at least 1 % to 3 % of white dwarf stars are contaminated in this way and that the dust originates from rocky bodies like asteroids ( also known as minor planets ) .
In our Solar System , minor planets are the left over building blocks of the rocky terrestrial planets like the Earth .
The Spitzer results imply that asteroids are found in orbit around a large number of white dwarfs , perhaps as many as 5 million in our own Milky Way Galaxy .
NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope set its infrared eyes upon the dusty remains of shredded asteroids around several dead stars .
This artist 's concept illustrates one such dead star , or " white dwarf , " surrounded by the bits and pieces of a disintegrating asteroid .
These observations help astronomers better understand what rocky planets are made of around other stars .
Image : NASA / JPL - Caltech
The new findings indicate the dust is completely contained within the Roche limit of the star -- close enough that any object larger than a few kilometres would be ripped apart by gravitational tides ( the same phenomenon which led to the creation of Saturn 's rings ) .
This backs up the team ’s hypothesis that the dust disks around white dwarfs are produced by tidally disrupted minor planets .
In order to pass this close to the white dwarf , an asteroid must be perturbed from its regular orbit further out – and this can occur during a close encounter with as yet unseen planets .
Because white dwarfs descend from main sequence stars like the Sun , the team ’s work implies that at least 1 % to 3 % of main sequence stars have terrestrial planets around them .
Dr Farihi comments .
“ In the quest for Earth - like planets , we have now identified numerous systems which are excellent candidates to harbour them .
Where they persist at white dwarfs , any terrestrial planets willlikely not be habitable , but may have been sites where life developed during a previous epoch . “
Perhaps the most exciting and important aspect of this research is that the composition of these crushed asteroids can be measured using the heavy elements seen in the white dwarf .
Dr Farihi sees this as a crucial step forward .
“ With high quality optical and ultraviolet observations ( e.g. the Hubble Space Telescope ) , we should be able to measure up to two dozen different elements in debris - polluted white dwarfs .
We can then address the question , “ Are the rocky extrasolar planets we find similar to the terrestrial planets of our Solar System ? ”
From Cryptosmith :
The NSA had an incinerator in their old Arlington Hall facility that was designed to reduce top secret crypto materials and such to ash .
Someone discovered that it was n’t in fact working .
Contract disposal trucks had been disposing of this not - quite - sanitized rubish , and officers tracked down a huge pile in a field in Ft. Meyer .
How did they dispose of it ?
The answer is encrypted in the story ’s text !
The story sounds like it ’s from the early 1960s .
The Arlington Hall incinerator contained a grating that was to keep the documents in the flames until reduced to ash .
The grate failed , and “ there was no telling how long the condition had persisted before discovery . ”

' I feel great , ' says five - year - old Mexican boy living near ' ground zero ' pig farm who may hold the key to swine flu outbreak
The five - year - old boy who is the earliest confirmed victim of swine flu so far has said he feels ' great ' .
Edgar Hernandez - who has since recovered - fell sick on April 2 - nearly two weeks before anybody even knew the virus existed .
' I feel great , ' he said today .
' But I had a headache and a sore throat and a fever for a while .
I had to lie down in bed . '
First survivor ?
Edgar Hernandez , four , at his home in La Gloria - where he survived swine flu
His mother , Maria , 34 , said : ' I have very good faith in God , but I was so worried .
I could n't sleep because I had to be by his side taking care of him all the time . '
Edgar is from the village of La Gloria , whose residents say officials ignored their warnings of an unexplained outbreak for weeks .
A staggering 60 per cent of the 3,000 residents of La Gloria - which lies in the shadow of a massive U.S - owned pig farm - reported getting sick , including three children aged under two , who later died .
Villagers say state officials and factory bosses claimed the outbreak was caused by chilly weather and dust in the air .
Although many others fell ill earlier than Edgar , none have yet been confirmed as having had swine flu .
By last night , the overall death toll in Mexico stood at 152 .
The youngster 's case came as more than 450 members of the community claimed they were suffering respiratory problems and symptoms similar to swine flu .
Locals gather outside Edgar 's house in La Gloria as they await state governor Miguel Herrera yesterday
They claim they are ill from contamination spread by pig waste at nearby breeding farms partly owned by a U.S. company .
Edgar was treated in hospital and is now recovering , but two infants from the area died .
Mexico's Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova told reporters a sample taken from a 4 - year - old boy in Mexico 's Veracruz state in early April tested positive for swine flu .
However , it is not known when the boy became infected .
As far back as late March , roughly one - sixth of the members of this community of 3,000 in the Gulf coast state began suffering from severe respiratory infections .
They say they can directly trace the infections to a farm that lies upwind five miles ( 8.5 kilometres ) to the north , in the town of Xaltepec .
Victor Calderon , General Director of pig farms run by Granjas Carroll de Mexico , speaks to the press outside Edgar 's home in La Gloria .
Locals claim the farms are ground zero for the outbreak
Mexican officials say they have n't determined the origin of the country 's swine flu outbreak , which has caused at least 20 deaths so far .
But Jose Luis Martinez , a 34 - year - old resident of La Gloria , said he knew the minute he heard about the outbreak on the news , with symptoms including a fever , coughing , joint aches , severe headache and , in some cases , vomiting and diarrhea .
' When we saw it on the television , we said to ourselves , ' This is what we had , '' he said .
' It all came from here .
...
The symptoms they are suffering are the same that we had here . '
Martinez and Bertha Crisostomo , a liaison between the villagers and the municipal government of Perote to which La Gloria belongs , say half of the people from the town live and work in Mexico City most of the week .
That means they could easily have spread the swine flu in the capital , where the largest number of cases have been reported .
Edgar lives in La Gloria - where many residents commute to Mexico City
Granjas Carroll de Mexico , 50 per cent owned by Virginia - based Smithfield Foods , Inc. , has eight farms in the area .
Smithfield spokeswoman Keira Ullrich said the company has found no clinical signs or symptoms of the presence of swine influenza in its swine herd or its employees working at its joint ventures anywhere in Mexico .
Residents say they have been bothered for years by the fetid smell of one the farms which lies upwind of the community and suspect their water and air has been contaminated by waste .
When an Associated Press team entered the farm on Monday , cars were sprayed with water .
Manager Victor Ochoa required the visitors to shower and don white overalls , rubber boots and masks before entering any of the 18 warehouses where 15,000 pigs are kept .
Ochoa showed the journalists that a black plastic lid covered a swimming pool - size cement container of pig feces , to prevent exposure to the outside air .
' All of our pigs have been adequately vaccinated and they are all taken care of according to current sanitation rules , ' Ochoa asserted .
' What happened in La Gloria was an unfortunate coincidence with a big and serious problem that is happening now with this new flu virus . '
Martinez said residents have been fighting for years to force the company to improve their pig - waste management .
Mexican news media reported that a municipal health official traced the source of a disease outbreak in La Gloria to a type of fly that reproduces in pig waste .
Local health officials and Federal Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova downplayed claims that the swine flu epidemic could have started in la Gloria , noting that of 30 mucous samples taken from victims of respiratory diseases there , only one - that of Edgar Hernandez - came back positive .
Cordova insisted the rest of the community had suffered from a common influenza .
Mexican Agriculture Department officials said yesterday that its inspectors found no sign of swine flu among pigs around the farm in Veracruz , and that no infected pigs have been found yet anywhere in Mexico .
However , the inspections may have been less than complete : Ochoa , the farm manager , said no one from the government has inspected his farm for swine flu .
Juan Lubroth , an animal health expert at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome , supported officials ' assessment of the pig situation and said there is no evidence of sick or dying swine in Mexico .
Lubroth noted that Mexico has a surveillance system that previously eliminated an unrelated disease from the country 's commercial pig population , which he said is a good indication that they also are conducting adequate reviews of pigs for swine flu .
Dr. Alejandro Escobar Mesa , deputy director for the control and prevention of disease for the state of Veracruz , said the epidemic in La Gloria was a combination of viral and bacterial illnesses , caused by an unusually dry climate .
' The dust dries up the mucous membranes and facilitates environmental conditions for the transmission of illnesses , ' Escobar said .
But residents here say they are certain that Edgar Hernandez was not the only swine flu victim in their town .
Concepcion Llorente , a first - grade teacher in La Gloria , says authorities still owe the town some answers .
' They said that what we had here was an atypical flu , but if the boy tested positive for swine flu , where did he get it from ? '
This title maybe misleading but the intention is pretty peaceful !
Legend has it that after the World War II got over , American pilot Gale Halvorson airdropped candies in the name of hope , for the Berlin children .
War equals devastation , so dropping candies instead of bombs was probably personal retribution .
Inspired by this incident , designer Hwang Jin wook and pals have come up with a plan to combat deforestation and desertification of land in a similar fashion .
Their mission is called “ Seedbomb . ”
Mission Seedbomb involves a bomber aircraft and charges full of the Seed Capsules .
Essentially the project involves artificial dispersal of seeds over arid areas where natural vegetation has lapsed due to man-made follies like deforestation leading to desertification .
Each capsule contains artificial soil and seeds , and are air - dropped over the selected regions .
Housed in biodegradable plastic , the artificial soil provides nourishment and moisture to the seed ; till it grows out to be a strong enough plant to sustain itself .
As the sapling matures , the plastic capsule melts away , leaving behind a brand new generation .
Sounds like Mission ( im ) Possible to me , however the logistics of desert environment and the kind of seeds to be dispersed will require a lot research and expertise from the botanists .
Because once the capsule melts away and the artificial soil ’s nourishment and moisture used up , it ’ll take a lot of effort on the plant ’s part to survive the harsh environment .

Ellie Banks can now eat pizza Ellie Banks loves her food , but for the last decade she has had chronic acid reflux ( severe heartburn ) and has had to watch what she eats .
Pizza has been out , so have spicy foods and even wine .
" I have n't been able to eat so many things , " said the press officer , from Stoke .
Then at the end of last year Ellie was given surgery called a laparoscopic fundoplication .
Safer surgery
The operation involves wrapping a piece of the stomach around the oesophagus to create a new valve to prevent acid backing up from the stomach .
It used to be done by opening up the chest cavity , but with the advent of keyhole surgery it is now a lot safer .
My life was put on hold
Ellie Banks
There have been calls for the operation to be more widely available .
Ellie says the operation has transformed her life .
" I could just not get to sleep and kept waking up all night in absolute agony , " she said .
" If I had eaten pizza or had had wine or anything like that it would hurt like hell and I would bring the food up .
It was really quite vile .
Taking action " I saw loads of different doctors for about 10 years until they actually sent me to see a specialist .
" They gave me some tablets , but said there was nothing they could do about it .
" Because I was quite skinny and it is usually larger people who get it , they did not think I had the same problem .
" I cut down my drinking and started eating more healthily , but it did not make any difference .
Proton pump inhibitors are the standard treatment for reflux " I did not want to be dependant on the tablets and did not like putting them into my body every day . "
But Ellie said things moved very quickly when she went to see her new GP .
" He sent me for tests and then they put a tube down my nose and every time I ate I had to press a button to measure the acid .
" They said the acid was horrendous and put me in for the operation " It was completely life changing . "
Research data NHS research by the University of Aberdeen recently found good results following surgery .
A year after keyhole surgery , only 14 % of patients were still taking medication , compared with 90 % of those treated with drugs alone .
HEARTBURN
A painful and burning sensation in the oesophagus , just below the breastbone usually associated with regurgitation of gastric acid
It is a very common condition with 20 % of the population experiencing it at some point in their lives
Those at the more severe end of the spectrum can end up taking tablets for the rest of their lives A trial of 800 patients suggested that the surgery should now be done more routinely in patients with chronic acid reflux .
The results so far suggest the procedure , although expensive at £ 2,000 per patient , is cost - effective because reflux sufferers no longer have to take medication and their quality of life improves .
But the researches are continuing to follow the patients for five years to check the benefits are long - term .
Professor Roger Jones , head of general practice at King 's College London and chair of the Primary Care Gastroenterology Society , said he had a number of patients contacting him recently and asking for the surgery , but he said some GPs still knew little about the technique .
" I think it does not always cross GPs ' minds that hospitals are doing this , " he said .
" But it is quite an important message to get out to GPs that patients who require long - term treatment with severe symptoms this is something that they ought to consider . "

It may be possible to control stem cells with a magnet Doctors may soon be able to patch up damaged bones and joints anywhere in the body with a simple shot in the arm .
A team at Keele University is testing injectible stem cells that they say they can control with a magnet .
Once injected these immature cells can be guided to precisely where their help is needed and encouraged to grow new cartilage and bone , work on mice shows .
The aim is to treat patients with injuries and arthritis the UK National Stem Cell Network conference heard .
The ultimate aim is to repair cartilage and bone
Professor Alicia El Haj
Keele University Professor Alicia El Haj , working with Professor John Dobson , also of Keele University , says the technology , patented by Magnecell , could be tested in humans within five years .
It would provide a way to treat disease without invasive surgery or powerful drugs .
The injection would use the patient 's own stem cells , harvested from their bone marrow .
These mesenchymal cells would be treated in the lab to give them a coating of minute magnetic particles .
Use in scans
These same magnetic nanoparticles are already approved in the US where they are routinely used as an agent to make MRI scans clearer to read .
Targeted magnetic fields could then move the cells around the body to the desired place and switch them into action without the need for drugs or other biochemical triggers .
Professor Al Haj said : " The ultimate aim is to repair cartilage and bone .
We have been able to grow new bone in mice .
Now we will look at whether we can repair damaged sites in goats .
" We should be able to move to human trials within five years . "
Professor Jon Tobias of the Bone Research Society said : " Stem cells capable of regenerating diseased bones and joints can now been isolated and grown up outside the body , but the difficulty is in getting them to exactly the right place .
" The technique developed by the team at Keele University , in which small magnetic particles are introduced into cells in the laboratory , represents an interesting approach to this problem , by raising the prospect of using magnets outside the body to manoeuvre cells into position . "
Meanwhile , experts at the University of Southampton , led by Professor Richard Oreffo , have treated four patients with hip joint problems using stem cell therapy .
The technique combines the patients own bone marrow stem cells with donor bone cells to patch - repair damaged bones that would otherwise need treatment with metal plates and pins .
They say it is only a matter of years before their method could be used routinely to treat some of the 60,000 people who fracture a hip in the UK each year .

This is incredible but not surprising news .
Robert Windrem , who covered terrorism for NBC , reports :
* Two U.S. intelligence officers confirm that Vice President Cheney ’s office suggested waterboarding an Iraqi prisoner , a former intelligence official for Saddam Hussein , who was suspected to have knowledge of a Saddam -al Qaeda connection .
* The former chief of the Iraq Survey Group , Charles Duelfer , in charge of interrogations , tells The Daily Beast that he considered the request reprehensible .
* Much of the information in the report of the 9/11 Commission was provided through more than 30 sessions of torture of detainees ... read on
Read the entire story .
What this report says is that the Bush administration took an active role in how torture was being used and their purposes were purely political and not to keep America safe .
Richard Wolffe says the same thing to Nora on MSNBC .
Cheney and his band of inquisitors wanted to find something that could justify the Iraq war to the American people after all the lies were uncovered for us to see .
And there was nothing .
NO WMD's in Iraq and no connection between Saddam and al - Qaeda .
Cheney willingly promoted the use of torture for his own political gains .
Wow .
He should be prosecuted just for that action because he even violated the CIA torture memo guidelines .
Cheney knows this information is going to come out so he 's taking to the airwaves to try and turn the discussion all around .
Lawrence Wilkerson has come out and said this :
Lawrence Wilkerson essentially confirmed this today .
Likewise , what I have learned is that as the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May of 2002 -- well before the Justice Department had rendered any legal opinion -- its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al - Qa'ida .
So furious was this effort that on one particular detainee , even when the interrogation team had reported to Cheney 's office that their detainee " was compliant " ( meaning the team recommended no more torture ) , the VP 's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods .
The detainee had not revealed any al - Qa'ida - Baghdad contacts yet .
This ceased only after Ibn al - Shaykh al - Libi , under waterboarding in Egypt , " revealed " such contacts .
Of course later we learned that al - Libi revealed these contacts only to get the torture to stop .
There in fact were no such contacts .
( Incidentally , al - Libi just " committed suicide " in Libya .
Interestingly , several U.S. lawyers working with tortured detainees were attempting to get the Libyan government to allow them to interview al - Libi .... )
Did you notices that there was very little media coverage if any on al - Libi 's suicide ?
It 's like he never even existed for the Villagers .
Red Hat and Georgia
Tech have published the results of a collaborative research project which attempted to measure relative open source software adoption by region .
The study illuminates open source hot spots and provides some insight into where the development model is most prevalent .
The report quantifies open source activity and also provides some statistical insight into the potential for growth in open source adoption for each region .
The factors used to evaluate the level of open source mojo in each region include government procurement and research policies , the number of Red Hat Certified Engineers and registered Linux users , the volume of discussion about open source topics in regional media , and Linux localization support for the region 's dominant language .
These statistics were used as the basis for formulating a global open source activity index .
Countries are ranked by overall activity and scores are also provided to indicate the level of open source adoption in government and industry .
Europe ranks high in the global index , which lists France , Spain , and Germany as the countries with the highest level of open source activity .
The United States came in ninth place .
The following is a list of the top ten and their respective scores :
France ( 1.35 ) Spain ( 1.07 ) Germany ( 1.05 ) Australia ( 1.04 ) Finland ( 1.03 ) United Kingdom ( 1.00 ) Norway ( 0.95 ) Estonia ( 0.89 ) United States of America ( 0.89 ) Denmark ( 0.79 )
The data can be explored interactively in a Web - based map made available by Red Hat .
You can click individual countries to see their ranking and scores .
The raw data and published reports are available from the same website .
A summary paper which describes the methodology of the research project indicates that the report is still a work in progress and acknowledges that " missing values are prevalent in the dataset and , unfortunately , require difficult choices and compromises in order to produce in index . "
Like most studies of this nature , it lacks authoritative clarity but provides useful insights within the boundaries of statistical rigor .
Despite the limitations of the methodology , the study demonstrates that open source is a global phenomenon that is having a broad impact on public policy and commercial IT .
" As the study indicates , open source is thriving across the globe , " said Dr. Paul M.A. Baker , the research director of Georgia Tech 's Center for Advanced Communications Policy .
" In keeping with the open source model , we see this study as a starting point and look to others to continue to build on the information contained in the study to make it more comprehensive and reflective of the expansion of the open source software model . "
The results of the study shed light on where the open source software movement is strongest .
As the project evolves , it could provide a useful framework for illuminating the regional prevalence of other emerging trends in open source software .
Permaculture landscape design takes account of the energies and forces affecting a design site through sector analysis .
Prevailing on any site are powerful energies , both potentially beneficial and destructive : wild energies such as wind , sun , fire , water and even wild animal flows and views potentially impact your property .
Once they are accounted for , with proper placement of design components they can be channeled for special uses , encouraged , minimized , blocked or deflected to conserve site energy , aesthetics and resources .
How do you account for site energies ?
The key is observation !
In most cases such energies will not be fully appreciated on a single visit to the site .
A full year or more of information will be needed , as well as delving into longer time frame data and the memory of long term residents of the area .
The information collected is then represented on a schematic sector diagram of the site .
The sector analysis diagram simply shows the direction of flow of these energies into the property .
Simple commonsense then dictates how this sector information influences the configuration and placement of elements within the appropriate zones in the design .
Here I have drawn a sector analysis in the Permaculture Landscape Design of our own 5 acre property .
As in all sector diagrams , this is a conceptual depiction , and shows the house site at the centre as the through point for all wild energies , with the succeeding zones 1 through to 4 radiating out from it .
Zone 5 spans all other zones as it is for wildlife and we wish to encourage native birds into our home garden and all other areas of the property .
The wild energies shown as sectors on our diagram are :
The Sun ’s Energy in Permaculture Landscape Design
The sun takes a different path across the sky during winter and summer .
Efficient home and site design takes advantage of this seasonal sun movement by capturing winter sun and excluding it in summer .
Summer sun sector :
As reflected in the sector diagram , here in Perth , Western Australia , in the middle of summer the sun rises 28 degrees south of due east , and sets south of due west .
In summer it is also higher in the sky ( 81 degrees from horizontal in mid summer ) .
Winter sun sector :
Similarly , in mid winter in Perth the sun rises 28 degrees north of due east , and also sets north of due west .
Its path through the sky is both much lower , and shorter ( giving us shorter days ) , than during summer , being only 34 degrees from the horizon in mid winter .
Wind Energy in Permaculture Landscape Design
Site elements such as hedgerows , fodder systems , buildings and forests can be used as barriers to divert or block damaging winds .
Similarly they can be arranged on your site to divert them to where they can benefit the site : towards wind turbines , or across ponds for evaporative summer cooling .
Hot summer winds
Cooling summer winds
Cold winter winds
The Energy of Fire in Permaculture Landscape Design
Fire danger sector
Like ours , your sector analysis should show the direction of major fire danger to your property .
This will be a function of many things including from what sector direction the hottest summer winds blow , the summer thunderstorm sector ( since these are so often accompanied in Australia by lightning and thus fire ) , and areas within and adjoining your property that have a heavy load of flammable material such as remnant vegetation bushland and ungrazed hobby blocks .
Some site elements such as roads , stone walls , pig runs , dams , and fire retardant plants in wind break arrangements , fodder systems and orchard areas can be arranged on your site as a barrier to the fire danger sector to slow or block fire from important structures such as your home .
Conversely , site components that increase the risk of fire , such as eucalypt woodlots , native vegetation areas , hay lofts and pine trees , should be sited away from central Zone infrastructure , and themselves be shielded from the fire sector by fire retardant barriers .
Wild Animal Energies in Permaculture Landscape Design
Owing to the location of our property on old farming land adjacent to a large national wildlife park it is subject to a lot of native and feral animal flows .
Apart from the presence of kangaroos in plague proportions , there is also a herd some 100 strong of feral goats that locals informed us habitually visited our site , making the entire perimeter a wild animal sector .
Because of the destructive impact of these on the survival of trees , our first task has been to exclude them from the property .
We have built high dog fencing around the whole farm boundary as a barrier to also keep domestic dogs from neighbouring hobby farms out .
Other wild animal energies that will influence our design are predatory feral foxes , eagles and crows .
Predator proofing strategies will be necessary such as siting a floating island in our dam for our geese , and roofing our poultry pen .
We are also envisioning siting a pigeon tower away from the house , but adjacent to the orchard ( on the boundary of Zones 2 and 3 ) to attract large birds of prey , and so utilize their energies to repel wild parrots from our fruits and nuts .
There are a lot of small native birds in the area which we will be encouraging by planting dense and prickly shrubs and trees in Zone 5 to provide them with shelter and nesting sites , so that we can harness their insect eating behaviors to control pests in all our Zones .
Aesthetics in Permaculture Landscape Design
Aesthetic enjoyment of your property is an important objective for sustainable living .
Wanted views out
Unwanted views out
Unwanted views in
Water Energy in Permaculture Landscape Design
Catchments both within and beyond your property divert water through your site as storm watersheds , permanent creeks and swamplands .
Capturing the energy of water to increase water storage on your site both in the form of plants and animals , soil and in dams is an important goal of your design as it is a direct determinant of potential property yield .
High storages represent an energy storage in the form of gravity , that can be used to gravity feed water to site elements without energy inputs .
Site all Design Components to Manage Incoming Energies
The basic energy conserving rule in Permaculture landscape design is to place every element in your system so that serves more than one function , and have more than one element in place to serve each important function ( e.g fire protection , water collection ) .
So with this in mind , you can use your sector / zone diagram to plan your site ’s Permaculture Landscape Design .
For example , you ’ll want to facilitate the capture of winter sun and cooling summer breeze energies into your home ( Zone 0 ) and home garden ( Zone 1 ) .
So site elements such as tall evergreen trees and large sheds planned for Zones 2 or 3 will need to be sited so that they do not block the winter sun sector from Zone 0 and 1 .
The winter sun sector , instead , would be more ideally suited a deciduous home fruit orchard because it allows in winter sun and provides summer shade , while being of low flammability .
Hedgerows and windbreaks ( that might also function as food or fuel for animals and you ) can be placed so that they divert cooling summer breezes toward your house , but block damaging hot summer and cold winter winds .
Placement of a small structure such as a poultry shed would be bordering Zone 1 , away from the fire sector , adjacent to the annual garden ( for easy use of manure and the tilling , fertilizing and weeding work they do for you ) , backing onto a forage area , and form part of a windbreak system .
In fact , there should be no site element that is not placed in accord with zone and sector considerations to conserve site energies .
Mexico City rubbed its eyes Wednesday morning , emerging from a five - day economic shutdown that authorities ordered to contain the swine flu – bringing a curious calm to one of the world 's most frenetic capitals .
Men and women , dressed in suits and holding briefcases , walked down city streets en route to work as offices reopened Wednesday .
Street vendors unfolded tables and chairs on sidewalks .
Mario Antonio Figueroa , a juice vendor , says he 's never been so happy to wake up at 4 a .m. to get to his spot on the street .
" I just hope they let us keep working , " he says , rinsing off a half - dozen oranges .
Restaurants also open Wednesday , as workers cleared off tables that were stacked away while takeout was the only service permitted .
The next wave comes tomorrow , when high school and university students head back to class .
Museums , libraries , and churches will also open doors .
And by next Monday , elementary school students will be back on their playgrounds .
Residents have been eagerly awaiting the resumption of normal life .
Health officials say the flu crisis , which had its epicenter here , is for now on the wane , although the death toll jumped from 29 to 42 , as tests confirmed additional cases .
But while business will bounce back for many , Mexico still will contend with stigmas and diplomatic rifts that may take much longer to resolve .
" There is the cost associated with the interruption of economic activity ; however , there is a second effect that is more permanent , and that is the psychological impact on people , on Mexicans in Mexico and international tourists outside Mexico , " says Alfredo Coutino , a senior economist for Latin America at Moody 's Economy.com .
" My impression is that the impact is going to last for the rest of year . "
The hardship that Mexicans have endured , which authorities cite as a main reason the flu has been controlled , was acknowledged this week by Mexican President Felipe Calderón .
" This extraordinary situation has signified important costs for the economies of the states and especially the population in general , " Mr. Calderón said .
$ 1.3 billion stimulus package
To aid in the recovery , the government announced a $ 1.3 billion stimulus package in tax breaks and funds for businesses , including hotels and restaurants , said Mexican Finance Minister Agustin Carstens .
Mr. Carstens said the crisis will cost the country about $ 2.2 billion , or reduce GDP this year by 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points .
For those in the informal economy , like Mr. Figueroa , the statistics mean little .
" We live day by day , " says Figueroa , who sells juice for about 75 cents per glass .
" The government officials that make the policies do n't live off the pesos they earn each day . "
And stigmas will be much harder to fight , especially in the tourism industry .
Mexican Tourism Minister Rodolfo Elizondo has said that they anticipate tourism revenue to fall by 43 percent this year , as airlines cut their flights to Mexico , companies cancel their conferences , and honeymooners opt for other beach destinations .
Tourist cancellation rate soars to 70 percent
In Cancún , Mr. Elizondo said , cancellation rates are as high as 70 percent , and hotel occupancy rates for the first 10 days of May dropped to 44.8 percent ; typically they are almost double that .
In Mexico City , the normal hotel rate of 55 percent fell to just 15 percent at the end of April .
Sixty - four port calls were canceled for cruise liners , meaning the loss of up to 134,000 passengers who could have stepped in Mexican territory to purchase food and souvenirs .
Four conventions were also cancelled , which would have brought in 47,000 visitors .
" No one loves us anymore , " quipped a Mexican migration official as a visitor entered the country Monday evening .
Stigmas will be hard to fight even for Mexicans in Mexico , though , says Mr. Coutino .
" For the restaurants and bars that open in coming days , they will not be working at full capacity because consumers are scared to go back , " he says .
Diplomatic spats
The crisis has caused some diplomatic havoc for Mexico .
Cuba and Argentina temporarily cancelled flights – a move heavily criticized by Mexican officials .
In China , dozens of Mexicans were quarantined without evidence of being ill with the swine flu .
Mexico sent a charter flight to retrieve them , but registered its dissatisfaction with the way China handled the situation .
Not all things are back to normal .
It is still unclear when gyms , movie theaters , and bars , which were all forced to close their doors , will be allowed to reopen .
And for those heading back to work today , not all agreed it was for the best .
Rafael Lopez , a lawyer , says he feels office openings are too rushed .
" I think it would be better to wait a few more days until this calms down , " says Mr. Lopez , whose business attire was complemented by a face mask .
But Israel Acevedo , who hauls supplies for a construction company , says he could n't be happier to get back to work – even though , unlike many in the informal economy , he expects to be paid by his company for the days missed .
Mr. Acevedo says there was an upside : he finished housework that had been sitting around for weeks – like fixing a doorknob on his front door – and spending family time with his wife and kids .
" We are all ready to get back , though , " he says .
SONY COMPUTER ENTERTAINMENT
FURTHER STRENGTHENS
ITS SUPPORT FOR GAME DEVELOPMENT FOR PLAYSTATION®3
Introduction of New Reference Tool Models to Provide a Lower- cost Game Development Environment
Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. ( SCEI ) today announced that it would further strengthen its support for game development on PLAYSTATION®3 ( PS3 ® ) computer entertainment system .
Since the launch of PS3 , SCEI has introduced a wide range of hardware and software tools to improve efficiency in game development for PS3 , and the company will continue its effort to support the growing game development community .
To meet the needs of various game development styles , SCE reduced the price of the original Reference Tool models DECR - 1000A and DECR - 1000 in 2007 , as well as added new features to PS3 Debugging Station to help raise productivity in game development .
Further enhancing its support for developers , SCE introduced new Reference Tool models in March 2009 , DECR - 1400A for North America and Europe / PAL territories at US $ 2,000 and € 1,700 respectively , and DECR - 1400J for Japan at JPY 200,000 .
Having the same form factor as the commercially available PS3 , the new Reference Tool models allow advanced game programming and more efficient computer graphics rendering .
With its more affordable pricing , this new model will appeal to a broader range of developers and publishers , and will help to provide a more streamlined game development environment , further accelerating the game development for PS3 .
In addition to the introduction of new Reference Tool models , SCE will also enhance its support by providing a comprehensive line - up of software tools as well as technical support to the game development community .
“ SNC PPU toolchain for PLAYSTATION 3 ( SNC ) ” , a compiler made available as part of the Software Development Kit* since February 2008 , is optimized to the power of PS3 and generates high - quality code .
As a result , not only will it contribute to raising the quality of the game but also to significantly improving productivity .
SNC is widely supported by many developers and publishers for its quality and efficiency , and is utilized in some of the best - selling franchise titles including Fallout 3 from Bethesda Softworks LLC , Killzone 2 from Guerrilla Games , and Ryu ga Gotoku 3 from SEGA Corporation .
SCE will continue to further improve the performance of SNC and will expand its features to meet the needs of the game creators .
Additionally , at the Game Developer ’s Conference held in San Francisco , California , in February 2008 , SCE introduced a graphics - rendering engine known as the PhyreEngine™ .
Provided as a full package along with its source code , and incorporated with many updated features including the linkage with the physics engines , this graphics rendering engine is adaptable to various game development styles .
Furthermore , documents describing the technical aspects and overview of PhyreEngine have been made available to help the game developer community in creating games more efficiently using this graphics engine .
The latest version 2.40 , released in March 2009 , includes a new “ foliage rendering ” system that provides tools and technology to render ultra-realistic trees and plants to be easily integrated into games , helping game developers to express their creativity more freely on the PS3 system .
With more and more new and exciting PS3 titles scheduled for release this year from third party developers and publishers as well as from SCE Worldwide Studios , SCEI will deploy various measures to further reinforce game development for PS3 and will continue to expand the platform to offer attractive interactive entertainment experiences only available on PS3 .
* Software Development
Kit is a set of development tools and software libraries .
Developers are able to obtain this SDK by signing a license agreement with SCE and by purchasing tool products .
By gradually migrating to a complete open source desktop and web applications , Gendarmerie Nationale , the French national police force with 105,000 employees , has saved millions of euros .
The move cuts Microsoft out of the equation , helping the French national police force slash its IT costs by 70 percent .
Most of the money saved was on proprietary software licenses , beginning in 2004 .
Previously , the acquired Gendarmerie Nationale acquired 12,000 to 15,000 licenses annually .
Gendarmerie National 's decision to adopt a strictly open - standards IT policy began in 2002 with the intention of improving interoperability between other police forces and custom agencies .

Estimated Savings of 50 Million Euro on Licenses
Since 2007 , Gendarmerie Nationale purchased only 200 licenses .
New PCs come loaded with Ubuntu .
Since 2004 , the Gendarmerie has saved an estimated 50 million euro on licenses for standard office applications , hardware and maintenance .
( Source : osor.eu )
Because one of the Gendarmerie 's accountants was irked at being forced into buying new software licenses by Microsoft , the decision was made to move to open source in 2004 .
The accountant tried OpenOffice .
When they found that OpenOffice worked just as well as Microsoft Office and was available for free , the decision was made to install it on 90,000 desktops .
Switch from XP to Ubuntu Seamless
In 2007 , the Gendarmerie decided to shift desktop operating systems from Windows XP to Ubuntu instead of Windows Vista because Vista did not provide them any advantages and because Microsoft said it would require the training of users .
Migrating from Windows XP to Ubuntu proved to be very easy .
Open Source Also Reduced Maintenance Costs
Open source has also helped the Gendarmerie reduce maintenance costs , since it 's easier for them to keep GNU / Linux desktops up to date .
Installing new versions of anti-virus applications on desktops in the Gendarmerie 's outposts used to take a year .
Now it 's done within two weeks without requiring travel .

The Gendarmerie Nationale success , as noted by APC Magazine , contradicts Microsoft 's arguments that the ' total cost of ownership ' of Windows is less than Linux .

It seems like you just finished getting your corporate blog up to snuff and now you 're being asked to " tweet " your campaigns .
Microblogging is taking center stage not just as a social tool , but also as a marketing one -- and you suddenly have to think in minutes , not days .
And instead of crafting thoughtful posts that weave in your marketing messages , now you have to craft short , punchy posts just a few words long .
Welcome the world of microblogging -- the newest way to communicate with customers and prospects .
Microblogging , the process of broadcasting short , simple messages out to a private group of subscribers or over a public webpage , is like traditional blogging on amphetamines .
It 's fast and immediate .
Instead of updating posts on a corporate blog every few days , you are communicating every few hours .
Twitter , the darling of the microblogging world , has become famous for the rapid fire posts and updates from traditional web technorati like Guy Kawasaki and Jason Calcanis , as well as celebrities like Shaquille O'Neal , who all have have tens to hundreds of thousands of followers .
However , there are good reasons for businesses to build a base of followers , even if you are not trying to amass an army watching your every post .
First , let 's define exactly what we mean by microblogging .
In general , microblogging refers to brief text updates , photos , or audio clips that are published in regular , short bursts either to a pre-selected group of subscribers , or " followers " as Twitter calls them , via a public website , or to mobile phones .
Twitter , with some 6 million users to date , rules the microblogging world , but it 's far from the only platform .
In fact there are more than 100 microblogging services around the world , with more joining the fray every day .
And you can also microblog without using one of the dedicated services ; you could simply create an RSS feed or even scroll punchy updates on your homepage .
The content of a microblog differs from a traditional blog in that it is much more topical and is much shorter .
Marketers and communications teams use microblogging to get the word out about a new product , special offer , or branding campaign .
For example , think : " Our new software is out ! " as the microblog equivalent of a product release , or " Get 20 percent off in the next hour only ! " as the microblog promotional offer .
The marketing results of microblogging can be exceptional .
It is a personal , relevant way to connect with " followers " of your company or brand , creating a constant , ongoing dialogue around your products or services .
So what can you do to get started the right way with microblogging ?
Here is a 10 - step guide to make microblogging work for your company .
1 . Pick a leader .
Someone at your company has to become the face of the microblog .
Depending on your company , it could be the CEO ( @Zappos ) , the customer service guy ( @comcastcares and @ RichardatDell ) , the marketing outreach folks ( @MSWindows ) , or a combination of all of them .
Now , to generate enough updates , you will need to get the entire company involved .
Send out a memo saying you need news tidbits , funny stories , corporate culture bits , publicly announceable customer success stories , small wins in different departments ( tech , sales , marketing , engineering , product design , etc. ) .
Your microblog is the place to announce small but important news items .
But make sure there is a one personality driving the charge .
2. Spiff up your background .
A Twitter background is easy to build .
If your design firm wants to charge you $ 10,000 , fire them on the spot .
You can use a free tool like Twitbacks.com , or throw something together in Photoshop in minutes .
But get creative .
Search through Twitter profiles to get some good ideas .
3 . Start out with simple messages .
Think of your microblogging platform as a new way to communicate with customers and potential customers by offering them useful information and tips , inside deals and promotions , and news about your company they might not otherwise learn .
Your first updates can introduce your intentions and let people know what they can expect to find if they subscribe to your feed .
Entice them with useful and fun information , promotions , or insider - like tidbits about your brand .
4. Establish a regular rhythm .
Only you can decide how many updates per day is enough .
It depends on the content .
Customer service tweets need to be updated all day long , while product news will be less frequent .
Map out a general plan to update your feed X - number of times per day , and at which particular times of the day .
Early morning , mid-morning , and early - afternoon make the most sense for business goals .
These regular posts are a chance to have fun with your messaging .
You can also weave in anecdotes about your company 's culture , announce small news tidbits that are n't worth a whole press release , such as " Today we signed our 100th customer ! " or " A customer using our database technology just ported a petabyte ! "
5 . Follow others , and they will follow you .
Are there leaders in your industry who tweet ?
Key suppliers , partners , or customers ?
Unless you are President Obama ( @barackobama ) or already have established credibility , chances are low that you will suddenly achieve tweet - stardom .
You need to reach out to your core community by following them and asking them to follow you .
6. Connect with your followers .
No one is forced to follow you .
Anyone who has searched for you , found you , and chosen to follow you is a person you want to know better .
Do the polite thing and send them a direct message , thanking them for the follow .
If they have relevant content , follow them as well .
A little dialogue goes a long way .
7 . Talk like a real person .
Maybe your microblog is just supposed to be funny , or maybe it's a serious conduit for news and promotions where you can speak one on one with customers .
But leave the marketing messages at home .
You have 140 characters , which is enough to say something useful , but not enough for hyperbole .
8 . Use the tools out there .

While the governor was a strong supporter of all the measures , he was not the public face of the effort , as he was in 2005 when he took on the budget issues , and well as the state ’s unions , in another failed effort at the ballot box .
This time the Republican governor let teachers and firefighters do his talking for him in advertisements , and indeed was not even in the state the day of the vote .
Instead , he was a guest of President Barack Obama at the White House , where the president was announcing tough new federal standards on automobile emissions that emulate California ’s environmental standards .
He updated his Twitter account through out the day ( " Just landed in DC .
Look forward to updating you tomorrow , hopefully with pictures or video " ) but made nary a mention of the propositions there .
The one measure to pass , which would prevent legislators and statewide constitutional officers , including the governor , from receiving pay rises in years when the state is running a deficit , was approved by more than 75 percent of those who cast ballots , demonstrating the overwhelming disgust many Californians say in polls that they feel toward elected officials in a time of deep budget paralysis .
The central measure , Proposition 1A , would have increased the state ’s rainy - day fund but also restrict spending in future years , and extend several temporary taxes .
Proposition 1B , which was connected to 1A , would have required $ 9.3 billion to be paid to education to make up for shortfalls in spending levels set by a voter - approved proposition in 1988 .
Voters indicated in polls earlier this month that they had a distaste for protracted taxes , caps on spending during inflation periods and general legislative and gubernatorial will .
The other failing propositions were 1E , which would have redirected money guaranteed for mental health services to the state ’s general fund ; 1D , a similar measure using money earmarked for early childhood programs ; and 1C , which would have modernized the state lottery and permitted the state to borrow from future profits .
In what is almost certainly going to result in a showdown at the US Supreme Court , the 9th Circuit Court Of Appeals has incorporated the 2nd amendment into the 14th amendment .
In simple terms this is the first time that the 2nd amendment has been applied to limit the actions of an individual state , in this case the county of Alameda in the state of California .
Without getting too complicated in legal mumbo jumbo , the Bill of Rights was originally considered to only apply to limit the actions of the federal government .
When the 14th amendment was passed there was debate as to how much it incorporated , or extended the provisions of the BoR to the individual states .
Over the 150 years or so since the 14th was passed , a number of provisions , mostly the 1st , 4th and 5th amendments have been applied to the states , but not the 2nd .
This could be a problem for many gun control laws and follows in the basic pattern of the Heller decision last year which applied the law to the District of Columbia .
Clearly this is going to be appealed .
I ’m somewhat surprised at the lack of media coverage so far ( which explains the lack of a link to a major news source ) .
It is worth noting that the three judge panel which issued the ruling consisted of a Carter , Clinton and Reagan appointee , so in theory 2 of them were Democrats .
The ruling can be found at http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/04/20/0715763.pdf
More About Walnuts :
Tell Me How YOU like to eat Walnuts !!!
( OrganicJar ) A new study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , found that incorporating approximately 1.5 ounces of walnuts -- a handful of whole nuts or about three tablespoons of chopped nuts -- into your daily diet lowered serum total cholesterol by 5.4 percent and low - density lipoprotein , or " bad , " cholesterol by 9.3 percent .
In healthy individuals , walnuts lower cholesterol more than fish , fatty fish lower triglycerides and both lower heart disease risk , U.S. researchers said .
" The practical significance of the study is that eating an easy - to - incorporate amount of walnuts and fatty fish can cause meaningful decreases in blood cholesterol and triglycerides even in healthy individuals , " lead author Sujatha Rajaram of Loma Linda University School of Public Health said in a statement .
Walnuts contain the highest amount of omega - 3 fats of any other nuts .
Besides there amazing ability to lower triglycerides and reduce plaque formation , they also support brain function , improve your mood , and help with depression .
Make sure that you buy ‘ organic raw walnuts ’ and that there flesh is white rather than yellow ( indicates rancidity ) .

FOR BOYS ONLY : Linwood College pupils Shayne Hume and Jerome Davis take part in a boys - only science class , aimed at boosting their achievement .
New Zealand boys are further behind girls in the classroom than in any other developed country , and the head of a Christchurch boys ' school blames marital splits .
The 30 - member Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) yesterday released a report comparing achievement by 15 - year - old boys and girls in 40 countries .
Of the OECD countries in the study , the difference in reading achievement in favour of girls was greatest in New Zealand , the report showed .
" There are significant gender differences in educational outcomes , and these appear as students grow older . "
Last year 's National Certificate of Educational Achievement ( NCEA ) results , released this month , showed girls outperforming boys by wider margins as pupils got older .
" It 's an issue that boys ' schools have an opportunity to address , " St Bede 's College rector Justin Boyle said .
Boys seemed to have particular difficulty with writing , and the school had introduced a programme to improve writing skills , he said .
" I believe also there are other social issues ; who are the male role models who are influencing these boys ? "
Boyle said .
" Invariably , we find if mum and dad have split they have not had the male role model in their lives to encourage them in a holistic way about how they get educated . "
Divorce statistics released this month showed about one - third of New Zealanders who married in 1983 had divorced before their 25th wedding anniversary .
Education consultant Joseph Driessen said children who came from broken homes were typically 25 per cent behind other children in achievement .
" Boys are affected by divorce very deeply because 85 per cent of custody goes to the mother and guys just disappear .
That needs to change , " he said .
" We need to have a family split - up philosophy where we realise that sons need their fathers .
All custody and access should be 50 - 50 . "
Boyle said boys ' schools could help form well - rounded men .
" We are in a good position in a boys ' school to look at particularly boys ' issues and address them head - on , " he said .
The OECD report said single - sex schools in New Zealand were more effective for girls than for boys .
Co-educational Linwood College runs two boys - only classes for struggling boys .
" They do exactly the same curriculum as any other student .
It 's the context and the topics that might change , " principal Rob Burrough said .
He said NCEA assessment was better suited to girls .
" Schooling does tend to favour girls and the way they learn .
Internal assessment is more user - friendly for many girls , " he said .
" Academic achievement is just one measure of intelligence , so it 's a matter of adapting to success in today 's education environment , and teachers have to provide a variety of teaching experiences to cater for different learning styles . "
A Ministry of Education report released yesterday showed boys outnumbered girls by more than two to one in needing specialist literacy teacher help .
Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams is on a visit to the Middle East Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams says he believes there can be progress in the Middle East after talking to Gaza 's Hamas prime minister .
Mr Adams had an hour long meeting with Ismail Haniya on Wednesday night .
Hamas , which rules Gaza , is listed as a terrorist organisation by Israel , the US and EU .
Mr Adams said he was encouraged by the dialogue .
" Mr Haniya told me that Hamas wants a peace agreement , " he said .
The meeting came at the end of a day in which Mr Adams met with civic , political and business leaders in Gaza .
He also toured parts of northern Gaza devastated by the Israeli operation in the Palestinian territory in January .
He said : " I welcome the opportunity to engage with so many people .
" I was pleased to speak directly with Mr Haniya .
I outlined to him Sinn Féin 's view that there should be a complete cessation of all hostilities and armed actions by all sides .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The fact is that the people of Palestine and the people of Israel are destined to live side by side .
I believe that most people want a peaceful accommodation .
" Following my meeting with Mr Haniya I believe that progress is possible .
" As I have said consistently there needs to be a dialogue between the people of Palestine and their leadership and the people of Israel and their leadership .
" That is what worked in Ireland . "
On Tuesday , Mr Adams visited Sderot and Kfar Aza - a town and Kibbutz - in southern Israel that have been the targets for rocket attacks from Gaza .
However , before he set off for the Middle East Israeli officials said they would not meet him because he would not rule out meeting Palestinian militants .
They had threatened not to allow him to enter Gaza .
He said he regretted the Israeli government 's refusal to meet him .

Ahmed Rashid : Taliban Activity Up in Pakistan
Journalist Ahmed Rashid talks on NPRs Fresh Air about recent Taliban advances in Pakistan and the violence there that appears to be escalating .
Share Your Reaction Read Comments View Credits FRONTLINE / World editors :
To protect certain people whose participation in the film may make them the target of threats , we made a decision to block access to the video in Pakistan .
The city of Peshawar is on high alert .
The Taliban are closing in , regularly attacking police convoys , kidnapping diplomats , and shooting foreigners .
The fighting across this volatile region has driven thousands of families from their homes and many have found shelter in Peshawar .
Correspondent Sharmeen Obaid - Chinoy is traveling across her fractured homeland to investigate the rising popularity of a new Pakistani branch of the Taliban , now threatening the major cities , blowing up girls ’ schools and declaring war on the Pakistani state .
Her journey begins at a rehabilitation center in Peshawar , where she talks with many young victims caught in the crossfire of this war .
“ We saw the dead body of a policeman tied to a pole , ” an articulate young girl named Qainat tells the reporter quietly .
“ His head had been chopped off .
It was hanging between his legs .
There was a note saying that if anyone moved the dead body , they would share its fate . ”
Before the Taliban took control of Qainat ’s village , the women in her family attended university and worked .
But now the Taliban has banned girls from going to school .
Qainat is from Swat , a 100 - mile - long valley in the north of Pakistan , three hours drive from Peshawar .
Until recently , Swat was known as the Switzerland of the east , and had a thriving tourist industry .
Two years ago , hundreds of Taliban fighters moved into the valley from the adjoining tribal areas , when the Pakistani Army drove them out .
Driving through the streets of Swat filming surreptitiously , Obaid - Chinoy sees Swati women wearing the burqa .
This never used to be the case .
The Taliban often use radio broadcasts to drive home their message .
In one typical address , a preacher proclaims : “ Sharia Law is our right , and we will exercise this right whatever happens .
We will make ourselves suicide bombers !
I swear to God if our leader orders me , I will sacrifice myself … and blow myself up in the middle of our enemies . “
The Taliban have destroyed more than 200 government schools in Swat since they took control of the region .
Walking through the rubble of a school that once taught 400 girls , the reporter comes across two nine - year - old girls who used to study there .
“ Why did you like school ? ” she asks one of them .
“ Because education is like a ray of light and I want that light , ” she replies .
When the sound of mortar fire cuts the conversation short , the film crew leaves quickly , passing through the main square .
Locals have renamed it “ Khooni Chowk ” ( “ bloody square ” ) for all the public beheadings the Taliban now carry out there .
Several weeks after FRONTLINE / World filmed in Swat , the Pakistani government signed a peace deal with the Taliban , allowing the imposition of a brutal brand of Sharia Law on a million people across the valley .
It ’s a significant deal , reports Obaid - Chinoy .
Swat lies outside the tribal area , showing that Taliban influence is growing , and the militants now have a new safe haven .
In Taliban strongholds near the Afghan border , they have been running their own schools for years , targeting poor families and often providing food and shelter .
One Swat teenager explains how he joined the Taliban a year ago , when he was 13 .
First it was the sermons at the mosque , then being recruited to a madrassa , and finally spending months in military training .
“ They teach us to use a machine gun , Kalashnikov … Then they teach us how to do a suicide attack , ” he tells our reporter .
Despite the Swat peace deal , the Pakistan Army has been battling the Taliban for several months , deep inside the tribal belt .
In Bajaur , just 10 miles from the Afghan border , flattened buildings are all that remain of this former trading hub , once home to 7,000 people .
The Army claims it destroyed the town because it was the only way to free it from militants .
This hard line approach has left hundreds of thousands of refugees , many winding up in makeshift camps on the edge of the Tribal belt .
It ’s the largest internal displacement Pakistan has ever seen , Obaid - Chinoy reports .
Almost a million people have been forced to leave their homes .
Visiting one such camp in Peshawar , we meet two young men among the 15,000 children displaced there .
Wasifullah and Abdurrahman are best friends , but they have different ideas of who is to blame for this war .
Both boys fled their village when the Pakistani Army began bombing .
Their district was also targeted by American missile strikes .
In one of those strikes , Wasifullah ’s 12 - year - old cousin was killed .
“ We brought his remains home in bags , ” he explains with little expression .
“ We could only find his legs so we buried them in our village . ”
There have been more than 30 U.S. missile strikes in the tribal areas in the last year .
They target Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders , but civilians are often killed as well .
It ’s an easy recruiting tool for the Taliban , and Wasifullah is eager to sign up .
But his best friend Abdurrahman blames Al Qaeda for the destruction of their village .
He would prefer to become a captain in the Pakistan Army .
The two friends sadly represent the fault lines in this unstable nation .
The Army has also suffered in its campaign against the Taliban .
In the last five years , thousands of Pakistani soldiers have been wounded .
And more than 1,500 have been killed .
Visiting some of the wounded in a local hospital , Obaid - Chinoy asks one soldier why the Taliban hate the Pakistani Army so much .
“ The American policies we adopted ; that ’s why the Taliban are angry at the Army .
That ’s why we ’re suffering , ” he whispers .
Meanwhile , the Taliban are growing bolder by the day , openly inviting journalists to the heart of the tribal areas for a show of strength .
As a woman , Obaid - Chinoy is told she is not welcome and that she will be killed if she goes .
A local cameraman sets out to film there instead .
In a village 6 hours from Peshawar , it is the first time that the new deputy leader of the Pakistani Taliban , Hakimullah Mehsud , has been filmed .
Arriving in an American Humvee his men have just captured in an attack on a NATO convoy , he tells the cameraman , “ If America continues bombing the tribal areas … and martyrs innocent people … then we are compelled to attack them . ”
He also sends a message to Islamabad : “ If the Pakistani leaders and army maintain their stance … then we will take control of Peshawar and other cities . ”
This is no empty threat .
The war has already arrived in the capital and Pakistan ’s largest city , Karachi .
Back in Karachi , Obaid - Chinoy finds that her native city has become a new safe haven for the Taliban .
She visits one of the city ’s poorest neighborhoods , which local police concede has become heavily infiltrated by the Taliban .
Most of the children here already study at small madrassas .
After their lessons , some of the boys play cricket on a strip of wasteland close to school .
One of them is Shaheed , which means “ martyr . ”
He is 14 and one of 200 pupils at the school , most of whom come from extremely poor families .
The state education system in Pakistan has virtually collapsed , leaving more than 1.5 million children studying at schools like this one .
Sitting down to be interviewed , Shaheed explains what Sharia Law has taught him about women .
“ The government should forbid women and girls from wandering around outside , ” he says calmly .
“ Just like the government banned plastic bags -- no one uses them any more -- we should do the same with women . ”
Shaheed ’s teacher defends the school , saying it promotes only peace and harmony , not terrorism , but away from the camera , he tells another story .
When asked who he thinks will win this war , his response is chilling : “ No matter how many Muslims die , we will never run out of sacrificial lambs . ”
It also confirms something Shaheed said during his interview : “ When I look at suicide bombers younger than me , or my age , I get so inspired by their terrific attacks . ”
Leaving Karachi , the reporter tries to make contact with the Taliban leadership in the tribal areas .
She wants to talk to the men who are recruiting children from these religious schools for suicide operations .
After lengthy negotiations , she meets with Qari Abdullah , who makes no attempt to hide his face .
“ We never used to fight against Pakistan , because we thought the Army were Muslims , ” he tells her .
“ But when they started bombing us , we had to do jihad against them . ”
When she asks him about using young children to carry out such attacks , he replies :
“ Children are tools to achieve God ’s will .
And whatever comes your way , you sacrifice it . ”
He then reveals that he recruits children as young as 5 , 6 , and 7 years old .
Coming to the end of her bleak journey , Obaid - Chinoy reminds us that there are 80 million children in Pakistan , many of them living in poverty .
If the militants continue to expand their war and to recruit children freely , as they do now , then Pakistan may soon belong to them .

How brutal - is this the gift to the world or humanity ?
why people kill their own people .
What do they achieve with these killings ?
Why the world is supporting this inhuman revolution around the world .
If
the rulers are not able to protect their citizen 's and their rights , they are not fit to rule the country and it is high time to think the people of that country .
Here also , if the parents kept aware of their children and their friends , and prevented them from wrong doings in time , none of the country should have faced this situation what today they are facing ...

First of all the parents of those children will sacrifice their blood their kids to go blow themselves up !
Just so they could get some shelter and food .
Is it just me or is that major selfishness ?

I think Pakistan is not honest in their approach to defeat the Taliban .
They gave birth to the Taliban to counter India , and now they know that Taliban could act as an extra force in event of war with India , apart from them also being able to destabilize India with terrorist attacks .
salt lake city , utah
I wonder why everyone in the Western media does not mention or give importance to one point , of how Taliban came into existence into first place , and why they survived so long .
It was Pakistan 's wish to nurture Taliban and other extremist elements within their country to help destabilize neighboring India , which has unfortunately backfired on Pakistan .
Even
during these tough times for the country , you could see Pakistan 's news channels broadcasting messages from Taliban saying that they are with the country in the event of war with India .
Its this sympathy for Taliban , which is also its main strength .
I just hope that politicians in Pakistan stop experimenting people in extremism , and stop nurturing all extremist organizations and elements .
This thing I presume will only stop if Pakistanis stand up , and ask the politicians to give up their obsession about Kashmir and India , since everything in Pakistan is done with a view point of countering India .

It 's very awful .
As a man who has a grandfather from Pakistan , I 'm very upset to know about the negative side of Pakistan .
This is all about perception .
Taliban always has different perception to Pak's Government .
It 's also bad for the Pakistani Government .
Pakistani Government should be fully restricted to the Taliban .
The regime in Pakistan now , does n't care fully about the condition in FATA / NWFP .
If Pakistani Government knows , it wo n't to be like this .
The World has just become anarchy , but not at all .

None of us wants the Taliban kind of Islam , but very few of us can express this with impact .
If people like Sharmeen have the courage to come up and say No to this , we must give them a warm shoulder .
I think the Islam interpreted by Taliban is not only contrary to real Islam of the Holy prophet , rather it is demoralising Muslims all over the world .
We must condemn them before they reach our doors .

I have very mixed feelings after watching this clip .
One part of me feels very grateful that I was born in America , especially since I 'm a girl .
However , another part of me can't help but feel ashamed of being American .
Conflicts like the one in Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Iraq , happen mainly because of American hegemony .
Although America is rapidly declining in terms of global power , it helped spawn this conflict in the Middle East , and many others before that ; unfortunately , there may be other ones to come .

What a disturbing firsthand account of the consequences of using religion as a tool for war and violence .
It is such a shame that the three Abrahamic religions of Judaism , Christianity , and Islam cannot find common ground in their monotheism and common ideologies but instead have spent the last 2000 years killing each other and using religion as a political , secular tool for personal gain .

It 's a really hard piece to watch ... i m here in the US for higher education in my late 30 s ... and it is a typical example of progression that we Pakistani women were going through .
I being the first from may families to go abroad alone on a foreign scholarship .
I value that a lot because that is just another success story for women in general ... BUT I damn well know there is going to be a drastic break in this vertical line of progression !
I do n't think my daughter , who lives back home , will have the nurturing environment that I shared with others .
My parents were able to fight the social system to get us our basic rights but her parents will just be frightened for her safety .
We just went back a few generations , and I blame ALL of us for not being able to see it all when very educated professional couples were taking their boys out of school for a couple of years to send to hifz ( memorize by heart ) the Quran .
We just assumed we were being religious !
But it was a seed of softer fundamentalism that we were sowing .
I am a proud , very proud practicing Muslim .
But I can never support a bit of what 's going on in the name of Islam , because I KNOW that 's not it .

From the comments I have read it appears most responses have been limited to an emotional reaction only .
Few practicable solutions , if any , have been presented , nor has the history of the problem prior to the US exit from the region , after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops , been addressed .
Like all geopolitical issues , often the external players in the game become part of the problem over a period of time , and extricating themselves from the situation becomes almost impossible .
For those same players who are now entrenched and compromised , having developed allegiances and vested interests in the localised situation , they lose sight of the bigger " global " picture focusing only on the immediate here and now .
In this case ' get rid of the Taliban . '
Good , let 's do that .
What next ?
Where will they disperse to ?
What will they morph into ?
Once they have morphed , how will they present themselves in their next reincarnation ?
Will we be able to identify them ?
What have we done to protect ourselves against this ' new ' monster ?
And this is assuming we will recognise them for who and what they are .
My understanding of global politics has taught me that almost 90 % of all ' strategic ' relationships eventually end in the small easily manipulated monster becoming a big one , and worse still developing its own agenda and propaganda , becoming a force unto itself , and then running amok .
History is riddled with events which are an outcome of such machinations .
I write all of this NOT having seen this production because those of us resident in Pakistan have been denied access to it .
I fail to understand in this world of technology how Frontline can defend a position claiming protection of its participants .
Just fix the Techie stuff and bounce us to a site where necessary adjustments have been made to protect these individuals .
Your excuse is exactly that - an excuse .
You can and should do better .
If Frontline and Chinoy wish to raise awareness and affect change in Pakistan ( presumably one or both are your goals ) , how do you expect to achieve this , if the very people whom you have made the subject of this footage and those around them who are impacted by this , do not have access to your production ?
I await your response with interest .

There are several comments from Pakistan and Pakistanis which we need to heed even more here than the well - done journalism of the documentary ... among them a long passionate letter above from Lahore as well as these commonly heard words from another Pakistani : " This documentry no doubt is a very thorough and brave work .
But this also makes it clear that the Taliban do not have the means or motivation to use modern ways to get information .
Someone is providing them with the equipment and the information .
Pakistan is certainly not doing that .
You in the US may think this is our mess but there was no such problem in our areas before American occupation of Afghanistan .
And the blame for a mess created in this part of the world all lies on American shoulders .
I have no sympathy whatsoever for Taliban , Al Qaeda or for American soldiers for that matter ... "
Also , in my own blog today I expressed two concerns : 1 ) Why are the positives left off - the spiritual history of Pakistan , the leaders , the writings and ongoing work toward the rule of law , education of the poor ?
2 ) Why in the world is Shell the sponsor ?

Thank you for this wonderful piece of brave reporting .... we do n't see or read this in our media very often .
Sharmeen is a very brave person , and has taken many risks to bring us this reporting .
I am blown away by the indifference and callousness of the Taliban to have such hatred for their fellow man , because we are all walking the same path , and we all need help , not bombs .

This is undoubtedly great reporting .
What I 'm more concerned about is , who is actually sponsoring the Taliban ?
Who is supporting them ?
How are they generating enough money to run madrassas , recruit martyrs and support their families .
I 'm pretty sure there are forces / countries involved in creating this evil regime .
Someone needs to investigate and make those countries / agencies accountable .

Excellent documentary because it makes the link , even if only indirectly , between Islam and the Taliban .
We see the young men becoming " Talibanized " after attending Islamic schools , after reading the Koran , after coming under the influence of Islamic religious authorities .
The Taliban is just standard Islam carried out to the letter .
Last week , we read that a council of Pakistani Islamic religious leaders met in support of the Pakistani government and condemned the Taliban .
However , they condemned only the Taliban 's tactics of suicide bombing and beheading .
The clerics all supported the Taliban 's goal , namely , the establishment of Sharia law throughout Pakistan .
Probably , most of Pakistan 's population supports this goal , too .
Or , at least , they think they do .
In all of our dealings with Pakistan , our leaders , including our ignorant president , do not understand that Pakistan is a deeply Islamic country , or what significance this has .
In fact , the name of the country is not " Pakistan " ; it is the Islamic Republic of Pakistan .
That fact is hugely significant , but neither our diplomats nor our journalists understand that significance .
Any reader who would like to understand the importance of Islam in Pakistan ( and elsewhere ) should read the Koran .

This was deeply disturbing and heart wrenching .
I fell in love with Pakistan and the Pakistani people while living and teaching school there for seven years , recently .
It is a complex problem that I feel is rooted in a feudal system that has repressed the poor and not encouraged education and progress for its masses .
With so much poverty and lack of good public education , it is the perfect storm .
I wish I could wake up tomorrow and have this all be a bad dream .

Excellent piece .
Yet she still avoided the main issue , which is WHY the Taliban have such an ideology ?
Because they take the violent ( and mysogynistic ) passages of the Qur'an literally .
How about interviewing some Muslim clerics opposed to Taliban ideology , such as Barelwis ?

Very interesting but selective reporting .
It may earn a lot of miles in the U.S. due to a fascination with the Taliban , but this is less than 2 percent of Pakistan .
There are many excellent schools and suburbs in Pakistan operating fine .
Yes , Pakistan has a problem that they must fight and eliminate .
The show painted a picture that is very different from the situation in Pakistan .

This is an excellent piece of documentary history that should be viewed by the millions of people around the world with empty concepts of the grim reality of a world beyond democracy .
It is understandable that this world of terrorism , Sharia law , and violence is not something that everyone could ever possibly experience -- nor should they have to .
It is important , however , to remain open minded in an effort to find truth amid a sea of false reporting .
Whether you support or denounce the Coalition 's efforts in Afghanistan , Iraq , or Pakistan matters little and should bear no weight on the comprehension of the current fight of the Taliban versus the World .
This fight is not one of theological underpinnings , though it is projected as such .
It is a war just the same as all for the history of time -- it is a fight for POWER and MONEY .
The Taliban want both and will do anything to ensure that they get it .
I have lived amongst people in fear for their lives everyday -- not knowing anything of peace , watched as NGO 's from the countries of the World attempted to donate money for development , only to experience destruction and violence for the efforts .
I have fought to provide this peace and development for people who desperately want it against a group of people who want nothing more than utter devastation .
Please do not be fooled into believing half - truths and lies -- the Taliban will never honor a peace accord , never accept democracy , and will use only your tolerance for personal freedoms in an effort to exploit you as weak .
This work is a bold effort to bring forth the gruesome truth that many simply wish was not a reality -- do not allow this false hope to drive rational decisions .

It was such a powerful documentary that I was stunned to watch the insight of the Taliban .
The problem in our Muslim societies has been the lack of logic and education .
We all know that the memorization of the holy Quran is commendable and carries a lots of spiritual and moral fruits and enlightens the person 's vision with the understanding of the spirit of the holy message .
But we the Muslims never took the religious studies as a serious matter , instead leaving it at the helm of the Imam of the mosque who needs no qualification except having a beard on his face .
That is why whatever he tells the little kids , they believe its from the Quran .
It is very unfortunate that the Imam of the mosque himself does not know the meanings of the holy verses of the Quran .
This story says that Karachi has become the center of the new generation of Taliban but no one says that 99 percent of the Imams in Karachi mosques are from the tribal area or NWFP because the local Karachi residents never wanted their children to be Imams or religious scholars -- therefore , someone has to fill the gap .
This is happening all over Pakistan .
In my little town in Pakistan where I grew up , only one Imam was local .
We Muslims as a whole have to evaluate ourselves , what we stand for , and what we have to do .
I do congratulate sister Shameen here who put her life at risk and enabled us to watch the inside story of the Taliban .

The skeptics among us believe that these journalistic efforts " grease the skids " preparing the gullible U.S. citizens for greater American involvement including : more unaccounted for tax dollars , more drones and equipment , and more military involvement , et al , as the United States flounders around with no clear goal in soverign nations like Pakistan .
The conservative right does n't need these kinds of journalistic reports to " fire up the base " for more involvement .
The right - wingers are seemingly always eager to extend American influence by meddling in other countries .
No , this kind of reporting resonates with the left - wing liberals -- those who need " greater moral justification " to become involved .
Interventionists must have a devil .
They must have things presented in an unmistakable black and white , good guys and bad guys framework .
The devil has been clearly identified in this report .
It is now Taliban .
( Where did Al Qaeda go ? )
The bad guys are not the corrupt Pakistan ruling elite this month .
Later , we may have to paint them with the " devil 's brush " , but not now .
For the time being , we seem to need them .
How long will the U.S. keep writing big checks to Pakistan after the " devil " is defeated ?
Will we spend the billions and billions required for nation building ?
It may be in the best interest of Pakistan , Afghanistan , Iraq , and other nations who want American money to keep a credible " terrorist threat " alive .
By playing on American paranoia to demand huge sums of support , these countries and factions could greatly damage our already fragile economy and win without ever reaching our shores .

Reporters never consider examining how did it all started .
I would say , UN must set up a fact - finding mission to establish the source of evil .
Millions of innocent people are uprooted from their homes and living a miserable life because of this operation .
But the real culprit is never caught .
We know this as fact that Talibans are illiterate people , use religion for their ulterior motives but hardly know their religious values .
Somebody must have given them arms and ammunition and trained them before unleashing them on their enemies .
Patrons who started this whole mess are the real culprits and must be identified , held responsible and put to task .
And if the civil society of the world fails to do that , then it 's just a matter of time before humanity will suffer such disasters again and again in one part of the world or the other .
Because the godfather will never cease to practice such abomination whenever it is in their national interest .

I have been reading the comments posted and it's amazing to me how many people think the only answer is more interventionism .
Pakistan can only rely on it's own people being courageous enough to stand against the Taliban in much the same way Iran stood against the Shah , and in the same spirit that led Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence .
Freedom comes from within and this is what Pakistan is fighting for .
In truth , I feel the biggest mistake the U.S. made in Afghanistan was asking for the weapons back from the Afghan 's after Russia fled .
It left them at the whim of those who chose to keep them .

I am not sorry to say what a terrrible piece of journalism Sharmeen .
This report is totally biased and produced with content as per the wishes of Western powers only .
It is not a true picture .
You presented only one side of the picture .
It is no surprise that the report comes from the middle of a great playground ( the Tribal Areas ) where the Western occupation along with India are playing out their dirty game .
I agree there are people who have bad intentions and hard line beliefs .
But those who Sharmeen portray that way are very few among the majority of the population .
It is a great shame that for the cost of few dollars you are lobbying against the interest of 170 million Pakistanis .

Amazing documentary , and fantastic and supremely brave reporting by Sharmeen Obaid - Chinoy .
As a frequent viewer of Frontline , this is a piece that I know will follow me for some time .
I do wish , however , that Ms. Obaid - Chinoy would have dug a little deeper into the completely dysfunctional education system ( if you can call it that ! ) of Pakistan .
The poverty of the region and utter failure of the government to provide its children with any basic education have provided the perfect vector to spread the Taliban 's doctrine of hate .
But why and how did Pakistan fail in this vital endeavor , despite receiving tens of billions of dollars in American aide ?
My guess is that a great deal of our taxpayer dollars are lining the pockets of Pakistan 's corrupt leaders , while its children suffer as a direct result of their greed .
This should have been discussed , and I hope FRONTLINE will produce a follow up film , which will focus on this sad reality .
Pakistan 's leaders , wherever you are , be ashamed !!

I am not shocked at all .
Pakistan created the Taliban and kept them alive to fight a proxy war in Kashmir against India .
The foundation of Pakistan is based on the hatred of India because it is not a Muslim country .
Extremism is like flesh eating bacteria , and as thing gets tougher in India and Afghanistan , it has to find food elsewhere -- and it did inside Pakistan .
If you live in a glass house , do n't throw stones at your neighbor .
The U.S. should stop all aid to Pakistan and let the Taliban take over and the war will move from Afghanistan to Pakistan .
The allied forces will have 1 front to fight not 2 as now .
What is really sad is that a once great religion has mutated into what you see now in Pakistan .

Was anyone else watching that city destroyed on the border reminded of the U.S. policy in Vietnam ?
" We had to destroy the village to save it from communists ? "
Then that soldier in the hospital said the Army was using ' US ' tactics .
And if we ' fight like this ' we can't win .
I am trying to figure out how this happened .
David Petraeus is supposed to be this big intellectual who understands counter - insurgency warfare .
But somehow the message is not getting through to the actors in Pakistan .
The clearest example is her interview with the Pakistani military leader , saying those young teenage kids were " part of the problem not part of the solution . "
This is ignorance on a U.S. - in- Vietnam scale .
They are actively creating Taliban by their war tactics , but then pretending it is not happening , and thinking they can just level every village and forget about the refugees .
I think we have seen this movie in Vietnam , I do n't know why we are using these ' missile attacks ' if it is just repeating the mistakes of that war .
So thanks Rumsfeld , thank you neocons .
You chased the Taliban out of Afghanistan , left them alone for 8 years so you could blow up Iraq , and now they have nukes .
Way to go .
Imagine if the Khmer Rouge had nukes .
They would have used them in a heart beat .
And no , you do n't need ' skill ' to use them , just a couple of scientists you buy off or scare into launching them for you ( if you do n't already have the expertise ... which a lot of the Taliban do , having been educated overseas ) .

Clearly , after watching this video , it has only strengthened my opinion that the U.S. should get its forces not only out of Afghanistan , but also , remove them from Pakistan as well .
Osama Bin Laden has been deceased since 2002 , per Benazir Bhutto's David Frost Interview which the BBC , which edited out the revelation about Osama Bin Laden being dead .
Therefore , the legitimacy of ANY U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and indeed , Pakistan , is not only ' questionable ' it is highly illegal and smelly .
The U.S. is destroying these two nations for its own energy conquests , and this must stop .
The Drone attacks must stop .
The squandering of U.S. forces in the region must stop .
The United States needs to ' apologize ' to the world for carrying out the biggest fraud of the century .
Justification of war in Afghanistan to chase a man who not only has not been proven to have attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11 , 2001 , but also , the major reason for going into Afghanistan has been proven to be utterly , totally false and nothing more than a ' lie ' by those who have demonstrated unbelievable HUBRIS in destroying these ' 2 ' countries -- and doing so for energy conquests and wars of aggression on people who have not harmed the U.S. in any way .
We must get out .

If I were in charge of Pakistan , I would first get rid of all the people in the Education Ministry starting with the minister .
The government schools in Pakistan are ghost schools .
Teachers are on payroll , classes are full , salaries are given , bills are paid , but in reality there are zero classes .
There is no furniture , there are no teachers , sometimes there are a few students wandering about in search of a teacher .
The Taliban are serious and very committed about their evil goals , and teach and feed and clothe for free anyone who sends their child to them .
The government just takes money from the world , the U.S. , etc. , while the ministers and the teachers pocket the money and run their private business or hold other jobs .
Until the racket is fixed , Pakistan can not be fixed .

I had friends from Swat valley , as far as I know they are very self respectful and brave people , and every house carries large amount of weapons .
So how can they allow these few terrorists to terrorize them ?
It 's the right time to use their weapons -- they have to help themselves if they do n't want Taliban there .
A few terrorists come into their areas and they let them go .
I cannot understand this , so I request the local people , stand up and face those cowards .

A few people posed the question " How could they let this situation grow ? "
I believe it 's because of the thin line between pride / anger , enthusiast / zealot , supporter / warrior .
You can teach people an ideology , religious or not , but the person providing the instruction can pervert this or not .
I can tell kids about a married man 's life , but if I teach them and keep the idea that extra-marital relations is not only the norm , but encouraged , they will feel it 's true .
Such is the case with teaching kids solely about religion and a militant party 's beliefs , and nothing else .

Pakistan 's weakness is its bad location , surrounded by enemies .
However , the evil the Americans have done to this world , will indeed lead to its complete disintegration .

This ongoing war with the Taliban will have further fallout in Pakistan and in turn more extremists will be produced to threaten Pakistan 's and the world 's peace .
If you notice all the kids shown in the video being recruited have similar characteristics : Extreme poverty - not being able to feed themselves and their families .
No access to education other than that of madrassas and most of them not even having proper shelter .
Therefore to win this war , a long term strategy is needed to eliminate the above problems in those areas
So far in this film and in many others , I 've never seen even an average educated kid or adult with a stable financial family background joining or being recruited by the Taliban .
Hence I come to the conclusion that the Taliban is exploiting the problems of those people and they are joining them more than any other reason just to survive poverty , hunger , disgrace and shame .
More spending is needed in that area to provide some sort of jobs and education -- that itself will enlighten people towards a moderate kind of thinking rather than hardcore extremist view .
On one front the Army and its counter insurgency should be conducted to eradicate the present Taliban .
But what is more important , is the long term stability of the region that will come if -- and only if -- heavy spending is done in education and the economy in that area .

Only a country that really wants to defeat terrorism can do it .
There will be a lot of international pressure to try to learn to live side by side .
Yet even if you try to come to an understanding , the terrorists will not be satisfied until they consume you completely and control the whole country .
Once having done this they will want more .
Power has no limit .
First Pakistan , then they will want more .
Take a lesson from Sri Lanka , the only country to defeat terrorism .
As per the FBI the LTTE were the worst of the worst terrorist in the world that could not be defeated .
So they thought .
But a tiny country proved otherwise .

This is excellent reporting .
It 's a shame that the rest of our media have given up on the news business and can do little more than regurgitate each other 's stories , adding only their own spin .
I do n't know what we would do for news these days , if it were not for PBS and the BBC .
As Sharmeen points out , this is a fight for the allegiance of the people of large portions of Pakistan and Afghanistan , and the local people have by no means given up the fight .
The Taliban 's tactics are not new -- we have seen them dozens of times in places all across the world -- to terrorize the adults and to indoctrinate the children .
This strategy has been beaten before , and can be beaten again , if Pakistan and the rest of the world offer a consistent strategy .
The Taliban are primarily funded by Saudi money .
This problem cannot be solved without involving Saudi Arabia , but so far we have been afraid of doing so .
We have invested in a regime in Saudi Arabia -- the house of Saud -- and we are hesitant to weaken it by forcing them to clamp down on their own people .
Saudi Arabia itself is a nation in peril , with hundreds of princes vying for power , a population growing increasingly restive as millions of people are left out of their share of the oil money , etc .
It 's an extremely unstable situation , and the U.S. is necessarily cautious about putting too much pressure on it .
But sooner or later we will have to do something , because so long as they can continue to export Wahabism and the money to back it up , the world will remain a dangerous place .
The Pakistani government and military are in a tough spot .
On the one hand , they created the Taliban , and hope to continue to use them against the U.S. and India .
On the other hand , they cannot tolerate flagrant attacks on their own authority .
And now they are under pressure , because if they do n't do something , America will cut off the money tap , and then how will they send their kids to Europe or America for their education , how will they continue to build their nest eggs ?
I think that we in the West need to continue along the lines many people have already mentioned : support education in Pakistan , stop the flow of Saudi money , work directly with the Pakistani people ( and not their corrupt government ) to help them fight the Taliban .
Secular schools , some sort of functioning economy , somewhat more effective police to protect them from Taliban violence ... this may well be enough to turn the tide .
However , we also need to be prepared for the worst .
If not now , the time may yet come when the only solution is to split Pakistan up .
This may not be such a bad thing .
The Punjabis would likely keep the nuclear weapons .
They are richer and more educated , and have their own wealth to protect .
They are less vulnerable to Taliban influence , and could be better trusted to keep the nuclear weapons safe , simply because they have more to lose .
Punjab Sindh would be a more progressive country , freed from the burden of carrying the rest of Pakistan .
The tribal areas may need to be separated , perhaps with Baluchistan in the south and some kind of Pashtun homeland in the north .
They will likely continue fighting , but without nuclear weapons , they would be less of a threat to the rest of the world .
The US could support the more civilized parts of the NWFP area , such as Swat , and help establish schools , hospitals , some kind of local industry .
Punjab and Sindh would no doubt support this as well , since it gives them a buffer zone between themselves and the more lawless parts further west .
Finally , we need to do something about the Pakistan - Afghanistan border .
This border is ignored by the Pashtun people , and will never be sealed unless we park 100,000 American troops there forever .
But there is no reason to seal it if Pasthun parts of Pakistan are united with similar parts of Afghanistan .
Then they , as a country , can sort out their own problems .
There is probably no way to deal with them other than letting them live their own lives as they please , but with the threat of massive retaliation if they take their fights outside their own borders .

These murderers should be tracked , caught and eliminated once and forever .
( anonymous )
For a moment , step back and think what are the reasons of all this .
It is the American occupation of Afghanistan that is creating these problems .
But no one will bother looking at this aspect of the story because the media in America never ever focuses on this issue .
To average Americans , this is a just war as it was in Vietnam and in Iraq in pursuit of WMDs .
Wake up please and realise that USA is occupying a country to which it came with limited goals and those goals have not been achieved .
This is the bigger failure of this occupation .
The biggest failure is the failure to realise that it is an occupation and it is in no one 's favor .

This is a typical Western funded documentary to reemphasize and accentuate the same anti-Taliban hatred once again .
These ignorant individuals ( Talibans ) are reactionaries showing their reactions after being bombed and killed by the Pakistan Army and their masters for the last seven years .
The Taliban 's reactions are not only wrong and dreadful but undoubtedly non Islamic .
But all these highly funded documentaries discuss the reactions and the reactionaries but not the actions and the initial and brutal and barbaric conspiracies .
You all are just missing the point either intentionally or unintentionally !!!

I have a mix of awe and respect for Shameen because of the courage and personal risk that she put herself into to make this documentary .
I pray that Shameed may continue to live and to express the views of both sides of the conflict in safety .
What I learned from this is that we ( meaning the Pakistani govt as well as citizens from the West in particular ) need to realize the sort of issues that go on in the rest of the world .
That using purely military might to obliterate a terrorist group will never work , because when you kill innocent lives , it will only plant seeds of resentment and hatred which is the perfect environment to cultivate young and impressionable minds to become terrorists .
In their minds they are only militant defenders of the poor and oppressed .
We must reach out to these people with respect and dignity , to lift them out of poverty , provide them with education and jobs and also teach them a moderate form of religion .
Mankind only wishes to live in peace and harmony , but when you have nothing and you are repressed , you accept the hand of whoever reaches out to you .
Governments must also curb corruption and provide assistance to all of their citizens .
May the policy makers of the world watch this documentary .

This is certainly one of the best pieces of journalism that I have ever seen .
One of the greatest victims here is the religion of Islam .
Many of the beliefs of the Taliban by themselves are idealistic in nature .
How many Muslims , or people of any other faith for that matter , believe in sacrificing their lives for just causes ?
As an example , are n't Americans doing it everyday in Afghanistan and Iraq by fighting for what they believe to be a just cause ?
But the combination of these ideals with an extremist mentality is an ugly one .

It 's amazing to see how easily the Taliban have hijacked the Islamic religion to their own purposes .
They have taken what 's good about Islam and corrupted it into a senseless war of jihadism and righteousness .
Killing people is wrong .
Forcing others to concede to your way of thinking is wrong .
The Taliban are hateful , malicious and manipulative so - called leaders who breed nothing but more of the same .
They take advantage of young , poor helpless people by providing them with the basic elements of a human life : food , shelter and sense of existence .
And at such a young and impressionable age .
Really , the Pakistani government should be deeply ashamed that they could not ( or would not ) do the same .
Pakistan started as an ideology of what was good in Islam .
It 's incredibly hard to watch the country disintegrate into a distorted view of what Islam is all about .
Kudos to Chinoy for braving such an incredible journey .
I personally hope the Taliban rot in hell for their deception , hate and notorious tunnel vision .

What an amazing video , very comprehensive .
One is horrified while watching .
Yet , at the same time , as I listened to the commander talk about the recruitment of children ( boys ) and listened to the teenagers talk about guns and killing , I could see the similarities with the gun-loving , macho culture that we live in .
Six and seven year old boys here would like to walk around with those with guns , feeling powerful - getting power .
Do n't we too have suicide killers here ?
Yes , it 's not the same , but it 's also not a world away .
One can see the links .
Perhaps this is one reason it is so easy to recruit and so difficult to defeat these forces .
The boy says - women are like plastic bags , the music video says women are things to be bought and sold .
Again , not exactly the same but not as far apart as one might think or wish .

Frightening and alarming .
Clearly there is some country that helped Pakistan in securing nuclear weapons .
It is incumbent upon that country to come forward and destroy the arsenal before they come into the hands of fanatics who do n't care who lives and who dies .
All Pakistanis should be concerned because they are sitting on a time bomb that will mostly consume from within .

This is absolutely tragic .
The U.S. is partly responsible for the current events .
The U.S. has been giving money to Pakistan over the years ( billions of dollars ) and never held Pakistan accountable .
My suspicion is that most of the corrupt politicians of Pakistan have lined their pockets .
It is not implausible that some of the Taliban / Al Qaeda are involved in looting the money given by US .
It is not too late to take corrective actions .
Make Pakistan accountable for every penny that has been given by U.S.
If they are unwilling to control the Taliban / Al Qaeda then stop the aid .
And , lastly , force them to take action .
If the U.S. does not take action now , then a disaster is waiting to happen .

Watching the lives that the children of northern Pakistan are living is absolutely heartbreaking .
They are wide - eyed , hopeful and full of life regardless of the horrendous circumstances that they live in .
There is talk here about " stopping the cycle of violence " and policy change where our own western governments are concerned .
If policy change will halt the barbaric practices of the Taliban , then perhaps that option should be examined .
Unfortunately , the Taliban have made clear by their past actions in Afghanistan that their goal is a medieval Islamic emirate .
That goal existed long before September 11th .
What I 'm trying to express here is this :
The children in this piece are victims of the Taliban , and no one else .
Pakistan is on the verge of becoming a FAILED NUCLEAR STATE , at the hands of the Taliban .
I truly hope that we can all agree that the Pakistani military deserves all the support it can get .

Excellent report !
Sharmeen is a very brave woman .
I was horrified by this video , it shows the depth of commitment that the Taliban has and the power they command .
The fear the Taliban employ is merely a window dressing for their true power : economics .
Sending parents food help and even money just for the chance to " educate " their children is both brilliant and disgusting .
These people are not idiots -- they know that they may never see their children again but they are destitute and the Pakistani state is powerless to help them , so they turn to the Taliban .
As Pakistan deteriorates , the Taliban will gain power in a negative feedback loop , caused by economic distress and the power vacuum left by the state 's collapse .
The only way to stop this is a massive state building exercise designed to create local jobs and foster personal responsibility and a culture intolerant of corruption .
The US may not be able to do this , due to our own problems , but I hope that someone will step in and give the Pakistani people the chance to be powerful , productive and peaceful world citizens .

Pakistan created the Taliban monster with the help of the U.S. during and after the Russian invasion of Afghanistan .
Now they have turned their guns against their masters .
Pakistan has to wipe them out .
They cannot negotiate with these barbarians who are using the name of Islam to grab power .
Pakistan needs the world 's help , not finger pointing , to deal with this cancer .

This was a chilling piece of journalism .
The toughts it leaves behind will not go away .
What is more profound than two best friends who would kill each other when confronted with the right circumstances ?
It shows what religion makes us willing to do .
Help us all .
Having pondered this piece of news only shows me how education must be brought to Pakistan .
Education free for all .
That is where the world has to provide for Pakistan , anything else is useless .
Only educated people with abilities to fend for themselves will be in position to oppose Talibans ignorant way of existence .
Having just read " Three Cups of Tea " left me with such hope and knowledge .
I highly recommend it to all of the people who have watched this documentary .

The reporter did n't ask the politicians why the public education system has collapsed .
If the only education available to the poor are the Taliban , of course the country will continue to absorb Taliban ideals .
Give parents a better / well - balanced alternative and the Taliban will lose their grip on future generations .

I have pointed out in the film that the public system of education has collapsed because the Pakistani government has failed its people .
The Pakistani government has from time to time acknowledged this failure .
I also point out that if the ordinary , poor Pakistanis were given a choice they would send their children to secular schools rather than religious ones .
Chicago , IL
Until the moderate Muslims in Pakistan stand up and take their country back , the Taliban will always be a presence .
They provide what the always weak government wo n't : law and order , food , infrastructure .
For too long , those with education and money have been ignoring what 's going on right under their noses because , so far at least , it does n't affect their day - to - day lives .
They still go to parties , go to weddings , spend hours at each other 's houses drinking tea and discussing how the US ruined their country .
They ruined their own country .
Pakistan was doomed to failure from the day it declared independence .
Why ?
Because it was founded on bribery and greed .

There has been a conscious effort by the US and CIA to destabilize Pakistan , manifested in these last elections which were entirely a Western project .
The road map given to this new PM
is the breakup of Pakistan ( to open a new front in the " War on Terror " ) and the surrender of Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal .
This is so as to allow for a military intervention so as to break Pakistan ( like Afghanistan / Yugoslavia ) into a few protectorates and war zones .
The US needs a significant military presence in Pakistan , the last country that borders Iran , which is not occupied by or a client to the US .
This is all about Oil and the fact the Iran is still a free country .

I am quite amazed after reading some of this feedback that some participants are so naive as to continue to blame U.S. involvement as an excuse for this type of behavior .
In order for you to understand the roots of this problem I urge you inform yourselves on the background of Abdullah Azzam ( Bin Laden 's Protege ) , author of the book " Al Jihad . "
It is also quite apparent that advocates for action in Darfur state claims that the U.S is aligned with causation for actions that evolve out of Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Do human or women 's rights in Africa take precedent over the ones that are taking place in this region ?
Please do some critical thinking and research before making these ridiculous claims .
Is the U.S. a saint when it comes to foreign policy ?
Of course not .
However you do have to take into account the good things along with the bad .
Put your personal politics aside should you have any real concern for this situation and provide some logical solutions that might benefit the people suffering in these regions .

As someone who understood the Urdu conversation , I was fuming when I head the teacher of madrassa in Peshawar mentioned that they never run out of sacrificial lambs .
The Urdu sentence sounded a lot more offensive because I immediately had picture of numerous sacrifices of goats I have seen ; the picture of their heads attached by thin skin and flesh .
His callous attitude towards children really bothered me .
Towards the end , the child singing about the kind of death he wishes shows the exploitation of children .
I wish more people could understand the words in Urdu .

After watching this documentary , one wonders where the so - called Pakistani leadership was ?
How could they let so much evil grow under their noses ?
How could they let the children be treated like this ?
Why did the government not have schools for these children of the poor and provide them food and shelter ?
All the money that has gone to Pakistan , you do not see signs of it anywhere .
What a shameful situation , for a supposedly Islamic country , that the most innocent and helpless children are recruited by these mullah monsters to train them to go blow themselves up in the name of Islam .
Please , the world is moving forward .
These children should be learning science and technology , instead they are memorizing the Quran .
The horrible , terrible , monstrous and villainous mullah should all be hanged for their crimes against women and children .
I cannot imagine the Pakistani government allowing even one madrassa to function .
There is no reason that this should have happened in Pakistan , where there is so much potential and so much talent and we could have been standing more strong and secure in the world .
But our leadership has again and again failed , and failed miserably .
Yet we continue to have the same horrible people come and rule us .
Who , at the drop of a hat , will leave the country and go to their mansions abroad , which have been bought by Pakistani money illegally obtained and legitimized by NRO .

What is sad is that if we had not neglected this segment of our society for so long , things might have been much different .
The Taliban seem only to be able to gain strength because of our mistakes .
They could have very easily been educated citizens striving to develop their areas , rather than burning them down to the ground .
I feel we cannot only depend on our government ( although it is their responsibility ) anymore .
It is high time for the public to help stop this virus from spreading and try and do what should have been done a long time ago : close the gap between the different segments of society .

An incredible video and really terrifying , especially the last line : " Pakistan may soon belong to them . "
In fact , I am not against Islam but the imposition of Taliban Shariah .
The story was nicely told by Ms. Obaid - Chinoy , a very courageous woman .
But there are still some very important questions unanswered .
What do the Taliban want ?
What will be the end of this movement ?
Is it Shariah to kill innocent people in the name of Islam ?
How can the American 's War Against Terror end ?
Is there any chance of Taliban leaders to sit with higher authorities and find the solution to these acts of brutality ?
I am really very hopeful that we can save the lives of millions of children if we can discuss it with TTP .

I often work in conflict zones and am always careful to hide people 's identities -
In this case , the girls and their father insisted on telling us their story without hiding their face -
They wanted people to look into their eyes , see what they were going through -
Without their compelling testimonies most people would not realize what is happening to the people of Swat -
We were very careful to hide where they lived , you never see their house from outside or the street they live on -
So as a journalist i felt i did my duty -
And since the film has come out the family is safe and happy to hear that so many people outside the country now know that the Taliban do not represent the people of Swat. ( anonymous )
A rare view into what it looks like in that part of the world .
When watching , I often found myself wondering whether the translations of what people were saying were accurate .
I see from one of the responses that it may not have been .
I 'm sure the filmmaker is presenting what she thinks is the truth , but in these types of conflicts , the truth can be different things for different people .

After seeing the boys speak , it is apparent that they must not be spared in fighting the Taliban .
They have already been brainwashed and probably will always believe what they 've been taught at such young ages , becoming violent men in future .
I fear for the girls though .
I think most of them are anti-Taliban and are suffering terribly on a social level , never mind the state of perpetual war .
They lose in this situation for their present and very probably their future as well if this abomination is not stopped R H

This is absolutely no different then the children recruited and murdered in the name of another power hungry megalomaniac , Pol Pot and the Khemer Rouge in Cambodia .
They 're mind bending and holding them with just the promise of survival , food , and places to sleep , safe from the dangers of the streets .
The Taliban ( " students of religion " ) are fanatical , using their religion as power .
The religious border school between Pakistan and Afghanistan , funded by Islamic charities ( mostly Saudi ) , preaches the strictest form of Islam , including self sacrifice , ( ie. suicide bombers ) and total suppression of women 's based human rights .
Pakistan has nurtured these religious schools to support their Kashmir campaign , but also to make certain Afghanistan does not become an open non-aligned country and a buffer between Shia Iran .
Until Pakistan makes the hard choice to govern the border tribal areas , there will never be peace in Afghanistan and that threatens Pakistan as a state and member of the international community .
US policy to close the border in the SE , Helmand or Kandahar Provinces will not be successful until a full and complete cooperation from Pakistan .

sigh those little girls are my heroes .

The first girl is such a trooper for taking care of her mother .
I hope the indirect care the nurses provide for her mother will be an education for her so when it is time for her to advance she will be able to do so .
The two girls obviously come from a very loving family .
I am glad you showed how it is not the community , but the restrictions put on the community that makes it how it is .
Those girls are the cream of the crop .
It is crazy how the Taliban and Pakistani army are both playing off the vulnerability of the displaced and poor .
This is how it usually is though .
It 's a shame .
I feel so helpless .
When I look at them , they are all humans stuck in a crappy situation .
I want to scoop them all up , and take them home .
Yet , this is idealized hope .

Great job , Sharmeen and I commend you on your courage and bravery traveling to Pakistan and covering all the news .
It is a shame what is happening there , especially with the young children who are so impressionable .
I hope and pray the Pakistani government will not have to eat their words when they said that they will definitely win this war against the Taliban .
Do they not see what is happening ?
How can any country look to a better future when their schools are destroyed ?.
When little girls are not allowed to go to school .
When all the Taliban wants to do is use these very kids as sacrificial lambs for slaughter .

I think it 's already too late to save Pakistan .
Life as they have known it will soon end .
It 's only a matter of time before the Taliban completely take over the place .
The civilian leadership is too weak to order the army to do anything .
Most of the aide that Pakistan receives from abroad will find its way into the bank accounts of corrupt politicians .
The recent peace deal in Swat was approved by the Pakistani parliament in one day with 2 people in the assembly speaking against it .
It was approved unanimously because the Taliban threatened to kill anyone opposing it .
Can you imagine a situation where elected leaders are too scared to speak in parliament and will simply rubber stamp something like this ?
So instead of wasting any more time , the US should quickly put plans in place to destroy Pakistan 's nuclear capabilities .
Once that is out of the way , we can all breathe a lot easier .

This is a brilliant documentary and explains very lucidly what is happening around us .
It tries to give a holistic picture as well -- a truly brave and commendable feat by the journalist .
It explains much more than any voluminous report could .
People are understandably worried here in Pakistan , but there is also denial which we need to come out of .
We must resist this onslaught , which will destroy this nation and set it back a thousand years .
It has to be done now not just by force alone ( that too unfortunately will have to be used ) , but by rooting out the main causes that have resulted in the quagmire we are in .
Education is the key but it has to be supplemented with a sound justice system and economic opportunities .
Easier said than done .

Centuries of so - called progress and yet this is what we get .
A country with the most sophisticated and deadly weapons ever created by man , that are capable of ending the world in a real sense , are being taken over by religious zealots who would have felt right at home 2,000 years ago .
Clearly , many parts of humanity have not progressed much .
The real danger though is that we are all very much like the Pakistani's .
All of us are just one generation away from being in their shoes .
And as NAazi Germany shows , even the most civilized of countries can commit real evil and act in irrational and self destructive ways .
I can only conclude , based on this documentary , that human beings are flawed beyond redemption .

I stumbled upon this documentary on my local PBS station by accident .
I am also originally from Pakistan and have been living in the USA for several years .
It seems that lately all the news are full of stories about the Afghan - Pakistan violence .
I did not realize the extent of this violence until I actually saw this documentary .
Sharmeen mentions that people used to go to the Swat Valley for vacation .
My family and I took that trip once and it was beautiful .
I am extremely sad to see what is becoming of those beautiful parts of my country .
I just want to find a way to help these children who are getting all the wrong information about the religion of Islam and even the rest of the world .
I come from a family that has always emphasized the importance of a good education .
In my opinion , a lot of these problems are rooted in the fact that Pakistan has such a low literacy rate .
I think one way to help these children break the cycle of violence is to educate them .
What Afghanistan and Pakistan need are books and dedicated educators , not guns and bombs .
stillwater , ok
These people are hopelessly backwards .
The USA needs to withdraw from this hopeless part of the world and devote itself to completely ending its use of foreign oil .
The Taliban are like Nazis , you either crush them or get completely away from them .
Since we do n't have a legitimate national interest , we should completely leave the Middle East and find a way to end all involvement .
They must work out their own horrible problems without us .

The parallels to other terrorist organizations around the world is very disturbing .
The use of FM radio to control and direct an entire population is very similar to the role played by RTLM during the Rwandan Genocide .
The brainwashing of children and their exploitation as child foot soldiers and suicide bombers is taking a page out of the LTTEs tactics in Sri Lanka .
Considering these parallels , here is a wake - up call to all those who think that the Taliban / Al - Qaeda will not be able to take control of Pakistan 's nuclear arsenal or even if they do , will not have the ability to operationally use it .
The LTTE was able to build several rudimentary aircrafts in the jungles of Sri Lanka .
Though operating a nuclear weapon is several orders of magnitude more complicated , I would not put it out of the reach of Al - Qaeda / Taliban in Pakistan .
Scary thought .
Hope the US and Pakistan intelligence agencies have a contingency plan in place to prevent such an eventuality !

This piece reaffirms my belief that the only way to eliminate this virus of an ideology is complete destruction .
I am saddened that it has to come to this but those of us who have evolved into beings that have the ability to live together peacefully and respect each others religion can not tolerate a virus such as this that wants to inflict death upon the very basic fiber of our world .
Like a virus , they destroy their host until the host dies .
They do not value life and there is no reasoning with them .
In WWII we dropped atomic weapons that although killed thousands of lives , mostly civilians , prevented the deaths of millions .
It is time to strike once again using all means necessary .
Exterminate all life in the region so the rest of us who can live together in peace move on .

How strange that you make a piece on Pakistan and Pakistanis are not able to view it from Pakistan .

Hats off to the reporter and the camera crew .
You guys have done a great work in getting close to the reality and sharing it with the world .
Very brave work .

As an American - Muslim woman , by this I mean I was born in America and accepted Islam as an adult , this piece saddens me .
This is not the message that Islam teaches , at least not from my perspective .
Bombing , blowing yourself up and taking innocent lives is not what God tells us to do .
This is part of man 's desire to be in power .
This small group of men have hijacked my Islam and are using it to fit their own needs and personal views .
I pray that Allah opens their hearts and minds to see what they are doing is wrong .

Of course this is disturbing , but not surprising at all .
You'd have to have had your head in the sand to not know about the brutal tribal mentality that is festering and growing exponentially in all areas of the middle east .
Unfortunately , I do n't see any end in sight , nor solution .
I fear for mankind and do not want any grandchildren , period .

An extraordinary film but one that is ultimately only conveying one side of the story .
What is clearly missing is why this civil war phenomenon has appeared in Pakistan .
The Pak Army 's brutal and wholesale murder of villagers and razing their entire land to the ground is a war crime and a crime against humanity .
How is that glossed over but the revenge ( which I do n't condone ) is greatly magnified .
Also , no mention is made of the massacre of the Lal Masjid ( Red Mosque ) in 2007 by the Pak Army where Pakistani soldiers massacred hundreds of schoolgirls and teachers at a madrassa .
This is what set off the massive wave of suicide bombing in the country as a sort of revenge by whatever and whichever means .
Also , why not mention that the Pakistani state has utterly failed , education being the first to fall ?
The madrassas are only flourishing because state schools have zero funding and resources by a corrupt government only interested in lining its pockets and stashing the loot in Swiss banks as in the case of Zardari and his minions .
Covering just one side of the story is not just deceptive , it also creates a false view that ultimately results in failure to solve the crisis .

Excellent report .
Kind of makes all the news coverage of the economic downturn seem trivial in comparison .

An incredible piece .
As a student of security studies , Arabic and the media , this documentary was enlightening on so many levels .
The dismal reality of Pakistan makes my stomach tie into a knot .
It hurts to think about the stories you portrayed ; it is excruciating to realize that they represent a tiny fraction of an expanding base of jihadism .
I believe that the resources of the US government can solve the challenges we face there .
I 'm entirely skeptical of the Pakistani government though .

Correspondent Chinoy was awfully brave & as committed , I think , as the Taliban she reported on .
But so were the civilians who responded so openly to her questions .
Greed & disregard of the sacredness of life have made all sides blind to the evil inflicted on humanity everywhere .
What a shame .
We 're all doomed if this is not corrected .
And no one in power seems interested in correcting anything for the time being .
Denise Turner
Philadelphia , Pa .
Your reporting is vivid , inspiring , frightening .
I am terrified not of the evil in foreign lands , but of the evil of my own domestic leaders that continue to repeat the same mistakes that have placed the entire world on this collision course .
Amen . East Meredith , New York
From the madrassa teacher : " No matter how many Muslims die , we will never run out of sacrificial lambs ...
Someone who sees death as a blessing - who can defeat him ? "
And the man who recruits children as suicide bombers : " Children are tools to achieve God 's will . "
Folks , let 's get real , the Taliban will succeed in both Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The US 's involvement in these two feudal , dreadfully corrupt societies will not change the outcome , but we 're too ignorant and proud to recognize that .
America is incapable of admitting error or defeat .
These brainwashed children are a just a blood - thirsty version ( albeit much poorer ) of the brainwashed youth at Yeshivas and Christian universities and Bible schools .

Sharmeen Obaid - Chinoy 's reporting was compelling and unbelievably brave .
Revelations uncovered here in this 1/2 hour story were profound ... this was raw - unhampered by slickness of any kind .
The truth and power of this story will stay with me for a very long time .

If only the CIA , ISI and Saudis would start cooperating again and try to undo the ill - effects of the monster they created 30 years ago , perhaps we can begin to reverse this problem .
This is the 3rd generation of the Taliban .
The originally brainwashed no longer need the devils that manipulated them from the outside .
They swallowed the pill of hate whole and are now passing it on to the next generation .
The ignorant are infecting the destitute with their ignorance and snowballing the cancer that we short - sightedly injected into that region .
Everyone needs to learn the lessons of past mistakes and not contribute to this problem any longer .
We know the Russians and Indians have a prime opportunity to slap back at Pakistan and the US by surreptitiously arming and egging on the Taliban , but once these monsters feel they have settled their score with the Pakistani government , they 'll quickly revert to targetting Hindu India and expanding into Russia 's southern - Istan neighnors .
This is a psycological and socio- economic war more so than anything else .
There needs to be a mass propogation of moderate , mainstream , AUTHENTIC Islam both on the airwaves but also by the seizure and building of alternatie madrassas for these poor children .
Instead of feeding feudal land families and obese military generals with the billions we send in military and economic aid , we need to start using it to build infrastructure and opporutinites in the ravished regions .
Anyone that says America should just forget about this region will be in for a rude awakening soon .

One of the great things about spring for any avid cyclists it the opportunity to get back to regular outdoor rides .
Good bye trainer , hello open roads .
As we spin into shape we tend to start talking about cycling events for the season and which ones we may want to give a go alone or in a group .
It 's fairly often friends and family of riders mention seeing an event in their area , but they did not quite know what to make of it .
Scott Martin , writer for Road Bike Rider , wrote a nice little commentary for bike race observers with cheering instructions .
I think you will enjoy as follows :
Helpful things to shout :
---" Your teammate is bridging up to you . "
---" Four riders have a 15 - second lead , but two of them are n't pulling . "
---" Take turn 1 wide .
I sprinkled carpet tacks on the inside . "
( Best said sotto voce . )
Unhelpful things to shout :
---" Go faster ! "
---" You 're getting dropped . "
---" Boy , do you stink . "
How to answer when bystanders ask why you 're not racing :
---" I put the ' cry ' in criterium . "
---" I get dizzy riding around in circles . "
---" I prefer it when my skin is attached to my body . "
What to yell at French riders :
---" Allez , allez ! "
What to yell at Italian riders :
---" Forza , forza ! "
What to yell at Spanish riders :
---" Venga , venga ! "
What to yell at American riders :
---" Get outta the road , you spandex weirdoes .
I 'm late for work . "
Know your victory salutes :
--- Two arms upraised : Classic , says it all .
--- One arm upraised :
See above , only too tired to raise other arm .
--- Rocking imaginary baby : I dedicate this win to my newborn daughter / son .
--- Pointing index finger skyward : I dedicate this win to my deceased teammate / coach / bike washer .
--- Pumping a clenched fist :
Take that , you disbelieving team manager / cycling journalist / boy - or girlfriend who dumped me .
--- Firing invisible pistol : I 'm the baddest hombre in town .
--- Shooting invisible bow and arrow : I 'm the baddest indigenous person on the prairie .
--- No salute : I hope there is n't any drug testing .
Australia 's isolated communities has made telecoms progress difficult The Australian government has announced a massive project to extend broadband internet systems across the country .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described Australia as a " broadband backwater " and likened the project to building the railways in the 19th Century .
He dropped plans for a private tender , in favour of a government investment of about A$ 43bn ( $ 30bn , £ 20.9 bn )
Mr Rudd had promised a fast , affordable broadband system in the 2007 elections that brought him to power .
Just as railway tracks laid out the future of the 19th Century and electricity grids the future of the 20th Century , so broadband represents the core infrastructure of the 21st Century
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd Private firms , such as Singapore 's Optus and Canada 's Axia NetMedia had been bidding for a A$ 10 bn - A$ 15 bn fibre - to - the - node network offering speeds up to 12 megabits per second .
Experts advised the government to choose instead the more ambitious fibre - to - the - home network offering 100 megabits per second , accessible by 90 % of Australian homes .
Turbo - charged Mr Rudd described the broadband plan as " the single largest nation - building infrastructure project in Australia 's history " , which would play a huge role in " turbo - charging Australia 's economic future " .
" Just as railway tracks laid out the future of the 19th Century and electricity grids the future of the 20th Century , so broadband represents the core infrastructure of the 21st Century , " he said .
Under the new plan , the government will initially invest A$ 4.7bn with the overall investment from government and the private sector reaching up to A$ 43 bn over eight years .
Construction would begin early next year and the government would sell its stake in the broadband company five years after the network was up and running .
Australia 's largest telecoms firm Telstra was excluded from the initial tender but Communications Minister Stephen Conroy said it would be invited to take part in the new project .
The government also said it was considering a major regulatory shake - up in the telecoms industry .
It has proved difficult to bring fast internet to all Australians because of the large clusters of population in coastal areas contrasting with small , far - flung rural communities across a vast land .
Mr Rudd linked the project to his plans to help Australia cope with the global financial downturn , saying it would create 25,000 jobs a year during construction .

So , to launch this new feature , let ’s take a current look at a pair of FOX News jabberers and try to determine just WHO IS CRAZIER – Glenn Beck or Bill O’Reilly ???
Yes , we ’ll occasionally take a look at a couple of semi-outrageous , at - least - somewhat - connected figures in the news , comparing and contrasting them , their words , and their behavior until we can determine just which one of them is the nuttier , more insane , and just plain crazier individual .
We ’ll be plucking examples from the world of politics , media , pop culture – whatever floats to the surface of obvious madness .
Party labels , network or publication affiliations , or even poll or box office numbers wo n’t necessarily matter – if they seem unhinged , we ’ll call them on it …
Here ’s a new feature on The Stonecipher Report – one that ( unfortunately , perhaps , for the country ; but , fortunately for us smart - ass wise guys ) may well continue for awhile : WHO IS CRAZIER ???

Here ’s a new feature on The Stonecipher Report – one that ( unfortunately , perhaps , for the country ; but , fortunately for us smart - ass wise guys ) may well continue for awhile : WHO IS CRAZIER ???
Yes , we ’ll occasionally take a look at a couple of semi-outrageous , at - least - somewhat - connected figures in the news , comparing and contrasting them , their words , and their behavior until we can determine just which one of them is the nuttier , more insane , and just plain crazier individual .
We ’ll be plucking examples from the world of politics , media , pop culture – whatever floats to the surface of obvious madness .
Party labels , network or publication affiliations , or even poll or box office numbers wo n’t necessarily matter – if they seem unhinged , we ’ll call them on it …
Overview :
This is your classic comparison of a cagey veteran vs. an ambitious up - and - comer ( and watch for multiple sports analogies – mostly baseball - related – coming up ahead ) .
We all know that O’Reilly has been clever and crazier - than - batshit for years now .
His patented " No Spin Zone " has always been – of course – just a special sort of pre-emptive spin that warns and proactively criticizes his guests and opponents , allowing only HIS OWN SPIN to be uttered as alleged truth on his air .
Fair enough , sir – that ’s quite the good strategy ( especially if you never want thought - out opposition tossed in your jowly face ) .
Crazy , yes … but it apparently works pretty well – much like asking a cowering man " When did you stop beating your wife ? "
While hardly a rookie , the FOX newcomer Beck does n’t have the career - long statistics that Billo does … but , like a charging phenom challenging the established All - Star , he ’s definitely attracting some attention with his recent behavior .
And he ’s kinda subtly seductive to the same audience of morons that lap up Billo ’s loud , thrusting blather – Beck is more passive , sympathetic , and seemingly sensitive ( although , of course , not in any sort of lilly - boy liberal way ) .
Advantage : Billo , mostly on lengthy career and forceful reputation …
Recent Crazy Activity : O’Reilly has been hitting strongly for average , spraying his disdain for Obama , Pelosi , and Reid to all fields since November 4 , 2008 .
Particular recent crazy behavior has included sending out his stalker - producer to harass ( on her vacation , no less – after apparently following her for hours from her home ) a liberal female blogger who denounced his belittling of a rape victim AND ( nice insanity grand slam here ! ) his claiming that he and FOX have crushed NBC and their broadcast and cable news operations ( this , while the network made a healthy three - quarters - of - a - billion - dollars in profit , their network slate pulls good ratings , and the MSNBC lineup continues to gain in ratings ) .
However , the suddenly hard - hitting challenger seems to be in the middle of a DiMaggio - 56 - game - streak - in - 1941 or Sosa - hitting - 20 - homers - in - June - 1998 binge , rising above the current ( and frequent ! ) insanity of other righty commentators like Coulter , Ingraham , Hannity , and , yes , even O’Reilly .
Beck ’s been comparing himself to this country ’s Founding Fathers , weeping openly over politics and supposed safety from terrorism , and widening his eyes in seemingly constant surprise over the current direction of the US and the rest of world – cuckoo , cuckoo !
If Billo were any sort of a mentor – and not just a bitter , closed - in , always - # 2 - to - Rush figure among conservative bloviators – he might actually be proud of Lil’ Glenny … Instead , it ’s clearly just …
Advantage : Beck .
Self - Labels :
This one is a bit tricky – but amusing to those of us who can see through ( and sniff past ) bullshit .
While O’Reilly will occasionally openly rub up against conservatism ( and , of course , nearly only supports Republican figures and policies ) , he usually claims to be an independent who takes clear , truth - weighing looks at both sides of all issues and subjects .
Hah !
Uh , I mean " Ohh - kay , Bill – whatever you say ! "
On the other – and even nuttier – hand , Beck has recently claimed that his beliefs and the current activity of especially the left ( but including BOTH organized US political parties ) has pushed him much closer to declaring himself a Libertarian .
Now – pardon me , Dr. Paul – but that ’s just CRAZY .
Advantage : Beck .
Sample Crazy Quotes :
O’Reilly : " I just wish Katrina had only hit the United Nations building , nothing else , just had flooded them out , and I would n't have rescued them . " – 2005 " Listen , citizens of San Francisco , if you vote against military recruiting , you 're not going to get another nickel in federal funds .
Fine .
You want to be your own country ?
Go right ahead .
And if Al - Qaeda comes in here and blows you up , we 're not going to do anything about it . " – 2005 " You know , look , if I could strangle these people [ who criticize him ] and not go to hell and get executed , I would , but I can 't . " – 2007 " I could n't get over the fact that there was no difference between Sylvia 's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City .
I mean , it was exactly the same , even though it 's run by blacks ... there was n't one person shouting , ‘ Hey , MFer , I want more iced tea . ’ " – 2007 Beck : " I 'm thinking about killing Michael Moore ... I could kill him myself , or…hire somebody to do it ... No , I think I could . " – 2005 " You know , we all have our inner demons … I ’m on the verge of moral collapse at any time .
It can happen by the end of the show . " – 2006 " Al Gore 's not going to be rounding up Jews and exterminating them . " – 2007 " The most used phrase in my administration if I were to be President would be ‘ What the hell you mean we 're out of missiles ? ’ " – 2009
Advantage : Billo just sounds mean … while Beck sounds truly crazy ( AND seems to be getting worse ) .
Final Analysis : O’Reilly is consistent – yeah , consistently an asshole , but that widely circulated , nutty old " We ’ll do it live !
Fuck it ! " tape from his old " Inside Edition " days notwithstanding , he just does n’t seem to be out of his mind – well , not completely , anyway .
Most of his whole " Culture Warrior " crap seems simply calculated as the avenue that could make him the most bucks and give him the most sniffs at influence and semi-power .
So , much as Limbaugh is a focused , single - subject comedic entertainer , Billo is a calculated successful businessman on the fringes of politics …
Beck , however – well , he seems nuttier than Alan Keyes on a steady diet of meth , caffeine , pure cane sugar , and cocaine .
His recent performances crying on air – blaming the recent shooting spree in Alabama on the gunman ’s reaction to being " shut down by political correctness " ( which came only from Beck ’s imagination , not any reporting or investigation about the tragedy ) – and seeming to call for an armed opposition to the current US government to " rise up " out of Texas ( perhaps to be led by Chuck Norris ! ) … well , that ’s just goddamned insane , is n’t it ?
… Therefore , we here at The Stonecipher Report are proud ( well … also a bit disgusted , frankly ) to award the decision in our first WHO IS CRAZIER ???
analysis to FOX News ’ pathetic little cuddly bear of a teary patriot , Mr. Glenn Beck !
Good job !
And , man , you ARE crazy …
A little advice , though : Just try to pace yourself , dude – if O’Reilly had been thrashing about at that " Inside Edition " level since the late ‘ 80s or early ‘ 90s , he clearly would ’ve stroked out by now .
Perhaps you oughta try to ration out that craziness a bit at a time .
In fact , by my estimation , you ’re just about all nuttied out already for 2009 , here in only the third month of the year .
So , take a deep breath , have a drink or something ( unless you already do plenty of that – in which case , perhaps you wanna quit drinking instead , hmm ? ) , and give it all a little bit of a rest , Glenny .
There ’s plenty of time to try and launch a new " Boston Tea Party " or a modern defense of the Alamo or something like that later …
… Oh , but I know he wo n’t be listening to me or any of my considered advice , though .
Of course not – he ’s just fuckin ’ CRAZY …

The Summer Of Rage Starts Here ! - Call from London Anarchists
G20 London Summit : A rebellious call for days of action
March 28th - April 2nd 2009 THE SUMMER OF RAGE STARTS HERE !G20 London Summit : A rebellious call for days of actionMarch 28th - April 2nd 2009
' Put People First ' Anti-G20 demonstration , 11 am Central London
As the financial crisis has spurred a global economic recession the reality of the situation is being faced by us all – price hikes and wage cuts , job losses , spiralling debt and repossessions .
The institutions of government and global finance are making us pay for their mistakes , giving themselves hefty bonuses for the privilege .
As big banks get billions of our money to bail them out , the Post Office is threatened with privatisation and mass redundancies to claw back the pension hole !
Government and bosses , while protecting their own interests , are steadily losing their grip as the anger of the working class becomes more and more apparent after a decade of enforced ' social peace ' .
Putting working class anger first
The recent wildcat strikes at the Lindsay Oil Refinery saw workers take action for themselves , without union backing .
Thousands of workers across the country walked out in sympathy strikes – a practice still outlawed under the Thatcherite anti-trade union laws .
No repercussions were suffered by the workers - a lesson to us all .
And although we oppose such slogans as “ British Jobs for British Workers ” , we do not dismiss the experiences , anger and positive action of those workers to develop a pro-working class position , based not on capitalism 's demands for inter- worker competition , but on international class solidarity .
If we want social change we must fight without prejudice for it .
Solidarity is not a word but a weapon
Our purpose is to put direct action at the core of any fightback - against the repossessions and redundancies that we will face over the coming months and years , to restate our commitment for an international unity amongst all working class people regardless of nationality , race , sexuality or religion .
We stand shoulder to shoulder with all those who take direct action against their current situation ( against the state and its institutions , against the bosses and the capitalism they cling to ) , and confront those who seek to hinder or recuperate that action - fascist parties like the BNP , government forces , the trade union elite and the corporate media .
The memory of the miners strike , Wapping , Poll tax lingers long and hard .
2009 is our summer of rage - we are only as strong as the power we give ourselves .
Join the direct action bloc on the Put People First mass demonstration on Saturday March 28th .
Meet in Victoria Embankment Gardens , 11 am .
Look for the red and black flags .
APRIL 1/09 // RECLAIM THE MONEY
Meet in the Square Mile ( London 's Financial centre ) to take back what 's ours
World leaders , including Barak Obama , are set to meet at Docklands Excel Centre in London 's East End , for the G20 financial summit on April 2nd , to sort out the global crisis they themselves conspired to create .
While unemployment escalates along with debt and poverty - we are told to tighten our belts , not to complain , to have faith in bankers , bosses and politicians , these leaders are preparing the biggest shake up in the history of capitalism since the 1930s .
We can only imagine what is on offer as their solution - from the people that brought us wars in Afghanistan , Iraq and Palestine , from the heads of economies that continue to concentrate the world 's wealth in the hands of a tiny minority from the obscene rich and powerful who continue to steal the products of our labour and time , forcing us to fight amongst ourselves for what 's left .
We are living in uncertain , dangerous times , where we can either allow our futures , and the future of our children , to be decided by the same class of people that have brought us into this crisis ( and continue to profit from our misery ) or we can decide to get rid of the lot of them and organise society differently - for our own benefit and of the benefit of those around us ; those we work with , those we live with , for a future based on our collective needs .
We are their crisis
Let 's make this a chance for a fundamental change in society .
Let 's reclaim the history of working class struggle for a new free world , for a global human community fit for all , not the undeserving rich elite who are happy to see our lives ruined if it means that they stay in charge and at the top .
Join thousands of disgruntled , angry , pissed off people on the streets of the financial district .
As the bankers continue to cream off billions of pounds of our money let 's put the call out – RECLAIM THE MONEY , storm the banks and send them packing .

" NEOBITS is our mainstay in our IT business needs , fast friendly service , great prices and account representatives that go above and beyond to meet our ever changing needs . "
This blog entry is about one of the most interesting discoveries of the 90's in Neuroscience -- Mirror Neurons -- and a recent research paper that adds to their intrigue .
Mirror neurons are found in the premotor cortex , and what has made them so interesting is that they fire both when the individual performs a goal - directed action and when they watch someone else perform the same action .
It is as if the mirror neurons encode an understanding about the intentions of someone else .
For example , when my husband reaches for his coffee cup I understand that he intends to take a drink before he even raises the cup to his lips .
Neuroscientists think it is the mirror neurons that encode the " understanding " when we watch what others are doing .
A recent study suggests that mirror neurons may do more than just reflect understanding others .
A group of Neuroscientists in Tubingen Germany and Parma Italy has shown that mirror neurons may contribute to thinking about how to interact .
They ran a clever study to find out if the mirror neurons in the ventral premotor cortex encodes how far away from you someone else is performing an action .
Is it within reach ( peripersonal space ) or just out of reach ( extrapersonal space ) ?
About half of the neurons responded differently depending on whether the action was performed within reach or just beyond .
Some of the mirror neurons fired more if the observed action was within reach , while others fired more when the action was out of reach .
This result shows that some mirror neurons are space - selective and are providing information about understanding and whether the action is occurring close or further away .
The clever twist came when the researchers tested what happens to the response of the space - selective mirror neurons when the action is performed within reach but there is a glass barrier that blocks reaching .
Would the space - selective mirror neurons continue to encode the distance to the action or would they change because the barrier makes it out of reach ?
Surprisingly , the response of some neurons changed .
Some mirror neurons that responded when actions were within reached stopped responding when there was a barrier .
While other neurons that responded to actions out of reach changed and responded to the near actions performed behind the barrier .
As if they " knew " that they could not reach the action because of the barrier .
This study adds an intriguing new dimension to the mirror neuron story .
Some mirror neurons are space - selective and encode if an observed action occurs within or outside of reach , like a ruler to measure if the action is close or further away .
And some space - selective mirror neurons change their response when a barrier blocks access .
As the authors suggest , mirror neurons may contribute to understanding " what others are doing " and these space - selective properties might help to decide " how I might interact with them " .
It is not hard to see that these space - selective properties , and the plasticity of these mirror neurons , may be part of the neural system that controls our social interactions .
But why is it that only some space - selective mirror neurons change their responses to the barrier while others continue responding to the distance ?
Perhaps the neurons that do n't change simply code whether the action is within reach and the neurons that do change their response identify that something needs to be done to be able to interact -- move the barrier .
The answer to why there are 2 types of space - selective mirror neurons will have to come from future experiments .

Java Water Simulation
Description
Two height maps are used to store the current and previous states of the water .
You could use int or short data types for these .
Each map should be the same size as the image or screen area that you are drawing .
In my implementation I 've used a single array of shorts that is large enough to cater for both states , plus , I 've added two rows per state .
Why ?
That will become clear later on .
Each frame you will toggle between state maps .
I 'm using a simple offset to swap between starting locations within the array .
For each array element in the current state array :- Look at the neighbouring pixels from the previous state , i.e. above , below , left and right .
Take the sum and divide by 2 .
Because we are dividing by 2 a right - shift will work beautifully .
Now subtract the value in the current state map .
If we left it like that the ripples would never subside so we need to diminish the strength of the ripple every pass .
The most realistic way of doing this is to reduce the resulting height by a fraction of itself .
Once again we can use right - shift to optimise this .
In my example below I 've used reduced the strength of the ripple by 1/32nd of itself each time with a right - shift 5 .
We now need to distort a background image based on the height of the water ripple in the current location .
We do this by calculating an offset .
Just as with a real pool of water , light rays penetrating the water will be refracted .
We calculate an X/Y offset based on the current distance from the centre of the ripplemap and the magnitude of the ripple at this point .
Perform a bounds check on the offset , i.e. check that the offset coordinates are not negative or larger than the size of the texture image .
Plot the pixel at current ripplemap x/y location using the texel at the calculated offset .
Demonstration
alt = " Your browser can handle applet 's , but is n't for some reason ! "
Your browser cannot handle the applet tag !
Move your mouse over the pool balls
Main code
public void newframe ( ) { // Toggle maps each frame i=oldind ; oldind=newind ; newind=i ; i=0 ; mapind=oldind ; for ( int y=0 ; y < height ; y ++ ) { for ( int x=0 ; x < width ; x ++ ) { short data = ( short ) ( ( ripplemap[mapind-width]+ripplemap[mapind +width ] + ripplemap [ mapind -1]+ripplemap[ mapind +1 ] ) >> 1 ) ; data -= ripplemap [ newind+i ] ; data -= data >> 5 ; ripplemap [ newind+i] =data ; // where data=0 then still , where data > 0 then wave data = ( short ) ( 1024 - data ) ; //offsets a=((x - hwidth ) * data/1024 ) + hwidth ; b= ( (y - hheight ) * data/1024 ) + hheight ; // bounds check if ( a > =width ) a=width - 1 ; if ( a < 0 ) a=0 ; if ( b> =height ) b=height - 1 ; if ( b < 0 ) b=0 ; ripple [ i] =texture [ a +( b* width ) ] ; mapind ++ ; i++ ; } } }

You can create a fairly realistic water simulation in only a few lines of code .
I 've seen the algorithm implemented here discussed on many sites .
A good explanation of why this works can be found here .
The basic approach is :- The code for the main loop is as follows : - You may have noticed that when you create a ripple at the left or right edge of the applet the water is also disturbed at the opposite edge .
Not very realistic huh ?
This is simply because the ripplemap element corresponding to the right - hand edge pixel on one row is adjacent to the element of the left - hand pixel in the next row .
This create a wraparound effect .
You could get around this by ensuring that the extreme right / left elements are always zero .
I 've done something similar to separate the two state maps .
Remember earlier when I described the size of the ripple map as being two rows larger than necessary in both states .
This was so that the ripples could reach the top and bottom without crossing over into the opposite state map .
You 'll notice that many of the values that would alter the behaviour of the water are hard - coded , e.g. magnitude of the ripple , radius of ripple , rate of decay , etc .
A wider range of effects could be acheived if these were runtime parameters .

Glenn
Beck is the tip of the spear for the conservative talkers and activists who are convinced that America is descending into tyranny under Obama .
( I like Jon Stewart ’s line : that ’s not tyranny ; that ’s just being in the minority . )
The Fox News host is ( 1 ) often the first major media figure to adopt the crazy right - wing conspiracy theories that circulate on the web , thus pulling them into the mainstream ; and ( 2 ) takes right - wing talking points the furthest , like when he suggested that Obama is turning America into a Nazi state .
The tag line on his Fox News show ought to be : “ First Among Nut Jobs : the Glenn Beck Program ! ”
So it was inevitable that Beck would be the first to suggest that if you oppose Obama enough , you have the right to secede .
Here ’s Beck ( audio at the link ) :
“ You ca n’t convince me that the Founding Fathers would n’t allow you to secede .
The Constitution is not a suicide pact .
If [ a ] state says , “ I do n’t want to go there because that ’s suicide , ” they have a right to back out !
… I sign into this union , and I can never , ever get out ??
No matter what the government does , I can never get out ? ? ”
Here ’s my prediction — in 12 - 18 months , conservatives will learn how to be out of power again and we ’ll see a lot less of the tea parties and Glenn Beck - type ranting .
But I gotta wonder :
Why did n’t conservatives get this worked up when their party controlled the White House and they could actually pressure the president to do what they wanted ?
The activist / blogosphere left knows how to harness its grassroots energy when it actually matters .
It does n’t complain about its politicians , the way conservative activists complain ( ed ) so bitterly about Bush .
It works hard to get its politicians to do what it wants .
Update : Looks like Beck did this once before , in 2008 .

This year , the final - year students in Product Design at Beckmans College of Design have created an alternative meeting place in Greenhouse at the Stockholm Furniture Fair .
The students have created a space to inspire informal gatherings of people , in the same way as you would meet spontaneously about town - sitting at the edge of a monument , on a front porch or a flight of stairs .
The furniture in the showcase are based on indivdual briefs to create a specific type of furniture .
In contrast to what is usually the case in Greenhouse , where many prototypes are for view only , the students have encouraged the visitors to interact with the furniture and the space .
As a a bonus this year , the third - year students have collaborated with the second - year Advertising and Graphic Design students in creating a catalogue and a film .

The Los Angeles County coroner 's office said today that further testing indicated neither of two flu - related deaths being investigated in Los Angeles County appeared to be linked to the swine flu .
Coroner 's officials this morning said they suspected the deaths in Long Beach and La Mirada might be tied to the swine flu .
But officials said the Long Beach man was not suspected of having the swine flu and that preliminary lab tests indicated the death of a La Mirada man was " not related to swine flu . "
More tests are being done , officials said .
Coroner 's spokesman Craig Harvey said Bellflower Medical Center reported the death of a 33 - year - old Long Beach resident Monday afternoon who had symptoms resembling swine flu .
The man was taken to the hospital Saturday , complaining of shortness of breath and lymphoma .
Doctors later diagnosed the patient with pneumonia , Harvey said .
The second case involves a 45 - year - old man from La Mirada , whose death was reported Monday to the coroner 's office .
The man died April 22 at Coast Plaza Doctors Hospital in Norwalk .
Doctors said the man died of pneumonia , but the L.A. County Health Department refused to accept the death certificate signed by the private doctor , Harvey said .
The case was then referred to the coroner 's office , which will conduct further investigation .

Low pressure brings cloudy skies A hot day can spell bad news for migraine sufferers , increasing their risk of an attack the next day , US research suggests .
The risk went up by 7.5 % for every five degree Celsius increase in temperature revealed the study of more than 7,000 patients , published in Neurology .
The same applied to people who suffer from non-migraine headaches too .
Although you can't alter the weather , people can watch the forecast and pop a pill to avert attacks , the authors say .
As well as temperature , people might want to check air pressure too , as lower barometer readings over the past couple of days were also linked with migraines , although less strongly .
This does not mean that just because there is a hot day people are going to have a migraine the next day , although it is more likely
Dr Brendan Davies of the Migraine Trust
The study looked at people attending the emergency department of a large US hospital for advice about a headache at any point during a seven year period .
Overall , 2,250 were diagnosed with migraine and 4,803 with " tension " or " unspecified " headaches .
Using meteorological and pollutant monitors , the researchers then compared measurements of a number of environmental factors during the days leading up to and again some weeks after a patient 's hospital visit .
When they averaged the temperature for the day , taking into consideration night time lows and midday highs , the researchers found every five degree Celsius rise in temperature was linked to a 7.5 % hike in headache risk .
Storm brewing Lower barometric air pressure , which typically brings cloudy or stormy skies , within two or three days leading up to a person 's hospital visit also increased headache risk .
Air pollution had no effect .
Researcher Dr Kenneth Mukamal , of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , said : " These findings help tell us that the environment around us does affect our health and , in terms of headaches , may be impacting many , many people on a daily basis . "
He said headache patients should see their doctor to identify the triggers that lead to their symptoms .
Dr Brendan Davies , consultant neurologist and spokesman for the Migraine Trust , said : " This adds scientific validity to what we have suspected for some time .
Up to 50 % of patients believe weather may trigger their migraine .
" It looks like it is the change in the air temperature , and to a lesser extent the change in air pressure that is important .
" It would be interesting to see if the same environmental factors apply to workers in an office .
It also adds more to our understanding that migraine is a sensitivity problem . "
He warned that people should not become over - reliant on medication , taking it just in case .
" This does not mean that just because there is a hot day people are going to have a migraine the next day , although it is more likely .
We do not want people taking too many painkillers too often because that carries its own risks . "
Professor Peter Goadsby , from the University of California , San Francisco and Institute of Neurology , London , said : " The challenge for clinical science is to link this seemingly odd trigger to the brain mechanisms involved in migraine . "
Lee Tomkins , director of Migraine Action , said : " Although the study has some flaws , including the fact that most people with headache would not attend a casualty department , this study is very interesting in demonstrating how weather conditions can adversely affect migraine .
" It is another example of science ' catching up ' with the anecdotal evidence that many of our members give us about everyday living with migraine . "

ここ数日、LLVMについて少し勉強している。そもそもなんでLLVMを触り始めたかというと、Twitter上で「今コンパイル欲求に駆られている」と(割と何も考えずに)つぶやいたところ、
「 じゃ あDTコンパイルしようぜ 」 srd !
でもあれコンパイラとは名ばかりでぶっちゃけ文字列をRubyコードにtranslateしてるだけだったりするね
「 DTパーサを改良してLLVMにブリッジして、クロスプラットフォーム環境で高速に動作するDT処理系にするといいよ 」 何その無駄に敷居高いお仕事！誰得！でもなんか面白そう！
というやりとりがあって、じゃあ本当に誰が得するのかわからないけど面白そうだからLLVMをバックエンドで使ってesotericがサポートしてるコードからバイナリを生成するコンパイラ作ろうぜ、という流れになったから。実にLLVMの無駄遣いですね。この記事ブクマするときは「LLVMの無駄遣い」ってタグを付けるといいですよ。
LLVMって何さ ?
まずそもそも、iPod touch のJail Breakに手を出そうとしたときにちょこっと調べたりした(iPhoneSDK発表以前、JBしたiPod touch/iPhone向けにアプリを開発する際にはLLVMを使ってiPhone OS向けにコンパイルする必要があった。最近は追ってないので今どうなってるかは知らない)程度だったので、実のところLLVMが何をするものなのかちゃんと分かってなくて、どうすんべーとまず調べ直すところから始める。
LLVM と はLow Level Virtual Machineの略で 、Lightweight Languageとは特に関係がないようだ(お約束)。知ってたよ。うん。知ってたってば。調べた結果、コンパイラ基盤と呼ばれるものでコンパイラを作るのに使うライブラリ・ツール群であること、VMの名の通り一度LLVMで処理できる中間言語にした後、それをLLVMのツールで実行したりネイティブのバイナリに変換したりして使うということ、コンパイル時や実行時に様々な最適化を施してくれて、より実行効率の良いプログラムを作れるようにしてくれるらしいこと、なんかが分かった。他にも色々あるけど、それはきっと詳しい人がどっかでまとめてくれてるから割愛。うん。分かんなかったわけじゃないよ。違うってば。
あと、llvm-gccとかclangとかを使えばC/C++/Objective-CのコードをLLVMに対応させてコンパイルできるようだ。それはそれで面白いけど今回は「自作の言語をコンパイルするのにLLVMを使う」のが目的なので、どっちかというとそれ相当のものを作ることになるのでとりあえずその辺は後で見ることにする。DTコンパイラをllvm-gccと並べてよいものかとかそこにツッコミを入れるのは無しの方向で。石を投げたりしないで下さい。
Rubyから使う
大雑把に何なのかはわかったけど、さてどう使おう。C++では使えるようだしサンプルもC++のコードが並んでるんだけど、C++書いたことないしなぁ、ってかRubyで書いてたのをC++を勉強しつつ書き直すとか面倒くさいなぁ、むしろObjC書きたいなぁObjC、とか段々脱線しはじめたときに、RubyからLLVMを使うgemがあるのを見つけた。
これこれ、これが欲しかったのよと早速gem installしてみたところ、コンパイルは通ってちゃんとインストールできるんだけど、サンプルコードを動かしてみたところdylibのload errorが出る。MacOSX10.5のRuby1.8.7(LLVM、RubyともにMacPortsからインストール)でしか試してないけど、どうも上手く行かない様子。調べてみようと思ってgithubからソース落としてきて、ローカルでgemをビルドするところからやってみたら、そっちはちゃんと動くようになった。あれかなぁ、リンクするライブラリとか違うとこ見ちゃうのかな。まあいいや、とりあえず深追いするのはもう少し後にしよう。
大雑把にllvmrubyの使い方を説明すると、大体以下の通り。
LLVM::Moduleのオブジェクトを作る LLVM::Module#external_functionで外部のライブラリの関数を使えるようにする
CやC++のライブラリから取ってこれるようなので、Rubyの組み込み関数とかも呼べる
LLVM::Module#get_or_insert_functionで関数を定義する
上のメソッドがLLVM::Functionのオブジェクトを返すので、それのcreate_blockメソッドでブロック(関数の中身)を用意する
ブロック のBuilderを取得して、それに対してごにょごにょして中身を作る
b = method.create_block.builderですね
LLVM::Module#write_bitcodeでコンパイルしてファイルに書き出すか、LLVM::ExecutionEngineのrun系メソッドでそのまま実行する
ちなみにこれはLLVMのバイトコードを生成する手順だけど、他にRuby1.9のVMの命令セット互換の中間表現を実行するruby_vm.rbが添付されてたり、Rubyのコードをllvmrubyを使ってJITコンパイルするものだと思われる(ちゃんと見てないので間違ってたらツッコミ歓迎)yarv2llvmってgemがあったりする。ただまぁ、「DTをRuby上で高速に実行したい」のではなくて「DTからスタンドアローンのネイティブプログラムを生成したい」ので、こっちは今回は使わない。Cでの拡張をしないアプローチでRubyのプログラムを高速化したくなったらこの辺のを使うのかな、多分。ruby_vm.rbの方は後でVMを実装するときに参考になりそうだからそのときにまた読もう。
ぐぬぬ
ここまでは何とか辿りついた。実はここまでで結構試行錯誤してるけど、まぁ何とかここまではよしとする。で、だ。ここで問題なのは、前回のバージョンアップで中間表現をRuby2Rubyで扱えるASTにしてしまったこと。何が問題かって、これのコンパイラを作るってのはつまりRubyのコンパイラを作るってことになるわけですよね。うん。…できるかっ！
そもそも言語処理系の基礎知識も何もない状態でネタで始めた言語作り、いきなりRubyのASTを処理できるコンパイラを作るとか正直敷居が高すぎるので、もう一度中間表現の見直しをすることにした。もっとシンプルなASTにしておけばコンパイラの方でも扱いやすいし、前回ぶっ殺したEsotericVMの方ももう少し楽に作れるかもしれない。
そこで今少しずつ仕様の見直しをしつつコンパイラを書きつつ進めてるのだけど、Low Level Virtual Machineと言うだけあってライブラリ側では大分コアなところしか用意はしてくれないわけですよね。てことで諸々のデータ型とか最低限必要な組み込みの関数とか自分で用意してやらなきゃいけないわけで、その辺考えてたら大分混乱してきた。
どう考えてもDTにオブジェクトシステムとかGCとかは要らないので適当に端折ろうとは思うのだけど、esotericはパーサ部分で大方の言語固有の要素を解決しちゃってコンパイラやVMの方は汎用的な言語処理系の基盤にしたいわけで、そうすると一応はちゃんと考えて設計しないといけないよなぁ。いかにミユビナマケモノとはいえそろそろノリでなんとかできる範囲を超えてきた感じ。助けてくだしあ。とりあえずお薦めの書籍とか誰か教えてくれると嬉しいなぁ。情報系の学生が読むようなの。
In my perpetual need for inspiration to overcome my bloggers block I asked for some folks to provide with some questions or topics of interest ….
I ’m gonna hit all of the replies as i go along , but this one seems like the easiest one to answer , from Frigga :
I could suggest a few topics and definitely ask a bazillion questions … but I have n’t read your archives , so you ’ve probably covered lots of stuff so far .
I ’ll ask one anyway .
I ’d be interested in reading about your journey to becoming a Christian , and then your journey away from Christianity .
What was it that made you believe so strongly , and then not believe so strongly ?
Do you have any doubts that you could be wrong ?
Firstly , anyone can feel free to ask or bring up any topics of interest they want to , rehashed or not , because if it is something i covered more than probably a year ago , it was still with some semblance of Christianity left in me .
So really anything is fair game .
My journey INTO Christianity started very early , in 1992 ( i was 6 , so do with it what you will ) I was “ saved ” at the Chester Church of God- a fairly small COG Pentecostal church .
My earliest memories of that church were of me being at the alter and crying a lot and having “ chattering teeth ” , some Pentecostals equate this with speaking in tongues ( like i said , do with it what you will ) .
I also remember being “ Slain in the Spirit , ” — if you are unfamiliar with these terms just ask …alot of people outside of the pentecostal subculture may not be familiar with the terminology–a lot of it is somewhat extra-biblical .
I also remember very clearly going to a pentecostal summer camp ever year for a few years through that church — and there were a lot of the same experiences .
If you have seen the movie Jesus Camp — its a lot like that — except I do n’t remember praying to George Bush .
My family stopped going to church for one reason or another and i was out of church for many years …. i guess i was about 13 or 14 when i started going to a local Southern Baptist church .
I got exited about Jesus again , i went to that church for about 3 years , toward the end of that I started studying the Bible a lot , and I got into apologetics .
There was a schism in that church due to the pastors “ full gospel aka pentecostal ” leanings and on the day that the church asked him to leave , myself and the pastor along with many from the church went to another building and founded the new church .
It was a non denominational full gospel type deal .
During that time I had a mentor and with his encouragement i really delved into the Bible , eschatology , and Word of Faith doctrine — i loved the church and i loved studying .
I helped the Praise leader ( whom was my mentor ) , worked with the youth group , prayed for people at the alter a lot , and ran the sound board during services , Monica and I also went to the church and prayed ( someone did it every night ) about 2 times a week … so that ’s a minimum of 4 nights of church most weeks .
My ministry is an area of this that I am still not comfortable addressing
So i am omitting anything to do with that — it also took up a lot of time .
So things at that church began to bother me as i read the Bible further , I think i was working through the Bible for the 4th time or so when I had an epiphany moment about the Word of Faith doctrine and how wrong and selfish it was , my pastor at the time was going further and further into that ( and I was HUGE into it for a while ) … it just hit me that it was wrong …. and I did n’t know how to confront my pastor over it so Monica and I made the decision to stop going to that church — I continued studying the Bible on my own and apologetics , and i Kept the ministry running for about a year .
( this was around 2005 i think ) .
Monica and I went to a few churches here and there , but I never really felt like there was anything locally that would really be “ God ’s church ” and fulfilling all the things and roles that it should be , I never was satisfied with church …
I mulled over the thought of a new church but that never happened , thankfully .
So Eventually i stopped reading the Bible for the most part , and I had a lot of resentment for the church and the poor examples of Christians in it …so yea if you still sense that in me , its there .
In the end , i think the Bible deconstructed itself , finding the contradictions i was afraid to face during my earlier studies …. with the knowledge that the Bible was erroneous so often , i think the paradox between a loving god providing no means for us to KNOW he was true was more or less the final straw .
IN apologetics I had faced all the same questions and oppositions I hold today with no trouble — the reason for that is because when you are a Christian , and suddenly what you believe is challenged , your mind nearly shuts down and blocks out that realization — at least that occurred with me and I do n’t doubt that it occurs with many Christians today
The more emotional aspects of this change are covered here .
In a nutshell what made me believe so strongly was that i loved god — i felt god — i knew god in a personal way that most people never experience … therefore my belief was incredibly strong .
Now I am strongly opposed because of the dramatic way in which all of my belief was turned on its head … .
the sheer pain of that loss ( the death of the Omega if you will ) is why I am where I am .
I have no doubt that i will lose interest in proving others wrong eventually , but it is a built in part of my personality right now … hopefully i will grow out of it — but debate is fun , and I want to do so in respectful way .
I hope this blog can be a forum for that , and for others that are struggling through the same thing .
The second part of this question is about whether I have doubts of being wrong in all this …
I think i handle it pretty well in this entry titled :
What if I am wrong about all this ?
Thank you frigga , did that answer your questions ?
if not smack me side the head and i will try again .
sorry if that rambled
Police have charged eight suspects over the killing of 44 people at a wedding party in south - east Turkey on Monday .
The suspects were among 10 held after the attack in the small village of Bilge Koyu , governor of Mardin province Hasan Duruer told Anatolia news agency .
Two other suspects are still being questioned , AP news agency reports .
Among those killed in the attack - described as a feud between two families - were the engaged couple , six children and three pregnant women .
Some 200 guests were reportedly celebrating in Bilge Koyu , about 20 km ( 12 miles ) from the city of Mardin , when the attackers burst in shooting automatic rifles and throwing grenades .
Paramilitary police were sent to the village to pursue the attackers .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The identities of those arrested have not yet been announced .
Unconfirmed reports said the assailants included members of a militia known as the Village Guards , who have helped government troops fight Kurdish separatist rebels in recent years .
If the group , set up in 1984 , is found to have been complicit in the killings , it is likely to reinforce calls for it to be disbanded amid long standing accusation of illegal activities .
These are my reflections on what I think laws should be , not what they may actually be .

Probabil că ai în minte prima dată când ai văzut un videoclip fals , care arăta suficient de bine pentru a te convinge că este real .
Diplomats have walked out of a UN conference on racism during a speech by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Here are some key quotes from his address :
The victorious powers [ of the world wars ] call themselves the conquerors of the world , while ignoring or down - treading the rights of other nations by the imposition of oppressive laws and international arrangements .
Following World War
Two , they resorted to making an entire nation homeless on the pretext of Jewish suffering .
They sent migrants from Europe , the United States and other parts of the world in order to establish a totally racist government in the occupied Palestine .
In compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe , they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive , racist regime in Palestine .
It is all the more regrettable that a number of Western governments and the United States have committed themselves to defending those racist perpetrators of genocide , whilst the awakened consciences and free - minded people of the world condemn aggression , brutality and the bombardment of civilians of Gaza .
[ Conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan were ] a clear example of egocentrism , racism , discrimination or infringement upon the dignity and independence of nations .
Today , the human community is facing a kind of racism which has tarnished the image of humanity .
In the beginning of the third millennium , the word Zionism personifies racism , that falsely resorts to religion and abuses religious sentiments to hide hatred .
Efforts must be made to put an end to the abuse by Zionists and their supporters of political and international means ...
Governments must be encouraged and supported in the fight aimed at eradicating this barbaric racism and moving towards reforming the current international mechanisms .
You are all aware of the conspiracy of some powers and Zionist circles against the goals and objectives of this conference ...
It should be recognised that boycotting such a session is a true indication of supporting the blatant example of racism .

I love dolphins so much .
They are so graceful , sleek , acrobatic , and wet .
If I was a dolphin I would be one of those brave ones that fights sharks .
I read somewhere that the dolpin in Flipper was actually several dolphins as the dolphins kept dying .
Or it might have been Skippy the kangaroo , I forget which .
Either way it is very sad .
Once when I was swimming , I found myself caught in a rip and was carried far out to sea .
After several weeks of treading water , I became too weak and gave up hope .
As I slipped from the surface and slowly sank like that guy in the movie Titanic , I was rescued by a friendly dolphin who carried me back to his family and fed and nursed me back to health before constructing a small raft out of kelp for me on which I sailed back to shore .
Ever since that day , I have devoted my life to collecting the most beautiful dolphin sculptures in the world .
Here are just a few of my favourites ;
The most beautiful and magical creatures of the sea , these magnificent dolphins are captured in their wondrous movement atop the crystal waves .
As if mirroring the ocean , the waves sparkle with prismatic colors and dazzling lights .
I have this on the dashboard of my 4WD , people often remark on its unique beauty .
At almost sixty centimetres height it does obstruct some view but is semi transparent so I do not feel it causes any problem .
In this deliciously decorative delight , a dolphin frolics merrily amongst lacy turquoise reefs .
With a charmingly crafted shell for keepsakes , this pleasing scultpture is a dolphin lover 's dream !
I keep this on my desk at work and use the hanging basket to put my mobile phone in .
My ringtone is a dolphin call so everytime my phone rings it is like the dolphin is singing to me .
I call this dolphin Carl .
Seashell , dolphins , and coral reef night light .
Simply beautiful .
If I was a dolphin I would definitely live in an underwater paradise such as this .
Leith and I would be the dolphins on the right and the other dolphin would be a friend dropping by .
They would remark on what a beautiful home we had and then we would eat that purple fish .
The only way you sleep through this alarm is if you do it on porpoise .
Every morning I wake up to the pleasant sound of dolpin laughs , it makes me chipper , ready for the day and aroused .
One of my favourites , three marbelized dolphins form a cosy nest , awaiting the pleasant aromas which will soon drift from the urn of this absolutely stunning oil warmer .
Sometimes I light a candle , add my favourite oil and sit watching it while listening to dolphin calls on my ipod .
A mother dolphin teaches her baby the ways of the sea on this blue - glass carved art piece .
With tealight holder .
If I was the mother dolphin I would teach my baby dolphin that life has no set path but that which you choose .
Researchers have developed a critical part of a hydrogen storage system for cars that makes it possible to fill up a vehicle 's fuel tank within five minutes with enough hydrogen to drive 300 miles .
The system uses a fine powder called metal hydride to absorb hydrogen gas .
The researchers have created the system 's heat exchanger , which circulates coolant through tubes and uses fins to remove heat generated as the hydrogen is absorbed by the powder .
The heat exchanger is critical because the system stops absorbing hydrogen effectively if it overheats , said Issam Mudawar , a professor of mechanical engineering who is leading the research .
" The hydride produces an enormous amount of heat , " Mudawar said .
" It would take a minimum of 40 minutes to fill the tank without cooling , and that would be entirely impractical . "
Researchers envision a system that would enable motorists to fill their car with hydrogen within a few minutes .
The hydrogen would then be used to power a fuel cell to generate electricity to drive an electric motor .
The research , funded by General Motors Corp. and directed by GM researchers Darsh Kumar , Michael Herrmann and Abbas Nazri , is based at the Hydrogen Systems Laboratory at Purdue 's Maurice J. Zucrow Laboratories .
In February , the team applied for three provisional patents related to this technology .
" The idea is to have a system that fills the tank and at the same time uses accessory connectors that supply coolant to extract the heat , " said Mudawar , who is working with mechanical engineering graduate student Milan Visaria and Timothée Pourpoint , a research assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics and manager of the Hydrogen Systems Laboratory .
" This presented an engineering challenge because we had to figure out how to fill the fuel vessel with hydrogen quickly while also removing the heat efficiently .
The problem is , nobody had ever designed this type of heat exchanger before .
It 's a whole new animal that we designed from scratch . "
advertisement
The metal hydride is contained in compartments inside the storage " pressure vessel . "
Hydrogen gas is pumped into the vessel at high pressure and absorbed by the powder .
" This process is reversible , meaning the hydrogen gas may be released from the metal hydride by decreasing the pressure in the storage vessel , " Mudawar said .
" The heat exchanger is fitted inside the hydrogen storage pressure vessel .
Due to space constraints , it is essential that the heat exchanger occupy the least volume to maximize room for hydrogen storage . "
Conventional automotive coolant flows through a U - shaped tube traversing the length of the pressure vessel and heat exchanger .
The heat exchanger , which is made mostly of aluminum , contains a network of thin fins that provide an efficient cooling path between the metal hydride and the coolant .
" This milestone paves the way for practical on - board hydrogen storage systems that can be charged multiple times in much the same way a gasoline tank is charged today , " said Kumar , a researcher at GM's Chemical & Environmental Sciences Laboratory and the GM R&D Center in Warren , Mich .
" As newer and better metal hydrides are developed by research teams worldwide , the heat exchanger design will provide a ready solution for the automobile industry . "
The researchers have developed the system over the past two years .
Because metal hydride reacts readily with both air and moisture , the system must be assembled in an airtight chamber , Pourpoint said .
Research activities at the hydrogen laboratory involve faculty members from the schools of aeronautics and astronautics , mechanical engineering , and electrical and computer engineering .

Cabinet ministers face questions after full details of their expenses claims were published by the Daily Telegraph .
They include a claim for £ 6,500 made by Gordon Brown to pay his brother for a cleaner for his Westminster flat .
Minister Hazel Blears claimed for three homes in one year and spent nearly £ 5,000 on furniture in three months .
Mr Brown said the system did not work and had to change : " MPs have to live in two places .
But we need a system that is better than the one we 've got .
" Meanwhile Downing Street has released a copy of the contract for cleaning Gordon Brown 's flat and said there was nothing " unusual or wrong " about the PM sharing a cleaner with his brother and reimbursing him for a share of the cost .
' Looks bad '
The Telegraph reported that Andrew Brown received £ 6,577 between 2004 and 2006 for cleaning services at the prime minister 's private flat .
EXPENSES REACTION
Gordon Brown Hazel Blears Jack Straw Harriet Harman Lord Mandelson
Defending the prime minister , deputy Labour leader Ms Harriet Harman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " It 's being portrayed as if Gordon Brown somehow has pocketed extra money for it purporting to be his cleaner , or his brother has pocketed extra money , and that 's not the case . "
She said all claims were within the rules .
" I know this looks bad and people are angry , " she said .
" MPs believe in the cause of public service and that 's why they 're in public service and I believe our House of Commons is not scarred by corruption on the scale of other political systems . "
" We have recognised that the allowances system needs to change , but people have claimed in good faith under the old system - we 've already changed the old system and we 're going to change it further . "
Asked about claims
MPs have been claiming one property is their " second home " under the allowance , but not for the purposes of council tax or capital gains tax , she refused to give a " gut instinct judgement " on whether it was a breach of the rules .
Potential abuses
But she said : " Normally it would be the same for council tax , for tax if there was a sale of the property ... normally there would be a consistency on that . "
Full details of all MPs ' expenses dating back four years , running to 2.4 million receipts , were due to be published in the middle of July after the Commons authorities lost a Freedom of Information battle .
But the Telegraph claims potential abuses would have remained secret because MPs have been allowed to edit out addresses and other information .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Having a clean house is not requisite to being an MP , so why are we paying for it ?
Alex , Pontyclun
The newspaper has published details of 13 cabinet ministers , including chancellor Alistair Darling , Communities Secretary Hazel Blears and Culture Secretary Andy Burnham .
It plans to publish further revelations about MPs from other parties as well as Labour over the next few days .
The Telegraph reported that Gordon Brown also claimed £ 153 twice for the same plumbing work at his constituency home - which No 10 said was done inadvertently and had been repaid .
Justice Secretary Jack Straw claimed his entire council tax bill for his second home despite already enjoying a substantial discount from his local authority , worth a reported £ 1,500 a year .
' Honest '
His spokesman said all his claims were made within Commons rules and he had repaid it when he spotted the mistake .
Among other revelations , Ms Blears is said to have claimed for expenditure under the allowance on three different properties during the same year , spending £ 5,000 on furniture in three months .
The Telegraph says by switching their designated second home between their London and constituency properties , Ms Blears and other MPs have been able to claim for household goods or other reimbursements for both .
Jack Straw is under scrutiny for his council tax claims A spokesman for Ms Blears said she had done nothing wrong and the furnishings she had bought were " reasonable " .
" Hazel is honest as the day is long , " said the spokesman .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson claimed for improvements on his constituency home after he announced he was leaving Parliament to become an EU Commissioner .
He later sold the property for a profit of £ 136,000 .
He rejected claims he used taxpayers ' cash to " renovate " his home for profit , insisting the money was spent on essential maintenance .
He said the Telegraph 's report - which details a £ 1,500 gardening bill and £ 1,350 in house repairs - was presented to provoke public anger .
" The fact is that these allowances would not have been paid if they were n't within the rules , " he told BBC Radio Scotland 's Good Morning Scotland programme .
We do respect public opinion and we do respect the need for change
Labour MP Sir Stuart Bell
Expense claims - key details Nick Robinson 's view What MPs can claim on expenses FOI blog : Expenses leak Q&A : MPs ' expenses Culture Secretary Andy Burnham was in correspondence with the fees office for eight months over an expenses claim for £ 16,500 to buy and renovate a new London flat .
Officials finally agreed to pay the cash after rejecting the claim three times .
This followed a series of letters from Mr Burnham asking for his expenses to be paid urgently .
Mr Burnham says that over the past five years he has under - claimed on the Additional Costs Allowance by about £ 40,000 .
The Telegraph accuses MPs of trying to maximise the amount of money they can legitimately claim within the rules , which they set and oversee .
Labour MP Sir Stuart Bell , who sits on the House of Commons Commission , said the expenses claims were " not unusual " or " out of order " .
He added : " We do respect public opinion and we do respect the need for change - and I think that change is coming , I hope it will come quicker and I hope the public will get the respect for MPs back which we do actually deserve at the end of the day . "
The Telegraph has not confirmed whether it paid for the information .
No 10 sources suggested the information published was accurate but insisted the nature and timing of the publication was politically motivated .
MPs recently voted through reforms of the expenses system amid mounting public anger about alleged abuses and will now have to provide receipts for all spending .
But they have still to reach a cross-party agreement on reforming the controversial second homes allowance .
The Committee on Standards in Public Life is also conducting a review of pay and expenses after concerns public trust had fallen to an all - time low .

[ Zach ] sent us a link to his keyboard pants .
Frankly , we were astonished , not only by his craftsmanship , but by the fact that we were working on a pair ourselves .
Admittedly his are much better looking and ours will probably never be finished .
The inspiration for both his and ours , was this sloppy version .
[ Zach ’s ] pair have been cut in half , and he never really found a convenient way to reconnect the two halves , so only the left works .

SPOKANE , Wash . — George W. Bush insisted that the U.S. did not use torture .
But the four Bush - era Office of Legal Counsel memos released last week by the Obama administration ’s Justice Department paint a starkly different picture .
The declassified memos provided legal authorization for “ harsh interrogation techniques ” used by the Bush administration in the years following Sept. 11 , 2001 .
They authorized ( as listed in the Aug. 1 , 2002 , memo by then - Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee ) “ walling … facial slap , cramped confinement , wall standing , stress positions , sleep deprivation , insects placed in a confinement box , and the waterboard . ”
According to the American Civil Liberties Union , the OLC under Bush “ became a facilitator for illegal government conduct , issuing dozens of memos meant to permit gross violations of domestic and international law . ”
The memos authorize what the International Committee of the Red Cross called , in a leaked report , “ treatment and interrogation techniques … that amounted to torture . ”
These torture techniques were developed by two psychologists based in Spokane , Wash . : James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen .
Their company , Mitchell Jessen & Associates , provided specialized training to members of the U.S. military to deal with capture by enemy forces .
The training is called SERE , for Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape .
Mitchell and Jessen , both psychologists , were contracted by the U.S. government to train interrogators with techniques they claimed would break prisoners .
They reverse - engineered the SERE training , originally developed to help people withstand and survive torture , to train a new generation of torturers .
The memos provide gruesome details of the torture .
Waterboarding was used hundreds of times on a number of prisoners .
The Bybee memo includes this Kafkaesque authorization : “ You would like to place [ Abu ] Zubaydah in a cramped confinement box with an insect .
You have informed us that he appears to have a fear of insects .
In particular , you would like to tell Zubaydah that you intend to place a stinging insect into the box with him . ”
After President Barack Obama said there should be no prosecutions , he was received with great fanfare at the CIA this week .
Mark Benjamin , the reporter who originally broke the Mitchell and Jessen story , said when I questioned him about Obama ’s position : “ If you look at the president ’s statements and you combine them with the statements of Rahm Emanuel , the chief of staff , and Eric Holder , the attorney general … you will see that over the last couple of days the Obama administration has announced that no one , not the people who carried out the torture program or the people who designed the program or the people that authorized the program or the people who said that it was legal — even though they knew that it frankly was n’t — none of those people will ever face charges .
The attorney general has announced that … the government will pay the legal fees for anybody who is brought up on any charges anywhere in the world or has to go before Congress .
They will be provided attorneys … they have been given this blanket immunity … in return for nothing . ”
Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein asked Obama to hold off on ruling out prosecutions until her panel finishes an investigation during the next six months .
Though Obama promises to let the torturers go , others are pursuing them .
Bybee is now a federal judge .
A grass - roots movement , including Common Cause and the Center for Constitutional Rights , is calling on Congress to impeach Bybee .
In Spain , Judge Baltasar Garzon , who got Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet indicted for crimes against humanity , has named Bybee and five others as targets of a prosecution .
For years , people have felt they have been hitting their heads against walls ( some suffered this literally , as the memos detail ) .
On Election Day , it looked like that wall had become a door .
But that door is open only a crack .
Whether it is kicked open or slammed shut is not up to the president .
Though he may occupy the most powerful office on Earth , there is a force more powerful : committed people demanding change .
We need a universal standard of justice .
Torturers should be punished .

There are several critical points you must be aware of in writing and preparing a song for submission to a publisher or record label .
You will probably only have ten seconds of the reviewer 's time , and if you do n't catch their interest in that space , most likely your submission will be sent to the " round file " .
Â
When you write the song , keep this in mind ; and when you sit down with your producer at the time of recording , be sure to address this and follow your producer 's advice .
Â
A great chorus will never be heard without a great beginning to keep the listener listening .
Musically , you must have an original " hook " .
Â
This is the musical phrase that the audience will keep humming , over and over , long after the song has finished .
Â
A great example of a terrific intro and unforgettable musical " hook " is found in Â the song , " Pretty Woman " .
Â
When you hear those four drum hits and an ascending scale , within 4 seconds you know what song is coming , and you can hardly wait .
Â Â Â
The hook usually comes in the first line ( and / or in the last line ) of the Chorus of the song , so make those two aspects ( introduction and first / last line of the chorus ) correspond .
Â
If you are having trouble coming up with this engaging musical novelty , consult with a pianist or lead guitarist about your song .
Â
Tell them you need some help , and you might be surprised what a fresh pair of earsÂ and an experienced musician will produce spontaneously for you .

How many different ways can you talk aboutÂ love in a song ? Â I love you .
Â I do n't know why I love you .
Â I do n't know why you love me .
Â
Why do n't you love me ?
Â
You 're so easy to love .
Â I love you because ...
Well , you get the idea .

Why does one love song hit big and another die on the recording - room floor ?
Â
The songwriter has to findÂ a new and unexpected way to say the same old thing .

Do n't say ' She 's so sweet " - say " She 's as sweet as Tupelo Honey " .

Â
Write down every word and phrase that comes to you .

You will be surprised what ideas and novelties that list will generate for you .
You want to write a song that other people can relate to .
Â Describe a place they 've been emotionally .
Â Â Give the story your own fresh perspective , and describe it through your unique eyes and heart , but keep the message relevant to the masses .
Â
Take your listenerÂ for a ride on a memory you can share .
Make it rhyme . Â
Do n't cheat .
Â
You can do it .
Â " That " does n't rhyme with " What " .
Â
Sure , there are lots of popular songs out there with " near - rhymes " , but you can do better than that .
Â
If you can't find a word in the second line to rhyme with the first line , think about changing the first line .
Â
Or consider using two words ; or stringing a word out and rhyming the middle of it .
Â
Each line does n't have to be a complete sentence .
Â
For example : Â Â One thought is that life is a jewelÂ
Give it wings , and suddenly you 'll ... Â Â Â Near - rhymes are a subtle interruption to the listener 's attention .
Â
It takes their subconscious mind off the message for a brief moment .
Â
You do n't want to do that , so be better than the rest .
Â
Work the lyrics until you find a true rhyme .
Â
If you have to use the word " orange " in the song , use it in the middle of a phrase , not at the end where you have to try and find an impossible rhyme for it .
Â Â
You can rhyme the first and third lines of your four - line verse or chorus .
OR you can rhyme the second and fourth lines , or you can rhyme them all .
Â
Whatever you do , pattern - wise , make the entire song consistent .
Â
Do n't rhyme the second and fourth lines in the verses , and the first and third in the chorus .
Â
And please please please make the words correspond with the notes of the song so that they are sung in the same meter they would normally be spoken .
Â
In fact , once you 've written the lyrics , speak them out loud , like a poem , Â and see if they sound like something you would say in natural conversation with a friend .
Â
If they do n't , they will be distracting to the listener , and this is one of the most blatent signs of an amateur writer .
In country music , I am sorry to tell you that you must use only one verse before you get to your chorus .
Â
You have to tell the story that makes your listener understand where the Chorus is coming fromVERY quickly .
Â
Current country music is all about the chorus .
Â
Big , building , with both a lyrical and musical hook , repeated over and over and over and .. well , you get the idea .
Â
Difficult to write with complex meaning , of course , but commercial .
Â
Write in the following structure : Â Verse , Chorus , Verse , Chorus , Instrumental Verse , Bridge .
Â
The bridge is a section that 's usually two lines long , musically new but related , and that builds from the instrumental section to rush the listener back over the mountain cliff and into the Chorus again .
Â
You can repeat the Chorus after theÂ bridge , butÂ the bridge is only heard once during the son .
Â Â
Then you can " tag " the song by repeating the last line of the Chorus , or fade it out if that seems more appropriate to you .

In pop music , you have much more leeway , and as long as you have a repeated , greatÂ hook , you can work the rest of the song around it .
Â
Just remember to make the first ten seconds impressive .
Â
Pop music also requires a whole new level of lyrical hook .
Â
Use analogies and be much more poetically vague --
You can get away with it here , and this makes it possible for many more listeners to find a way to relate the song to their own lives .
Express a common idea in a new way , through your own unique eyes .
Â
Use the music to infuse the emotionalism , and use the lyrics to engage the hopes , dreams and memories of your listeners .
Â
Make the lyrics tell a complete story or express a complete thought .
Â
It must be self - contained , with a beginning , an explanation or set - up , a build , a climax , and a conclusion .
Â
The words must match the musical notes assigned to them so they are in the same meter as if they were spoken , and you have about twelve lines ( maximum 14 , if you use a bridge ) to accomplish all of this .
Â
It 's hard work to do it well , but if you have the brilliant inspiration , it should n't surprise you that hard work will be required to justify the gift you 've been given .
Ah , yes , the final rule which the music industry will impose : Â ' She who must be obeyed ' commands that this all be accomplished in three minutes .
Â
It is a rare song that goes beyond 3 minutes and 30 seconds and still makes the commercial cut .
Â
Work with your producer to extend or make cuts to get your song within these time parameters .
Â
No pushing the envelope here ;
It 's THE RULE . Â
Aim for 3 minutes and 15 seconds .
Now get out there and free - associate yourself into oblivion so you can start putting together the next number one hit !

There ’s an interesting article by The Independent ’s Steve Richards today , focusing – as the media does every three months or so – on the prospect of a ‘ Hung Parliament ’ , and what the Lib Dems would do in such an eventuality .
Actually the article ’s a bit broader than that , and I ca n’t let the opportunity pass without briefly digressing to agree wholeheartedly with his snipe at the Tories ’ two key initiatives of the past week : David Cameron ’s ‘ apology ’ for failing to anticipate the economic crisis until way too late ( Steve accuses the Tories of “ still playing student - like games ” ) ; and yesterday ’s gimmicky announcement of a freeze in the BBC licence fee ( “ in the economic context the proposal is puny , suggesting that Cameron thinks in New Labour - like incremental terms when he leads in an era far removed from the mid 1990s . ” ) .
It ’s not even smart opposition tactics , let alone good government - in - waiting strategy .
By apologising for the Tories ’ recent economic incompetence , Mr Cameron has allowed the Prime Minister to blur his culpability ( I ’m sure No. 10 has prepared the ‘ we all bear some responsibility , as even the Leader of the Opposition admits ’ line ) .
And as for the BBC licence fee – well , it ’s such a token gesture even that uber - populist Tony Blair would have rejected it as too small for him to be associated with .
But back to ‘ Hung Parliaments ’ , and Steve ’s contention that therefore Lib Dems matter now ( leaving to one side that we actually do matter now , as almost sx million folk voted for the party at the last election ) .
For some perverse reason , Steve reckons :
For perverse reasons senior Lib Dems never seemed to relish the prospects of a hung parliament , as if doing so would somehow challenge the purity of their uncompromising policy commitments , a purity of impotence .
Surely it ’s not so very hard to see why the party and its leadership approaches the prospect with caution rather than relish ?
After all , last time the third party propped up the government of the day under a first - past - the - post system ( the Liberals in 1977 - 79 ) , it did n’t exactly do wonders for our electoral standing .
That ’s not to say we should n’t as a party be anxious to get our hands dirty pulling the levers of power ; but let ’s be realistic about the risks , eh ?
The fear is a simple and potent one : seem to favour either Tories or Labour , and we split our own party and antagonise the voters of the party we did n’t pick .
Net result to the Lib Dems : the exercise of a little power for a limited time with the ever - present danger of annihilation at the next election .
More significant is Steve ’s confirmation of the party leadership ’s policy of equidistance :
For the first time in years the party leadership is genuinely “ equidistant ” between Labour and the Conservatives .
Nick Clegg cannot see how he props up a Brown government , but he is no fan of Cameron ’s either .
Copying the Tony Blair rule book , Cameron sought to form a relationship with Clegg early on .
But Clegg was not interested in playing Paddy Ashdown to Cameron ’s Blair and the two of them have little contact .
And , as Steve notes , even if Nick Clegg was determined on a coalition with either Mr Brown or Mr Cameron , he knows the party membership is unlikely to sanction it – as we would have to :
The leadership of the Lib Dems is committed to what is called a triple lock before entering any form of arrangement with another party .
The leadership must get the support of its parliamentary party , the executive of the party and the membership .
That is quite a lock .
Like Steve , I have little doubt that party members would vote down any deal , unless it came with the promise of propertional representation as a package of reform measures – and that ’s not going to be offered by either Labour or the Tories .
But unfortunately that ’s where Steve ’s article stops – unfortunate because the really interesting hung Parliament scenario is not ‘ who will the Lib Dems do a deal with ’ ( because the answer is no - one ) .
No , the really interesting question is ‘ what happens when the Lib Dems refuse to do a deal with anyone ?’.
And to answer this , can I commend The Times ’s Sam Coates ’ excellent analysis of last week , which moves us much further along the hypotheticals :
There is an assumption that should the Tories be the largest party in a minority Parliament , the Lib Dems will probably support them in some form .
This seems unlikely , at this stage , to be a formal coalition .
But they recognise it would be electoral “ suicide ” to do the reverse and prop up Gordon Brown to keep him in Number 10 if the Tories are the largest party .
What really interests them is what happens next , in the event of a rapid second general election .
A
Tory minority government will probably only be a short term affair .
The Conservatives would govern for a few months , but then go to the country to “ seal the deal ” like Harold Wilson in 1974 .
Labour , possible fearing the consequences , will be much more willing to negotiate at this stage .
If they do begin private or public talks , this would put pressure on the Tories to enter negotiations too .
Having engaged both parties in negotiations , it will be in the words of one Lib Dem , “ game on ” .
The Lib Dems will not , initially , insist on PR as part of any deal because this automatically gives Labour a huge advantage .
However senior Lib Dems are intrigued by the personal position of David Cameron .
He is instinctively hostile to PR .
But in evidence to the Power Commission on democracy a few years ago , Cameron apparently told the committee that while the First Past the Post system should remain , he believed that of different types of PR , the Single Transferable Vote system was fairer to AV , which Labour would offer .
Lib Dems would prefer STV because it ’s more proportionate than AV .
They believe there could be constitutional chaos of there is a Hung Parliament .
The Standing Orders which govern what happens are complex , contradictory and out of date .
Some Lib Dem legal experts think the confusion could even be exploited by Gordon Brown to try and cling on to power even if Labour is not the largest party .
Before we all get too carried away with our game theories , though , I still reckon the Tories will win a ( slim ) majority at the next election .
And let ’s hope if and when they do , Messrs Camero and Osborne have put a bit more thought into what they ’ll actually do than their recent pronouncements seem to suggest .
Eileen Bishop said she was " half asleep " when the scooter charged off
An 87 - year - old Cornish woman was rescued by police five miles from home when her mobility scooter sped off out of control .
Eileen Bishop , from Perranporth , and her husband Anthony were on their way to church when , he said , she " disappeared off the radar " .
Officers later found her heading along the A3075 towards Newquay .
A police community support officer ( PCSO ) rode the scooter back and said it appeared to be working correctly .
' Full tilt '
Mr Bishop said the incident began when he and his wife set off for St Michael 's church .
He said the scooter , which " had n't been going that well " , was set to three - quarters speed .
" Suddenly she passed me at full tilt , " Mr Bishop said .
I was half asleep to tell you the truth
Eileen Bishop
" I shouted after her but she is a bit deaf .
I could n't chase her as I 've had a triple heart bypass .
" She just disappeared off the radar . "
Mr Bishop said he and a neighbour searched for his wife and then went to the police station to report her missing .
" I was just about in tears , " he said .
Officers found Mrs Bishop after a motorist reported a mobility scooter " swerving " across the road near Pendown Cross , five miles away .
Mrs Bishop said she was not sure how she got separated from her husband .
" I just lost him .
I was half asleep to tell you the truth , " she explained .
It took PCSO Michael Ginnelly an hour to drive the scooter back to Perranporth .
" I think Mrs Bishop just gripped the controls and went too fast and held on for dear life , " he told BBC News .
Erik Prince , who founded security contractor Blackwater Worldwide and remained defiant after the company became embroiled in controversy following a deadly 2007 shooting incident in Baghdad , is stepping down as chief executive of the parent company .
The 39 - year - old Mr. Prince will retain his post as chairman but move away from daily oversight of the company he started 11 years ago .
The closely held venture earned more than $ 600 million in revenue last year , with about a third of that coming from a major U.S. State Department contract to protect diplomats in war zones .
" I'm a little worn out by the whole thing , the politics of it all , " Mr. Prince said during an interview at the company 's headquarters in McLean , Va .
" Me not being part of the equation reduces the ' X ' on the thing . "
The move comes at a turning point for the security industry .
The Obama administration plans to withdraw most U.S. combat troops from Iraq by next summer and the Iraqi government is assuming legal authority over Defense Department and State Department contractors .
With this new legal authority , the Iraqi government is effectively forcing the company to leave by denying it a needed license to work there .
That led to the State Department 's announcement in January it wo n't renew Blackwater 's contract .
The parent company , EP Investments , in February announced it was changing its name to Xe , in part to distance the company from the stigma attached to the Blackwater moniker .
Mr. Prince said the new name is derived from the abbreviation for Xenon : " It 's an inert , non-combustible gas . "
Blackwater references were also dropped from the names of its affiliated business units .
Other management changes are being made .
Joe Yorio , 44 , an executive from shipping company DHL with an Army Special Forces background , will become president of Xe , replacing longtime employee Gary Jackson .
Danielle Esposito , 32 , a veteran employee , will become chief operating officer and executive vice president .
The chief executive slot remains open and is likely to be filled by Mr. Yorio , Mr. Prince said .
" It 's not an entrepreneurial start - up anymore , " said Mr. Prince .
" Any systems can always be made better ... and that 's what the new management team is there to do . "
Other longtime executives have also recently departed .
The company 's image was forged from its high - risk guard work protecting State Department diplomats in Iraq .
A growing aviation business , and a successful training operation in Moyock , N.C. , have largely remained in the shadow .
Without the State Department contract in Iraq , Xe will largely be out of the guard business .
That puts an increasing importance on military and police training as well as flying helicopters and planes for the U.S. military , with a focus on Afghanistan .
Mr. Prince defended the company 's track record , saying " we have done great work for the U.S. government . "
With unrivaled equipment , including a fleet of helicopters , and an American contracted guard force in Baghdad , Blackwater retained a perfect record of never having one of its State Department clients killed or injured under its protection .
Blackwater 's tactics were put under a microscope after a shooting incident on Sept. 16 , 2007 , that left 17 Iraqis dead .
Although the company said its guards acted in self defense , the U.S. Justice Department recently charged five of the men for their alleged role in the incident .
They pleaded not guilty and a trial is expected early next year .
A sixth guard pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the government .
Mr. Prince said his decision to step aside was motivated by wanting to spend more time with his seven children , noting that his father almost died at 42 while building an auto - parts company .
Mr. Prince used part of the $ 1.35 billion from the sale of that business to start Blackwater in 1997 .
Among other things , Mr. Prince said he is also planning to start a private - equity venture .
Looking back , Mr. Prince said he is proud of the company 's record in the security business , as well as its training operations in the U.S. and abroad .
" The PR challenges were far more relevant than I thought they would be , " he said .
" I thought we operated in a meritocracy . "

Hummus Recipe
Pin 210 244 Shares
I began my cooking career at a vegetarian restaurant in Ithaca , New York .
Although you ’ve probably heard of the other vegetarian restaurant in town , I worked up the hill at the Cabbagetown Café .
While we were n’t as famous , the food was really good .
Farmers would come in lugging crates of dirty root vegetables , crispy radishes , and slender green pea pods , and we ’d make what we wanted with them .
The food was n’t especially fancy , but we did do some creative things and almost everything was delicious that we whipped up .
This was years before the farm - to - table movement because so widespread , but it was the same concept .
Because it was a vegetarian restaurant , and with the rather harsh climate in the winter , some of the food had to be hardy to sustain our customers through the tough winters .
Hummus was really popular there , as it is in the Middle East , where I had it later in life and discovered just how wonderful this dip can truly be .
So nowadays I stockpile tahini when I go places like Lebanon and Israel , and use it frequently .
( I even went to a hummus factory ! )
In the U.S. , an excellent brand is Soom .
I usually use dried chickpeas for my hummus recipe , but for ease , the jarred or canned ones mean that you can make a batch in minutes .
Traditionally hummus in the Middle East is n’t flavored .
A glug of olive oil in the traditional , but there are lots of other possibilities .
I ’ve mentioned at the end of the recipe , but whatever strikes your fancy will do .
I try to keep hummus around for a quick snack with crackers but it ’s also nice as part of an assortment of Middle Eastern and North African appetizers , such as Eggplant Jam , Baba Ganoush , Roasted Peppers , and Cucumber - Feta Salad .
Hummus Print Recipe Makes 6 to 8 servings Adapted from the Cabbagetown Café Cookbook ( Crossing Press ) by Julie Jordan Hummus makes a great tartine – an open - faced sandwich , although it ’s also a great dip .
Try to find good - quality tahini for hummus , such as Soom .
Check local natural food stores and markets specializing in Middle Eastern ingredients .
If cooking your own dried chick peas , it takes about 1 cup ( 140g ) of dried chickpeas to make 2 cups ( 350g ) of cooked ones .
Rinse them well and sort them to make sure there is no debris in them .
Cook them in plenty of water , replenishing it if necessary , with 2 teaspoons of baking soda , which helps soften them .
For very smooth hummus , removing the skins after they are cooked will yield a smoother dip .
3 large cloves of garlic , coarsely chopped 1 teaspoon coarse salt 3/4 cup ( 180g ) tahini sesame paste ) 2 tablespoons olive oil 1/3 cup ( 80 ml ) freshly - squeezed lemon juice 2 cups ( 350g ) drained canned chickpeas , ( reserve the liquid ) 1/8 teaspoon chile powder 6 tablespoons of chickpea liquid , or more 1 .
In a blender or food processor , whiz together the garlic , salt , tahini , olive oil , and lemon juice until the garlic is finely - chopped .
2 . Add the chick peas , chile powder , and 6 tablespoons of chick pea liquid , and pulse until smooth .
Stop the machine a couple of times during blending to scrape down the sides to make sure everything gets well - incorporated .
3 . Taste , and add more lemon juice or salt if desired , and more of the chick pea liquid until it reaches a thick , but spreadable consistency .
You can make it as smooth , or as coarse , as you want .
I like mine mid-way between the two .
Serving : I make a well in the center and drip in some good olive oil and add whatever strikes my mood , from red pepper flakes to za’atar .
Chopped toasted nuts are nice , such as hazelnuts , as are seeds or fresh herbs .
Serve with toasted pita chips , baguette slices , raw vegetables or whole wheat crackers .
Storage : Hummus will keep in the refrigerator for up to four days .
You can also freeze hummus , well - wrapped , for up to two months .

Polyphony Digital has been working on Gran Turismo 5 for nearly six years , and finally , the game ’s November 2010 release date is just around the corner .
When the lead designer , Kazunori Yamauchi , told press at E3 that , " We 've actually reached a point where we can probably release [ GT5 ] anytime , except that you can also keep working as long as you want to as well , it 's just a matter of timing ” , what he should have said was that they were trying to cram as much content into the game as possible .
Three new features were announced at the recent Gamescom conference in Germany that illustrates the amount of features users can expect when they get behind the wheel .
Track Editor
There will be a track editor in the game , but it will not be as in depth as other level editors out there , some of which are considered relatively inaccessible due to an intimidating level of detail .
Instead , GT5 ’s editor allows you to set a wide array of parameters which will be used to randomly generate a track .
You can set things such as the time of day , location (s ) , number of turns , and can regenerate the resulting custom track ‘ til it suits your needs .
Tracks can also be saved locally and shared with friends over the ‘ net .
B - Spec GT4 ’s B - Spec mode was a driver management sim that was acceptable at the time , but left lots of room for improvement .
What began as an experiment dating back to an unreleased sequel to GT3 : A - Spec , has finally matured into a fleshed out pit simulation .
As the team manager , you nurture a team of a maximum six drivers and guide them to victory , race by race .
There are gauges and indicators to monitor vehicle and driver wear and tear .
The gameplay requires the player to coach the driver without being a backseat driver , and calling for pit stops in an efficient manner .
If the car or driver is neglected or annoyed by your constant babying , you could end up with a moody driver and a run -down auto .
It ’s all about balance .
Kart Racing
In order to corner nearly every aspect of auto racing , Polyphony Digital has integrated a Kart racing mode for GT5 .
Kart enthusiasts might not pick up the game for this racing mode alone , but it will provide an excellent distraction from the traditional racing formula .
Kart racing was initially intended for Gran Turismo 6 , but excitement got the best of Yamauchi and the team decided to include it GT5 , rather than sit on it for another half - decade .
Real - time surface deformation is one of the trademark features in GT5 , emulating realistic body damage for a handful of the available vehicles , but I do n’t expect that will translate to the karts , or , ESRB forbid , the racers themselves .
[ youtube ] Bi8fv5uRfbg[/youtube ]
GT5 is shaping up to be an amazing game with more features than once could master in a lifetime .
It will be a bargain at any price and should be in the running for game of the year .
Expect a full review shortly after the game ships on November 2nd .
The Republic of Ireland ’s economy is in a technical depression but will bounce back faster than the Northern Ireland economy , according to the first major all - island economic forecast .
The Ernst & Young Economic
Eye report published this morning predicts that the economy of the island of Ireland will contract by almost 8 per cent in terms of gross domestic product ( GDP ) this year .
With a decline of more than 10 per cent GDP from its economic height , the Republic will effectively be in depression , it says .
In 2009 alone , the Republic ’s economy will contract by 8.9 per cent , the report forecasts .
By contrast , there will be a shrinkage of 2.9 per cent in the Northern Irish economy .
This will result in a contraction of 7.8 per cent in the all - island economy .
“ The island economy is in the eye of an unprecedented economic storm and collateral damage is severe , ” said Brendan Lynch , who advised on the report .
“ Though early 2009 looks like being the worst period , recovery will be slow and the storm will leave scars on the economic landscape for years . ”
Employment figures in the Republic will not return to their 2007 peak until the year 2021 .
In Northern Ireland , the recovery in the labour market will be slightly quicker , with peak employment numbers returning in 2018 .
However , an “ over - reliance ” in Northern Ireland on the public sector and the relatively closed nature of its economy compared to the Republic means that although the downturn will be less pronounced north of the border , the economy there will enjoy less “ bounce back ” in its recovery phase .
The strength of the Republic ’s services sector exports will aid the recovery south of the border , as many of these exports require specialist skills that make the Republic less “ replaceable ” as a centre for producing exports , the report says .
Some 44 per cent of the Republic ’s exports are in the services sector , but just 6 per cent of Northern Ireland ’s exports are in the services sector .
This is among the lowest proportions of the developed economies .
The report concludes that the Irish government was “ left with little option ” but to adopt a radical “ tax and cut ” approach to correcting its budget deficit .
However , it is sceptical about the UK government ’s “ spend and hope ” approach .
“ We predict that as spending increases , and with stamp duty holidays and temporary VAT cuts due to reach their end , tax rises [ in Northern Ireland ] will inevitably follow , ” said Neil Gibson , an adviser to the report .
The sluggish nature of the recovery will mean that in many locations in Ireland the recession will have a “ generational impact ” , bringing severe economic and social hardship to many , Ernst & Young says .
" The answer is no , I do n't think that is a good strategy to grow our economy . "
President Obama said it with a chuckle last week at a town hall - style forum .
The idea was for Obama to answer some questions about the economy submitted to the White House website .
The most popular ones all had something to do with the virtues of legalizing and taxing marijuana .
“ I do n’t know what this says about the online audience , ” Obama joshed , and the good Americans assembled at the forum shared a little laugh .
What does it say about the online audience ?
Maybe it says that advocates of marijuana legalization have hope that a president who once inhaled will , even in the middle of a recession , devote some attention to our country 's disastrous drug policies .
Have you heard of Santiago Meza Lopez ?
They call him “ The Soupmaker . ”
In January he confessed to Mexican authorities that he had dissolved over 300 dead human bodies in acid .
There ’s a lot of money to be made in America ’s black market for drugs and Mexican suppliers are willing to kill a lot of people to control those markets and capture the gains .
Conservative estimates put the death toll of the war between rival Mexican gangs at over 5,000 in the last year alone .
When you kill so many people it ’s hard to know what to do with all of the rotting bodies .
One way to handle the problem is to call in the Soupmaker .
Six hundred American dollars per corpse .
Did you know that the United States of America , the Land of the Free , puts a larger portion of its population behind bars than any country on earth ?
Thanks in large part to the War on Drugs , Americans lock more of their own in cages than do the thuggish Russians or those “ Islamofascist ” Saudis .
As it happens , American drug prohibition and sentencing policies hit poor black men the hardest , devastating already disadvantaged black families and communities — a tragic , mocking contrast to the achievement of Obama ’s election .
Militarized police departments across the nation month after month kick down the wrong doors , terrify innocent families , shoot lawful citizens , and often kill the family dog .
So why is Obama laughing ?
To be fair , in 2004 , Obama called the War on Drugs “ a complete failure . ”
And he ’s much saner about pot than most politicians .
He has in the past called for decriminalization of marijuana and his Justice Department has promised the DEA will ease up on medical marijuana dispensaries that comply with state law ( though the Feds just cracked down on a cannabis coop in San Francisco ) .
Sure , Obama ’s got a lot on his hands these days .
But his dismissive snicker reflects a sadly common nonchalance toward America ’s disastrous experiment in prohibition .
This is a “ war ” that has not only failed utterly to shut down the market for drugs , but has , on the way , perpetuated the shameful American legacy of racial stratification , eroded the rights and safety of American citizens , and fomented a civil war on our southern border in which knock - on markets for assassins and corpse liquidation specialists flourish .
To call this “ complete failure ” is to put on a happy face .
Barack Obama inhaled .
“ The point was to inhale , ” he once smartly observed .
But Obama also knows how to get elected president .
Sadly , at this point in history , it remains a political liability to have become intoxicated on certain safe but illegal and stigmatized substances , like marijuana .
Obama has said his past drug use was a regrettable youthful indiscretion , and he might even believe it .
But why regret it ?
He managed to become president , did n’t he ?
It ’s easy to laugh off the folks who jammed the White House switchboard when we imagine them as pranking “ stoners , ” and this picture of “ the online audience ” concedes the harmlessness of marijuana users while refusing to take them seriously .
But why not imagine them as regular folks motivated by a love of liberty , justice , peace , and , sure , maybe a taste for grass ?
Why not imagine them as successful professionals , unlike Barack Obama only in political ambition ?
Marijuana is neither evil nor dangerous .
Scientists have proven its medical uses .
It has spared millions from anguish .
But the casual pleasure marijuana has delivered is orders of magnitude greater than the pain it has assuaged , and pleasure matters too .
That ’s probably why Barack Obama smoked up the second and third times : because he liked it .
That ’s why tens of millions of Americans regularly take a puff , despite the misconceived laws meant to save us from our own wickedness .
The Atlantic Monthly ’s Andrew Sullivan has been documenting on his blog the stories of typical , productive Americans — kids ’ football coaches , secretaries of the PTA — who smoke marijuana because they like to smoke marijuana , but who understandably fear emerging fully from the “ cannabis closet . ”
This is a profoundly necessary idea .
If we ’re to begin to roll back our stupid and deadly drug war , the stigma of responsible drug use has got to end , and marijuana is the best place to start .
The super - savvy Barack Obama managed to turn a buck by coming out of the cannabis ( and cocaine ) closet in a bestselling memoir .
That ’s progress .
But his admission came with the politicians ’ caveat of regret .
We ’ll make real progress when solid , upstanding folk come out of the cannabis closet , heads held high .
So here we go .
My name is Will Wilkinson .
I smoke marijuana , and I like it .
How many fans do you need to support you if you 're an independent game developer ?
Apparently , only about 10,000 a year .
For the last year , Arizona - based game developer Flashbang Studios has released a game every eight weeks free of charge to play online on its Web site Blurst .
The games have often been bizarre and cartoonish .
" Jetpack Brontosaurus " and " Off - Road Velociraptor Safari " play exactly as they sound while " Blush " allows players to control a jellyfish - like creature through a glowing undersea world .
On Friday , the company release its newest game , " Paper Moon , " a monochromatic jaunt through a dreary landscape as players control the scenery to advance through the stages .
" It 's based on a pop - up book and the song by Ella Fitzgerald , " says Steve Swink , Flashbang 's game designer .
Later this year , Blurst games will conduct an experiment .
In addition to giving away its games for free , it 'll charge $ 20 for a six month subscription for additional features such as a downloadable version .
Blurst will also be taking requests from fans to add features over time .
Mr. Swink and his team calculated how many people they 'd need to keep a staff of six and cover a $ 20,000 per month budget .
They arrived at what they considered to be a reasonable goal : only 5,000 people every half - year .
The new business model is a real - world test of an essay published by Wired magazine founder and technologist Kevin Kelly entitled " 1,000 True Fans . "
Mr. Kelly argues that artists could make a living with a small group of dedicated individuals who would fund their work .
" A True Fan is defined as someone who will purchase anything and everything you produce .
They will drive 200 miles to see you sing .
They bookmark the eBay page where your out - of - print editions show up .
They can't wait till you issue your next work , " he wrote .
Mr. Kelly argued that such rabid devotees would create outsourced version of the patronage system that 's funded artists for centuries .
Joining Flashbang was a much - needed change of pace for Mr. Swink .
For more than a year , he had toiled in a Los Angeles office complex working on the newest release of skateboarding game " Tony Hawk Underground . "
As an employee for Neversoft , Mr. Swink was working 16 - hour days during the hectic end of the production cycle and had thrown personal care to wind .
" I had hair down to my waist and I was getting fat , " he says .
" I was a disgusting , ragged hobo . "
Amir Liberman , the founder of Nemesysco , an Israeli company that internationally markets voice based lie detectors that simply do n’t work , successfully pressured an academic journal into withdrawing the Internet availability of a peer - reviewed article that exposes Liberman ’s lie detection “ technology ” for the pseudoscientific flapdoodle that it is .
The Article
Swedish linguists Anders Eriksson and Francisco Lacerda co-authored an article titled “ Charlatanry in Speech Science : A Problem to Be Taken Seriously ” that was published in the International Journal of Speech , Language and the Law ( vol. 14 , no. 2 [ 2007 ] ) .
Eriksson & Lacerda review several voice - based lie detectors , including Nemesysco ’s “ Layered Voice Analysis ” ( LVA ) which the U.S. military ’s Special Operations Command has purchased and the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department is considering adopting .
A variant of LVA customized for security checkpoints has reportedly been trialled at Moscow ’s Domodedovo International Airport .
Eriksson & Lacerda point out that so - called “ thorns ” and “ plateaus ” — characteristics of digitized voice recordings that Nemesysco claims reflect emotional states — are merely artifacts produced by the digitization process !
With regard to the LVA software , Eriksson & Lacerda note :
Contrary to the claims of sophistication —
‘ The LVA software claims to be based on 8,000 mathematical algorithms applied to 129 voice frequencies ’ ( Damphousse et al. 2007 : 15 ) — the LVA is a very simple program written in Visual Basic .
The entire program code , published in the patent documents ( Liberman 2003 ) comprises no more than 500 lines of code .
It has to be said , though , that in order for it not to be possible to copy and run the program as is , some technical details like variable declarations are omitted , but the complete program is unlikely to comprise more than 800 or so lines .
With respect to its alleged mathematical sophistication , there is really nothing in the program that requires any mathematical insights beyond very basic secondary school mathematics .
To be sure , recursive filters and neural networks are also based on elementary mathematical operations but the crucial difference is that these operations are used in theoretically coherent systems , in contrast to the seemingly ad hoc implementation of LVA .
That the mathematics involved in LVA is simple is explained by the fact that despite apparently having styled himself as such , Nemesysco founder Amir Liberman is no mathematician , as Eriksson & Lacerda explain :
Who is Mr Liberman ?
We might as well have asked :
Who is Nemesysco , the company behind the LVA products , because Mr Liberman and Nemesysco seem to be one and the same .
Damphousse et al. ( 2007 : 14 ) report as follows : ‘ The LVA was developed in Israel by Amir Lieberman [ sic ] who applied mathematic algorithm science to voice frequencies ’ , giving the impression that the program is based on some advanced mathematical theory .
As we have pointed out , this is far from the truth .
When we first became aware of the LVA , in connection with an attempt in 2004 to introduce the LVA on the Scandinavian market , we too were given the impression that Mr Liberman was indeed a high ranking Israeli mathematician .
We do not know the origin of these rumours .
It has been said that the information once appeared on the Nemesysco home pages but we have not been able to confirm this .
Screening the Nemesysco home pages we became highly suspicious of these claims , however .
To acquire more information about the person behind the products we consulted an Israeli colleague who is an active speech science researcher and asked him if he knew of a mathematician by that name .
He did not .
A controversy arose between us and the Scandinavian representatives of the LVA whom we , after a careful study of the LVA claims , accused of trying to peddle a bogus product .
This controversy , partly fought in a newspaper , caught the interest of a journalist , Arne Lapidius , who was working in Israel for the Swedish daily Expressen .
After some research he managed to locate Mr Liberman , a 32 year old ( in 2004 ) businessman in a small office in the town of Natania .
The business appeared to be a one - man operation .
Mr Lapidus interviewed Mr Liberman about his academic background and was told that he basically had none .
He has no degree ( never had time to get one , he explains ) but has taken some courses in marketing at an Israeli open university .
As we have explained above , the LVA is a simple program written in rather amateurishly used Visual Basic .
Given what we now know about Mr Liberman , that is about what one would expect rather than ‘ 8,000 mathematical algorithms applied to 129 voice frequencies ’ ( Damphousse et al. 2007 : 15 ) .
What still remains for us to understand is how insurance companies , security agencies , police departments can be willing to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars , pounds , and euros in equipment without ever asking who are behind the products , what are their qualifications , what are the scientific principles upon which the products are based .
The program code is part of the patent documents and may be downloaded from patents on - line .
Any qualified speech scientist with some computer background can see at a glance , by consulting the documents , that the methods on which the program is based have no scientific validity .
Why did those who so willingly invested huge amounts of money not even bother to look ?
For us this is the real puzzle .
Liberman Responds
Rather than rebutting Eriksson & Lacerda ’s well - documented critique with facts , evidence , and reason , Amir Liberman instead instructed his lawyers to send a letter to Equinox Publishing , Ltd. , the publisher of the journal in which the article appeared , threatening legal action if an apology and retraction were not forthcoming .
Sadly , Equinox quickly succumbed to Nemesysco ’s heavyhanded tactics , reaching a confidential ( but no longer secret , as we shall see ) settlement whereby Equinox removed the article from its website ( where it had previously been available for purchase ) .
Contacted by e-mail , Equinox managing director Janet Joyce confirmed that the company has never before done such a thing .
The agreement with Nemesysco appears to have been purely a business decision on Equinox ’s part , and it is important to note that the International Journal of Speech , Language , and the Law has not retracted or otherwise disavowed the article .
Amir Liberman did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment .
Eriksson and Lacerda , for their part , stand by their article .
Documents Reveal Legal Pressure
AntiPolygraph.org has obtained part of the correspondence between Nemesysco ’s lawyers and Equinox that led to the agreement .
The saga begins with a letter dated 3 November 2008 ( 300 kb PDF ) from the Jerusalem law firm of Shimron , Molho , Persky & Co. to Equinox averring that Eriksson & Lacerda ’s article “ is seriously defamatory both of Mr Liberman and of Nemesysco Ltd. ” and demanding an apology and retraction .
The letter avers that “ [t ] he alleged defamations may be boiled down essentially to the following : ”
Our Clients ’ technology does not work and cannot work and is therefore arbitrary and consequently worthless , contrary to our Clients ’ claims with regard to it .
This allegation is presented in various ways and pervades the Article .
Our Clients are liars and charlatans ( definition from Chambers online : “ someone posing as an expert in some profession ” ) .
This is occasionally conveyed by means of sarcasm , giving the further implication ( insofar as this is not already conveyed in the term “ charlatan ” ) that the Clients are acting in bad faith by commercialising technology which they know does not work .
In addition , our Clients are irresponsible and perhaps even reckless in allowing their technology to be used at all , and in particular at Domodedovo Airport , Moscow .
But the letter fails to specify even a single statement in the article that Mr. Liberman believes to be defamatory .
Anticipating this criticism , his lawyers explain :
While it might be usual to provide examples from the Article demonstrating the said defamations , we refrain from doing so on the basis that no person acting in good faith could seriously argue that the article is not openly defamatory in the above ways – starting from its title .
Really ?
The reviewers who approved the article for publication would presumably disagree .
And comments posted by outraged readers on popular websites such as Slashdot.org and Reddit.com suggest that many others would also disagree .
The next document we have is a follow - up letter ( 124 kb PDF ) from Shimron , Molho , Persky & Co. dated 13 November 2008 responding to a letter from Equinox ( no copy available ) .

Nemesysco ’s attempt to suppress Eriksson & Lacerda ’s article has backfired .
Badly .
The Internet abhors censorship , and from an initial post on a University of Stockholm linguistics blog , news of Nemesysco ’s coercive endeavor to discredit the authors and restrict public access to the paper eventually spread like wildfire .
In an example of what has been dubbed “ the Streisand effect , ” copies of Eriksson & Lacerda ’s article have been anonymously posted on Scribd.com ( where it has been viewed more than 7,000 times ) and WikiLeaks.org , and it may also be downloaded via BitTorrent .
In addition , the controversy over the suppression of the article has recently been noted on the website of the premiere scientific journal , Nature .
AntiPolygraph.org deplores Equinox ’s decision to accede to Nemesysco ’s bullying .
To the extent that Anders Eriksson and Francisco Lacerda characterized “ Layered Voice Analysis ” as charlatanry , they were fully justified in so doing .
That ’s precisely what it is .
Nemesysco founder Amir Liberman is a charlatan , and those who would squander public monies on his emperor ’s - new clothes technology should be held up to public ridicule .
Well , some right wingers will explode in shock .
Remember , we heard from the primaries through the general election that Barack Obama is not tough enough .
Well , obviously many forgot that he said he would protect this country and its citizens .
Today the pirates went down and the captain was saved .
A senior US official tells me that President Barack Obama approved a recommendation by Defense Secretary Bob Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen to dispatch special forces to the US scene on Friday .
These special forces were authorized to take action " in extremis " against the Somali pirates holding Maersk Captain Richard Phillips , 53 , hostage on a motorized lifeboat off the coast of Somalia .
A senior official tells me that when the fourth Somali pirate was on the Bainbridge ship , Phillips moved to side of the lifeboat to relieve himself .
At that point , U.S. special forces saw their opportunity and took other three pirates out .
Captain Phillips is now safe aboard a U.S. vessel .
It 's " going to make a great movie , " a U.S. official adds .
Nuff said on that one .
I have a little job that runs on my web server and tells me what URIs people have tried to fetch over the last 24 hours which were not successful .
One of these URIs was for a page that used to contain my first ever Linux device driver .
That device driver is now obsolete and so there was little point in tracking down the code and putting it back in place , but I did think there was a story to tell , so today I wrote down what happened with this driver at the URI .
Thanks to the magic of ikiwiki's " inline " directive , here it is in the log :
This is a story about my first real attempt to contribute to the Linux kernel .
The Davicom DM9601 is a cheap USB NIC that I picked up on ebay at some point in late 2006 .
Suprisingly , at the time , there was no driver for it in the Linux kernel .
I 'd had some experience hacking on the kernel whilst working for IBM and I 've always wanted to get more involved , so I thought this would be a good opportunity .
I searched around and managed to find a vendor - written driver for the 2.4.x kernel series , but nothing newer .
I felt that the best approach would be to start porting this driver to 2.6 , improving it along the way .
I got to work , and after several hours I had something that would compile against 2.6 series headers , at least , so I put my progress online and wrote a short log post about it ( dm9601 ) .
A really invaluable resource whilst doing this was LWN .
net 's " Porting device drivers to the 2.6 kernel " .
Once I had the code up there , kernel hacker Arnd Bergmann got in touch with me .
He said , quite frankly , that my driver had a long way to go , but that he would be willing to help mentor me and guide me in improving it so that it would make it into mainline .
This was fantastic news : this is exactly what people need when trying to get up to speed with the customs of something as complex as the kernel development community .
Arnd sent me a long list of things I needed to fix .
Whilst I had my code online I had several other people get in touch with me and provide things like device IDs for their NICs that they needed to add in order to get it to work for their hardware .
Several weeks later , after implementing a good chunk of Arnd 's suggestions , I had a driver that worked , at least a little bit , with 2.6 , so I got back in touch with Arnd .
Bad news , for me at least : Peter Korsgaard , another kernel hacker , had implemented a dm9601 driver from scratch over a weekend .
Apparently he was at a friend 's house , his friend had this device , he noticed there was n't a driver in the kernel already and sat down to write it as a fun project .
From scratch .
In one weekend .
This was a bit of a blow .
I could n't imagine having the skill and knowledge required to be able to pump out a driver like that , but I knew the first step on the road was what I was doing , and that road was now closed .
I could n't really blame Peter , I could only really feel quite jealous at his prowess , so that was the end of that .
His driver was much leaner , much tidier , fitted the kernel programming style properly , and was thus accepted .
However , for my hardware at least , it did n't actually work , and he did n't have access to the device after that one weekend , so he was n't in a position to fix it .
This situation lasted about 4 months from 2007 - 02 - 23 , when Peter 's driver was accepted , until about 2007 - 06 - 27 with this patch .
From this whole experience , I did manage to get one small patch into the kernel : one which added the device IDs for my NIC and those of the people who had got in touch with me .

An influenza vaccine that protects against death and serious complications from different strains of flu is a little closer to reality , Saint Louis University vaccine researchers have found .
" This is a significant first step in developing a universal vaccine to help protect against pandemic influenza , " said Robert Belshe , M.D. , director of the Saint Louis University Center for Vaccine Development .
Belshe , the lead researcher who studied a vaccine made with proteins from strains of influenza viruses A and B , presents his findings on April 27 at the National Foundation for Infectious Disease Conference for Vaccine Research in Baltimore .
Currently drug companies manufacture a different flu vaccine each year to match the strains of influenza that researchers predict will circulate .
Adding a universal influenza vaccine to a seasonal vaccine would help improve protection against strains of influenza as they change each year .
" Novel vaccines , capable of inducing long - lasting , broad immunity against divergent strains , including potential pandemic viruses , are highly desirable , " Belshe said .
In the study , 377 healthy adults received three injections of a universal influenza vaccine , known as Bivalent Influenza Peptide Conjugate Vaccine ( BIPCV ) , over a six month period .
Researchers found that a low dose of the vaccine is well tolerated and safe , Belshe said .
It addition , the low dose vaccine evoked an immune response – high antibody titers – that is similar to levels associated with protecting small animals infected with influenza from serious disease and death .
More testing is needed , Belshe added .
The research also is significant in light of the search for a vaccine to protect against a deadly influenza pandemic , which is a global outbreak of the disease that spreads quickly with lethal consequences .
Nothing screams sexy like an ad for a C# developer job at a well - funded start - up .
In fact , when Frank 's recruiter presented the opportunity to him , Frank knew it would be a long shot .
After all , he had no commercial software experience and had only limited Web development experience .
But he did know .NET pretty well , so he figured it'd be worth a try .
Maybe his skills could translate to a Web - based software company .
His first interview went surprisingly well .
They asked a lot of " aptitude " questions , as they were firm believers that " experience can be gained and skills can be learned , but attitude never changes . "
Apparently , Frank showed good aptitude and was asked back for a second interview .
When Frank came back for round two , he was given the grand tour .
It was everything start - up dreams were made of : posh decor , shiny new Macbooks everywhere , an air - hockey table , free catered meals and Aeron chairs as far as the eye could see .
After the interview , his future boss Derrick made Frank an offer he could n't refuse .
Frank 's first day consisted mostly of introductions .
When he finally made it back to his desk , he could n't help but wonder about some things .
Things like , why would a Web - based software company with 20 employees have only three developers on staff ?
And why would two of those developers be part - time interns ?
The more he thought about it , the more he worried .
Frank counted four different program managers .
What tasks at the small company could possibly keep the New Product Introduction Manager or Geospatial Systems Program Manager busy all day ?
" Did the company really need 10 ' manager ' level positions ? "
Frank asked himself .
" Should n't some of these people have software backgrounds ? "
But Frank shrugged his concerns off , reasoning that this was the type of team needed to build a successful start - up .
Wait …
What ?
Once Frank finally settled into his comfy Aeron chair and fired up his dual - monitor workstation , he was ready to learn the code .
This , he figured , is where it would all come together and make sense .
He heeded his fellow developers ' warning that things " were a little beta-ish " and dove right in .
After all of two minutes , he wanted to jump back out .
The pages were riddled with race conditions and generally only supported one request at a time .
The developers did n't seem to know the difference between Cache , ViewState and Session objects , so they just used all three simultaneously to " make things work . "
As for the " helper functions " -- they were perhaps the most unique take on .NET coding Frank had ever seen .
In one baffling case , the developers created their own areValuesDifferent method to act as a wrapper for object .
Equals ( ) :
public static bool are ValuesDifferent ( object val1 , object val2 ) { bool diff = false ; if ( val1 == null ) { if ( val2 != null ) diff = true ; } else { if ( val2 == null ) diff = true ; else { if ( val1.GetType( ).FullName.CompareTo( " System. String " ) == 0 ) { if ( ( ( string ) val1 ) .
CompareTo( ( string ) val2 ) !=
0 ) diff = true ; } if ( val1.GetType( ).FullName.CompareTo( " System.DateTime " ) == 0 ) { if ( (( DateTime ) val1 ) .CompareTo(( DateTime ) val2 ) !=
0 ) diff = true ; } if ( val1.GetType( ).FullName.CompareTo( " System.Int64 " ) == 0 ) { if ( ( ( long ) val1 ) .
CompareTo( ( long ) val2 ) !=
0 ) diff = true ; } if ( val1.GetType( ).FullName.CompareTo( " System.Double " ) == 0 ) { if ( ( ( double ) val1 ) .
CompareTo( ( double ) val2 ) !=
0 ) diff = true ; } } } return diff ; }
As the lead developer later told Frank , " Well , this way , it only checks the value . "
Frank took a few minutes to explain the whole concept of " virtual " methods and how Equals ( ) does exactly the same thing .
His colleague shrugged his shoulders and replied , " Hmm , I guess that would work , too . "
The really good news came later that day , when Frank learned that the company would be hiring some new intern developers .
Well , not just any interns , only the " most aptitudinal " that money could buy .

With Apple ’s WWDC about 3 weeks away , the rumor mill is in full effect .
According to AppleiPhoneApps , they were approached by someone with connections to Apple ’s hardware development team who divulged that the next iPhone model will be released on July 17 , 2009 .
This supposed source also dished out the specs of the next iPhone model .
Some of the rumored specs have already been reported , while others are completely new .
So without further adieu , here are the rumored specs of the next - gen iPhone model .
A nation which constantly perceives existential threats in everything from domestic protest marches to the sale of bread during Passover , Israel has today launched a five - day national exercise of assorted “ doomsday scenarios ” that might imperil the nation at some point in the future .
The exercise will simulate missile strikes simultaneously coming from the Gaza Strip , Lebanon , Iran and Syria , including chemical and biological weapons in the most densely populated areas .
It will also include a wave of suicide bombings , earthquakes and epidemics .
The drill has been planned for month and officials insist it is purely defensive , but the timing – just one week before the Lebanese elections , is being seen in neighboring Lebanon as a sabre - rattling exercise meant to prepare Israelis for retaliation in the event of a new offensive war .
Hezbollah , whose opposition bloc is expected to win those elections , has placed its operatives on emergency alert during the drill , in the case that the simulated doomsday is used as a pretext for an attack .
In the summer of 2006 , Israel invaded southern Lebanon , killing over a thousand .
Jack Straw tightened the proposed rules in March
The government is dropping plans to hold secret inquests without juries , Justice Secretary Jack Straw has said .
In a Commons written statement , Mr Straw said the move did not command the necessary cross-party support , despite earlier government concessions .
It was included in the Coroners and Justice Bill earlier this year to cover cases involving sensitive information .
Civil liberties groups who feared cases like that of Jean Charles de Menezes would be affected , welcomed the move .
The government had argued that in some cases inquests should be held in private for national security , crime prevention or diplomatic reasons .
We welcome this sane and humble climbdown
Shami Chakrabarti , Liberty
In response to criticism , Mr Straw tightened the proposed rules in March .
He altered the plans so a High Court judge , rather than ministers , would have the final decision over whether the press and public would be banned from an inquest .
In his statement on Friday , Mr Straw said : " The government felt these changes struck a fair and proportionate balance between the interests of bereaved families , the need to protect sensitive material and judicial oversight of the whole process .
" However , following further discussions in the House and with interested parties , it is clear the provisions still do not command the necessary cross-party support and in the circumstances the government will table amendments to remove clauses 11 and 12 from the bill . "
He added that where it was not possible to proceed with an inquest under existing arrangements , the government would consider establishing an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 instead .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of civil liberties campaign group Liberty , said : " We welcome this sane and humble climb - down .
" It was completely bizarre for a government that has spent over a decade lecturing the public about victims ' rights to attempt to exclude bereaved families from open justice . "
Parliamentary opposition Amnesty International UK campaigns director Tim Hancock agreed it was to be welcomed , adding : " When someone loses their life at the hands of the state , it 's essential - and required by international law - that an independent and impartial inquiry finds out how and why it happened . "
The proposal for secret inquests was originally included in last year 's counter - terrorism bill but was dropped due to parliamentary opposition .
Aspects of it were subsequently revived in the Coroners and Justice Bill , with ministers promising safeguards .
But some MPs and human rights organisations were concerned that cases such as " friendly fire " military deaths and deaths at the hands of the police could be heard in private , instead of being subject to public scrutiny .
Ben Ward , associate director for Europe at Human Rights Watch , said the decision to abandon the plans was " a welcome development " .
He said : " Had the proposals passed , we might well have seen an inquest like the one into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes held behind closed doors . "

Pay to Play Politics is Unacceptable for Health Care Reform
Yesterday morning , eight doctors , lawyers and other activists stood up for single payer health care .
We stood up during a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee .
The hearing was only to hear from the insurance industry , pharmaceutical companies , HMO ’s and business interests .
They did not want to hear about a real national health care plan .
I was one of the eight .
We stood up to the private health insurance industry , to the corporate power in Congress and demanded a single payer national health care plan where everybody is in and nobody is out .
We want a plan that ensures the peoples right to choose their own doctor , hospital and health care treatment .
We want a plan that will control costs – something that cannot be done unless the insurance industry , HMO ’s and pharmaceutical companies are challenged .
The Senate Finance Committee which has taken millions from the insurance industry , HMO ’s , pharmaceutical industry – those that profit from health care in America only scheduled their donors to speak .
It was pay to play on display in Washington , DC before the corrupt Senate Finance Committee .
We stood up and told the truth .
The Emperor Has No Clothes we said .
We were arrested and charged with “ disruption of Congress ” a euphemism for telling the truth in Congress .

Normally I tell people that Chinese is n’t really as hard as they think , and that characters are actually pretty easy to remember once you get the hang of it .
And then something like this comes along and kicks me in the ass .
The character to the right is nàng , a verb meaning “ to have a stuffy nose . ”
It is 36 strokes , and there is no simplified version .
Unlike most extremely complicated characters , it is reasonably common , as it is used to describe a common physical condition , 齉鼻子 , literally “ stuffed nose . ”
I sometimes wonder why I did n’t decide to study Spanish …
Update :
While discussing this character with my girlfriend over lunch , she realized that she could n’t remember how to write it either , so maybe it ’s hard for more than just us poor foreign students of the language .
Update 2 : Changed the tone to the correct — fourth — tone thanks to a great comment from Kang Zhuxi , below .

( CNN ) --
It did n't matter what officers said to him :
The man was going to jump .
The 51 - year - old was spotted Tuesday morning by a Tampa , Florida , citizen , perched on the northbound side of the Howard Frankland Bridge , which carries Interstate 275 over Old Tampa Bay .
The citizen called police .
The story the man told was all too common , according to Tampa Police Department Officer Jeff Kritz .
He said he was a carpenter by profession , earning $ 65 an hour at one time .
But over the past three years , as the economy spiraled downward , he said he had lost his business , his home and his family -- his wife had divorced him , Kritz said , and his daughter was estranged .
The man came to Tampa from Rhode Island 2 ½ weeks ago seeking warmer weather , but has been homeless .
He said he slept in the Tampa airport Monday night , but authorities threw him out on Tuesday .
So " today was the day , " Kritz said .
" He said , ' That 's enough . '
" He never , ever thought in a million years that he would be in this kind of position , " Kritz said .
" He said , ' I 'm on the street with nothing . ' "
Another officer had already responded when Kritz pulled up to the bridge about 10:45 a.m .
" When I pulled up , he got a little nervous , " Kritz said .
He positioned himself behind the man , showing the other officer his Taser and maintaining eye contact .
The first officer kept the man occupied , telling him Kritz was there to keep traffic away .
The man was clearly determined to end his life , so Kritz used his Taser on him .
" I knew I did n't want to go hands - on , " he said .
" I did n't want to wrestle him . "
He did n't want to use the Taser either , Kritz said .
" I 'd much rather see him come down ... but that was n't going to happen . "
As Kritz used the device , which delivers a shock via wires with electrodes at their ends , the man froze , his muscles tightened and he slipped to the ground gently as the officers handcuffed him .
As he was loaded into an ambulance that would take him to a crisis center , the man began to cry -- " a good cry .
It 's like you 're letting it out , " Kritz said .
" He was very thankful .
He wanted help . "
Kritz walked over to him and said , " Everything is going to be OK .
Give me a hug . "
The two embraced , and Kritz said the man told him : " ' Brother , that was from the heart .
That was awesome . ' "
The officer said he was thrilled with the outcome Tuesday , but noted that suicide calls are becoming more common as a result of the economic downturn , and some -- like an economy - related suicide by hanging a few days ago in the Tampa area -- do n't have happy endings .
In talking to the man , Kritz said the officers tried to tell him that " a lot of us are in this situation , there is help out there ... I can get him the help he needs .
Although he says ' There 's nothing you can do , ' you continue talking . "
But he said he was convinced the man was serious and his decision was final .
" He was gonna go , " Kritz said .
" That 's why I decided to Tase him . "
" He was a regular guy , " Kritz said .
" He 's a regular guy that is just caught up in this economy ....
The sad part is , it could be one of us in a few years .
Nobody 's immune from this . "
All About Tampa • Suicide • National Economy
By Fred Burton and Scott Stewart Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake told parliament May 5 that he believes Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is among the large group of Tiger militants trapped in a 4 - square kilometer coastline area near Mullaitivu .
The area around Mullaitivu has been the final focal point of a recent larger government military offensive aimed at restoring government control of northeast Sri Lanka and crushing the South Asian country 's separatist rebels , who have controlled large parts of the region for the past several years .
The Tigers ' battlefield losses have been compounded by the severe disruption to their formerly extensive financial network ( primarily concentrated among the Tamil diaspora in Western Europe and Canada ) after the European Union placed the group on its terror list in 2006 .
This led to tightened sanctions by Europe , the United States and Canada against the Tigers , as well as greater international cooperation in arresting Tiger smuggling rings .
Some of the Tigers ' main financiers have since been arrested , and many of their assets have been frozen .
It takes a lot of money and equipment to wage a conventional war , and those resources have become far harder for the Tigers to come by of late .
As STRATFOR has previously noted , if Sri Lankan troops manage to crush the remnants of the Tigers ' hard - pressed conventional military forces , the Tigers will have little choice but to give up on conventional warfare ( at least for the time being ) .
But the Tigers ' separatist struggle is more than 30 years old and has been marked by great brutality on both sides .
Because of this , there is very little chance the Tigers will simply accept defeat and fade into history .
Instead , now that the government has the military advantage , the Tigers can be expected to continue their war against the government by melting back into the populace and resorting to guerrilla tactics and terrorism .
In many ways , this will resemble events in Iraq and Afghanistan , where a militarily weaker force melted away in the face of a more powerful conventional military force .
The Tigers , however , have a far more experienced and effective terrorist apparatus than either their Taliban or Iraqi counterparts .
This struggle will therefore remain bloody in Sri Lanka ( and perhaps even abroad ) .
Background
The Tigers are battling for the creation of an independent Tamil homeland for the country 's 10 - 15 percent Tamil minority , the dominant ethnicity in northern and eastern Sri Lanka .
The Tigers are struggling against the majority Sinhalese Buddhist - controlled government , which has fought the Tigers in a bloody civil war that has lasted nearly three and a half decades .
Over the decades , the Tigers have developed an extremely sophisticated paramilitary organization .
This force consists of not only ground forces ( complete with artillery and even some armor ) , but also a sea wing that engages in arms smuggling and naval attacks against the Sri Lankan Navy — to include suicide boat attacks — a small air wing , and an elite force of militants trained to conduct assassinations and terrorist attacks known as the Black Tigers .
The Black Tigers became famous for suicide bombings ( one of which killed former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 ) , and we are hard - pressed to think of another militant group that has assassinated as many VIPs , including several Cabinet ministers and numerous members of parliament , as have the Black Tigers .
Last year alone , they killed a Sri Lankan member of parliament on Jan. 1 , the minister for nation building on Jan. 8 , and the highway minister on April 7 .
They also killed the Sri Lankan foreign minister in August 2005 .
( click image to enlarge ) The Tigers ' fortunes have fluctuated over the years .
Several times they have brought large swathes of northern and eastern Sri Lanka under their exclusive control , only to lose them to government offensives , such as an offensive launched in January 2001 .
As mentioned , international pressures on their finances and logistics in recent years , plus the loss of the strategically significant Elephant Pass in January — formerly a key logistics hub for their resupply efforts and an important base for their naval efforts — mean the Tigers are now in an uphill battle for survival .
Compounding the Tigers ' woes , the government now is far better prepared , equipped and trained than it has been during previous military offensives .
But despite being so hard - pressed and having taken such significant losses , there are no signs that the Tigers have lost the will to fight .
They continue to hold out rather than surrender , and we have not seen news of desertions .
The Tigers ' material losses will be more difficult to overcome than their loss of personnel .
They should be able to find new volunteers ( or conscripts ) among Sri Lanka 's Tamil population .
Their ability to recruit should be aided by the Sri Lankan military 's policy of forcing Tamils into internment camps , something the Tigers also have leapt on as an international propaganda opportunity .
Tiger militants are well - trained and are also subject to rigorous political indoctrination .
With rare exception , the Tigers prefer to fight — or take their standard - issue cyanide capsules — and die rather than surrender .
This willingness for self - sacrifice is best seen in the Black Tigers , which were early adopters of suicide bombing attacks and have been among the most frequent users of the tactic .
The Black Tigers also have employed more female suicide bombers than any other group .
( They used a female suicide operative in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination . )
The Black Tigers reportedly have a waiting list of militants seeking to enter the unit — suicide bombers reportedly are held in almost mythical esteem by their ordinary Tiger colleagues — and Prabhakaran reportedly handpicks each member .
Insurgency and Terror As seen from Iraq , Afghanistan and any number of historical examples , it is very difficult to eradicate an insurgency that can blend in with a sympathetic local population .
Doing so is even harder when the insurgents can exploit international borders to create a place of refuge .
Although Sri Lanka is an island , it is located very close to the coast of India .
It lies just a few miles from the Indian state of Tamil Nadu , an Indian state that , as its name implies , has a substantial ethnic Tamil population .
Some Indian Tamils are sympathetic to the Tigers , and the Tigers have established a sizable presence in Tamil Nadu .
Sympathy in Tamil Nadu for the Tigers came into view May 5 , 2009 , when a large group of pro-Tiger Indian Tamil activists blocked a convoy of Indian army trucks in the city of Coimbatore because they believed the trucks were carrying supplies destined for the Sri Lankan military .
The activists reportedly damaged and ransacked some of the trucks .
Support in Tamil Nadu means that the Tigers can — and do — exploit the international border to their advantage .
The Tigers use India in much the same way that the Taliban and al Qaeda use Pakistan .
The Tigers ' logistical and training infrastructure in India is especially important during times ( like the present ) when the Sri Lankan government is hammering them .
The Tigers also have a long history of working with an array of other militant groups in India and the general region .
This cooperation is not based on ideology , but rather on mutual benefit , such as bolstering the groups ' ability to smuggle weapons and other goods .
Another truism about insurgency is that it takes far fewer resources to sustain an insurgency than it does to fight a conventional war .
The amount of ordnance expended in a single conventional battle can sustain months or even years of insurgent activity , especially if the insurgents can acquire ordnance from their enemy during their operations .
Conducting terrorist attacks requires even fewer resources than insurgent attacks ; terrorism is a cheap and time - tested means of hitting a militarily superior foe .
When properly conducted , terrorist attacks are the ultimate exercise of asymmetrical warfare .
For a militant group to effectively wield terrorism as an asymmetrical weapon , however , it must gain mastery of a range of tactical skills that we refer to as terrorist tradecraft .
These skills include , among other things , the ability to operate without being detected , the ability to collect intelligence on potential targets , the ability to procure munitions , the ability to recruit operatives , the ability to plan effective strikes and the ability to construct reliable improvised explosives devices ( IEDs ) .
Through decades of trial and error , the Tigers have developed all of these skills , as evidenced by their large number of successful assassinations .
In fact , they have a record of tactical success that would make any jihadist group green with envy .
The Tigers excel at collecting intelligence , and their female operatives form a significant part of their intelligence apparatus , since they generally can travel more widely than males can and do not tend to arouse suspicions to the extent male operatives do .
Female Tigers who are already willing to serve as suicide bombers not surprisingly have been willing to use seduction to obtain information critical to their cause .
The group has also long demonstrated the ability to operate in the Sri Lankan capital , Colombo , as well as in other non-Tamil majority areas .
And it has conducted scores of attacks against military , financial and political targets and civilian soft targets in non-Tamil areas .
The group conducted five suicide bombings in Colombo alone in 2008 , and several attacks against soft targets like passenger buses and commuter trains .
The group also has a cadre of very polished and experienced bombmakers who make reliable and effective IEDs .
Perhaps most spectacularly , the Tiger air wing launched a 9/11 - inspired airborne suicide attack Feb. 20 , in which their two remaining aircraft were loaded with explosives and sent out after dark on a suicide mission to attack Colombo .
One of the planes was shot down , but the other plane reached the capital and struck the 12th floor of the 15 - floor Inland Revenue Department , where it exploded — a scene captured by a Sri Lankan navy infrared camera and posted to YouTube .
YouTube Video of Airborne Tiger Suicide Attack ( STRATFOR is not responsible for the content of other Web sites . )
It is thought that the Inland Revenue Department was not the intended target , but that the plane was hit by anti-aircraft fire and accidentally struck that building .
According to Sri Lankan sources , the intended target may have been either the headquarters of the Sri Lankan air force , which is next to the building that was hit , or the president 's house or army headquarters , which also are close by .
The decision to use the remaining Tiger aircraft in this type of suicide operation against the government in Colombo rather than risk losing them to advancing government troops is a prime example of the Tigers ' mind - set .
Mayhem in the Forecast With the Tigers ' air wing now apparently gone , further 9/11 - style suicide planes are unlikely .
The Tigers , however , will almost certainly plan more terrorist strikes .
Such attacks will be seen as retaliation against the Sri Lankan government .
They also will be used to hurt the economy ( and thus the government 's ability to finance its military efforts ) .
And they will be used to force the government to divert troops from the northeast to provide security to other parts of the country , thus taking pressure off the Tamil heartland .
The Tigers also have shown a limited cyberwarfare capability , which they can be expected to use to score propaganda points and wreak economic havoc when possible .
In addition to assassinating VIPs and attacking passenger trains and buses , the Tigers have a long history of attacking villages and massacring Sinhalese Buddhist and Muslim civilians to foster a sense of terror .
We anticipate that small Tamil units will resume operations to massacre civilians , in particular Sinhalese Buddhist and Muslim civilians .
The Tigers also probably will attack crowds of civilians and commercial centers .
We also anticipate assassination attempts to be launched against military and political VIPs in Colombo , and against local / regional leaders and military and police commanders in the northeast .
Attacks against passenger trains and buses also can be expected .
STRATFOR sources in Sri Lanka advise that the Tigers are likely to strike at the Yal Devi Express , a train that runs from Colombo to Vavuniya and is of great symbolic value to Tamil - Sinhalese coexistence .
We believe there will be numerous attacks and ambushes targeting traffic on the A - 9 road that leads from Colombo to Jaffna aimed at both military and commercial targets , blending terrorism and insurgency .
Such attacks could involve ambushes and roadside IEDs , a tactic the Tigers have used with success in the past , such as with the roadside IED used in the January 2008 assassination of the minister of nation building .
Due to the long history of conflict in Sri Lanka ( which has sometimes been fueled by external meddling ) , we do not share the assessment by some in the Sri Lankan government that the Tigers are all but dead .
They may be severely damaged as a conventional military force — for a time at least — but the group 's cadre of dedicated , zealous militants will certainly spill a lot more blood in their quest for independence and vengeance against the Sri Lankan government .

The Chinese government has issued strict rules on " harmful " internet videos , after blocking access to YouTube over a clip purportedly showing police beating Tibetan independence protesters .
China 's State Administration of Radio , Film and TV posted revised restrictions banning online videos that " oppose the basic principles of the Chinese constitution ; jeopardize China 's unity , sovereignty or territorial integrity , divulge state secrets ; and endanger national security or harm national honor and interest , " reports the Hollywood trade pub Variety .
Authorities have also barred online videos that " advocate evil cults and superstitions , " or " explicitly display sexual perversions , extreme violence or the slaughtering of animals . "
Furthermore , no movie or television show can be posted or downloaded that has n't been approved to be shown in China .
The People 's Republic only allows a maximum of 20 foreign films ( generally only blockbusters ) a year - and usually after heavy editing .
The tighter restrictions are suspected to be a response to a video released on YouTube last month by the government of the exiled Dalai Lama allegedly showing Tibetan protesters being shackled and beaten by police during protests near Lhasa last March .
Chinese authorities have claimed the video is a fake and wo n't confirm the government was responsible for shutting off YouTube .
The government recently launched a nationwide crackdown on " lewd " and " obscene " internet content that has seen more than 1,900 websites blocked by authorities and at least 41 people detained . ®
The Church of Scientology and six of its French leaders went on trial on Monday on charges of organised fraud that could lead to an outright ban on the organisation in France .
Known for its Hollywood celebrity followers Tom Cruise and John Travolta , the group is in the dock in Paris for the second time in six years , although French courts have prosecuted several individual Scientologists since 1978 .
The court is hearing a complaint from two women , one of whom alleges she was manipulated into handing over 20,000 euros ( 28,000 US dollars ) for costly Scientology products , such as an " electrometer " to measure mental energy .
She says she was approached in a Paris street by a Scientologist in late 1998 who offered a free personality test , at a time when she was feeling psychologically fragile .
After being told that her test results were poor , the woman was sold a series of " life - improvement courses " , vitamins and other products that she could ill afford , landing her in debt .
NASA Twin Spacecraft May Reveal Secret Of Lunar Origin
At the time of the giant impact , Theia and Earth would have been large enough to be molten , enabling heavier elements , like iron , to sink to the center to form their cores .
by Staff Writers
Greenbelt MD ( SPX ) Apr 14 , 2009
Two identical NASA spacecraft are preparing to enter a point in the universe that may eventually answer the question of how our moon was born .
The spacecraft duet , called Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory , or Stereo , are nearing a zone known as the Lagrangian points .
At these points , the gravity of the sun and Earth combine to form gravitational wells where asteroids and space dust tend to gather .
The 18th - century mathematician Joseph - Louis Lagrange realized there were five such wells in the sun-Earth system .
The twin probes are about to pass through two of them , named L4 and L5 .
During their journey , the spacecraft will use a wide - field - of - view telescope to look for asteroids orbiting the region .
Scientists will be able to identify if a dot of light is an asteroid because it will shift its position against stars in the background as it moves in its orbit .
" These points may hold small asteroids , which could be leftovers from a Mars - sized planet that formed billions of years ago , " said Michael Kaiser , Stereo project scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
" According to Edward Belbruno and Richard Gott at Princeton University , about 4.5 billion years ago when the planets were still growing , a hypothetical world called Theia may have been nudged out of L4 or L5 by the increasing gravity of other developing planets like Venus , sending it on a collision course with Earth .
" The resulting impact blasted the outer layers of Theia and Earth into orbit , which eventually coalesced under their own gravity to form the moon . "
This concept is a modification of a scientific " giant impact " theory of the moon 's origin .
The theory explains puzzling properties of the moon , such as its relatively small iron core .
At the time of the giant impact , Theia and Earth would have been large enough to be molten , enabling heavier elements , like iron , to sink to the center to form their cores .
An impact would have stripped away the outer layers of the two worlds , containing mostly lighter elements like silicon .
The moon eventually formed from this material .
Stereo's primary mission is to give three - dimensional views of space weather by observing the sun from the two points where the spacecraft are located .
Images and other data are then combined for study and analysis .
Space weather produces disturbances in electromagnetic fields on Earth that can induce extreme currents in wires , disrupting power lines and causing wide - spread blackouts .
It also can affect communications and navigation systems .
Space weather has been recognized as causing problems with new technology since the invention of the telegraph in the 19th century .
Critics say the money could be better spent on the London Underground Prime Minister Gordon Brown has marked the start of construction on a new £ 15.9 bn rail route across London .
Crossrail will link towns to the east and west of the city with Heathrow , the West End , and Canary Wharf .
The project 's supporters say it will bring better transport for London and create jobs when they are badly needed .
But Crossrail has been criticised by some commentators as a waste of money , given the extreme pressure on the public purse .
Given the go - ahead in 2007 , Crossrail will involve digging tunnels from the east of London to a point close to Paddington station in the west of the city .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The tunnels will link to existing rail stations , providing train services to Maidenhead , Heathrow , central London , Docklands , Shenfield in Essex and Abbey Wood in south London .
Mr Brown joined rail minister Lord Adonis and London Mayor Boris Johnson at Canary Wharf in London Docklands as a foundation for a new Crossrail station was laid .
Mr Brown said : " Investment in important projects like Crossrail , the largest construction project in Europe , is vital to create and protect jobs as well as supporting business , so we can grow our way out of recession and ensure a strong future for London and the country as a whole . "
There have been concerns that the Conservatives could abandon the project because of the economic conditions should the party win the next general election .
BBC transport correspondent Tom Symonds said : " Critics say it 's far too much when public spending is expected to fall and some say the money would be better invested in the tube system . "

But Conservative mayor Mr Johnson said the project will change the face of transport in London and the south - east forever .
" The years of hesitation , irresolution and vacillations are over , " he said .
" The shovels have tasted earth and the construction of a railway that is crucial to the economic prosperity of this great city has begun . "
At peak times 24 trains an hour will run on the route , carrying up to 1,500 passengers .
The first trains are expected to start running in 2017 - more than four decades after the concept was first recommended .
The Department for Transport has provided £ 5.6bn of funding for the project with Transport for London paying for another £ 7.7 bn .
Airport operator BAA is funding the project to the tune of £ 230 m and the Corporation of London is providing a further £ 200m .

The WSJ is reporting that President Obama is leaning toward the CIA position on releasing the torture memos , which would mean that they would be heavily redacted .
Among the details in the still - classified memos is approval for a technique in which a prisoner 's head could be struck against a wall as long as the head was being held and the force of the blow was controlled by the interrogator , according to people familiar with the memos .
Another approved tactic was waterboarding , or simulated drowning .
A decision to keep secret key parts of the three 2005 memos outlining legal guidance on CIA interrogations would anger some Obama supporters who have pushed him to unveil now - abandoned Bush - era tactics .
It would also go against the views of Attorney General Eric Holder and White House Counsel Greg Craig , people familiar with the matter said .
Top CIA officials have spoken out strongly against a full release , saying it would undermine the agency 's credibility with foreign intelligence services and hurt the agency 's work force , people involved in the discussions said .
However , Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair favors releasing the information , current and former senior administration officials said .
The argument that the agency 's credibility could be any more damaged either at home or with foreign intelligence services is laughable .
The essential contents of these memos is well known -- as is the result .
The leaked ICRC report provided that in stark , and intensely damaging detail .
The damage that could be done by not making the memos public would likely far outweigh the confirmation they provide that the U.S. tortured .
I 'm not in the habit of quoting Andrew Sullivan , but on this , he 's spot on :
Chrysler may give union 55 % stake instead of $ 10.6 bn to provide healthcare after Obama administration piles pressure on carmaker
Chrysler 's largest trade union could end up owning 55 % of the ailing carmaker under a tentative deal intended to save the cash - strapped 84 - year - old company from bankruptcy and possible liquidation .
With just 48 hours to go before a deadline set by the Obama administration to prove its viability , the third largest US motor manufacturer yesterday agreed the outlines of an arrangement to carve itself up between the union , the US government , lenders and its likely technology - sharing partner , Fiat .
Under the pact , the United Auto Workers Union would take a majority share in the company and would get a seat on the board – an unprecedented arrangement which would turn the firm effectively into an owner - operated enterprise .
In return for shares in Chrysler , the UAW will allow the company to cut by half the $ 10.6 bn it is supposed to be investing in a union - run trust to provide healthcare for retired workers .
In a letter made public last night , the UAW 's leadership asked members to accept changes to bonuses , overtime , job security agreements and health benefits .
It warned that unless workers agreed , the US government would withdraw financial support and Chrysler faced " immediate liquidation " .
" These modifications to our contract and to the [ healthcare ] trust are essential to securing federal loans to keep Chrysler in business so that we can keep manufacturing jobs here in the United States and , more importantly , live to fight another day , " wrote the UAW 's president , Ron Gettelfinger , and vice - president , General Holiefield .
The UAW revealed that Fiat is to get a 35 % stake in return for a commitment to build a small car at Chrysler 's US factories and market Chrysler 's products in Europe .
The US company , which owns brands including Dodge and Jeep , has suffered from its lack of expertise in smaller vehicles .
Chrysler 's lenders , which include top banks such as JP Morgan and Citigroup , have been sticking points in achieving a deal , reluctant to take shares in the company to satisfy their $ 6.9 bn of loans .
In a breakthrough yesterday , several leading lenders accepted an arrangement under which they would write off more than two - thirds of the money they are owed , accepting just $ 2bn in cash .
But 46 banks and hedge funds all need to agree to this .
The Obama administration wields influence with the banks because it has extended bail - out money to them under the treasury 's Troubled Asset Relief Program and is thought to be using this as a bargaining chip .
The positive signs do not mean that the prospect of bankruptcy has evaporated .
The treasury has been preparing a bankruptcy filing in case Chrysler fails to produce a viable plan on Thursday and some insiders suggest that this could still happen , with officials believing that the company can be better saved under court protection from its creditors .
The head of the Canadian Auto Workers Union , Ken Lewenza , said yesterday Fiat 's boss , Sergio Marchionne , had told him that bankruptcy remained likely .
Lewenza told Reuters that Fiat 's boss had warned him : " You know , Ken , a lot of things can happen in two days , but if I was a betting man , I would suggest Chrysler is going to fall into Chapter 11 . "
Majority ownership by a union would be a rarity for a major US corporation .
The UAW is one of the nation 's biggest and most powerful labour organisations - it represents 513,000 car workers and 570,000 retired employees .
Chrysler is owned by the private equity company Cerberus , which bought the carmaker from Germany 's Daimler two years ago .
Unable to stem losses , Cerberus has refused to sink any further money into Chrysler , prompting the US government to extend emergency loans of $ 4bn to the company at the beginning of the year .
Although Apple is touting the performance of its new iMac and Mac mini desktops , a new test shows that newer processors from Intel have had little impact on the computers ' true speed .
Benchmarks run by Primate Labs through its own Geekbench test suite have confirmed that any benefit from the updated Core 2 Duo processors comes purely through clock speed .
When clock speeds are identical between systems , such as with the new low - end 2.66 GHz iMac and a mid-range predecessor from last year , the difference in test scores becomes almost unnoticeable , coming down to 11 points in the case of the two all - in - ones .
Even the 2.93GHz iMac , which replaces a 2.8GHz model , has only a 189 - point advantage — or about a 5 percent speed difference that directly maps to the higher clock rate .
The largest relative gain in tests is for the Mac mini , which still only gains about 7 percent despite leaping two generations ahead in processor technology at 2GHz .
Primate is n't shocked by the results as it notes that both of the home computers ' performance is dictated by a processor architecture fundamentally identical to what has existed for the past two years .
This wo n't advance for the notebook - grade chips used by Apple until Intel brings its " Nehalem " architecture to the processors through the " Calpella " platform due this summer .
As such , the test developer warns that those solely interested in clock speed may want to avoid buying new .
Geekbench tests of the 2009 iMac and Mac mini updates , courtesy of Primate Labs .
" You might be better off getting a discontinued ( or refurbished ) previous - generation Mac rather than one of the new Mac models , " the company says .
However , Primate also acknowledges that Geekbench only tests CPU - and memory speed - intensive features such as floating point math , not video performance .
As a result , it 's possible for the systems to be much faster in 3D and other areas that depend as much or more on graphics processing , such as the Mac mini's 5X speed - up in moving from the Intel GMA 950 chipset to NVIDIA 's GeForce 9400 M .
The iMac 's GeForce 9400 M and GT120 are also claimed to accelerate performance over the Radeon HD 2400 and 2600 in older versions .

Credits :
Press Alt + F2 , enter : and in this configuration editor , navigate to " Apps -> Gnome Do -> Preferences -> Docky -> Utilities -> Dock Preferences " .
On the right side there are some properties with their corresponding values , including the position of the dock which you can change from " Bottom " to " Top " to move Docky to the upper part of the desktop .
Do n't try " left " or " right " as it will not work , but surely it 's a a matter of time before this will be incorporated into future versions .
Any changes made do not apply until you restart GNOME Do. Using gconf - editor you can also customize the zoom used when hovering the mouse over the icons :* Zoom Percent :
The percentage the icons will be magnified when the mouse hovers over them .
If set to 1 there will be no zoom , and 3 is quite exaggerated .
In my case , for example , I have a value of 1.5 for the zoom with the icons of 25 pixels . *
Zoom size : value in pixels of the distance over which the zoom effect will take place , lets you enter a value to define how many icons are affected by the expansion when the mouse is placed over one of them .
Update : I made a video with the " Genie " effect :
To achieve this Mac - like effect you do n't have to changes any Docky settings , but Compiz's .
Before we get started , make sure you have CCSM installed ( Compiz - Config Settings Manager ) .
If you do n't , : “ Genie ” is protected by patent ( of Mac ) and Compiz decided to disable the option to set “ max wave size ” of its “ Magic Lamp ” effect to 0 so that you can not mimic the “ Genie ” effect with it .
But we can still make it work , so read on .
Compiz lets you choose what animation is applied to each type of window action ( minimize , maximize , focus ... ) and how long the effect should take .
So to get the Genie minimize effect , open CompizConfig Settings Manager ( System > Prefereces ) , and under " Effects " check " Animations " .
Now click on " Animations " , go to " Minimize Animation " tab , double click the existing effect and replace it with " Magic Lamp " : For the next step , we 're going to need a Hex editor .
If you do n't have one installed : If using Compiz currently , use Alt +F2 and Type : so you do n't get any weird behavior until we finish with this .
Now , using ghex we need to edit a Compiz plugin library , so type this in a terminal : a. )
Go to Edit -> Find , click on the right hand boxb . )
Type : magic_lamp_max and click findc. ) Changefrom 3 to 0d. ) Save , Closea . )
Go to Edit -> Find , click on the right hand boxb . )
Type : magic_lamp_max and click findc. ) Changefrom 3 to 0d. ) Save , Closesudo gedit /usr / share/ compiz/animation.xmla. ) Go to Search -> Findb . )
Type : magic_lamp_max and click find , scroll down past the languagesc . )
Changefrom 3 to 0d. )
Save , CloseRestart , log out and back in , or Alt +F2 and Type : Compiz -- replace .
Any of these should work .
The next step is to use CompizConfig to change the Magic Lamp Settings like in the red rectangle in the image below ( System > Preferences > CompizConfig Settings Manager : Animations > the last tab called " Effects Settings " ) :
That 's it .

Alarms have been ringing for months about the risk that natural gas drilling poses to drinking water supplies , but recent reports of water contamination just a few hours away have prompted representatives from New York City to once again appeal to the state government to ban drilling inside the watershed serving 9 million city residents .
In a report to be issued tomorrow , Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer cites two dozen cases across the country where drilling pollution appears to pose a threat to public health .
Most of those cases were originally documented in a series of stories by ProPublica .
At issue are plans to begin widespread drilling of the Marcellus Shale , a deeply buried gas - rich layer that underlies the southern part of New York state and Pennsylvania .
The Marcellus is believed by some geologists to hold as much as 400 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas , equal to 20 years of the United States ' current total production , and its development could be worth $ 1 billion a year to New York 's economy -- money that is desperately needed to fill Albany 's gaping budget hole .
But much of the drilling would underlie the giant reservoirs and watershed that provides unfiltered drinking water to New York City .
City officials have already protested that any pollution in the watershed could jeopardize the city 's permit to provide unfiltered water and force it to build a $ 10 billion water treatment plant .
Now Stringer says he 's concerned the state -- which has not held any of its public hearings on the issue in New York City -- may drive forward regardless .
" We can't allow those pressures to push us into hasty decisions that come at the cost of New Yorkers ' health -- or the state 's long - term interests , " Stringer said in a statement issued with the report .
ProPublica 's investigations have shown that the state has done little to study the impacts drilling might have on water supplies and is unprepared to treat the copious amounts of waste water it produces .
Most concerning are a suite of chemicals used in the key process of hydraulic fracturing , where millions of gallons of fluids are pumped underground at extremely high pressure to break up the rock and release the gas .
The identities of some of the chemicals are protected trade information that has never been released to governments or to the public , but which are believed to be highly toxic .
Scientists have had difficulty measuring any threat because they can't trace the source of pollution without knowing the names of the chemicals used in fracturing .
It is also unclear whether any of the water treatment facilities in New York and Pennsylvania , the heart of the Marcellus deposit , are capable of cleaning the waste before it is released back into the region 's rivers and lakes .
A stockpile of documents about hundreds of Guantanamo Bay detainees , some written by the prisoners themselves , could be destroyed under a little - known provision of a federal court order the Bush administration obtained in 2004 .
For four years , records in the prisoners ' habeas corpus lawsuits challenging the legality of their detentions have been piling up in a secure federal facility in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington , Va .
Because much of the information is classified , the 750 or so attorneys representing the prisoners are required to do and store all their work on - site .
The provision is part of a broad order ( PDF ) issued at the very outset of the habeas cases -- at the last official count in January , 220 cases remained -- that set rules for how sensitive documents and attorney access should be handled .
It calls for the government to destroy all classified records given to , prepared by or kept by prisoners ' lawyers -- including originals and copies of writings , photographs , videotapes , computer files and voice recordings -- when the cases end .
Case files already fill 40 to 50 locked file cabinets , and restricted computer drives hold still more .
Documents include captives ' letters , drawings and poems , their attorneys ' notes from meetings with them , and reports of their interrogations , according to several lawyers who routinely access the files .
In some cases they describe the capture , transfer and investigation of prisoners , the identities of their accusers , and the government 's reasons for holding them .
The lawyers estimate that a quarter to a third of the records have been marked classified .
Although the lawyers are forbidden to reveal classified details , they could include prisoners ' personal accounts of abuses and interrogation procedures that have recently been described in secondhand reports .
These voices have been missing , the New York Timesnoted today , because the government refuses to disclose prisoners ' statements and their lawyers operate under a gag order .
The destruction provision does not appear to threaten court papers and government records , according to a September 2007 letter ( PDF ) from Allen Weinstein , then the chief archivist of the United States , to concerned open - government advocates .
The government is required to save those records .
But letters and notes between detainees and their lawyers containing classified information will be destroyed , he wrote , because letting the government keep them would endanger the prisoners ' attorney - client confidentiality , while letting detainees ' lawyers keep them would risk disclosure of sensitive information .
The concern that records might be destroyed seemed academic until recently .
The Bush administration had for years fought the captives ' right to bring habeas lawsuits , and the end of the cases seemed nowhere in sight .
But last July the Supreme Court said the cases could proceed .
The litigations , which had sputtered along since 2004 , gained steam .
More lawyers began booking hotel rooms near the Crystal City stronghold , and for the first time they 're having to line up to use the 20 or so government computers there .
When the Obama administration vowed to shut the Cuban prison by January 2010 , the lawyers ' sense of urgency increased .
Attorneys think that could mean a quick end to some cases , because prisoners may waive their rights to litigate further in exchange for release or transfer .
More than two dozen cases have already wrapped up at the trial - court level .
Dean Boyd , a Justice Department spokesman , told ProPublica , " We are not going to destroy any documents pursuant to [ the provision ] at this time , nor have we destroyed any . "
He refused to say whether a set of the prisoners ' records would be preserved or whether the administration would oppose detainees ' lawyers , who say they will soon ask the court to change the order .
David Remes , who represents 20 prisoners , said that " volumes of notes " taken by attorneys could be shredded if the court order is enforced .
He said he and colleagues have spent 80 to 100 hours meeting with each of 18 Yemeni clients they represent , and 30 to 40 hours with two other prisoners .
He estimated that 25 percent of the notes of these meetings include classified information .
He and several other attorneys complained that the government is over - classifying information and that records posing no threat to national security could be erased .
Classified status , which is meant to protect national security , is decided by executive - branch agencies including the military and intelligence offices .
The current standards are set out in a 2003 executive order -- said by open - government advocates and the media to have significantly expanded government secrecy -- issued by former President George W. Bush and so far unaltered by President Obama .
" There is no way that most of the stuff I 'm reading is classified , " said Marc Falkoff , an assistant professor at Northern Illinois University College of Law who began representing Guantanamo prisoners in 2004 .
" I would love to hand you a three - ring binder of all the documents the government has submitted as justification for keeping one of my clients in Guantanamo , and you decide for yourself whether the quality of this information is something you think justifies seven and a half years in prison . "
The government treats any material originating from the prisoners as " presumptively classified , " said Gitanjali Gutierrez , an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights who represents Mohammed al - Qahtani in his habeas suit .
Qahtani is the alleged 20th hijacker , whose military commission charges were dismissed after a top government official concluded he'd been tortured .
The Justice Department ’s Boyd confirmed that communications between prisoners and their lawyers are presumed classified , but said that the court has approved that approach and that there ’s a procedure for reviewing whether something is properly classified .
Even if some of the records legitimately need to be classified , Gutierrez said , they should be preserved to enable a future evaluation of this time .
" Historians are going to go berserk when they find this out . "
It 's not unusual for classified court records to be shredded , said Meredith Fuchs , general counsel of the National Security Archive , a nongovernmental organization that collects and publishes declassified documents .
But she said these cases have unusual historical importance , and she 's especially concerned that the court order requires destruction of originals and all copies of certain records .
When the terms of the 2004 order were first being debated , the prisoners ' lawyers were struggling just to meet with their clients and learn the basic details of what they were suspected of doing .
The survival of case records seemed a distant problem , said Remes , who as a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling led negotiations over litigation rules on behalf of the prisoners .
" At the time , we did n't know what we did n't know " about prisoner treatment , said Remes , who left Covington in July to found a human rights firm .
" Document destruction did n't really emerge as a problem until December 2007 , when it emerged that [ CIA ] tapes of waterboarding had been destroyed . "
How did a Norwegian electricity company become the biggest fiber - to - the - home provider in the country ?
By adopting an innovative business model , offering faster speeds at identical prices , and — most unusual of all — letting customers save a few hundred bucks by digging their own fiber trenches through their backyards .
We spoke to the company about the willingness that Norwegians have shown to get involved in laying their own infrastructure .
From power to broadband
Lyse did n't start out as a broadband company ; before 2002 , it was an electrical company that provided power to about 120,000 Norwegian homes .
But it was good at infrastructure building , and in 2002 it decided to jump into the Internet game by deploying fiber to the home .
That first year , it had only 500 customers ; now , it has more than 130,000 , making fiber even more important than electricity .
And that fiber does n't just supply Internet access .
Lyse offers the usual triple play bundle of voice , TV , and Internet , but it is also experimenting with tying home alarm systems and WiFi-equipped mobile phones into the fiber connection ( every install comes with a wireless router to make this simple to set up ) .
Users can pay for all these services — plus electrical service — on a single bill .
Lyse 's business model is different from companies like Verizon , which is currently rolling out fiber across its service area and then trying to sign up customers .
Lyse instead sends people into unserved areas , knocks on all the doors , and passes out information on the new fiber service .
Only when 60 percent of the people in an area sign up in advance for the service does Lyse start the actual fiber install .
Sixty percent sounds like a tough threshold , but the company says that it has been " very successful " so far by offering people far greater Internet speeds for the same price they are currently paying .
Lyse 's Altibox service offers 10 Mbps , 30 Mbps , or 50 M bps connections — all of them fully symmetrical ( upload and download speeds are identical ) .
In many areas , the uptake rate tops 80 percent , though competitors have boosted speeds and started deploying fiber of their own in an effort to retain customers .
Digging the trenches
In addition to entering an area with tremendous support already lined up , Lyse also does something innovative : it allows prospective customers to dig their own fiber trenches from the street to their homes .
In return , customers can save about $ 400 .
" They can arrange things just the way they want , " says Herbj ?rn Tjeltveit of Lyse , which makes for happier customers ; apparently , nothing angers a Norwegian more than having some faceless corporation tunnel through his flower garden .
The scheme also appeals to a Norwegian sense of thrift and do - it - yourselfness , says Tjeltveit , and he speculates that it has an additional benefit : customers who put some sweat equity into bringing their Internet connection from the street to the basement are more likely to be invested in the product and the company .
( The obvious downside is that passionate customers are more likely to complain whenever they see shortcomings in the product . )
So far , 80 percent of all customers have elected to do their own trenching , following the instructions and timeframe provided by the company .
A technical team still has to come out to pull the fiber from the street through the ducting to the house and then make the proper termination , but much of the tough manual labor is avoided .
A new fiber deployment can certainly be expensive , but Lyse has insulated itself from much of the risk .
The model works , too ; the company is now the main fiber - to - the - home provider in Norway , where it covers half the municipalities , and its customer churn rate has stayed quite low .
As for the future , Lyse can ramp up the speed dramatically once all that precious fiber is in the ground ; its partners are already testing both 100 Mbps and 1,000 Mbps connections .

Our country has finally woken up to the need for a green energy future .
Now we need to invest in the technology to make America the world leader in renewable energy .
Offshore wind power is one promising source of energy that is commercially viable today .
Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimate that the wind off America ’s coast could generate nearly 1,000 gigawatts — a little more than the current U.S. electrical capacity .
Ocean power , while not as developed , is every bit as promising .
California has more than 745 miles of coastline , and every mile has daily energy transfers in the form of waves , tides and current .
Estimates vary , but experts suggest that more than a quarter of California ’s energy demand could be met by technology that harnesses these forms of ocean energy .

A unique , weird restaurant has opened in Riga , Latvia named “ Hospitalis “ .
It is a must - see place if you like gore things .
The restaurant looks like a medicine cabinet , while you are treated as a patient and taken good care by the long - legged waitresses in nurses uniforms .
The food is served in flasks and operating - room ’s dishes and is n’t that cheap ( 7 and more lats per meal ) , but this is a bizarre experience that is worth breaking the bank .
Besides , the place is owned by local doctors , but unfortunately , the president of Latvia , who is also a doctor , declined his appearance at the opening once he realized how weird this place actually is .
in /tech / ruby
We ’re pretty obsessed with performance at Gilt Groupe .
You can get a taste for what we ’re dealing with , and how we ’re dealing with it , from our recent presentation at RailsConf .
One of the techniques we ’re using is to precompute what certain high - volume pages will look like at a given time in the future , and store the result as static HTML that we serve to the actual users at that time .
For ease of initial development , and because there ’s still a fair bit of business logic involved in determining which version of a particular page to serve , this was done inside our normal controller actions which look for a static file to serve , before falling back to generating it dynamically .
We ’re now running on Rails 2.3 and , of course , Rails Metal is the new hotness in 2.3 .
I spent the last couple days looking into how much improvement in static file serving we would see by moving it into the Metal layer .
Based on most of what I ’ve read , I expected we might shave off a couple milliseconds .
This expectation turned out to be dramatically wrong .
Metal components operate outside the realm of the usual Rails timing and logging components , so you do n’t get any internal measurements of page performance .
Instead , I fired up ab to measure the serving times externally .
What I found for the page I was benchmarking was that the Metal implementation took about 5 ms .
The old controller action took 170 ms .
But , wait ... the Rails logs were only reporting 8 ms for that action .
Something was fishy .
I started inserting timers at various places in the Rails stack , trying to figure out where the other 160 ms was going .
A little bit was routing logic and other miscellaneous overhead , but even setting a timer around the very entry points into the Rails request serving path , I was only seeing 15 ms being spent .
This was getting really puzzling , because at this point where a Rack response is returned to the web server , I expected things to look identical between Metal and ActionController .
However , looking more closely at the response objects I discovered the critical difference .
The Metal response returns an [ String ] , while the controller returned an ActionController : : Response .
I went into the Rails source and found the each method for ActionController : : Response .
Here it is :
def each ( &callback ) if @body.respond_to?( : call ) @writer = lambda { |x| callback.call(x ) } @body.call( self , self ) elsif @body.is_a ?( String ) @body.each_line( &callback ) else @body.each ( &callback ) end @writer = callback @block.call( self ) if @block end
The critical line is the case where the body is a String .
The code iterates over each line in the response .
Each line is written individually to the network socket .
In the case of the particular page I was looking at , that was 1300 writes .
Ouch .
To confirm this was the problem , I changed that line to
yield @body
With the whole body being sent in a single write , ab reported 15 ms per request , right in line with what I measured inside Rails .
1 line changed .
150 ms gained .
Not too bad .
This sort of performance pessimization we uncovered is particularly insidious because it ’s completely invisible to all the usual Rails monitoring tools .
It does n’t show up in your logged response time ; you wo n’t see it in NewRelic or TuneUp .
The only way you ’re going to find out about it is by running an external benchmarking tool .
Of course , this is always a good idea , but it ’s easy to forget to do it , because the tools that work inside the Rails ecosystem are so nice .
But the lesson here is , if you ’re working on performance optimizations , make sure to always get a second opinion .
So you ’d better not drive behind the car full of paint buckets , the doors can open by an accident and all that paint would paint you …

Get the Most Out of Volunteering With These 7 Tips
Do you volunteer ?
If so , congratulations !
Volunteerism is one of the most cherished of American values .
You are one of the nearly 77.4 million Americans who volunteered in recent years , turning in 6.9 billion hours valued at $ 167 billion .
Although volunteers make all of our lives better , you , the volunteer , can expect to be happier , healthier , and more likely to be employed than people who never volunteer .
Studies have shown that unemployed folks who volunteer enjoy 27 % better odds of finding a job .
And , if you want to work at a nonprofit , there 's no better way to show your mettle or get your foot in the door than volunteering .
It even looks good on your resume . ​
If you are looking for a way to volunteer or do more of it , here are some tips for finding that perfect volunteer spot .
After 6 years of waiting ( it was retired in 2002 ) , the Chevy Camaro SS is finally back !
The newly redesigned and relaunched car is arriving as you read this at dealerships across the country .
The base model 1SS starts at $ 30,995 and comes with cloth seats .
The 2SS model starts at $ 34,180 but you get some cool stuff like a set of four console - mounted gauges , a Boston Acoustics 245 - watt 9 - speaker system with USB jack , Bluetooth connectivity , OnStar with turn - by - turn directions and heated leather seats .
An RS appearance package is available for both LT and SS models that adds dark finished wheels , HID headlamp with integrated halo rings , revised tail - lamps and a spoiler for an additional $ 1,200 .
If you are wavering on setup for the 2010 Chevy Camaro , the best option by far is to go with the SS version equipped with the Tremec TR6060 six - speed manual gearbox .
You get the LS3 6.2L V8 engine from the base Corvette , which produces 426 hp at 5,9000 rpm with 420 lb - ft of torque .
The automatic is no slouch at 400 hp but it revs lower and has lower compression ratios .
The difference in fuel consumption is negligible with the manual getting 24 mpg on the highway verse 25 mph for the automatic .
So , for $ 995 less you might as well get the horsepower boost and the 2 x fun factor .
Both models come with a tuned suspension with stiffer springs and larger antiroll bars .
The manual 2010 Chevrolet Camaro SS is officially a sub5zero car with 0 to 60 mph in just under 5 seconds .
Another advantage of going with the 6 speed version is getting launch control , which is activated by selecting Competition mode on the StabiliTrak stability / traction control system .
The car comes equipped with Pirelli P - Zero summer tires that measure 245/45ZR20 up front and 275/40ZR20 in rear .
Stopping power is provided by 14 inch disc brakes with 4 piston Brembo calipers all around .
The Camaro Concept was first released in 2006 at the Detroit Auto Show .
The new 2010 Chevy Camaro , unlike most production vehicles , differs very little from concept form .
The 21 and 22 inch wheels have been reduced to 20s and the trim and paint subdued a bit but other than that , it is pretty close .
In 2007 , the Camaro Convertible Concept was unveiled at the 2007 North American Auto Show .
It is still unclear what the future is for this car but it appears as if the convertible will make its debut in 2010 .
Let ’s just hope that it follows this same trend , as the concept is a knockout .

It is a special occasion when you capture that one in a million shot , when you witness an amazing spectacle and have your video camera at your side .
Natural disasters and unexplained phenomena happen every day .
Still , there are few videos of these events as they occur .
With the expansion of personal video cameras in the last 20 years , sometimes we get a glimpse at something unusual and amazing .
YouTube makes it possible for us to view these videos from all around the world .
I have put together a collection of 10 amazing videos you can find on YouTube .
I am always on the lookout for new finds , so be sure to let me know of any other unbelievable youtube videos that are not mentioned here .
10 . Ride That Mega - Tsunami
Mike Parsons is one of the most amazing athletes on the planet .
He is a big wave surfer and one of the best at his profession .
He was made famous by this video which shows him riding a 65 ft. wave off the beaches of Jaws , Hawaii .
The footage was filmed from a helicopter and is 100 % real .
At the time , it was the biggest wave ever surfed , but Parson ’s broke his own record in 2008 at Cortes Bank .
He has numerous extreme surfing videos , including Billabong Odyssey , which I recommend .
9. Mythbusters Play with Helium and Sulfur Hexafluoride
This is an amazing and simple scientific experiment featured on the show Mythbusters .
Everyone knows what happens when someone inhales helium , their voice gets high and squeaky for a couple of seconds .
Adam Savage decides to see what happens when he inhales sulfur hexafluoride , which is much denser then air and has the exact opposite effect as helium .
Basically , it will make your voice sound deeper and like you are from the dark side .
This video demonstration is hilarious as Adam inhales both helium and sulfur hexafluoride .
8. Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961 Crashes
Ethiopian Flight 961 was hijacked on November 23 , 1996 by three Ethiopians who were seeking political asylum .
Flashing a fake bomb , the attackers demanded that the flight be re-routed to Australia .
The pilot explained that there was not enough fuel on board to make that trip , but the hijackers ignored him .
Secretly , the pilot headed towards the Comoro Islands , which are halfway between Madagascar and the African mainland .
The plane was nearly out of fuel as it approached the Island group .
The pilot was forced to ditch in the shallow waters of the Indian Ocean of the Coast of Grand Comoro Island .
As the plane landed , a coral reef hit the engine causing the plane to spin to the left and break apart .
Tragically , 125 of the 175 passengers and crew aboard were killed in the accident .
A tourist recorded this video later proclaiming that she thought the 767 aircraft was part of a surprise air show .
It might be the most clear and devastating plane crash video ever taken .
7. Route 168 Landslide in Japan
A landslide is a geological phenomenon that often plagues the country of Japan .
Around 75 % of land in Japan is forested , mountainous , and unsuitable for agriculture or residential use .
Because of these steep elevations , levels of rainfall , earthquakes , and soft ground , Japan is extremely landslide prone .
In Japan , many busy roads are built across mountain slopes .
Route 168 is a national highway connecting Shingu , Wakayama to Hirakata , Osaka .
Landslides like this often cause much heartache to the area .
Highways routinely become blocked and many people do n’t have an alternative way to get home .
This has caused city officials to adopt many landslide prevention and safety programs .
In the video you can see the slide abolish everything including the protective fence surrounding the highway .
6. The Ghost Car
One night the Garden City police were in pursuit of a car .
The vehicle was driving sporadically and would not pull over to the side of the road .
It seemed to be speeding up and slowing down at abnormally rapid levels .
It was all captured by the police officers ’ dash camera .
As the pursuit ensues , the car enters a fenced - in parking lot and the chase seems to be coming to an end .
Suddenly , the car turns directly toward the fence and seems to mysteriously drive right through it .
All that you can see is a faint view of the car ’s tail lights as it barrels into the fence .
There are no signs of a crash on the fence or behind it .
The cop cruiser comes to a stop and the car and its occupants are never located .
Supernatural or not , you decide .
5. Christian the Lion
In 1969 , John Rendall and Anthony Bourke purchased a baby lion from Harrods department store of London .
They raised Christian for a year and then ultimately had him released back into the wild .
After hearing that he had been successfully reintroduced to his natural habitat they took an expedition to Kenya to visit their lion .
It was one year later and the men were accompanied by a documentary film crew .
Many conservationists warned Rendall and Bourke that Christian would not remember them .
The reunion that ensues is touching to the heart .
Christian cautiously approaches , but then runs and jumps into the men ’s arms .
The documentary also shows two female lions and one foster cub that are friendly with the crew .
With many tragedies on this list I figured a light - hearted story of friendship would fit nicely .
4. Challenger Explosion
It was the United States ’ 25th official space shuttle launch and the Challenger ’s tenth trip into space .
It was a special mission and included American teacher Christa McAuliffe , who won a contest to participate in the NASA Teacher in Space Project .
The Challenger mission was delayed many times and finally was set to launch on January 28 , 1986 .
Sadly , 73 seconds into the launch the Challenger broke apart and exploded leading to the death of all seven crew members .
It was later determined that the accident occurred when a faulty O-ring seal on its right rocket booster failed .
The failure allowed a plume of flame to explode out of the rocket booster and damage the external fuel tank and attachment struts .
By that time it was too late to save the shuttle .
It was one of the most costly and tragic accidents in United States history and was all caught live on television .
3. Paul Potts sings Nessun Dorma
Paul is a British tenor who won the first series of Britain ’s Got Talent .
Before the competition he was a mobile phone salesman .
This video shows his rendition of “ Nessun Dorma , ” which immediately made him the front - runner on the show .
You can see Simon Cowell laughing at him before he begins and then enter into a state of shock as Potts performs .
This is one of the most popular videos in YouTube history .
Paul was featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show whose topic was YouTube videos .
After winning the competition Potts went on a massive world tour , consisting of 97 concerts in 85 cities spanning 23 countries .
Paul Potts first album One Chance was a multi-platinum masterpiece .
It reached the # 1 spot in 13 different countries around the world , proof positive that everyone can enjoy some good opera music .
A similar scenario took place with Susan Boyle .
2. 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami Hits
On December 26 , 2004 a 9.3 earthquake struck off the west coast of Sumatra , Indonesia .
What followed was a devastating tsunami that traveled all along most coasts of the Indian Ocean .
It was one of the most deadly natural disasters in recorded history and more than 225,000 people were killed in eleven different countries .
The hardest hit areas were Indonesia , Sri Lanka , India , and Thailand .
There were many sad and terrifying videos taken of the tsunami as it struck the mainland .
Beach resorts and tourist attractions were hit first in many instances .
This clip shows a couple of different videos of the tsunami as it reached land .
It truly gives you a sense of the deadly power of this disaster .
Watch as the ocean completely engulfs a large pool at a beach - front hotel .
1. The Battle at Kruger
You know that a YouTube video has become famous when it has its own Wikipedia page .
That is the case for the Battle at Kruger .
The video was shot in September of 2004 at a watering hole in Kruger National Park , located in South Africa .
It shows an epic real life battle between a pride of lions , a herd of Cape buffalo , and one or two crocodiles .
It all begins when the lions attack one of the baby buffalo and tackle it into the river .
While the lions are trying to finish off their meal , a crocodile grabs onto the buffalo and tries to take it .
The lions prevail and pull the buffalo from the water only to then be attacked by the herd .
It is truly an amazing clip that shows an animal ’s true struggle for survival .

Two artists attempted to create a performance art piece by establishing a Wikipedia entry entitled " Wikipedia Art , " which could then be freely edited and " transformed " by anyone choosing to do so .
The page lasted a mere 15 hours before being summarily deleted by Wikipedia editors and admins .
Now , the pair 's archive and continuing discussion of the project is being threatened by the Wikimedia Foundation 's legal counsel , which has effectively threatened to pursue legal action against the artists for trademark infringement .
" Wikipedia Art is an art intervention which explicitly invites performative utterances in order to change the work itself , " reads the archive of the original Wikipedia post made by artists Scott Kildall and Nathaniel Stern .
" The ongoing composition and performance of Wikipedia Art is intended to point to the " invisible authors and authorities " of Wikipedia , and by extension the Internet , as well as the site 's extant criticisms : bias , consensus over credentials , reliability and accuracy , vandalism , etc . "
The pair meant for the article to be a functional critique of Wikipedia as an information source , using Wikipedia as the " venue " and its users as participants in the " performance . "
Whatever your opinions are about what constitutes art and what does n't , it did n't meet Wikipedia 's guidelines for an encyclopedic article , and ultimately the editors decided it should be deleted .
Once the article had been marked " AfD " — or Article for Deletion — there was substantial discussion on Wikipedia , which continued on various blogs after the deletion took place .
That is precisely what Kildall and Stern were hoping to achieve , so the duo created wikipediaart.org to track the discussion and archive the various forms the page took in the 15 hours it was live on Wikipedia .
The site went live February 16 but , on March 23 , Kildall recieved a letter from Douglas Isenberg , counsel for Wikimedia Foundation .
Isenberg wrote that he had been asked to investigate whether the use of the word " wikipedia " violated a number of statutes , including the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act , the Trademark Act , the Federal Trademark Dilution Act , as well as " state and common law trademark and unfair competition statutes . "
Isenberg 's letter requested that the wikipediaart.org domain be transferred to Wikimedia , but noted the group had no intent " to interfere in any way with your right to create and maintain an editable art project under another name . "
Kildall and Stern 's Wikipedia
Art is in the form of Wikipedia article .
How meta .
Kildall and Stern sought the advice of counsel and James Martin sent a reply to Isenberg on the pair 's behalf , noting that the wikimediaart.org site did not claim to be connected with or endorsed by Wikipedia in any way .
He also noted that the site was not being used for any commercial purpose whatsoever .
" We are disappointed by Wikimedia 's efforts to suppress free speech by threatening legal action , " wrote Martin .
" We have concluded that my client has not violated any of Wikimedia 's legal rights . "
Isenberg responded by with what essentially reads as a threat to take the case to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy of the World Intellectual Property Organization .
Paul Levy of the Public Citizen Litigation Group stepped in , on a pro bono basis , on behalf of the artists .
Levy , who has worked to defend fair use of trademark names in the past , strongly opposed Wikimedia Foundation 's attempt to skirt US law — which precedent suggests would protect the site on free speech and fair use grounds — by filing a UDRP claim with WIPO .
" Even if you end up deciding ... to file a UDRP claim , " Levy wrote in an e-mail to Wikimedia counsel Mike Godwin , " I have indicated that we will seek a declaratory judgment of non-infringement because we are not willing to allow this dispute to be resolved by reference to private law instead of the law of the United States that governs both your client and mine . "
Mike Godwin , lead counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation , insists that no threat was made to pursue legal action , and that Wikimedia Foundation simply wanted the artists to post a disclaimer .
" The possibility of a disclaimer is inherent in the suggestion that we resolve our differences amicably , " Goodwin told Ars via e-mail .
" A disclaimer is one way of doing this . "
However , none of Isenberg 's correspondence mentions a disclaimer as a possible resolution .
Godwin went on to say that the Wikimedia Foundation is not pursuing any kind of lawsuit against Kildall and Stern .
" We 're not and we do n't indicate in the Isenberg correspondence that we are . "
However , Isenberg 's second correspondence contains a fairly obvious threat to pursue legal action with the WIPO .
" I think it would be helpful to draw your attention to a recent domain name dispute between Wikimedia and the registrant of the domain name visualwikipedia.com , " Isenberg wrote in response to Martin 's letter on behalf of Kildall .
" The registrant of that domain name refused to cooperate with Wikimedia , after which Wikimedia filed a complaint pursuant to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy ( " UDRP " ) , resulting in a published decision ordering the domain name transferred to Wikimedia . "
There 's certainly an irony to the situation : a non-profit foundation 's online knowledge repository , which largely exists because of free speech and fair use , is suggesting the threat of legal action that could stifle free speech and fair use .
That irony , however , seems lost on the Wikimedia Foundation .
Like previous legal action against Wikipedia itself , the threats seem to draw attention to the Wikipedia Art site and make Wikimedia Foundation look bad , playing right into Kildall and Stern 's project .
Hopefully Wikimedia Foundation will see the folly in pursuing this action and , instead , focus on its core mission : to provide a free , online encyclopedia of " notable " human knowledge .

LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) -- Steven Rattner , the leader of the Obama administration 's auto task force , was one of the executives involved with payments under scrutiny in a probe of an alleged kickback scheme at New York state 's pension fund , The Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday , citing a person familiar with the matter .
A Securities and Exchange Commission complaint says a " senior executive " of Rattner 's investment firm met with a politically connected consultant about a finder 's fee , the report said .
The firm subsequently received an investment from the state pension fund , then paid a $ 1.1 million fee , it cited the complaint as saying .
THE killing of James Bulger , who was two , by a pair of ten - year - old boys in 1993 became one of the most infamous crimes in recent British history .
The CCTV image of the toddler being led to his death from a Liverpool shopping centre came to symbolise a complex of anxieties over crime and social breakdown , as Tony Blair , then shadow home secretary , understood .
There are echoes of that horror in the alleged attempted murder in South Yorkshire of two more small boys by two brothers , aged ten and 11 .
The assault is said to have taken place on scrub land near a former mining village , where the alleged perpetrators were being fostered .
The victims were reportedly attacked with knives and bricks and burned with cigarettes .
Their biological mother is said to have disavowed responsibility for them .
Thankfully , in this case , the victims survived .
But the outrage over it will nevertheless be intense .
And , in a sense , the country 's shocked fascination with heinous crimes committed by children is understandable , because they are rare and seem so outlandish .
In another way , though , it is odd , even irrational .
Most of the time , children are expected and allowed to be more unruly and noisier than adults ; society implicitly agrees that they are not fully developed moral actors , not responsible for their behaviour in the way that adults are held to be .
Yet when they commit awful crimes , a reverse view of childhood seems to take over in some quarters : that any child who could so depart from the ideal of innocent childhood and behave in such a way must be monstrously evil .
This Manichean way of thinking about crime by children can obscure the real lessons of these cases .
It has the effect of partially exonerating the assorted adults whose job it was to care for the accused children , from some of whom , presumably , they learned that violence is acceptable .
First , the back story .
The hint of scandal was first dropped Sunday , May 3 , in a Fort Worth Star Telegram article quoting OpenSecrets.org 's Sheila Krumholz :
As an example of a misleading Web site , she cites www.Specterforthecure.com.
It appears to be a fundraising site for a reform movement to help Sen. Arlen Specter , D - Pa. , fund programs that will seek cures for major diseases and illnesses .
Actually , it ’s a fundraising arm for the re-election of Specter , who last week switched parties from Republican to Democratic .
Unfortunately , " Watchdog " reporter Dave Lieber completely buried the lead in paragraph 23 , potentially dooming it to obscurity .
Until ... the same publication resurrected the item the next day and put it in a headline , " Arlen Specter and his confusing web site . "
This story elevates some important details :
A Specter spokeswoman told The Watchdog : " Specterforthecure.com is explicit throughout — including the name itself — that the site raises money for a candidate . "
The same morning [ Dave Lieber 's original ] column ran , Specter was on CBS ' Face The Nation to talk about his recent defection to the Democrats .
Specter took a moment to mention SpecterForTheCure.com .
See if you can figure out what the site 's purpose is from his remarks : " And one of the items that I ’m working on , Bob , is funding for medical research .
I ’ve been the spear carrier to increase medical research .
And I ’ve even established a Web site , Specterforthecure.com , to try to get people to put more pressure on Congress to join me in getting more funding . "

Here is a screenshot of SpecterForTheCure.com , taken yesterday ( Friday , May 8 ) at about 5 pm EST .
If your mother or grandmother heard Arlen Specter on CBS and went to this site , what would they think they were contributing to ?
Fortunately , a few reporters and bloggers picked up on this scandal .
Specifically : Politico's Manu Raju Thursday , May 6 , at 5:46 pm . Blogger SenateGuru Thursday at 10:34 pm . TPM's Brian Beutler Friday at 9:12 am .
USA Today 's Congress Team Friday at 1:47 pm .
And yet another Specter campaign official defended the site :
Specter 's campaign manager , Christopher Nicholas , told Politico that no one could be " genuinely confused about where contributions to this website go . "
If that 's true , how does the Specter campaign explain to all the people who have already given money on this site -- and the few reporters who did their job and reported on this site -- this :
( Screenshot taken 1 am EST Saturday , May 9 .
Clean version here . )
If you are a reporter reading this , here 's a message for you :
This is n't just a " cute Internet story " or " interesting catch " you read before moving to the next tab you have open on your screen .
This is a scandal involving someone at the center of national news .
It 's your job to cover Cancergate -- at least as much as the media covered " Lipstickgate , " and likely more .
Arlen Specter went on one of the Sunday shows that mold political conventional wisdom and lied to Americans .
Any cancer survivor or concerned citizen who went to that site to " put more pressure on Congress " to fund cancer research got defrauded by Specter .
If you are a regular citizen , what are you going to do about this ?
One productive thing you could do is email this post to 3 political reporters right now .
Their emails are often right in their articles .
Posting it on Twitter and Facebook , sending to your friends in Pennsylvania , and Digg'ing it would also be good .
If you are a Democrat or progressive , and you have n't yet partaken in the grassroots Straw Poll launched by national and Pennsylvania progressives on the issue of whether Dems want Specter representing them on the ballot in 2010 , consider weighing in here -- voting ends Monday :
Cross-posted at OpenLeft at 6:30 am .
Follow me on Twitter .
UPDATE 9:50 am : And the award for " First Journalist To Report On Today 's Website Update News " goes to ... Ben Smith , of Politico .
Forthcoming awards : " First reporter to ask Specter if he 'll return the money made before this change " and " First reporter to use Cancergate in a story . "
UPDATE 3:27 pm : Politico's Manu Raju gets a statement from Specter 's campaign manager :
Nicholas said Saturday that the changes were " just normal fine tuning as we roll out and enhance the web site . "
Really ?
Will Specter refund the money to people who gave before this site change ?

What is the best gun ?
What gun should I buy ?
Apply for a concealed carry permit .
This can take months .
Buy a Kel - Tec PF - 9 ( $ 300 ) for concealed carry .
Buy a rifle , some magazines , and ammo : AK - 47 ( $ 390 , semi-auto ) : more maneuverability and capacity , or
FAL ( $ 1200 ) : more power and range Practice .
IDPA type matches are good .
Why do you want a gun ?
Self Defense : Concealed Carry
If you are in a state that requires it , apply for a carry permit now .
They can take months to process .
If you are only going to own one gun , this is probably a good place to start , because it is within reach is always far more valuable than what you have left behind .
I HATE double action triggers ( DAO , SA / DA , Glock ) , which are the type found in most hand guns .
They have a much harder and longer trigger pull , for people who are n't capable of keeping their finger off the trigger until ready to fire , or remember to flip the safety off to shoot .
Single action triggers ( as in the 1911 ) are much better in every way , as long as you can keep your finger off the trigger , and practice flipping the safety off while drawing .
I sleep with my 1911 in my hand .
I have never had an Accidental Discharge .

Kimber 1911 Compact , .45ACP , $ 710
" The penetration of the .45 ACP 230 - grain FMJ bullet is 26 " in ballistic gelatin " - http://www.sightm1911.com/Care/45acp.htm
So use Jacketed Hollow Point ammo , because people are less than 26 " thick .
Mine is overly susceptible to limp - wristing .
The 1911 was named after the year in which it was adopted as the standard U.S. military sidearm .
It is a thoroughly tested and proven design , and fires the very substantial .45 ACP round .
It also happens to be rather slim , and Compact ( 4 " barrel ) or Ultra - Compact ( 3 " barrel ) models can be very convenient to wear .
It is also a single - action , which means that its trigger pull is much more shorter and lighter , which translates to increased accuracy .
The 3 largest manufacturers of 1911s are Kimber , Springfield Armory , and Colt .
I 've heard nothing good about Colt lately , and Kimber has the most modern machining processes .

Kel - Tec PF - 9 , 9 mm , $ 300 A very compact gun shooting the decent 9 mm , for a great price .
Kicks more than an average 9 mm due to its light weight .

Kicks more than an average 9 mm due to its light weight .
Kel - Tec P32 , .32ACP , $ 320 While the Kel - Tec P32 only fires the small .32ACP cartridge , it is extremely concealable .
You will basically never have an excuse not to wear it .
This makes it a " deep concealment " gun .
You can also get a clip that attaches to the frame so you can wear it clipped inside the top of your pants , which looks like it 's a folding knife .
The extreme compactness of this gun is , in my opinion , the best excuse for a double - action trigger .
Gelatin penetration tests with the P - 32 and a bunch of different ammo .
Basically : Use FMJ .
Because JHP has insufficient penetration .
FMJ gives you 14 - 15 " depth of penetration , which is good .
Smith & Wesson Model 60 , $ 560
Although the .38 was found ineffective similarly to the 9mm in the above mentioned FBI shootout .
And the .357 has a lot of kick for such a small gun ( which will make you anticipate / flinch , which will decrease your accuracy - practice ) .
Any small frame 5 round .357 or .38 really .
Fine rounds , and tiny .
A shrouded hammer design makes more sense for concealment , but I cannot stand the way they look .

" Blessed are they who , in the face of death , think only about the front sight . "
Liberty
If purchasing a rifle for indoor use , consider shorter barreled options ( carbines ) for maneuverability .
This may reduce long range potential .
Do not buy a Century Arms ( based ) rifle , they are crap .
They make copies of ( and receivers for ) several of the below rifles ( FAL , CETME , M14 , AK - 47 ) .
I strongly recommend hunting with these in places where it is legal , for practice .
Do n't pull the trigger until you 're confident the first round will kill .
Main Battle Rifles Short : Buy a ( metric ) FAL .
If you want a semi-automatic rifle with a more powerful round than the AK / AR / M16 , this is the section .
Full power rifle cartridge .
Effective range of about 500 yards .
Gun and ammunition are both larger and heavier than an assault rifle .
Ammunition : 7.62x51 mm NATO / .308 Winchester ( more damage , more bulk and weight to carry )
20 round detachable magazines .
After WWII , Germany tried to license the FAL from FN and failed FAL , 7.62x51 mm NATO / .308 , $ 1200 ( 2009 - 10 - 28 ) , 10.4 lbs + mag
The last NATO standard rifle developed under the mistaken belief that a soldier could be expected to be emotionally capable of firing an aimed shot at a human being .
Reliable .
Accurate for a semi-auto .
Good range .
Substantial cartridge .
This is the rifle the US military should have adopted instead of the M14 , along with most of NATO , before the ( current ) M16 .
I specifically recommend the
Compared to the M16 / AR - 15 , which is the current standard rifle for the U.S. and NATO military , the FAL : + Is more reliable . +

I specifically recommend the Austrian FAL Carbine from DSArms for quality and price .
The longest barrel length is not the most accurate due to " barrel whip " .
If you want a scope , you 'll need a scope rail , which does not need to be removed for cleaning .
Compared to the M16 / AR - 15 , which is the current standard rifle for the U.S. and NATO military , the FAL :
There are " metric " FALs and " inch " abominations , with parts incompatibility and minor differences .
Metric is probably the safe bet .
It looks like I will be putting a 1 - 4 x scope on mine , using Leupold quick release low rings .
10,000 round FAL torture test PTR 91 , 7.62x51 mm NATO / .308 , $ 1,200 Buy a FAL instead .
No last round bolt hold open .
Charging handle too far forward for speedy use .
Even w / paddle mag release , slow mag changes .
Difficult to clean thoroughly .
Heavy as hell .
Poor cheekweld .
- FYRARMS
Also , brass is not reloadable due to mangling by the fluted chamber .
Other than that , it is a copy of the HK91 , possibly better than the original , a proven battle rifle .
CETME , 7.62x51 mm NATO / .308 , $ 520 used ( 2009 - 10 - 28 ) The Spanish design HK started with when creating the G3/HK91 .
A good price compromise .
Make sure you do n't get one chambered for 7.62x51 mm CETME , which can crack if you use .308 Win. / 7.62NATO in them .
Its fluted chamber damages brass to the extent the brass is not reloadable .
Because it uses roller delayed blowback instead of gas operation , it is possible to float the barrel for increased accuracy .
M14 / Springfield M1A , 7.62x51 mm NATO / .308 , $ 1,500 I am aware of precisely two optics mounts for the M14 that are worth a damn : the ~ $ 150 Leatherwood mount , and the ~ $ 300 Sadlak Industries mount .
The M14 was the standard U.S. infantry issue Main Battle Rifle before the M16 .
The Springfield M1A is a copy of it .
Comparisons between this an the FAL can be heated .
Optics rail options are either partial , not covering the receiver , or require removing a couple bolts to field strip the rifle .
Obviously irrelevant if you will only use iron sights .
Kel Tec RFB , 7.62x51 mm NATO / .308 , $ 1,345 Bull - pup .
Ways in which it has been negatively compared to any detachable magazine .308 :
It has not been tested in war .
Fewer have been made from which you can cannibalize parts .
That 's a damn short list .
That 's a damn short list .
AR - 10 , 7.62x51 mm NATO / .308 , $ 1400 Never actually issued as a standard infantry rifle .
This is a larger caliber version of the AR - 15 .
There are plenty of optics mounting options , particularly for flat - top rifles .

Direct Impingement sucks .

After WWII , Germany tried to license the FAL from FN and failed * .
They then licensed the CETME from Spain and ( HK ) developed it into the G3 .
The HK91 is a semi-auto version of the G3 .
The PTR 91 is a copy of the HK91 using HK tooling , which may be of better quality than the original .
It is a shame that we do not know what would have resulted if HK had started with the FAL instead of the CETME .
Assault Rifles , or semi-automatic versions thereof Short : Buy an AK - 47 .
Intermediate cartridge ( between rifle and handgun ) .
Effective range of about 215 yards .
Gun and ammunition are both smaller and lighter than a battle rifle .
Ammunition : 7.62x39 mm or 5.56 mm NATO ( less damage , but it 's easier to carry more ) .
30 round detachable magazines .
These are the best examples of military rifles designed to fire larger numbers of intermediate ( smaller than most rifles , larger than handgun ) cartridges as a result of research which has shown that " ... very few troops are mentally prepared to direct aimed fire at the enemy , preferring instead to spray bullets in the general direction of the enemy . "
- M16 History
An assault rifle is , by definition , fully automatic .
I feel the additional price and paperwork are not worth the additional ability to waste ammunition .
These models are semi-automatic .
AK - 47 , 7.62x39 , $ 390 ( 2009 - 10 - 28 )
Nothing beats the reliability of the AK - 47 .
It is one of the most common firearms in the world .
It is stereotyped as inaccurate , but this is less true in current models .
30 round detachable magazines are commonly available , and the ammunition is cheap , roughly 25 cents per round in 1,000 round cases .
Although milled receivers are more accurate by force of inertia , I would go with a stamped receiver for reduced weight .
I think the biggest flaw of the AK may be the short sight radius , reducing accuracy .
This might be an ideal solution .
UltiMAK is a popular optics mount .
The best optic for this may be the Aimpoint Micro T - 1. 1 x ( unmagnified ) reflex or holographic sights are definitely well suited to the AK , and this one has a battery life of " over 5 years " continuous on , so just leave it on .
Bushmaster AR - 15 , 5.56 mm NATO , $ 900 , 9.78 lbs
U.S. uses bullets ill - suited for new ways of war .
I would not buy an AR without a full length 20 " barrel due to reduced effectiveness with short barrels as discussed in the article above .
This significantly reduces the AR 's utility .
The semi-automatic version of the M16 Assault Rifle ( current U.S. military issue ) .
It is more accurate than the AK - 47 , but is stereotyped as very unreliable and prone to jamming , but like the AK , modern versions are less prone to the old stereotypical problems .
The two biggest names in ARs are Armalite and Colt , but the equivalents from Bushmaster tend to be less expensive .
30 round detachable magazines are commonly available .
Many versions of the AR are available .
" Match " versions are intended to be as accurate as possible for sport , without regard to the effects on reliability .
For this reason I would suggest a standard Direct Impingement sucks .

I do n't mind the U.S. military adopting this minuscule cartridge if soldiers cannot be expected to aim at humans , but the direct impingement system bothers me .
Best Price SKS , 7.62x39 , $ 200 used
10 round NON - DETACHABLE magazine fed by stripper - clips .
Yes this one actually uses " clips " .
This is the predecessor to the AK - 47 , and fires the same ammunition .
If you want a reliable , war tested combat rifle for the best price , this is a good place to look .10 round NON - DETACHABLE magazine fed by stripper - clips .
Yes this one actually uses " clips " .
This is the predecessor to the AK - 47 , and fires the same ammunition .
Sniping or Deer Hunting A long range variation on the previous theme .
A very precise bolt action rifle with a good scope .
I suggest .308 Winchester caliber , because it is effective and common - also known as 7.62 mm NATO , it is one of the major ammunition types used by the U.S. military .
Effective range of about 800 yards .
It is often recommended that you spend about as much money on your scope as you do on the rifle .
Leupold makes good scopes .
I recommend a 10 x fixed power scope with a mil - dot reticle for range estimation .
Look around for a local shooting range over 300 yards .
If they are hard to come by , consider the possibility that you will never have a practical need to make a shot over 300 yards , and consider giving up a little accuracy for capacity and rate of fire , and getting a battle rifle instead .
With a .308 and a flat scope base , your maximum range will be limited by your scope adjustment range .
To fix this , and for their quality , I recommend a Badger Ordnance 20MOA canted scope base and rings .
Savage Arms ( under $ 300 ) is probably a good alternative brand if you do n't want to pay for Remington .
Do not get .30 - 06 , it is the same as the more common .308 Winchester with a shorter case due to modern powders .
Longer range :
To take .308 Winchester up to 1,000 yards , you 'll need a canted scope base , and 175 grain bullets - the limit is the point at which it drops back down through the sound barrier .
If your need to go farther justifies increased cost , and recoil , and its corresponding increased time between shots , .300 Winchester Magnum is good , and then .338 Lapua above that .
Remington 700P , $ 870 Previously known as the Remington Police Sniper Special - it is one of the most accurate out of the box rifles in a reasonable price range .
It is known to do less than 1 " diameter groups at 100 yards without modification .
Remington 700 SPS Varmint , $ 540 Largely the same as the 700P with a cheap stock .
Anti-Material
No anti-material rifle has ever been used in a crime .
This stuff will break trucks at a mile .
. 50 BMG is the standard round .
The rifles are really big .
Bolt - actions are , once again , most accurate .
You 'll want a rugged scope for it , as the recoil is extreme .
The .416 Barret round was designed in 2005 as a replacement for the .50 BMG in rifles .
The .50 BMG was never designed for long range accuracy , it was designed for the Browning Machine Gun .
Serbu .50 BFG , .50 BMG , $ 2200 The Serbu .50BFG is an accurate , well designed , attractive bolt - action .50 BMG rifle .
I believe it is the least expensive .50 BMG rifle .
I 'd love one .
Target Shooting - Pistol
It is very useful to have a .22LR pistol for target practice , since the ammunition is extremely cheap .
Select a semi-auto or revolver to match the most common handgun (s ) you use for other purposes .
Sig Trailside Target , .22LR , $ 600 Designed by a major company known to make exceptional competition .22LR pistols to be sold in the more common plinker price range , it has exceptional accuracy for its price .
Browning Buckmark , .22LR , $ 400 Another common quality choice .
Ruger Mark II , .22LR , $ 300 Probably the most common choice , but a pain to clean and assemble .
Henry AR - 7
This is an extremely packable .22LR rifle , if you 'd like something with a little more utility .

Home Defense Pick something from the Liberty section .
At short ranges , and not against body armor , nothing * is more devastating than 12 gauge 00 buckshot .
If you can guarantee these two conditions , and that you will need no more than 9 shots , go with a shotgun .
Since I cannot , I prefer an AK - 47 or an AR - 15 . (*
There are obviously impractical exceptions .
10 gauge shotgun. 40 mm grenade launcher . ) (*
There are obviously impractical exceptions .
10 gauge shotgun. 40 mm grenade launcher . )
An intermediate cartridge rifle carries 30 rounds , can quickly be reloaded , a carbine ( short barrel ) is at least as maneuverable indoors as a shotgun , and is far more versatile due to greatly extended effective range .
Shotguns generally max out at 8+1 rounds .
Reloading is slow .
" ... the maximum effective range on a man size target with the 12ga buckshot is 18yds . " - Shotgun Ammunition Assessment ( mirror ) .
If you use a shotgun , use 00 buckshot .
What wo n't go through walls wo n't drop badguys .
Pump shotguns have the nice advantage that you can quickly load any type of ammo you want for your next shot .
Receiver saddles are a good way to carry more .
The best penetration I 've been able to find is Brenneke Special Forces Short Magnum , and Green Lightning Heavy Field Short Magnum , which appear to be identical .
The most interesting apparently unavailable shotgun rounds are Sauvestre slugs .
Glock 9 mm with a 33 round magazine
If you have nothing but paper walls between you and your closest neighbors , then you will probably want to consider over - penetration .
In this case I would probably go with an extremely high capacity handgun with hollow points , like a Glock 9 mm with a pair of 33 round magazines .
If it 's a compact , that Glock with its standard magazine can double for concealed carry .
A very versatile option , but useless against an attacker 's soft body armor Saiga - 12 , AK pattern 12 gauge shotgun
If you 're going to get a shotgun , the Saiga - 12 AK pattern 12 gauge with a couple 10 round detachable box magazines is a nice option .
There are also 20 round drum magazines for $ 100 .
There can be problems with the top round in a magazine pressing against a closed bolt deforming over time , resulting in feeding problems , at least with some ammunition .
You can use a notched safety to hold the bolt back , or possibly find less squishy cartridges .
Mossberg 590 model # 50665 , 8 round magazine , $ 400
There is also the military version , the 590A1 , with a heavier barrel , aluminum trigger guard and safety , but it is not compatible with the barrel shroud .
Mossberg 590 , with an 8 round magazine , the highest capacity you 'll find in a pump .
There is also the military version , the 590A1 , with a heavier barrel , aluminum trigger guard and safety , but it is not compatible with the barrel shroud .
Hunting Shotgun Note Some places do not allow you to hunt with any firearm other than a shotgun .
If this is the case for you , you might want to purchase a shotgun with a pair of interchangeable barrels , and add a magazine extension .
Remington ( 870 ) makes factory extension tubes , and the barrels are easy to swap .
Mossberg ( 500 ) makes interchangeable barrel sets but no mag extension are available to improve their 4+1 capacity .
A long ( ~ 26 -28 " ) barrel with a choke is needed for hunting for tighter shot groups and longer range .
A short ( 18 - 20 " ) barrel with no choke ( aka cylinder choke ) is much more optimal for home defense due to greater maneuverability and wider shot groups .
The Remington 870 model 25571 plus a 3 round 20 " barrel mag extension could be optimal .
It includes 20 " ( no choke ) and 28 " ( choke ) barrels .
Extension improves capacity from 4+1 to 7+1 .
Home Defense - Handgun Compared to an intermediate cartridge rifle or shotgun , handguns have an advantage in maneuverability and concealability .
As mentioned above , there are some with 33 round magazines .
Para - Ordnance P14.45 , .45ACP , $ 810 The Para - Ordnance P14.45 is a variant of the 1911 .
It uses the formidable .45ACP cartridge , and has a capacity of 14+1 rounds .
Smith & Wesson Model 627 , .357 , $ 1000 I cannot recommend a revolver for home defense .
Even the 8 round .357s have insufficient capacity , and even with reloaders and practice I would expect them to take too long to reload , compared to a high capacity semi-auto .
You would be amazed how quickly six rounds goes away under pressure .
If you 're going to get a revolver for home defense , go with an 8 round .357 , get reloaders , and practice reloading .
. 44 magnum recoil takes too long to re-acquire your target , and the additional power is of no benefit ( except the extremely rare case of some body armor ) .
.357 Magnum has plenty excessive over - penetration and recoil .
Entertainment Desert Eagle .50 , .50 AE , $ 1210
It is not the best carry gun .
It is far to big to reasonably carry .
It holds the most rounds in .357 , only 9 .
The Para - Ordnance P14 holds 55 % more , of similarly powerful rounds .
In .44 mag . it holds 8 . In .50 AE it only holds 7 . .357 is appropriate to take out an attacker , the rest are overkill , and just less magazine capacity .
It is not the best home defense gun .
Its ammunition is all significantly less effective at indoor ranges against attackers than a 12 ga shotgun , including less area of effect .
It is not the best gun for use in multiple areas , because it 's not well suited to any of them .
For this , go look in the self or home defense sections .
So what is it ?
A hell of a conversation piece .
It 's the biggest pistol you can get .
There are reasons it 's popular in movies .
If you do get one , go all the way and get it chambered in .50 AE .
Oh yeah , and it has a fascinating gas blowback system , more common in rifles .
This had to be listed , primarily to say what it is not .
It is not the best of anything practical ( in .357 magnum , .44 magnum , or .50 action express ) .
It is not the best carry gun .
It is far to big to reasonably carry .
It holds the most rounds in .357 , only 9 .

Materials researchers say rebooting soon may be a thing of the past
The ferroelectric materials found in today's " smart cards " used in subway , ATM and fuel cards soon may eliminate the time - consuming booting and rebooting of computer operating systems by providing an " instant - on " capability as well as preventing losses from power outages .
Researchers supported by a National Science Foundation ( NSF ) nanoscale interdisciplinary research team award and three Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers at Cornell University , Penn State University and Northwestern University recently added ferroelectric capability to material used in common computer transistors , a feat scientists tried to achieve for more than half a century .
They reported their findings in the April 17 journal Science .
Ferroelectric materials provide low - power , high - efficiency electronic memory .
Smart cards use the technology to instantly reveal and update stored information when waved before a reader .
A computer with this capability could instantly provide information and other data to the user .
Researchers led by Cornell University materials scientist Darrell Schlom took strontium titanate , a normally non-ferroelectric variant of the ferroelectric material used in smart cards , and deposited it on silicon -- the principal component of most semiconductors and integrated circuits -- in such a way that the silicon squeezed it into a ferroelectric state .
" It 's great to see fundamental research on ordered layering of materials , or epitaxial growth , under strained conditions pay off in such a practical manner , particularly as it relates to ultra- thin ferroelectrics " said Lynnette Madsen , the NSF program director responsible for the Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team award .
The result could pave the way for a next - generation of memory devices that are lower power , higher speed and more convenient to use .
For everyday computer users , it could mean no more waiting for the operating system to come online or to access memory slowly from the hard drive .
" Several hybrid transistors have been proposed specifically with ferroelectrics in mind , " said Schlom .
" By creating a ferroelectric directly on silicon , we are bringing this possibility closer to realization . "
More research is needed to achieve a ferroelectric transistor that would make " instant on " computing a reality , but having the materials in direct contact , free of intervening reaction layers , is an important step .

Overpopulation – the human plague
“ Instead of controlling the environment for the benefit of the population , maybe we should control the population to ensure the survival of our environment . ” – Sir David Attenborough , The Life of Mammals
Populate and perish !
Overpopulation has become a topic of great concern to me , but one that seems taboo in our economic - growth - obsessed society ( and one that usually seems to invoke indignant reactions ) .
I do n’t consider it an exaggeration to regard overpopulation as the single greatest threat to humanity ’s existence and environment today – most ailments afflicting society can be traced back to too many people competing for dwindling resources .
The world ’s human population reached approximately 6.5 billion in 2006 , 6.72 billion in November 2008 ( only 7 years earlier , in 1999 , it reached 6 billion ) , and continues to grow alarmingly – in 2011 it reached 7 billion .
Humanity is now in plague proportions , putting an immense strain on the Earth ’s environment .
Cities , urban sprawl , roads and traffic are spreading like grey cancers over the continents , smothering the land underneath with concrete and asphalt .
Wilderness areas are disappearing because of this encroachment , and many other species are pushed into endangerment or extinction .
Even worse , the type of society that has developed – one based on the pursuit of endless consumption – is ultimately unsustainable as resources are voraciously consumed .
The immense amounts of waste produced because of this pollute the environment ( plastics are particularly noxious as they can take thousands of years to break down ) .
Humans are effectively fouling their own nest .
The more humans there are , the fewer resources there are for everyone , and there is a subsequent decline in quality of life .
In the natural world , animal populations tend to increase in times of plenty , but die off when famine inevitably strikes – the “ boom and bust ” cycle .
Technological innovations such as the “ Green Revolution ” – increasing crop yields through use of pesticides and artificial fertilization – have allowed the human population to reach an artificially high level and bypass this cycle … at least for the present era .
It is not unlikely , however , that our current industrial civilization will ultimately collapse , like others in history before it , such as the Mayans or Roman Empire .
The collapse of this current one will , however , be many times worse than previous collapses as there are so many more people , and it is dangerously fragile and interdependent due to globalization – much of what we consume is obtained from far away , usually other countries – and reliant upon environmentally - damaging forms of intensive agriculture .
Screen captures from the Baraka film : caged battery hens and overcrowded slum apartments – not much difference !
Unpleasant and stressful conditions for both species .
A little - noted aspect of high populations is that the more people there are , the less the individual matters as an individual is easily replaced ( unless they possess a valuable skill or talent ) .
It is impossible to see a population of thousands or millions of humans as individuals ; they instead become an amorphous mass .
Humans originally evolved in small family and tribal groups where most people knew each other ( the upper comfortable limit seems to be two or three hundred ) .
To live in a city of millions is thus a dehumanizing experience , and leads to stress and dysfunction .
Even if a large population could be supported , would people really like to live in high - density regions , packed into multi-storey buildings like unfortunate caged battery hens ?
I certainly would n’t , and humans did not evolve to live like this .
Here ’s China .
How would you like to live there ?
Look at all those little window A / Cs .
They ’ve got power , at least for now .
Humans can be packed in .
Do you want to live like a termite ?
Are we termites ?
Come on , I want to be up on top of the hill where that chair is and I want to have some space around me – do n’t you ?
People do n’t seem to want to think .
We still allow people to have more than two kids .
We encourage reproduction .
We actually give you a discount for having kids .
You should have to pay more when you have your first kid – you pay more taxes .
When you have your second kid you pay a lot more taxes , and when you have your third kid you do n’t get anything back , they take it all .
Our tax system is completely backwards .
But , then , so is our whole economic system .

She glanced down between her boots through the transparent deck of the ship as it passed over the center of Jejeno .
The city was both a tribute to isenj engineering skills and an indictment of their stupidity .
The forest of asymmetric towers – bronze , brown , copper , tan – and narrow streets created endless canyons .
Shapakti said that it was an echo of isenj origins as termite - like animals living in giant mounds , but Esganikan had seen almost identical soaring buildings in the images of Earth .
It was how greedy species built : it showed space was at a premium because they had filled it and out - priced it – yes , she understood Earth ’s economy now , she understood it very well – and they did n’t care about the intrusion on the landscape .
It was a statement of their contempt for all other life .

His scathing assessment was being submitted to the main opposition Conservative Party ’s policy group focusing on quality of life .

We touch on the subject of city dwellers , my tribe , as it happens .
We ’re a kind of helpless , infantilized race , in Bill Mollison ’s eyes , living in a doomed dreamworld , lucky if we know how to tie a granny knot and incapable of feeding ourselves without the aid of a supermarket , a bijou delicatessen or a restaurant that hangs as rustic decor the kind of bushman ’s tools he grew up using .
Cities , “ cancerous ” and “ parasitic , ” are the most unsustainable systems in the world , he says , sucking up resources and spewing out waste .
“ Look at New York .
It does n’t produce a single thing for anybody anywhere .
It has no product of relevance to human beings .

Finally , even most Asians choose for suburbia with lush gardens , when they get the chance ( prosperity ) for it .
Their living in huge and densely packed concentrations is an adaptation out of economic necessity rather than a social preference .
We humans have n’t diverged that much since we left the East - African savannas , and we still prefer the parks landscape .

Competition for employment is another negative effect of overpopulation .
Various jobs have become more automated and efficient , requiring less manpower ( or else jobs are “ outsourced ” to countries where labor is cheap ) yet the population continues to expand , and all these “ surplus ” people need to find some means to make a living .
They face a highly - competitive “ employer ’s market , ” in which employers have a huge resource pool to choose from and can thus afford to be selective about whom they employ .
Unfortunately , for those who do n’t have the appropriate skills , menial , low - paying jobs ( mainly in the service industry ) are often the only option ( if they manage to find work at all – some less desirable alternatives are to turn to crime , or starve to death ) .
Higher education to attain the requisite qualifications is expensive and beyond the reach of many , so a lot of people may remain in such unfulfilling dead - end jobs all their lives – a dismaying waste of potential .
There is also the “ spillover effect ” : many citizens of highly - populated countries emigrate to seek opportunities they can’t find in their homeland .
But economic immigration can incite resentment amongst a host country ’s citizens , who have to compete even more for jobs ( and some of the latter in turn might emigrate to other nations ) .
There are only so many habitable places on Earth , however , and space colonization is a long way off , if it ever eventuates – therefore , overpopulated countries ca n’t expect to keep exporting their surplus people .
Drastic solutions are needed , and politicians and businessmen should stop irresponsibly urging people to have more children to “ boost the economy ” – the economy can’t keep growing indefinitely ( as they seem to think it can ) as there are only finite resources on Earth ( and in space ) .
The Earth ’s environment is not coping now with nearly 7 billion humans ; how much worse will it be when growth reaches 8 or 9 billion by the middle of this century as predicted ?
The much - publicized “ solutions ” for climate change such as carbon emissions taxes or living more frugally are only superficial actions that do nothing to address the basic cause of environmental problems : more people competing for ever - dwindling resources .
Reduce population growth and humanity ’s environmental impact on the Earth will also be lessened .
Fewer humans will therefore make life pleasanter for everyone .
Rather than endless economic growth , a steady - state economy is a more desirable option ; one that is not dependent upon ever - increasing consumption to function .
Let ’s have a stationary world as opposed to one that ’s based on growth - mania where everybody has to elbow the other guy and compete to get to the front and be concerned about who ’s going to win and who ’s going to lose every day in the stock market .
In a stationary world , we can focus in on things that really matter – I love Mill ’s phrase “ the art of living . ”
Let ’s get to work on improving the art of living .

The problem with agriculture
In 1987 , scientist Jared Diamond wrote an article provocatively titled “ The Worst Mistake In The History Of The Human Race ” – the “ mistake ” in his opinion being the development of agriculture that supplanted humanity ’s previous hunter - gatherer existence .
“ With agriculture came the gross social and sexual inequality , the disease and despotism , that curse our existence . ”
It also enabled populations to expand far beyond their natural limits as food could be produced in much greater quantities than a hunter - gatherer lifestyle provided .
The industrialization of agriculture – the mass planting , mechanized gathering , processing and export of crops – accelerated this expansion even more during the 20th century .
This , however , comes with a downside – if crops fail , mass starvation threatens as most people are entirely dependent upon food imported from distant farms , and there is no way hunting and gathering could sustain 7 billion people , even assuming they had the requisite skills ( which most do n’t ) .
Most people in developed countries have been shielded from famine and are accustomed to an endless , even over - abundant supply of food ( with the accompanying health problems ) .
They are shocked at images of starvation from developing countries , but this is what happens in the rest of the natural world – Nature can be ruthless .
This boom - and - bust cycle is inexorable : animal populations flourish in times of plenty , but are depleted when food becomes scarce .
The only way for humans to sustainably circumvent this cycle without mass starvation or , conversely , inflicting huge environmental damage , is to curb population growth and restrict how many children are born .
This goes against natural instinct to reproduce profligately in times of plenty , but ensures that there will be enough food for everyone in leaner times .
Adopting such a policy , however , would involve radical changes in how society functions – abandoning the infinite growth policy that economies are addicted to – and few would be willing to undertake this ; certainly not governments or businesses who encourage growth .
We are effectively trapped in a vicious cycle of more people requiring more food production which in turn encourages yet higher reproductive rates .
Agriculture requires huge amounts of land for crops , and this is another source of pressure upon wilderness areas along with cities .
A worrying 2011 report in Time magazine is “ Africa Blossoms : A Continent On the Verge of an Agricultural Revolution . ”
The expansion of agriculture in Africa is presented in a positive light here , but the continent ’s endangered wildlife are already squeezed into nature reserves due to a growing human population , various animals unable to follow their ancient migration routes anymore .
( The few hunter - gatherer peoples still living their traditional sustainable lifestyle are similarly threatened . )
Agriculture will only add to this environmental destruction .
Another article on this theme is “ AGRICULTURE : Ending the World as We Know It ” by John Feeney .
China ’s problems
China currently has the largest population ( over 1.3 billion as of 2007 ) and it continues to increase ( India is following closely with an estimated population of 1.2 billion as of 2009 ) .
Since the 1980s it has attempted to rein in this growth through a one - child policy , but this has had only a limited effect and many citizens try to circumvent it .
A few groups such as ethnic minorities are also exempt from this law .
China needs to keep its economy growing to provide jobs for all these people , and thus must scour the world for more and more resources ( such as minerals and metals ) .
But there are only so many products it can make , only so many jobs it can provide , and the process of production is hugely damaging to the environment – consider the millions of plastic toys with the “ Made in China ” label which will eventually end up in landfill , polluting the environment for centuries .
It shares the world with other countries competing for dwindling resources .
This could all end in catastrophe before the end of the 21st century .
China ’s one - child policy is criticized by those in Western democracies who see it as an impingement on individual rights .
But China ca n’t afford to otherwise relax this policy – its already - huge population is having a worldwide environmental impact as they become more affluent .
Clearly , a rising birth rate would place an enormous burden on China ’s social and medical infrastructure , which is far less developed than physical infrastructure like roads and rail .
A change in emphasis will be essential .
Hospitals will need vast new infusions of money and other resources .
The weak system of homes for the elderly , child - care providers and other social services will have to be greatly expanded .
– TIME magazine , 29 May 2008
Where will the money and resources come from to provide for a massive population ?
China also faces one of the most skewed sex ratios in the world : men outnumber women 1.2 to 1 .
The male surplus , which means many Chinese men will never be able to have a family , creates an ominous future ; already , an underclass of young male thugs is proliferating in Chinese cities , a group easily recruited for crime .
In Beijing ’s worst nightmare , these angry young men could turn against the state .
As scholars Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer wrote in a 2004 book , in the mid-19th century unequal sex ratios , which left men idle , contributed to armed rebellion in the Chinese countryside .
A radical solution might be to cull ( as in kill ) the surplus young males – wars , in fact , already tend to do this , though in a somewhat uncontrolled manner .
In fact , that is something that could be done in any society with a surplus of single , young , unemployed males between 12 - 25 years ( who tend to be the most troublesome elements – just consult any statistics for violent crime ) .
A study called “ Bare Branches : The Security Implications of Asia ’s Surplus Male Population ” focuses on the social implications of surplus males .
What happens to a society that has too many men ?
In this provocative book , Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer argue that , historically , high male - to - female ratios often trigger domestic and international violence .
Most violent crime is committed by young unmarried males who lack stable social bonds .
Although there is not always a direct cause - and - effect relationship , these surplus men often play a crucial role in making violence prevalent within society .
Governments sometimes respond to this problem by enlisting young surplus males in military campaigns and high - risk public works projects .
Countries with high male - to - female ratios also tend to develop authoritarian political systems .
Hudson and den
Boer suggest that the sex ratios of many Asian countries , particularly China and India – which represent almost 40 percent of the world ’s population – are being skewed in favor of males on a scale that may be unprecedented in human history .
Through offspring sex selection ( often in the form of sex - selective abortion and female infanticide ) , these countries are acquiring a disproportionate number of low - status young adult males , called “ bare branches ” by the Chinese .
Hudson and den
Boer argue that this surplus male population in Asia ’s largest countries threatens domestic stability and international security .
The prospects for peace and democracy are dimmed by the growth of bare branches in China and India , and , they maintain , the sex ratios of these countries will have global implications in the twenty - first century .
Sounds harsh ?
Well , as a female , I have been menaced a few times in public over the years by groups of young males ( verbally so far , not physically ) for no apparent reason than being a female by herself – boys in groups seem to develop an irresistible urge to harass any vulnerably - looking females .
Feeling threatened like that is extremely psychologically distressing and I have no way to retaliate ( I do fantasize about eviscerating them ) .
So , given that , my attitude has hardened and I would feel a lot safer if there were fewer aggressive young males around .
How would you identify the aggressive ones , as , of course , not all males fit this description ?
One way is to catch those who roam the streets at night in groups or gangs – I see the results in my neighborhood the next morning ( graffiti , vandalism ) .
Another is to target those convicted of violent crimes .
Note that humans do n’t hesitate to cull other species ( some being elephants and kangaroos ) – species that are seen as being in competition with humans for land and resources .
Back on topic : China must therefore take stronger ( and perhaps unpalatable ) measures to reduce its population growth if it wants to keep its society stable .
To other worlds ?
One solution much - touted by spaceflight advocates is to alleviate overpopulation on Earth by expanding into and colonizing the Solar System , ( and , eventually , extrasolar planets ) and exploit these other places for the resources required .
The colonization of the Solar System is feasible in theory with current technology , but this would require people to live in artificial environments for however long they stayed in space ; not a desirable prospect for most compared to the richness of Earth ’s environment .
Terraforming is way beyond humanity ’s abilities for the foreseeable future .
Offworld colonies , assuming governments and private corporations were willing to fund them , could at best support a few thousand people , and transporting them to the colonies would be a years - long process with the only propulsive means now available , chemical rockets , which are slow and inefficient .
Given these present - day restrictions , possibly habitable worlds in other solar systems are simply too far away to be contemplated , unless one is prepared to spend thousands of years ’ traveling time in some sort of space ark .
Any volunteers ?
The Solar System is regarded by advocates as a near - limitless source of resources , and they see no need for humanity to restrict its growth ; indeed , an expanding population will eventually force humans to expand its presence off Earth .
I have some interest in the space program , but have become exasperated with the disdain that space colonization advocates have for suggestions that humans should try to live sustainably on Earth .
They seem to take such views as a personal insult .
An example of this thinking is Stephen Ashworth ’s space advocacy website , which contains essays such as Why Go Into Space ? , where he asserts that expansionists are morally superior (! ) :
The expansion of human activities into outer space is therefore an integral part of the growth of modern Western civilization .
It is an assertion of our values of tolerance , liberty , progress , reason and democracy .
Anybody whose main concern is to suppress or destroy this civilization will quite naturally find nothing of interest in space .
This to my mind is a disturbing example of hubris : of the Western mindset that the Earth and other worlds are there to be conquered and exploited by humanity ; that humans are the pinnacle of evolution ( “ We are no mere ‘ environmental abnormality ’ ; we are here for a purpose ; we are what nature has been working towards – unconsciously , unknowingly – for billions of years ” – source ) .
Space colonization with this attitude is a continuation of the policy that has caused so much devastation to Earth ’s environment ; of enabling reckless population and economic growth without care for environmental consequences .
A more realistic view of the Solar System “ safety valve ” theory :
Exoplanets as safety valves for excess populations or as new resource - providers are a non-starter on numerical grounds , quite apart from any technological , financial , physical , humanitarian or sociological objections that there may be .
At most , at enormous cost , we may within the next century or two establish small inhabited outposts on the Moon , Mars and perhaps some of the asteroids or a moon or two of Jupiter ( which would at least though , provide some refuges against dinosaur killers ) .
Even if it were to be possible , the emigration of excess population to other planets can only postpone the moment by a few centuries when the population of all planets exceeds the capacity of those planets to support it .
Neither can exoplanets be expected to provide replacements for dwindling terrestrial resources .
Even within the solar system the cost in terms of the consumed resources of ( say ) mining a small asteroid would exceed the value of any useful products by a large factor .
The same comment would apply a million million million times over to any attempt to provide any supplies of any material items from even the nearest exoplanet .

“ Can Space Colonization End Overpopulation ? ” at HardSF gives a good overview on why space is not a solution to overpopulation .
Domestic animals – the other overpopulation problem
As the human population has expanded , so has the numbers of the animals domesticated throughout history , the major species being cattle , sheep , goats , pigs , chickens , horses , cats and dogs ( see “ Farm Animal Populations Continue to Grow ” ) .
These animals have traveled with humans to every inhabited continent and become invasive species , competing with native animals for food and living space , and usually displacing the natives .
An xkcd diagram shows that humans and domestic animals vastly outnumber wild creatures .
Domestic animals that are farmed require vast tracts of pasture for feed , and this , along with agriculture , results in clearance of wilderness areas .
This National Geographic diagram from 2014 shows the percentage of undeveloped / wild land ( 46.5 % ) to agriculture ( 38.6 % ) and other ( urban , etc. ) ( 14.9 % ) ; a ratio likely to worsen for undeveloped land in the next few decades .
Animals kept as pets – such as cats and dogs in Western culture – can escape and become feral , breeding in vast numbers ; this also applies to various farm animals .
Australia is a sad example of a continent with unique indigenous species that has become overrun by the various introduced domestic animals since European settlement ; the latter have caused much environmental damage , along with the industrial civilization that developed since then .
One solution is to encourage less consumption of meat ; this , however , will not help the environment much if human population continues to grow , as farmland is still required for agriculture .
If human population is stabilized and decreases , eating less meat will be more effective .
The other is to greatly restrict pet breeding and ownership ; this would cause a lot of outrage amongst many , but is necessary to reduce the environmental impact such animals have .
It would also see far fewer unwanted animals euthanized each year .
Countermeasures
In this section are ideas for combating the overpopulation problem ( which would applied to all countries equally ) , in order from the benign to the unpleasant .
Some of these verge on the totalitarian , but with so many countries either unwilling or unable to regulate their populations , they could be seen as necessary measures !
Otherwise , Nature will – sooner or later – deal with excess populations far more brutally .
Some people would – with tedious predictability – try to subvert these measures ( a lot of people seem to lose all rationality when it comes to reproduction ) so harsh punishments would be necessary to discourage this ( e.g. compulsory sterilization , or even the death penalty as an extreme deterrent ) .
One irritation in fiction is that population control is , more often than not , presented in a negative manner ; as part of a draconian system that the main characters rebel against .
( Examples can be found on the Population Control page at TV Tropes . )
I wish authors and film makers would show some responsibility and stop depicting such characters as heroic .
The population rules are often there for good reason – such as conserving scarce resources – and characters who rebel are in fact selfish and irresponsible , and thus deserving of whatever punishment they receive .
What would an ideal population figure be ?
Probably no more than one billion ( 1000 million ) – a look at the World population estimates page at Wikipedia shows that the human population up to the 1800s was under this figure , and humanity did not have too much impact on the environment until the Industrial Revolution , when the population began a rapid increase .
Relatively benign methods
The following methods are already in use in many countries and are effective long - term strategies , but they can take decades for the results to show :
The education and emancipation of women to be enforced by the United Nations in certain countries if necessary .
Educated women tend to have fewer children as they realize they can do more with their life than only breeding !
If there is certainty that their children will survive to adulthood , the impetus to have large families is reduced .
Ensure all women have access to affordable contraception ( government - subsidized if necessary ) , family planning , health care and abortion .
Coercive & passive measures
Woman who want children are to be encouraged to have two children at most ; any more would not receive any form of government support .
( Or , alternatively , sterilize after the 2nd child . )
Begin a campaign to make having a large family ( 3 or more children ) socially unacceptable .
Underage pregnancies ( 18 being the usual legal adulthood age in many societies ) will not receive government support ; the mother will be encouraged to either abort or adopt the child out .
If she chooses not to , she will have to find her own means of supporting it .
Women who get pregnant while on welfare will not receive child support payments .
If you ca n’t afford it , do n’t have it !
( Also provide free contraception to those on welfare . )
Incentives to have children , such as the “ baby bonus ” currently paid in Australia , to be abolished .
Draconian measures
Of those who do have more than two children , only two of those children would be permitted to reproduce .
IVF to be banned – why artificially produce more people who would not otherwise be here ?
Encourage people to adopt or sponsor a child , or contribute to society in other ways !
The knowledge for the procedure will remain , but it would not be used unless there is dire need ( e.g. humans in danger of extinction – not likely at the moment ! ) .

The knowledge for the procedure will remain , but it would not be used unless there is dire need ( e.g. humans in danger of extinction – not likely at the moment ! ) .
Men over a certain age – say , 50 – to be sterilized so that we do n’t have geriatrics fathering children !
Women to be given birth control implants from the onset of menarche to age 18 , after which they remove the implant to have children if they wish .
That idea is from this science fiction novel :
The Shaa , after their conquest of Terra , were perplexed by the varieties of sexuality displayed by their new conquests , and had wisely made no attempt to regulate any of its variety .
Instead they ’d insisted , in the most unsentimental , practical way , on minimizing the consequences : every Terran female had to be given a contraceptive implant at some point during her fourteenth year .
Any woman having reached twenty - two , the age of maturity , could have the implant removed at any time by a physician , while younger women required the permission of a parent or guardian .
The number of unwanted children , though not eliminated altogether , was at least brought within manageable levels .
– Walter Jon Williams , The Praxis
Extremely unpleasant and last - resort measures
An even more drastic ( and unpopular ! ) solution would be to genetically - engineer a contagious virus or nanotech plague that would cause infertility , and release it in those countries which are seriously overpopulated .
Alternately , the virus or nanotech would sterilize everyone over a certain age ( e.g. 5 years old ) worldwide , so there would be no births for at least 13 years ( assuming that 18 is recognized as adulthood ) .
Active culling .
Nature ’s method of population control : war , famine , plague , environmental collapse , etc .
This will reduce the population by killing millions , but this is obviously an unpleasant way to do it !
Personal impact
Melbourne has been undergoing rapid population growth since the 1990s , and this has put great strain on its infrastructure , as well as driving up house prices .
The demand for housing is seeing overdevelopment in the suburbs as described on my Crimes against architecture page , ruining their ambiance .
If this trend continues into the future , as it seems it will , Melbourne will not remain a livable city but turn into an overcrowded slum , as so many megacities are in the world – and they are extremely nightmarish and unpleasant places to inhabit if you like open spaces and nature .
The Victorian State Government keeps enthusing about how wonderful population growth is ; how this proves Melbourne is a desirable place to live and how it will boost the economy , and so on .
( I get so infuriated at this that I just want to slap some sense into the offending minister / s ! )
In a speech that could have been ghost - written by any of the aforementioned Canadian growth - a- holics , Premier John Brumby of Victoria spoke of his Government ’s plan to “ manage growth , ” because you see , growth is inevitable , and growth projections must be treated as , if anything , “ pessimistic , ” i.e. conservative .
Thus Melbourne is going to grow at least 44 % by 2030 , with 6.2 million people by 2020 .
“ Demographer Bernhard Salt has projected we will regain our title ( sic ) as Australia ’s largest city within 20 years . ”
Note that the Premier treats a population growth plateau like a sports trophy to be raised aloft in triumph .
Melbourne will regain its “ title ” like Muhammed Ali regained his title against George Foreman .
Similarly when Victoria was “ losing ” people in the 1990s , presumably the state of Victoria was a “ loser . ”
But now “ the exodus has been turned around and people are now voting with their feet in favour of Victoria . ”
It is as if Premier Brumby is fighting an election campaign and people moving to Victoria are casting a vote for him .
A commonplace illusion among Premiers , Governors and Prime Ministers .
– “ The ubiquitous rationale of growthism ”
They seem to not comprehend that such growth will destroy what makes Melbourne so livable : its low housing density and suburbs with space for gardens .
Melbourne was not designed to be a high - density city and was all the better for it .
Traffic is now horrendous and the dilapidated public transport system can’t cope with the population we already have .
I dread to think what the city will be like in another decade or so .
I have never had any desire to have children , so I at least will not be contributing to population growth !
Unlike the fertile lands of Europe or the USA , Australia is a dry continent with ancient , nutrient - poor soils – much of it is desert , as a satellite map shows – and thus it cannot support a high population , something those who want to fill Australia up with people are unaware of ( or do n’t want to know ) .
Boundless Plains ? at Mark O’Connor ’s site also shows maps of Australia ’s relatively small proportion of abundant rain and fertile soils .
The Aboriginal peoples survived for 40,000 years or more on the Australian continent as hunter - gatherers , their sustainable lifestyle having minimal impact .
European discovery and settlement was arguably the worst disaster to affect Australia ’s fragile ecosystem , short of an asteroid strike .
In only 200 years or so , much of its unique fauna has become extinct , flora has been damaged or wiped out ( whole forests cleared ) , and exotic species introduced , irrevocably changing the environment here .
The destruction continues apace .
Continued population growth will only put more pressure on what remnant native life remains .
Various Australian politicians have been expressing concern about the supposedly declining birth rate for the last few years .
The following newspaper article is an example of this kind of warped thinking :
Business of babies A businessman is spending $ 200,000 on newspaper ads urging Aussies to have babies .
Electronics multi-millionaire Gary Johnston , 56 , aimed to draw attention to the population woes in full - page ads in major papers .
“ Where are the next - generation Shane Warnes or Ian Thorpes going to come from ? ” the Sydney father of four asks .
“ The few young people left will be too busy taking care of old people , alongside being taxed out of existence .
“ Something must be done to reverse the declining birth rate , and I hope this ad may help bring the matter to the attention of people still in a position to do something about it . ”
Mr. Johnston , 56 , has also put up $ 1 million for research into Australia ’s water crisis .
– Herald - Sun , 24 April 2006
I wonder if he has made the connection between Australia ’s INCREASING population and the ongoing drought and water shortage crisis .
All he has to do is look at China , which has a huge population and is undergoing an environmental catastrophe .
Given the environmental problems such as global warming and ever - scarcer resources that face humanity in the coming decades , urging people to have more children is irresponsible in the extreme .
The main reason why businessmen like him want an increased birth and immigration rate is so that they can make more money from more people .
Australia ’s birthrate has in fact been increasing , in part no thanks to the “ baby bonus ” payments introduced by John Howard ’s Federal government in 2004 , and which subsequent governments refuse to abolish .
Apart from this , there are also generous family government benefits for each child .
As far as I am concerned , the fewer people the better .
As noted above , I sincerely hope that some scientist genetically - engineers a contagious virus that would sterilize most of humanity !
Little else seems to be effective .
There are a lot of people concerned with the overpopulation issue ; unfortunately few get into positions of influence .
Below are some websites and articles .

Among them : the recession - fueled need for more public revenue , increased calls to redirect scarce law enforcement , court and prison resources , and a growing desire to declaw powerful and violent Mexican drug cartels .
Also in the mix is a public opinion shift driven by a generation of Baby Boomers , combined with some new high - profile calls for legislation -- including some well - known conservative voices joining with liberals .
Forget that many of Paul 's most devoted supporters are even worse than Jehovah 's Witnesses and Limbaugh dittoheads rolled into one .
And forget , at least for a moment , that he attracts racists and neo -Nazis to his banner .
His voting record -- much to the chagrin of the supporters who revel in his uniqueness ( and their own profound ignorance ) -- is mostly garden variety right - wing Republican rubber stamp .
But , unlike most Republican rubber stamps , only " mostly . "
In terms of his lifetime votes on the " crucial " issues that have come before Congress which divide along partisan lines , Paul almost always votes with his political party , the Republicans , but his progressive voting score , 23.42 , sits between those of two former Democrats , Rodney Alexander ( R- LA ) and Ralph Hall ( R - TX ) , two Republicans who sometimes break with the GOP and vote with the Democrats .
That has n't happened much this year ;
Paul 's progressive score on all issues voted on by Congress is a dismal , zombie - like 2.94 , more in tune with reactionary extremists bent on knee - jerk obstructionism like Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) and Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) than like the handful of reasonable mainstream conservatives like Chris Smith ( R - NJ ) , Timothy Johnson ( R- IL ) , Vernon Ehlers ( R - MI ) and Michael Castle ( R - DE ) , who have voted across the aislemore frequently than Paul .
After President Obama 's speech yesterday Paul was on CNN talking about economic fascism and equating Obama 's proposals to rescue America to the Bush policies that caused the Depression .
To Paul , Hoover and FDR were not opposites , but basically two peas in the pod and fascism is socialism and Obama is Bush .
If it were only the 1800s , many of his economic ideas might be reasonable .
Nevertheless ,
Paul does espouse plenty of ideas thatreasonable , right now .
This week he joined with one of Congress ' most progressive members , Alan Grayson ( D - FL ) to call for a transparent audit of the Federal Reserve and the bill that he and Barney Frank have introduced to to legalize industrial hemp is long overdue .
The 10 co-sponsors go from Congress ' most outspoken liberals like Tammy Baldwin ( D - WI ) , George Miller ( D - CA ) and Raul Grijalva ( R - AZ ) to a couple of far right kooks from the dark fringes of American politics , Tom McClintock ( R - CA ) and Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) .
The bill calls for the legalization of the non-drug variety of cannabis , the kind that 's healthy and nutritious to eat and that can be made into things to wear and that would be a boon to American farmers .
There is no downside to legalization , which was mistakenly criminalized in 1937 .
This morning I woke up and Ron Paul was on CNN talking about the legalization of marijuana ( and other drugs ) .
He makes a lot of sense -- and nearly half of American agrees .
A week ago thewonder why it 's taking so long to legalize it and suggest that " an unprecedented confluence of factors might finally be driving a change on a topic once seen as politically too hot to handle .
" Last year Paul co-sponsored H.R. 5843 , the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008 , with progressive icon Barney Frank ( D - MA ) .
The bill was killed in committee .
But the ideas that Paul expressed on CNN this morning were n't .
He advocates an approach where the real regulation of drugs would come from the individual , the family , the parents and the community .
As a practical matter , he thinks it should be left up to the states .
54 % of Californians favor outright legalization but , at least under Bush , even the modest state medical marijuana laws were trampled in a mania to continue the failed and totally dysfunctional war on drugs .
I was planning to post the video of the CNN debate between Ron Paul and the reactionary Baldwin brother , Stephen which you can see at the link because I just found the clip of Paul on CNN this morning : I wonder how neo -fascist Georgia Congressman Paul Broun , the most extreme right member of Congress , feels about Ron Paul 's proposal now that Paul Broun III , his 18 year old son has been arrested for marijuana possession .
Maybe the crazed congressman thought Junior was out at a tea party .

Remember back during primary season when Barack Obama got into all that trouble for saying that rural Pennsylvanians cling to their guns and religion ?
Well , all those Republicans who blew their tops after then - Senator Obama made those remarks better now hope that he was right about those folks in the Pennsylvania ' T ' ( that conservative area in PA between Philadephia and Pittsburgh ) if they hope to win another statewide election in the Keystone State anytime soon .
The Pennsylvania GOP is going to either need an armed rebellion or a whole lot of prayers to make it happen .
Of course , it 's not just in Pennsylvania that the Republicans are struggling .
They are slowly allowing the Democrats to make in - roads in all sorts of places around the country that were previously out of reach for the blue team .
Places like Indiana , Virginia and North Carolina had n't voted for a Democrat for President in decades and yet , all three of them voted for Barack Obama in 2008 .
Other states like Montana , Arizona and even parts of Nebraska are moving out of the red column and into swing state status .
The GOP is being forced to defend themselves in more and more places , and at the same time they 're running out of places to challenge the Democrats .
Several swing states are now shifting into the solidly blue column .
Republicans who wish to regain control of Congress or the White House can not continue to allow this to happen - and no where is this more important for them than in Pennsylvania .
The state is at a tipping point , it could tip back towards the middle and remain one of the largest swing states on the map or it could fall off the GOP 's radar altogether .
The Keystone State represents 21 Electoral Votes ( for now - the 2010 census will slightly change the electoral map ) and without a shot at those 21 EVs the Republicans would basically be conceding about 250 Electoral Votes to the Democrats ( John Kerry won 252 EVs in 2004 ; all of those states also voted for Barack Obama by at least a 9 - point margin and show no signs of turning red in 2012 ) .
Without getting into a state - by - state breakdown , if President Obama does not have to defend Pennsylvania , the Democrats will be able to play offense everywhere in 2012 and the Republicans will have to defend it all .
If , on the other hand , the GOP can prevent Pennsylvania from slipping away , Obama and the Democrats will need to look for about 40 EVs in 2012 rather than 20 , a far more difficult task .
Things are n't looking too good for the Pennsylvania Republicans though .
Just like the GOP on the national level , the party 's base is no longer the most shrewd and strategic block of voters in the country .
The organized , disciplined and strategic approach that the Republican Party used to take towards elections and voting has given way to the chaos of the GOP 's coming civil war .
The reasonable and pragmatic wing of the GOP will eventually win back their party from right - wing whack jobs like Glenn Beck , Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin who seem to be running the show at the moment , but the question is when ?
Will it be soon enough in Pennsylvania for the GOP to stand a chance against Obama in 2012 ?
We may get some clues in the 2010 Republican Primary for Senate in the Keystone State .
Arlen Specter , the 79 - year old , incumbent , Republican Senator is seeking re-election .
Statewide his numbers are n't great , but they 're not terrible either - he has an overall job approval rating of 52 percent - above the dangerous 50 % mark .
In the pre-2009 days , the PA Republicans would do the pragmatic thing and make sure that Senator Specter , a man with incumbency , excellent name recognition and an approval rating above 50 percent to his advantage , would become their nominee .
They would take the safe bet , particularly when the Democratic Party has yet to develop a clear front - runner in their race , even if Specter was n't exactly the most thrilling choice for most of them .
In 2009 , however , things are different .
The inmates are in charge of the GOP asylum and rather than nominating Specter , a moderate with a fantastic chance to get himself re-elected regardless of which Democrat he may face in the General Election , they seem hell - bent on nominating a right - wing , deregulating , tax - cutter for the rich named Pat Toomey .
Toomey is a former Congressman from Pennsylvania and is currently the president of an anti-tax organization called the Club for Growth .
He is expected to step down from that position soon in order to formally announce what he has been hinting at for months , that he will run against Arlen Specter in the Pennsylvania Republican primary for Senate .
At the moment , it appears likely that he will get past Specter .
Despite already having lost a Senate primary to him by two points in 2004 , and with 73 % of Republican voters saying that they do not know enough about him to form an opinion , he somehow has a 41 % - 27 % lead over Sen.
Specter .
That 's pretty bad news for the incumbent - Republicans do n't really know who Rep .
Toomey is , but they 'll take whoever they can get , as long as it's not Specter .
On the plus side for Specter , 28 % remain undecided and he appears to be geared up for a tough fight .
The race is likely to tighten up quite a bit before 2010 and in the end , if Specter ends up pulling off the win , it will be a signal to the rest of the political establishment that Pennsylvania 's Republicans are still an electoral force to be reckoned with .
If , on the other hand , they choose Toomey , they 're essentially throwing in the towel and voting with their rabid , right - wing hearts , rather than their brains .
While there is nothing wrong with voting with one 's heart , the GOP does not have the luxury of ubiquity right now .
If they want to survive , they need every victory they can get and can not afford to take principled stands at the cost of elections - especially in Pennsylvania .
WAX2003012852 - USS FLORIDA , Bahamas , Jan. 14 ( UPI ) -- USS Florida launches a Tomahawk cruise missile during Giant Shadow in the waters off the coast of the Bahamas on Jan. 14 , 2003 .
Giant Shadow is a Naval Sea Systems Command ( NAVSEA ) / Naval Submarine Forces experiment to test the capabilities of the Navy 's future guided missile submarines .
Florida is one of four Ohio- class ballistic missile submarines ( SSBN ) being converted to guided missile submarines ( SSGN ) .
Giant Shadow is the first experiment under the " Sea Trial " initiative of the Chief of Naval Operations ' Sea Power 21 vision and the first in a series of experiments before converting and overhauling the four SSBNs to SSGNs .
The SSGNs will have the capability to support and launch up to 154 Tomahawk missiles , a significant increase in capacity as compared to other platforms .

MOSCOW , March 23 ( UPI ) -- Russia is likely to place more emphasis on lighter attack submarines armed with nuclear - tipped cruise missiles in the future , military officials say .
With advances in the range and sophistication of tactical nuclear arms , Russian military leaders say low - yield nuclear warheads attached to cruise missiles fired from attack submarines make more sense than loading powerful bombs onto bigger strategic submarines , RIA Novosti reported .

" Probably , tactical nuclear weapons ( on submarines ) will play a key role in the future , " Vice Admiral Oleg Burtsev , deputy head of the Russian navy general staff , told the news service .
" Their range and precision are gradually increasing . "
Burtsev added : " There is no longer any need to equip missiles with powerful nuclear warheads .
We can install low - yield warheads on existing cruise missiles . "
An example of the kind of equipment to be favored in the future is the new Severodvinsk nuclear - powered attack submarine , to be commissioned in 2010 - 11 , Burtsev said .
It reportedly has the ability to launch long - range cruise missiles tipped with nuclear warheads , and can also battle hostile submarines and surface warships .

Madness .
Via : Progreso Weekly :
Air France Flight 438 , from Paris , was to land at Mexico City at 6 p.m. on Saturday , April 18 .
Five hours before landing , the captain ’s voice announced that U.S. authorities had prohibited the plane from flying over U.S. territory .
The explanation : among the passengers aboard was a person who was not welcome in the United States for reasons of national security .
A few minutes later , the same voice told the startled passengers that the plane was heading for Fort - de - France , Martinique , because the detour the plan needed to take to reach its destination was too long and the fuel was insufficient .
The stopover in that French territory in the Caribbean would be only to refuel the plane .
Exhaustion was becoming an issue among the passengers .
But the central question , spoken in undertones , was the identity of the “ terrorist ” passenger , because if the “ gringos ” say it , “ it must be because he must be a terrorist . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Looking at those of us sitting in the back of the plane , two passengers said no terrorist could be there because “ nobody there looks like a Muslim . ”
Again in the air , and preparing for another four hours of travel , a man who identified himself as the copilot came to me .
Trying to look discreet , he asked if I was “ Mr. Calvo Ospina . ” I told him yes .
“ The captain wants to sleep , that ’s why I came here , ” he said , and he invited me to accompany him to the back of the plane .
There , he told me that I was the person “ responsible ” for the detour .
I was astonished .
My first reaction was to ask him : “ Do you think I ’m a terrorist ? ”
He said no , that ’s the reason I ’m telling you this .
He also assured me that it was strange that this was the first time it happened on an Air France plane .

Introducing Instapaper 4.0 for iPad and iPhone
The lede here is that my pal , Marco , has just released the stellar new 4.0 version of his Instapaper suite .
This is fantastic news , and –as if you needed one more of Marco ’s beta testers to say so–I do sincerely hope you ’ll mark the occasion ( and support his hard work ) by purchasing the Instapaper iOS app (s ) .
I promise you ’ll be treating yourself to a massive update to an already excellent product .
Now , it ’s fortunate and appropriate that you ’ll be hearing this advice at length from a lot of people this week .
Because , if it ’s not already obvious , Marco ’s little app ( and its associated services ) enjoys a rabid fanbase of sundry paragraph cultists who are as eager as I am to spread the word ; and , yes , we do want you to join the Reading Nerd cult .
But , I also want to mark the occasion by adding a few thoughts on exactly what Instapaper has done , and continues to do , for me .
( As you may already know , I ’m a big Marco fan . )
Thing is , I want to tell you how Marco has made a magical machine for people who have decided to read .
Twinkling and flashing furiously , slot machines at the Boomtown Casino are bleeping at empty seats .
Only a handful of burly men occupy the poker tables and there are few drinkers around the bar .
In Canada 's youngest oil town , the gambling emporium is quiet .
After five years of frenetic building and activity , a race to extract crude from vast tracts of the Canadian oil sands has abruptly stalled , hit by a collapse in the price of a barrel of oil from a peak of $ 147 last July to barely $ 40 .
At the heart of the Albertan oil rush , the tough northern outpost of Fort McMurray , 280 miles from Edmonton , is feeling the pinch .
A quarter of the rooms are empty at the usually packed Nomad Inn .
Wednesday night chicken wings at the Podollan sports bar attracted only a spartan crowd this week .
" They 've slashed jobs , slashed projects , slashed budgets and everything else , " says Barry Gillis , a pipeline insulator for the oil company Suncor , shivering in deep snow outside the Boomtown Casino .
Until recently , Canada 's oil sands were the venue for one of the most spectacular races for profit of modern times .
The remote , boggy landscape contains between 1.7tn and 2.5tn barrels of oil , of which an estimated 173bn can be extracted using expensive , hi-tech filtering technology .
Canada 's reserves are second only to Saudi Arabia 's deposits , and a year ago 60 projects were being constructed by 25,000 workers living in temporary " camps " .
But since oil prices began a downward tumble , energy companies including Shell , Syncrude and Petro - Canada have shelved more than US $ 90bn worth of oil sands investment .
Charter flights ferrying staff from Newfoundland and Nova Scotia have been cut .
Suncor , formerly Great Canadian Oil Sands Ltd , has suffered its first quarterly loss in 16 years .
Last month one developer , BA Energy , became the first oil sands firm to file for bankruptcy protection .
" The economic environment has caused a crisis in the industry where planned investments have been put on hold , " says Bob Dunbar of Strategy West , a Calgary - based consulting firm .
" These are very expensive , capital - intensive projects .
They need high oil prices to pay out the capital and earn an adequate return . "
Left untouched for decades because it was considered too difficult to extract , much of the oil in the Canadian sands is well below ground in a thick , gloopy mixture of clay , water and bitumen .
Extracting it involves pumping thousands of tons of steam through pipes under the surface , then using hi-tech filtration to purify the crude .
Deforestation
Analysts at Merrill Lynch estimate that oil needs to sell for $ 80 for companies to build the vast rigs required on the Canadian sands .
If the commodity price falls below $ 32 , existing facilities will make an operating loss .
The credit crunch has made it hard for oil companies to raise money , and a rapidly sinking global economy has hit demand .
Merrill recently questioned if the sands were actually needed .
To make matters worse , ominous noises are coming from Washington .
The oil sands have an appalling environmental reputation : they involve deforestation , require vast use of water , emit carbon and produce a murky waste of bitumen that is dumped in " tailing ponds " in the Canadian countryside .
Barack Obama has vowed to wean the US off its addiction to " dirty , dwindling and dangerously expensive oil " .
Canada is anxious to play its cards right .
The US is its biggest customer and the country hopes to present itself as a friendlier source of oil than Venezuela or the Middle East .
The issue is likely to be on the agenda when Obama visits Ottawa on 19 February in his first official trip overseas .
Alberta 's provincial premier , Ed Stelmach , this week invited Obama to visit the sands : " We know he is interested in energy issues and would love for him to come to Alberta and see the oil sands for himself . "
Growing public anxiety about the environmental cost of oil from the sands peaked when 500 migrating ducks landed in a Syncrude waste pond last year and were poisoned by a mixture of bitumen and muck .
The birds ' death caused outrage , leaving a sour image and vindication for the green lobby .
But the economic cost of the slowdown could be high .
The oil sands make up 1.5 % of Canada 's gross domestic product in 2000 , and before the recent seizure in investment , the proportion was forecast to rise to 3 % by 2020 .
An estimated 40,000 construction jobs are at risk .
" The worst is yet to come , " warns Gil McGowan , president of the Alberta Federation of Labour .
" People talk about countries like the Philippines being remittance economies , but there are a lot of communities in the hinterland of Canada that have been kept afloat by money brought home by men and women taking jobs on the oil sands . "
Conspiracy theories abound among workers worried at the sudden evaporation in employment .
Some speculate that the largely US - controlled oil sands developers want to pipe raw bitumen south of the border for cheaper processing in under - used American refineries , cutting out Canada 's unionised workforce .
Others suggest that the slowdown is a warning to the government to indicate that the oil companies are willing to pack up and leave if rules on emissions and the environment become too tight .
During the boom , builders , engineers and electricians could earn six - figure salaries if they could put up with living for weeks in breezeblock dormitories on the edge of the sands .
The downturn has been swift and brutal .
" This is just another ploy for more profits , " said Pete LaRocque , a Suncor worker who grew up in Alberta .
" They 're playing a game with my life , my livelihood and my ancestry . "
May 4 , 2009
Israel and her supporters are making rabid efforts to enhance the ugly image of the new Israeli government .
That government , as we all know , is composed of manifestly fascist parties based on Jewish supremacy and racist disregard for the Palestinian people which has been on the receiving end of Zionist savagery and brutality for over sixty one years .
This month , Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and his thuggish Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman are going to try to convince the leaders of western countries that Palestinians don�t really need freedom and liberty and human rights and that , like all animals , all they need is bread and some other food supplements .
Netanyahu , who is slated to visit Washington D.C. later this month , is a great believer in the " power of the Jewish mind . "
Hence , he thinks he will be able to convince President Obama that the most pressing priorities in occupied Palestine should be to achieve economic prosperity , not promote human rights , including the right to life , for the Palestinians .
Netanyahu is a notorious prevaricator , a professional liar , and a master of vacuous sound - bites .
He often says what he doesn�t mean and means what he doesn�t say .
He thinks that enhanced hasbara efforts by Israel would make the international community , particularly the US and Europe , turn a blind eye to Israel�s frantic settlement expansion in the West Bank as well as ethnic cleansing against Palestinians in East Jerusalem .
Netanyahu will speak extensively about the proverbial red herring , namely the so - called " Iranian threat , " and is likely to demand that the Obama administration undertake to " neutralize the Iranian threat " before Israel makes up its mind with regard to Palestinian statehood .
Finally , Netanyahu is likely to speak vaguely about a prospective Palestinian state on " parts " of " Judea and Samaria " provided that all details pertaining to such an entity are subject to Israeli security considerations .
As to Lieberman , he is probably going to present a more honest description of the new government .
Indeed , unlike home - grown Israeli politicians , the former Moldovan immigrant is still insufficiently skilled in the hasbara art which explains his straightforward style with the media .
In recent weeks , Netanyahu reportedly rebuked Lieberman for speaking to the international media as if he was speaking to his right - wing constituencies .
This prompted Lieberman to hire a Public Relations consultant who has advised the foreign minister to speak vaguely on controversial subjects so that his words could be interpreted in many ways .
Lieberman has also been advised to say that he supports the two - state solution " in principle . "
However , it is amply clear that the phrase " in principle " encapsulates a huge amount of ill - will , deception and subterfuge on Israel �s part .
After all , Israel has really killed the possibility of establishing a genuine and viable Palestinian state on the West Bank .
Hence , instead of facing the prospects of paying the price for the death of the two - state solution , e.g. by having to accept a unitary , democratic state on all mandatory Palestine , Israel will exhaustively strive to give the Palestinian a deformed and despicable small entity made up of hapless and miserable Bantustans and townships controlled by CIA - trained Gendarmes whose main task would be to guard Israeli colonies and torment and even kill Palestinians who might dare to protest the liquidation of their national cause .
Such an entity , which Palestinian Judenrates would be free to give the grandest of names , would effectively spell the liquidation of the Palestinian problem .
This is at least what is being planned by Zionist circles in cooperation with western and some treacherous Arab regimes .
I say such a scenario would spell the liquidation of the Palestinian cause because Israel would retain the bulk of East Jerusalem and force the weak Palestinian leadership in Ramallah to kiss the paramount Right of Return goodbye if only to demonstrate its good - will and desire for peace .
Another gambit Netanyahu and Lieberman are likely to try to sell to the Americans and Europeans is the demand that the Palestinian Authority , probably including Hamas , recognize Israel as a state of the Jewish people .
Fortunately , PA chairman Mahmoud Abbas seems to have finally discovered the strategic entrapment inherent in any Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state .
Much of the world is still unsuspecting about this particular Israeli demand .
Indeed , most political circles in Europe and North America are likely to think that the Israeli demand is logical , rational and innocuous .
They are utterly ignorant of the implications , ramifications and repercussions of recognizing Israel as a " Jewish state " let alone " a state of the Jewish people . "
For those who still don�t understand , let us be clear about this .
Recognizing Israel as a Jewish state implies that Israel has the right to expel its non-Jewish citizens , particularly the 1.6 - million Arab community .
This may not happen immediately , but it could happen at some point in the future .
Of course , Israeli leaders and spokespersons would argue that this is not what Israel wants to do and that Israel is a Jewish and democratic state .
Well , this mantra of Israel being both a Jewish and democratic state is a big lie for a simple reason , namely that the " Jewishness " of Israel will always override whatever democratic fa�ade the Zionist entity could still claim to have .
Hence , it is imperative that honest media around the world expose the Israeli deception in this regard .
First , because the Netanyahu government is only using the issue of " Jewishness of the state " as a stalling tactic aimed at throwing the ball onto the Palestinian court .
And , second , because any Palestinian recognition of an exclusively Jewish state would perpetuate the deportation of millions of Palestinian refugees who had been unjustly uprooted from their ancestral homeland in order to fulfill Zionist ambitions .
Unfortunately , this brazenly racist endeavor on the part of the Zionist state has not be sufficiently challenged by the international community which is continuing to deal rather lightly hypocritically and even facetiously with this issue .
This is why ; Palestinians and their supporters are urged to expose the genocidal goals of Zionist efforts .
Finally , it is important that the Obama administration demonstrate to Netanyahu that the US is the United States of America , not the United States of Israel .
Otherwise , Lieberman�s statements last week that America�s decisions with regard to Israel are controlled by Israel , ought to be vindicated .
In short , the ball is in the Obama administration�s court , at least for the time being .
I love this picture of ticketed Smart Cars parked on Newbury St perpendicular to the street instead of parallel .
Since I first saw Smart Cars in Berlin , I had been wondering how parking authorities would address the innovative parking possibilities offered by tiny cars .
So far , Boston is n’t reacting too well .
I guess it comes down to the question of whether , when parking at a meter , you are paying for a right to park , or for the use of the space .
If it ’s for the use of space , then you should be able to fit as many cars as you can into the space .
If it ’s for the right to park on the street , well , then you ’re just going to keep getting tickets if you try to double up .

Making of “ Geldvermehrung ” ( “ Increase In Currency ” )
Andreas Pohl , Creative Director , Optix
When the agency came to us with the idea to show the increase of money on the international market in connection with some kind of sexual relation , we were very enthusiastic .
No doubt , we had to do this !
The goal was to create a world completely made out of banknotes and explicit characters that stood for themselves .
So we spent many days and nights doing a lot of research finding the right objects such as furniture , buildings , bridges , certain landscapes , clothes , etc .
This procedure was followed by style frames in 2D to evoke the right feeling , tone and look for the film while having a special “ origami look ” in the back of our minds .
After we were done creating rough animatics , we could start to fine tune our characters , as well as the different scenarios of the spot .
Our final task was to blend all the scenes , camera tracks and sounds together .
All characters ( Lincoln , Mao and the unknown lady ) were created as 3D characters in Softimage XSI .
Therefore , our designing team engaged in a lot of “ origami studying . ”
To get used to the technique , we spent a lot of time with uncountable folding sessions .
We took dollar and pound notes and folded Origami figures until our hands bled .
Then we were able to start with the digital modeling .
Each character received an individual animation rig .
With this digital skeleton we defined positions , rotations as well as the movements of the particulars .

As you might have read on our website ( or otherwise heard ) , there ’s this new phenomena spreading called the McGangBang .
In doing research ( or whatever you call searching the Internet for info ) for the McGangBang , I came across something else called the McLobster .
Originally , I thought it was a joke .
McDonald ’s is n’t exactly high brow enough to serve Lobster , now is it ?
I ’d consider lobster to be a seafood delicacy .
But I soon came to realize that it indeed was real and began shaking in my boots at the prospect of such a McFood .
To be fair , the McLobster is hardly new .
It ’s been around for several years , but unless you live in Eastern Canada or New England , you might not be aware of the crustaceous cousin of the Filet - o - Fish .
It comes and goes , much like the McRib , and the maritime treat basically represents McDonald ’s take on the venerable lobster roll .
The disturbing mix of lobster and bread is smothered in white “ McLobster sauce ” , which is some combination of mayonnaise , tartar sauce , and possibly some salad dressing .
Shredded lettuce and bits of celery are also included .
Photo below by “ are you gonna eat that ? ”
And in case you ’re wondering , it is real lobster meat in the sandwich .
It ’s actually not priced all that differently from typical lobster rolls , so do n’t be too worried .
Reports indicate that it ’s a decent representation of the sandwich , so maybe you should go out and try a McLobster next time you ’re in New England or the Maritime Provinces of Canada .
And if you ’re French - Canadian , be sure to ask for the McHomard instead .
What ’s the worst that can happen ?
Actually , scratch that last part , you probably do n’t want to think about it too much …
Here are a couple additional McLobster photos :
And if you need further proof of it ’s existence , here ’s a commercial …
Of course , this opens the door to a whole host of regional foods .
I began to wonder , what else I was missing out on living in the D.C. area .
Was there a McGrits ?
A McTofu ?
And really , that ’s just the tip of the iceberg .
What about worldwide ?
Beyond the Pulp Fiction famed Royale with Cheese , what other creations cater to the various cultures around the world .
Here are some examples :
Spam
Location : Hawaii
In the Aloha State , the McDonald ’s Deluxe Breakfast includes Spam along with eggs , rice , and Portuguese Sausage .

Chicken Maharaja Mac/ McCurry
Location : India

The Big Mac morphs into the Chicken Maharaja Mac ( originally a mutton burger ) , containing two grilled chicken patties with a smoke - flavored mayonnaise , fresh onions , tomatoes , and cheddar cheese surrounded by a toasted sesame seeded bun .
Also available in a lamb version .
The McCurry is a rectangular shaped crust that is topped with a creamy sauce ( made without eggs ) , and vegetables and / or meat .
You might also find the Pizza McPuff , which replaces the cream sauce with a tomato - based sauce and is topped like a pizza .
As noted on the menu , the vegetarian dishes ( marked in green ) and meat dishes ( marked in red ) are prepared in separate areas of the restaurant in respect for vegetarians .

What do you think ?
Moderate SafeSearch is on .
The light in the sky is thought to have been a shooting star Security cameras in Northern Ireland may shed some light on the cause of a massive fireball in the sky on Sunday .
The shooting star was reported at about 0030 BST by people living as far apart as Donegal and Cork .
David Moore chairman of Astronomy Ireland said they were fairly certain it was a rock from space which could have landed somewhere in Ireland .
He said they were very keen to hear from anyone who has footage of what is suspected to be a meteor falling .
" We 're fairly certain that it was a rock from space , a meteor which may have dropped a meteorite , " he said .
" We are asking people to send in their reports , so we can triangulate on the path and figure out did it land on Ireland ? "
The last time a meteor was seen over Ireland was in 1999 over Carlow and there was a similar event over the skies of Northern Ireland 30 years earlier .
Mr Moore said that no pictures had yet come to light of the incident , as it only lasted a few seconds .
But , he said , security cameras often captured such explosions in the sky .
" What can happen is security cameras that are filming in car parks or outdoors can catch these shooting stars , these fireballs , accidentally .
So if anybody has any footage of that , we would be delighted to see it .
" We think ... it came from the west across the centre of Ireland , which means everybody would have seen it .
We have reports from Cork and even from up as far as Donegal . "
He said security cameras in Northern Ireland facing towards the south probably would have picked it up .
Anyone who saw it is asked to contact the Astronomy Ireland website on www.astronomy.ie.
" We will publish a report there in a few days , " said Mr Moore .
" We will also predict where any meteorite might have fallen , as we did with Carlow in 1999 .
A lady found the meteorite in a small country lane .
" They will look like melted rocks , probably not very large .
We are looking for objects that would fit , in that particular case , in a mug .
But they could be larger . "

Man , pranks used to be so good .
And not like old Jackass shit , where you ’d light a dude ’s nutsack on fire and run around giggling about it .
Real fucking 5th grade pranks , where you did n’t have to go to a hospital or question your sexuality .
Well , thanks to technology , those days are gone .
Now pre-teens have to spend their idle time sexting each other or skateboarding over my feet when I ’m in line at an ATM .
Below are some of the most famous pranks that technology has killed : Prank phone calls - Back in the days of rotary telephones and cords that were still attached to the wall , executing a perfect prank phone call required little more than a voice change and a telephone book .
You could be a long lost relative , or a nosey neighbor who needed to know if a refrigerator was running .
More advanced techniques involved soundboards that would awkwardly splice conversation together to give the impression that an unsuspecting victim were talking to , say , Arnold Schwarzenegger from Terminator .
And while caller ID was the first true blow to this national pastime , there was always IP Relay .
That is , until some retarded kids started calling 911 with it , and blew the whole thing up for all of us .
Assholes .
Using a universal remote to change someone else ’s channel - Oh , to be 11 - years - old and sneaking around the neighborhood with a concealed item , peeking into windows .
It ’s probably better that DVR technology has rendered this once - famous prank basically obsolete , as taser technology has also vastly improved in the past decade , alongside neighborhood patrols sear jching for window - peeping pervertsust like you .
Jumping into people ’s photos - Before all of this digital technology , you captured your precious moments in one of two ways : slowly , with a roll of film and a pharmacy , or quickly with a blurry , lead - filled Polaroid .
Either way , the results could n’t be undone , which is exactly what pranking shitheads love to hear .
Goofy faces in the background , random middle fingers , imitating sexual gestures ... nothing was off - limits , especially if the photo subjects did n’t know you were in the shot .
Now , unless you possess the stealth of Solid Snake , you can fucking forget about ruining a good moment with anything but your personality .
One delete button later and it ’s back to square one , leaving you to look like the jackass who just pantomimed sucking his own dick for no reason .
Religion - Probably the most well - executed prank of all time , it ’s really a shame to see this one die off .
In its heyday , the global prank of piety was responsible for millions of deaths , countless tales of injustice , and innumerable moments of knee - slapping hilarity at the expense of a heathen .
A lot of right - wing jokesters do n’t like to admit to themselves that this prank is dead , just like how you still get those emails from Nigerian princes .
But , really , once Catholicism had to back off the whole notion of an Earth - centric universe , it was all downhill .
Now there ’s carbon - dating , gene tracing , and Bill Mahr ; all technological advances that prove conclusively that religion is a crock of shit .
It ’s a shame , too .
A lot of people really got some good laughs out of that one for a lot of years .
I mean , look at all that goofy shit we convinced the Pope he needed to wear .
Ha !
Woman wanted boy dead so she could have a baby with her new husband without violating the ' one child ' policy
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
A Chinese court has sentenced a mother to death for hiring a man to strangle her 9 - year - old son so she could have a baby with her new husband without violating the " one child " policy .
Li Yingfang had previously ordered a failed attempt on the life of her young stepdaughter , court officials in Shaanxi , central China , confirmed today .
Population laws introduced three decades ago prevent most couples from having more than one child .
Those who break the rules face strict financial penalties .
The case came as the country 's official media hinted that the government may be discussing reform after it published a survey showing that most women want more than one child .
Li , 36 , gave custody of her son to the boy 's grandmother after her first husband died , an official at a lower court in Weinan confirmed to the Associated Press news agency .
People who remarry may have second children if their new partners are childless .
But Li's second husband had a daughter from his own first marriage , preventing the couple from having a child together legally .
According to Shaanxi Television , Li initially paid Wang Ruijie about 70,000 yuan ( £ 6,900 ) to kill her stepdaughter .
But after the girl resisted and escaped , Li took her own son to a meeting with Wang , who strangled the boy and left his body by a rural road .
The court in Weinan originally imposed a suspended death sentence because Li had suffered from depression after having two abortions because of the population laws .
Such sentences are often commuted to life in prison .
But the higher people 's court in Shaanxi ordered her execution after it ruled her depression was not directly related to her crime .
Wang was given a suspended death sentence .
Both were ordered to pay compensation to the bereaved grandmother .
The survey cited in the Chinese press found that women are increasingly keen to have more than one child .
Its publication may reflect ongoing discussion within the government about how to reform the laws .
The authorities are usually keen to play down opposition to the policy .
" Our research shows that 70.7 % of women would like to have two or more babies , " said Jiang Fan , vice - minister of the National Family Planning Commission , according to China Daily .
" Some mothers think only - children suffer from loneliness and can become spoiled . "
He added that the gender gap among newborns was a " very grave " problem , although the trend had slowed since 2005 .
The ratio remains above 103 - 107 boys to every 100 girls .
The survey said that 83 % of women wanted a son and a daughter .
Last year China 's top family planning official tried to draw a line under the debate , saying the policy would not change substantially over the next decade .
A vice - minister had earlier said officials were carrying out detailed studies into the repercussions of changing the law and that it had become " a big issue among decision makers " .
Exemptions to the " one child " policy are already made for ethnic minority couples , or where both partners are themselves only children .
Some experts believe a uniform two - child policy would be a better solution .
China argues the rules are necessary to prevent a population already approaching 1.4bn from soaring out of control .
But in addition to exacerbating the gender imbalance and accelerating the ageing of the population , it has led to resentment because of wide variations in its enforcement and because the rich have little heed for financial penalties which are crippling to poorer couples .
Another Legal Medical Marijuana Company Now Public ( GFON , CVIV )
Cannabis Science , Inc. ( OTCBB : GFON ) , or Gulf Onshore , Inc. ( GFON ) , is yet another public stock company which is going after the field of legalized medical marijuana .
Just last week the company was called Gulf Onshore and it just changed its name to Cannabis Science , Inc. after acquiring the assets of Cannex Therapeutics LLC about 10 days ago .
Last week the company also announced that it had selected its first pharmaceutical cannabis product for FDA testing .
It was not even two weeks ago that a company called Medical Marijuana , Inc. ( OTC : CVIV ) had pursued a similar strategy in coming public after formerly being called Club Vivanet .
This new company ’s description says that it is at the forefront of medical marijuana research and development , and the company works with world authorities on phytocannabinoid science targeting critical illnesses , and adheres to scientific methodologies to develop , produce , and commercialize phytocannabinoid - based pharmaceutical products .
The company is dedicated to the creation of cannabis - based medicines , both with and without psychoactive properties , to treat disease and the symptoms of disease , as well as for general health maintenance .
This morning we saw a headline that the company had announced its 420 Commemorative Certificate Program and that it has engaged Capital Structure Today to provide it with branding and public / investor awareness services .
In short , you can probably expect to hear more about this company in the form of headlines and news stories .
When we ran the piece about Medical Marijuana , Inc. ( OTC : CVIV ) , we noted , “ If you ever thought that cannabis , pot , weed , or hemp were not going to be applied to a public company , it looks like that has changed . ”
The fact that a second company is now technically public in the field in not even two weeks is just sort of a head scratcher .
This almost seems like something we ’d expect to read in THE ONION , but this now has a real company and it is actually a stock if you count Pink Sheet and OTC stocks as full public companies .
Sometimes the real news is almost more unbelievable than the made - up news .
Whether or not these companies take off is something we wo n’t speculate on .
As we have noted before , there have been stranger things yet .
JON C. OGG
for your version of An Owned Life .
Contracts seem to be a topic of discussion periodically in the M/s world .
There are even instances where I saw contracts used in the D/s relationship .
On the surface , this seems like a valid way to enhance the commitment of a sub / slave .
In reality , it is something totally different .
In my book , An Owned Life , I made reference to the use of contracts .
Here in the United States , we occasionally see these documents come to light .
And they rarely have good results .
To start , the owning of another person , according to statutes , is illegal .
Slavery in any form is forbidden .
A legal contract is only providing evidence that you are engaging in something that is against the law .
We who are in the lifestyle know that submission of one is consensual .
In both the M/s and D/s relationships , there are certain parameters set up which both parties agree to .
This is not forced " ownership " like the traditional image of slavery .
Also , the central premise of our way of life is the exchange of power .
This is something that is agreed upon by the nature of the relationship .
The Dom / Master is in control .
All power is ceded over to that person .
It is the foundation of how the relationship is structured .
This is no different than a traditional relationship where one person is totally dominating .
All power rests with one person .
Contracts only serve to create issues if something goes wrong in the future .
Marriage was involved in the cases I saw come to light .
In these instances , the sub / slave 's divorce attorney introduced the document into evidence to prove damages .
While the relationship was consensual , the court did not look at it that way .
Each time , negative things happened .
I was once told to create a relationship with the end in mind .
It is easy to make decisions when you are in love or when something is new .
Everything is exciting and fresh then .
When relationships fall apart , there are hurt feelings and strong emotions .
Legal documentation only can come back and haunt you .
The M/s ( and D/s ) relationship is a structure that exists without formal paperwork .
Just like some choose to take their vows in front of their Higher Being without getting formally married , so too do we design a relationship that works for us .
There is no need to have something written on paper .
If you see someone promoting this idea on a forum or blog , refer them to this article .
It is a stupid idea without an upside .
Besides , a piece of paper is not going to truly increase your power .
A Dom / MAster 's power is not derived from a contract .
It exists because of the manner in which he ( or she ) conducts each day .
A sub will continue to submit when that person is being controlled in a way that works .
A contract will not offset a lack of ability .

mmalone 's django - caching .
Mike Malone shares code used by Pownce to add QuerySet level caching to Django .
It ’s a smart implementation — a CachingQuerySet class inspects the arguments passed to get ( ) , and if they ’re just a straight forward exact PK lookup hits memcache for the object before hitting the database .
Signals are used to invalidate the cache .
The National Organization for Marriage seems to be ratcheting up its efforts to suppress the audition videos that leaked from its anti-gay - rights " gathering storm " shoot .
According to YouTube , the group has gotten a clip from MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show pulled from the site .
In the segment , which aired Thursday , Maddow criticizes the group 's ad , and shows 40 seconds of the audition tapes .
" We do not know how Human Rights Campaign got access to the audition tapes , but because they did , we do know that pretending to be a straight person hurt by gay marriage is apparently very , very challenging , " she says .
The clip was previous available on YouTube , but now the page says " This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by National Organization for Marriage . "
MSNBC , of course , would have been well within its rights to demand the clip be removed .
But NOM asserting a copyright interest to have a critical newscast scrubbed from the net ?
That sets an extraordinary precedent .
Update : The Rachel Maddow
Show writes in to point out that the clip is still available on MSNBC 's website .
The section on the NOM ad begins at 2:15 .
Update April 14 , 2009 : Rachel Maddow addressed the DMCA take - down on Monday night 's show .
It 's on YouTube ... at the moment .

Discovery - Waltzing Algae ( Or Minueting Volvox , If You Prefer )
Scientists at Cambridge University have discovered that freshwater algae can form stable groupings in which they dance around each other , miraculously held together only by the fluid flows they create .
Their research was published today in Physical Review Letters .
The researchers studied the multicellular organism Volvox carteri , which consists of approximately 1,000 cells arranged on the surface of a spherical matrix about half a millimetre in diameter .
Each of the surface cells has two hair - like appendages known as flagella , whose beating propels the colony through the fluid and simultaneously makes them spin about an axis .
The researchers found that colonies swimming near a surface can form two types of " bound states " ; the " waltz " , in which the two colonies orbit around each other like a planet circling the sun , and the " minuet " , in which the colonies oscillate back and forth as if held by an elastic band between them .

The researchers have developed a mathematical analysis that shows these dancing patterns arise from the manner in which nearby surfaces modify the fluid flow near the colonies and induce an attraction between them .
The observations constitute the first direct visualisations of the flows , which have been predicted to produce such an attraction .
They have been implicated previously in the accumulation of swimming microorganisms such as bacteria and sperm cells near surfaces .
These findings also have implications for clustering of colonies at the air - water interface , where these recirculating flows can enhance the probability of fertilization during the sexual phase of their life cycle .
Professor Raymond E. Goldstein , the Schlumberger Professor of Complex Physical Systems in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics ( DAMTP ) and lead author of the study , said : " These striking and unexpected results remind us not only of the grace and beauty of life , but also that remarkable phenomena can emerge from very simple ingredients . "
Funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) , the work is part of a larger effort to improve our knowledge of evolutionary transitions from single - cell organisms to multicellular ones .
This greater understanding of the nature of self - propulsion and collective behaviour of these organisms promises to elucidate key evolutionary steps toward greater biological complexity .

Moreover , the flagella of Volvox are nearly identical to the cilia in the human body , whose coordinated action is central to many processes in embryonic development , reproduction , and the respiratory system .
For this reason , the study of flagellar organisation has potentially broad implications for human health and disease .
The group was led by Professor Goldstein and included Ph.D. student Knut Drescher , postdoctoral researchers Drs. Idan Tuval and Kyriacos C. Leptos , Professor Timothy J. Pedley of DAMTP , and Prof. Takuji Ishikawa of Tohoku University , Japan .

Source : Wikimedia CommonsIt is fairly common knowledge that the video on your TV is playing at 30 frames per second ( fps ) — unless you live in europe where it is 25 fps .
However , have you ever thought about why these are the frame rates ?
Why not 50 or 100 ?
You probably have n’t , but since I think about moving pictures all day I actually know the answer to this .
The main thing I would like to point out , which some of the geekier of you might already know , is that 30 fps is just an approximation of the actual frame rate of video in the US .
The real framerate is 29.97 fps .
Why this incredibly strange number you say ?
Well , i’ll tell you .
In order to make video play back at a fixed rate there needs to be some kind of timing circuit .
When television was first beginning , there were n’t any of the high tech silcon - based chips that we used for this task today .
So the brilliant engineers back then used the oscillation of AC electricty as the basis for their timing circuit .
In the US , electricity cycles at 60 times per second ( 60 hz . )
So using half of that gives us the frame rate of 30 fps .
( In Europe , electricity flows at 50hz .
50/2 = 25 fps )
So the frame rate of television was actually exactly 30 frames per second at one point in time .
However that all changed when color television was introduced .
When a signal for color information was added to the television transmission there was a big problem .
The color carrier signal was phasing with with the sound carrier signal because they were very close in the spectrum .
This made the picture look un -watchable .
The quick fix they came up with was to reduce the framerate by .03 fps which moved the two signals out of phase .
We have been stuck with this frame rate ever since .
So I hope you found that educational .
If you really want to read about this on a more technical level read the link at the bottom of this story .
I checked here to refresh my memory on some of the details .

Paramedic tried to buy wine wearing only his thong after supermarket staff ' refused to serve him in uniform '
A paramedic was facing disciplinary action today after he walked into a supermarket crowded with shoppers wearing just a thong .
The ambulanceman had been on duty when he strode defiantly into the Tesco store wearing just the underwear and a pair of socks after staff refused to serve him while he was wearing his ambulance uniform .
Police were called in and interviewed the medic about his actions which were said to have left shop staff and customers embarrassed and stunned .
Supermarket showdown : The Tesco store in Addlestone , Surrey , where a paramedic stripped down to his thong and socks after being refused alcohol because he was wearing his uniform
The man , aged in his 40's , had walked into the large Tesco shop at Addlestone , Surrey wearing his full all - in - one green coloured ambulance uniform .
He selected a bottle of wine but become annoyed when the check - out assistant told him it was the store 's policy not to sell alcohol to people wearing uniform .
The paramedic then stormed out of the shop , walked to his vehicle in the car park and took off his uniform .
However , he did n't stop there - and stripped right down to the thong and pair of socks he was wearing .
Then he walked back into the shop and asked the same cashier :
' Now , I 'm not wearing my uniform any more .
Will you serve me now ? '
The assistant refused and the manager was called , along with the police .
Refused :
Tesco would not serve the man while wearing his full ambulance uniform ( posed by models )
Rachael Monkton , who had been in the Tesco store shopping when the incident took place , said : ' He was shopping with a woman when the girl at the check - out said she could n't let him buy alcohol .
' He got a bit agitated and the manager was called over but she took the side of her employee .
' So the paramedic stormed out , leaving the woman at the tills and when he came back he was just in his underwear .
' People were staring at him and laughing - I could n't believe my eyes .
Normally people would pay to see a man in uniform strip but we got a free show , ' added Rachael .
A spokesman for Tesco confirmed that it was company policy not to serve members of the emergency services if they were wearing uniform and stood by the cashier 's actions .
' It is absolutely right that the cashier did not serve him when he was in uniform but what happened afterwards was unprecedented , ' he said .
' We realise that the customer may not have understood why he was refused alcohol but it was simply a member of our staff following company policy and the actions which followed were wholly unnecessary , ' the spokesman added .
The paramedic , who is employed by the South East Coast Ambulance NHS Trust , Surrey division , was understood to have been spoken to by his managers and to be facing the possibility of suspension and disciplinary action .
It was the second time in as many months that a customer at the Addlestone branch of Tesco has stripped in the store in protest at actions of the staff .
In February , 68 - year - old Norman Matthews took off his clothes after being wrongly accused of stealing a scratch card from the customer service desk .

Buddha , Dharma , Sangha From the Ultimate Point of View
This is a translation of the Tibetan Root - text : Mahayanauttaratantrashastra ( Tib. Gyu Lama ) . by Maitreya through Asanga
THE BUDDHA
Homage to the Buddha
The state of a Buddha has no beginning , middle or end .
It is perfect peace .
Buddhahood itself is fully self - awakened and unfolded ( by means of non-dual , primordial wisdom ) .
Having attained enlightenment a Buddha fearlessly shows the path of permanence ( of the Dharmakaya ) in order to bring realisation to those without realisation .
He wields the supreme sword of knowledge and the vajra of compassion and cuts down the sprout of suffering .
Also he destroys the walls of doubt which are surrounded by the thick forest of the various mistaken views .
In front of the Buddha I bow down .
The state of a Buddha is endowed with two kinds of benefit , the benefit for oneself and the benfit for others :
· It is non-composite , spontaneously present and not realised through external conditions .
· It is endowed with knowledge , compassionate love and the capacity to help sentient beings .
Buddhahood is non-composite , because by nature it is free from beginning , middle or end .
It is said to be spontaneously present , because it is perfect peace , possession of the Dharmakaya .
It is not realised through external conditions , because the self - cognizant primordial wisdom is to be realised by oneself .
It is knowledge , because it is realisation of the three previous qualities .
It is compassionate love , because it shows the path .
It is the capacity to help sentient beings , because it removes the suffering and the obscuring states through primordial wisdom and compassion .
The first three qualities make up the benefit for oneself , the latter three the benefit for others .
THE DHARMA
Homage to the Dharma
The Dharma is neither non-existent , nor existent , not a combination of existence and non-existence , nor something different from existence and non-existence .
It can not be examined nor pointed out through definitions and it can only be understood by self - cognizing wisdom .
It is perfect peace .
The Dharma is stainless , illuminating by the light of primordial wisdom .
It completely overcomes all attachment towards ( attractive ) objects , aversion towards ( unattractive ) objects and ignorance towards ( neutral ) objects .
In front of the true Dharma , which is like the sun , I bow down .
The Dharma has the characteristics of the two truths , the Truth of Cessation and the Truth of the Path :
· It is inconceivable , without the two ( roots of samsara ) and non-conceptual .
· It is pure , illuminating and has the capacity to be a remedy against obscuring states .
The Truth of Cessation is freedom from attachment and the Truth of the Path is the method which removes the attachment .
The Dharma can be summarised into these two aspects .
One should know that these two have three qualities each which are presented in the above order .
The Dharma is inconceivable , because it cannot be analysed by ordinary thinking ( in terms of the four alternatives ) , because it cannot be expressed through words and because it can only be understood by the wisdom of realised beings ( the Noble Ones ) .
It is without the two , because ( karma and obscuring states have been ) pacified .
It is non-conceptual , ( free from the causes of obscuring states ) .
Also the Dharma has the three qualities of being pure , etc ..
( Purity means being free from disturbing emotions and habitual tendencies , illuminating means to be free from conceptual obscurations and the capacity to be a remedy means that it functions as an antidote against all obscuring states . )
Therefore it is like the sun .
THE SANGHA
Homage to the Sangha
Because they have realised the Clear Light - nature of the mind , ( the Bodhisattvas ) see that the obscuring states have no essence at all .
Therefore , after having perfectly realised the peace which is the ultimate selflessness in all sentient beings , they see that all beings are pervaded by perfect buddhahood .
The Bodhisattvas have mastered intelligence which is free from veils .
Their primordial wisdom has as its object the completely pure nature which is present in limitless sentient beings .
In front of the Sangha I bow down .

The crew of the upcoming Hubble servicing mission have not only been busy training for all contingencies of spaceflight on the shuttle and telescope repair ( have you been following Astro_ Mike on Twitter ? ) but they ’ve also been training for the big screen .
The REALLY big screen .
NASA announced today that the crew will be using IMAX 3 - D cameras to document this most complex of space shuttle operations — the final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope .
And in another bit of news , in a show of solidarity and support of the shuttle astronauts , astronomers from the University of Alabama are encouraging everyone to “ raise a wing ” to the Hubble repair crew .
The IMAX 3 - D cameras will launch aboard space shuttle Atlantis , which is scheduled to lift off May 11 .
Astronauts will use the cameras to film five spacewalks needed to repair and upgrade Hubble .
The IMAX footage will be combined with images from Hubble itself to create a new IMAX producton , “ Hubble 3D , ” set for release in spring 2010 .
“ We have worked with IMAX on past Hubble missions and are excited about working with them again on the current Hubble mission .
The Hubble Space Telescope continues to dazzle us with the splendor of our universe , and after the mission we look forward to many more years of awe - inspiring imagery , ” said Bob Jacobs , NASA ’s acting assistant administrator for public affairs at NASA Headquarters in Washington .
“ IMAX has developed innovative 3 - D image capture and projection technology that creates a large - scale , immersive educational experience in which those of us on the ground are no longer passive observers of spaceflight , we ’re active participants . ”
The IMAX team has trained Atlantis ’ crew at NASA ’s Johnson Space Center in Houston to operate the cameras .
One will be mounted outside the crew cabin in the shuttle ’s cargo bay to capture IMAX 3 - D images of the historic final servicing mission .
The commander and pilot will double as filmmakers as two teams of spacewalking astronauts — working in tandem with the shuttle ’s robotic arm — perform some of the most challenging work ever undertaken in space as they replace and refurbish many of the telescope ’s precision instruments .
And now for more on “ raising a wing ” to the crew , which came to us via Pamela Gay : Dr. William Keel of the University of Alabama Department of Physics and Astronomy is planning to head to the local Buffalo Wild Wings to watch NASA TV during the Hubble repair mission ’s EVAs .
This is perhaps astronomy ’s “ championship ” event , and instead of the Final Four , it ’s the final Hubble servicing mission .
Keel will be watching with colleagues and students to take in the EVAs and perhaps even raise a Wild Wing in salute of the astronauts achievements .
On her Starstryder blog , Gay says , “ While this idea started in Tuscaloosa , there is no reason for it to end there .
Many restaurants and bars have cable television packages that include NASA TV .
Next week , grab a friend and grab a beverage and ask the guy behind the bar to tune the TV into the greatest high risk game of all :
It ’s Man versus the Machine as Mike Massimino and the STS - 125 team of astronauts upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope . ”

I added curiousprogrammer.wordpress.com to my emacs feed in bloglines after finding a cool tip that helps me out particularly with Django programming in Emacs .
One of the cool things about Emacs is that it's not just a text - editor , it 's a whole ecosystem of code ( or as the joke goes - a pretty cool operating system with a crappy built - in text editor ) .
In exploring all the extensibility though - the built in major and minor modes , the many external modes available - it 's easy to forget how much can be customised by setting a few variables .
I did n't even realise how much it was annoying me but the default way Emacs handles duplicate buffer names is kind of dumb .
If you have multiple files with the same names the first buffer gets the filename and subsequent buffers get an index value .
This is n't a problem in most editing tasks - you occasionally see a choice of switching between foo .py and foo .
py < 1 > and have to remember which is which .
In most code editing I do I do n't have many identically named files .
Django , however , makes this a little more annoying - each django app I have open has it's own models .py , views .py and likely a urls .py file .
When I 'm working simultaneously in several apps at once it 's confusing every time I go to switch buffers ...
Thanks to this post , however , I added the following lines to my .emacs :
( require ' uniquify ) ( setq uniquify - buffer - name - style ' reverse ) ( setq uniquify - separator " / " ) ( setq uniquify - after - kill - buffer - p t ) ( setq uniquify - ignore - buffers - re " ^\\ * " )
And now see a choice between views .
py / app1 , views .py / app2 , and views .
py / app3 when switching buffers .
Uniquify is comes with Gnu Emacs so there 's nothing you need to install to scratch this particular itch .
Update : thanks to commenter Van Gale Van Gale for the catch - I added the necessary require line above .
I also should have noted that this is built in on my Emacs 23 packaged by Ubuntu 8.10 - YMMV .

hen President Obama took office , it was popular opinion to say that black male stereotypes effectively died with that historic event .
But have they ?
The apt - named " Obama effect " is not really taking hold in some of the heartland as evidenced by recent headlines as women continue to be entertained by those who you could n't leave an empty purse around .
BET , which prided itself in covering inauguration activities , has reverted to repeated and familiar portrayals of black men in sagging pants and huge T - shirts , etc .
Thug music has n't changed either .
Many of the artists that were hot before Obama became a household word have n't changed their style at all .
When will the media outlets display ' change ' we can believe in ?
Should thug love survive ?
Cities and counties are reporting a sharp increase in homeless families as the economic crisis leads to job loss and makes housing unaffordable .
In Seattle , 40 % more people are living on suburban streets .
In Miami , calls from people with eviction notices have quadrupled .
" The demand from families with children has increased dramatically , " says Robert Hess of New York City 's Department of Homeless Services .
Each month since September , shelter requests have been at least 20 % higher than they were a year ago .
The Department of Housing and Urban Development requires a one - day count in January of people living on the street , in shelters or in transitional housing .
National figures have not been compiled .
Of 56 places where figures were available , 35 reported an increase in homelessness ; 12 had a drop .
" People who were on the edge can't hold on anymore , " says Cathy ten Broeke homelessness project coordinator in Minneapolis and Hennepin County .
She says 1,251 families sought emergency shelter last year , up from 1,032 in 2007 .
•
In Chicago , calls to a homelessness prevention hotline were 59 % higher in February than a year earlier , says Nancy Radner , head of the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness .
" We 're getting requests from people earning more than $ 30,000 a year , even $ 65,000 .
That 's unprecedented . "
•
In Los Angeles , 620 families used the winter shelter program this winter , compared with 330 families a year earlier , manager David Martel says .
•
In the Phoenix area , 230 people in families were living on the street in January ; there were 49 a year ago .
There were 139 children younger than 18 living on the street on their own , according to the Maricopa Association of Governments .
•
In Miami -Dade County , the number of people calling for help after getting an eviction notice jumped from 1,000 in 2007 to 4,000 last year , David Raymond of the county 's Homeless Trust says .
" We 've beefed up our prevention efforts , " he says , so fewer people become homeless .
•
In the Seattle area , street homelessness increased 2 % overall but 40 % in the suburbs , where the number living in cars rose from 229 last year to 339 , homelessness project director Bill Block says .
Several of the largest cities , including New York and Miami , say their increased efforts to find apartments or shelter beds have meant fewer people living on the street or in their cars .
Hess expects more people to need help this year and looks forward to a sharp increase in federal funding : $ 1.5 billion this summer is intended to help struggling people pay their rent , utilities or security deposits so they do n't end up homeless .
Homeless population in major cities The Department of Housing and Urban Development required every city and county to do a one - day count in January of people living on the street , in shelters or in transitional housing .
Not all jurisdictions have reported results yet .
A sampling of the findings : Boston
The homeless count rose 11 % from 2007 to 7,681 in 2008 , including a jump in the number of people living on the street from 184 to 219 .
" What we 've seen is a significant increase in family homelessness for the fourth consecutive year , says Jim Greene , director of Boston 's Emergency Shelter Commission , citing a 23 % increase in the number of families in shelters and transitional housing .
Chicago
The city has not released its count .
The homelessness prevention hotline received 59 % more calls last month than in February 2008 , says Nancy Radner , head of the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness .
Cincinnati
The count was largely unchanged : 1,128 compared with 1,133 a year earlier .
" We had really bad weather this year , " so a cold - weather shelter was open the night of the count , says Kevin Finn , executive director of the Cincinnati - Hamilton County Continuum of Care for the Homeless .
As a result , he says , the street count fell from 55 to 35 , but the emergency shelter number rose from 649 to 686 .
The number of people in temporary apartments declined slightly , he says , because " we do n't have enough transitional housing .
Des Moines
The count was 1,129 , down slightly from 1,138 a year before .
The street count fell from 135 to 58 , but the sheltered count rose from 1,003 to 1,071 .
The number of sheltered families changed little because " there are not a lot of family beds , says David Eberbach , associate director of the Iowa Institute for Community Alliance , a non-profit organization that tracks homelessness .
The city has one shelter that will take entire families and one that will take women with children .
Los Angeles
The city has not released its tally , but " there are definitely more families seeking help , says Rebecca Isaacs , executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority .
This winter , 620 families used its winter shelter program , up from 330 families the previous year .
Miami -Dade County
The homelessness count fell from 4,574 a year ago to 4,333 this year because fewer people are living on the street .
" Our shelter population is growing , says David Raymond , executive director of the Miami - Dade County Homeless Trust .
He says the city is spending more money not only to house the homeless but also to help people stay in their homes .
The number of people calling for help after getting an eviction notice jumped from 1,000 in 2007 to 4,000 last year , he says .
Minneapolis- Hennepin County
The county has released only its street count , reporting that it fell from 300 last year to 235 this year .
That included 34 unaccompanied youth .
The drop was due to greater efforts to shelter the homeless , says Cathy ten Broeke of the Office to End Homelessness in Minneapolis and Hennepin County .
" We 're seeing more families in our shelters , she says — 1,032 families in 2007 and 1,251 last year .
New Orleans
The city has not finished tabulating , but the number may not mean much , says Martha Kegel , executive director of UNITY of Greater New Orleans , a non-profit group .
She says an estimated 5,000 people are living in abandoned buildings , and it 's impossible to count them in a 24 - hour period .
Not all the emergency shelter beds available before Hurricane Katrina in 2005 have been restored .
New York City
The count was largely unchanged : 37,448 this year compared with 37,415 in 2008 .
The number living on the street fell sharply from 3,306 last year to 2,328 because of increased efforts to provide shelter beds and apartments , says Robert Hess , commissioner of the city 's Department of Homeless Services .
Philadelphia
The overall count rose 1 % to 6,915 , but the street count fell 10 % to 457 .
The city offered overnight cafes , drug treatment beds and other resources , says Roberta Cancellier , deputy director of the Office of Supportive Housing .
Those efforts " mitigated what would have been a greater increase , she says .
The city saw a 5 % increase to 3,561 in the number of people in families with children who were in shelters or transitional housing .
Phoenix - Maricopa County
The county has released only its street count , which shows a 20 % increase from a year earlier to 2,918 people .
" The biggest change we 've seen is with families , says Brande Mead of the Maricopa Association of Governments .
The number of people in families on the street rose from 49 to 230 and the number of youth on their own jumped from 40 to 139 .
Portland , Oregon
The city has not released its count but expects a slight increase from two years ago despite increased housing efforts , says Sally Erickson , Portland 's homeless program manager .
She says the recession 's effect started showing up a year ago .
Reno area
Its street count fell from 98 in 2007 to 55 in 2009 , but the number in shelters or transitional housing jumped from 621 to 859 , according to Kelly Marschall , head of Social Entrepreneurs Inc. , which coordinates care for the homeless .
She says two - thirds list unemployment or job loss as the main reason for their homelessness .
San Antonio
The count fell substantially from 4,063 last year to 3,303 this year , but the difference may be due largely to fewer shelters reporting and a change in methodology , says Mario Resendiz of the Department of Community Initiatives .
Seattle - King County
The county has not released its total .
This year 's number of street dwellers rose 2 % overall but 40 % in the suburbs , says Bill Block , project director of the Committee to End Homelessness In King County .
Washington , D.C.
The total homeless count rose 3 % from 2008 to 6,228 .
The number of adults on the street fell 15 % to 321 , but the number of families in emergency and transitional housing rose 20 % to 703 .

I 've been playing around with Nanojit , thinking about using it in a toy project of mine .
Nanojit is a library for generating machine code with backends for x86 and ARM .
It 's used by Tamarin ) and TraceMonkey for their just in time compilers .
The Mozilla documentation contains some documentation which gives an overview of what 's there :
Currently Nanojit seems to be directly included in both the Tamarin and Mozilla repositories .
To make it easy to reuse in my various test projects I split out the nanojit code and put it in a github repository .
The build is a simple makefile and is only setup for x86 since that 's that platform I 'm trying it on for now .
In the ' example ' directory of the nanojit github repository is the example from the Mozilla documentation .
This is what I 'm basing my usage of it from .
As a simple test of using it I wrote an expression evaluator .
You enter simple mathematical expressions using addition , subtraction , multiplication and division at the command line and it compiles the expression into machine code using nanojit and calls it to get the result .
I started with an interpreter first and added the compiling once that was working .
To parse the expressions I used Ian Piumarta 's Parsing Expression Grammar library .
I tweaked it a bit to be able to use it from C ++.
The grammar is simple and produces a basic Abstract Syntax tree :
Expr = lhs : Product ( " + " rhs : Product { lhs = new Add ( lhs , rhs ) ; } | " - " rhs : Product { lhs = new Subtract ( lhs , rhs ) ; } ) * { $ $ = lhs } Product = lhs : Value ( " * " rhs : Value { lhs = new Multiply ( lhs , rhs ) ; } | " / " rhs : Value { lhs = new Divide ( lhs , rhs ) ; } ) * _ { $ $ =lhs } Value = Number _ Number = < [ 0 - 9 ] + ( '. ' [ 0 - 9 ] + ) ?> { $ $ = new Number ( atof ( yytext ) ) ; }
Running this through the ' leg ' program produces C code that can be included in the project to compile the expression entered by the user .
The interpreter just walks over the AST , calling an ' eval ' method , to produce the result .
Code looks like :
float Number : : eval ( ) { return value ; } float Add:eval ( ) { return lhs -> eval ( ) + rhs ->eval ( ) ; } float Subtract : eval ( ) { return lhs ->eval ( ) - rhs ->eval ( ) ; } float Multiply : eval ( ) { return lhs ->eval ( ) * rhs ->eval ( ) ; } float Divide:eval ( ) { return lhs ->eval ( ) / rhs ->eval ( ) ; } int main ( ) { Object* result = parse ( ) ; cout << " Result : " << result ->eval ( ) << endl ; return 0 ; }
Converting this to generate machine code and call it is pretty easy .
Instead of an ' eval ' method I created a ' compile ' method .
' compile ' takes an object as an argument that I call methods on to generate Nanojit intermediate representation ( LIR ) .
It returns the resulting generated LIR instruction .
The code for the Number AST object looks like :
LIns * Number : : compile( LirWriter * writer ) { return writer -> ins Immf( value ) ; }
The LirWriter object contains methods to generate LIR code .
For Number we generate an immediate float value and return a pointer to the generated instruction .
The operators are implemented in a similar manner .
I 'll just show the code for Add :
LIns * Add :: compile( LirWriter* writer ) { LIns * a = lhs -> compile ( writer ) ; LIns * b = rhs -> compile ( writer ) ; return writer -> ins2 ( LIR_fadd , a , b ) ; }
Here we compile the left and right hand sides of the expression , saving pointers to the generated instructions .
Then we generate a ' float add ' LIR instruction .
This is passed the instructions that were generated for the left and right parts of the expression .
By calling compile on the topmost AST object we end up generating the code for the entire expression .
The code required to set up Nanojit and create the LirWriter is a bit more complicated .
Most of what I did was copy and pasted from the example code .
Basically I create a Fragmento object and a LirBuffer .
Then each time an expression is entered I create a Fragment object which will contain the final generated code and a LirBufferWriter which is the base LirWriter object used by the ' compile ' methods .
LirWriter 's can be added to a LirBufferWriter to form a pipeline that instructions go through to do different things like optimisation or output debugging code before ending up in the LirBuffer .
After this I generate a ' start ' instruction , call the ' compile ' method to do the rest , and generate a required epilogue instruction :
Fragmento * fragmento = new ( gc ) Fragmento ( &core , 20 ) ; LirBuffer * buf = new ( gc ) LirBuffer ( fragmento , NULL ) ; ... Object* result = parse ( ) ; ... Fragment *f = new ( gc ) Fragment ( NULL ) ; LirBufWriter writer ( buf ) ; ... writer.ins0( LIR_start ) ; writer.ins1( LIR_fret , result -> compile ( &writer ) ) ; ... f->lastIns = writer.insGuard(LIR_loop , writer.insImm( 1 ) , rec_ins ) ; // Compile the fragment .
compile ( fragmento->assm( ) , f ) ; // Call the compiled function .
typedef JS_FASTCALL float ( * ExprFunction ) ( ) ; ExprFunction fn = reinterpret_cast < ExprFunction >( f-> code ( ) ) ; cout << " Result : " << fn ( ) << endl ;
The expression evaluator interpreter and compiler example can be downloaded and played with by cloning my ' play ' repository on github .
Once cloned you 'll need to initialize and update the submodules to pull in the nanojit and peg third party libraries that it uses :
$ git clone git://github.com/doublec/play.git $ cd play $ git submodule init $ git submodule clone
Run ' make ' in the ' expr - interpreter ' and ' expr- compiler ' directories and run the ' expr ' program that results .
If you compile both nanojit and expr-compiler with DEBUG defined you get some debug output .
It show 's the LIR and the assembler code generated .
For example , the LIR for : 2+3+4*2 is :
start # 40000000:0 /* 2 */ #40080000:0 /* 3 */ fadd1 = fadd # 0x40000000:0 , #0x40080000:0 # 40100000:0 /* 4 */ #40000000:0 /* 2 */ fmul1 = fmul #0x40100000:0 , #0x40000000:0 fadd2 = fadd fadd1 , fmul1 ret fadd2</ pre>
The assembly code generated for this is :< pre>mov - 8( ebp ) , 0 mov - 4(ebp ) ,1073741824 mov - 16(ebp ) , 0 mov - 12(ebp ) ,1074266112 fldq - 16 ( ebp ) fadd - 8( ebp ) f0(#0x40080000:0 ) fstpq - 8 ( ebp ) f0 ( fadd1 ) mov - 16 ( ebp ) ,0 mov - 12(ebp ) ,1074790400 mov - 24 ( ebp ) ,0 mov - 20 ( ebp ) ,1073741824 fldq - 24 ( ebp ) fmul - 16 ( ebp ) f0(#0x40000000:0 ) fadd - 8 ( ebp ) f0 ( fmul1 )
It 's easy to change the code to use integer math instead of floating point .
Use LIR_ret instead of LIR_fret for the return , and use LIR_add , LIR_sub , etc .
This is the assembly code generated for 2+3+4* 2 using integer math :

The quest to save the planet …
Is it really about saving the planet or saving ourselves ?
In either case , a Texas restaurant and bar chain called Little Woodrow ’s has a motive I can definitely get behind :
How about you ?
I ca n’t remember how I came across the above picture , but I knew I had to post it .
In reality , I probably came across it via Twitter or StumbleUpon .
The question I posed above stems somewhat from an incredible George Carlin video , completely worthy of the 7:00 + minutes it takes to view it .
In it , he makes the point that the Earth has been here long before man , and will be here long after man .
His bit goes on to say that our fight to “ save the planet ” is actually a fight to “ save ourselves ” .
Is it ?
Even if it is , and I think George would agree , beer is a creation of humanity worth saving eh ?
If you ’re going to join the masses of people who have enjoyed beer since around 9,000 BC , why not enjoy an organic variety ?

Do tell , do tell …
I have been following drug policy for – eek – more than twenty years .
While there have always been a few brave , high - profile journalists and pundits who dared to question the drug war , for the most part , the American press has been as gung - ho in cheering it on as our politicians .
Now – with the Mexican drug war completely out of control , with Afghanistan supplying 90 % of the world ’s opium and with an economy in collapse , the media has finally begun to seriously question our approach .
In just the last week , Time , the LA Times , the NY Daily News , Denver Post , Orange County Register , Miami Herald and San Francisco Chronicle have all called for a drug policy re-think – or for outright marijuana legalization .
Day - in , day - out , for years , we ’ve seen stories about arrests , about drug seizures , about addicts and treatment .
But virtually all coverage just reinforces conventional wisdom : treatment stories tend to boost a particular method without looking at the data or lack of data supporting it , cops and dealer stories tend to hype the amount of drugs seized and rarely look into the long term impact of such busts .
“ Science ” stories tend to conflate correlation and cause – and fail to note contrary evidence .
[ In the instance of the linked story , if marijuana causes psychosis , why has n’t psychosis increased with the worldwide rise in marijuana use since the 60’s ? ]
And of course , every so often we get a big wave of stories about a dangerous , new drug that ’s more addictive than anything that preceded it which menaces our youth and calls for a crackdown .
Those “ drug menace ” stories used to sell papers – but on the internet , it is trivially easy to search and find that while this year , methamphetamine is the most addictive and dangerous drug , last year , it was Oxycontin and ten years ago , the same was said of crack .
Meanwhile , the last drug did n’t addict all youth or collapse our society ( bankers managed that all by themselves ) , so why should this one ?
For years , virtually every internet discussion of drug policy has been dominated by drug policy reformers and outright legalization advocates – but this growing sentiment amongst the most educated and connected went unreported .
Maybe the MSM is finally waking up – they can no longer simply create and re-enforce conventional wisdom .
When the facts about drugs are only a few clicks away , the propaganda loses its luster .
Given that the vast majority of journalists have smoked pot and at least a third of those in their 40’s or up have probably taken cocaine without significant problems , does it really make sense for them to go on carrying water for the drug warriors , worrying about “ the children ” and infantilizing their audiences by repeating myths that many must know themselves to be untrue ?
Will we finally dump the tired “ gateway drug ” nonsense about marijuana and the ridiculous “ not your father ’s marijuana ” idea that in the 60’s and 70 ’s marijuana was n’t dangerous and now it is ?
This is not at all to imply that marijuana has no risks or that addiction can’t do terrible harm – but it ’s time to put risks in context and look at whether the solutions cause more harm than the problem they ’re intended to solve .
The media does still have significant power to shape policy and public opinion – it simply can no longer sustain myths .
If it starts to turn on the drug war and raise questions about other policies that have been seen as untouchable despite utter failure , maybe people will start to trust it again , too .

“ We are trying to provide the antidote for the consumer rebellion against interruptive advertising , ” says Sheryl Sandberg , Facebook ’s chief operating officer and Mr. Zuckerberg ’s business consigliere .
Ms. Sandberg , who ran Google ’s highly successful advertising initiatives before leaving the search giant to join Facebook , said her company ’s revenue was growing despite a brutal downturn that is hurting other kinds of online advertising .
She also puts one rumor to rest , saying the company is not considering charging members for any aspect of its service .
“ We ’re pretty pleased with the overall trajectory , ” she says .
“ Our conversations with big advertisers have broadened in scope and we also have more people asking about how they can work with us . ”
Facebook recently introduced advertising tools to let companies focus on users based on the language they use on the site and their geographic location .
So , for example , an advertiser can now tailor a message to the Latino community in Los Angeles or French speakers in Montreal .
Despite the gloom permeating much of the advertising world , and the formidable challenges facing the site , some advertisers say they glimpse the future in Facebook ’s brand of interactive advertising .
“ Our clients all want to see if they can make this work , ” says Al Cadena , the interactive account director at Threshold Interactive in Los Angeles , which represents companies like Nestlé , Honda and Sony .
“ Advertising used to be a one - way communication from advertiser to consumer , but now people want to have a dialogue .
And Facebook is becoming the default way to do that , not only in the States but really for the whole world . ”
Internet evangelists say that when a technology diffuses into society , as Facebook appears to be doing , it has achieved “ critical mass . ”
The sheer presence of all their friends , family and colleagues on Facebook creates potent ties between users and the site  ties that are hard to break even when people want to break them .
According to reports , Apple is planning to cut its laptop , the MacBook , by around $ 100 - $ 150 .
It 's as much a response to the competition from netbooks as to the recession .
The main source of the rumors is the usually reliable Appleinsider.com site .
It says Apple 's plans to develop a tablet computer -- perhaps like a much larger iPod Touch -- will wind up taking longer than expected .
( Source : appleinsider.com )
That 's a blow to plans that the tablet will stop users defecting to netbooks , the increasingly popular slimmed - down laptops which offer basic functionality , notably web surfing , at a budget price .
Until the tablet is available , Apple is reportedly hoping to deter defectors by dropping prices , most notably on the 13 inch MacBook .
The cuts , which may also extend to the iMac desktop , will likely be in the $ 100 to $ 150 range .
( Source : cnn.com )
Price War Unlikely
Price cuts would be a major change in tactics for Apple .
When it avoided significant reductions in the prices of its last range of new models , it appeared clear the firm was not interested in competing on price and instead wanted to position itself as a premium brand .
If the price cut rumors are true , they will inevitably be seen as a response to the recent stinging advertising campaign by Microsoft which uses ' ordinary shoppers ' to directly attack Macs as overpriced .
Unfamiliar Territory for Premium Apple Brand
Whether the price cuts would work is another question .
Even with the full $ 150 reduction , the 13 inch MacBook would still cost around $ 849 .
That 's more than double some of the most popular netbooks , and still exceeds many if not most PC laptops .
However , while Apple may be eager to promote its newly priced computers as offering good value , the problem is that the firm will likely never cut costs enough to satisfy buyers driven mainly by price , simply because Apple 's brand strategy does not allow its products to appear ' cheap ' .
London cops have been given the power to " disperse " anyone under 16 , gathered in groups of two or more , from almost all of central London , after 9 PM .
The police do n't have to see the kids doing anything wrong , they only have to believe " the presence or behaviour of a group of two or more persons in any public place in the relevant locality has resulted , or is likely to result , in any members of the public being intimidated , harassed , alarmed or distressed . "
If you 're observant , in central London , you may have seen this notice casually cable - tied to a lamppost .
From afar , it looks like a council planning application , or parking bay suspension .
It 's actually notifying you that you 're now subject to an anti-social behaviour order , and the Police ( and the not - really - Police Community Support Officers ) have special powers to remove you from this area if they feel like it .
These dispersal areas cover large swathes of London , and other cities in England .
There are now over 1000 such areas .
It 's ambiguously worded , but it institutes law that in other words may not seem so palatable .
There 's a curfew for unsupervised under - 16s , from 9 pm to 6 am .
Any group of 2 or more people can be broken up and / or that the member of the group have to leave the designated area ( if they do not live there ) .
Crucially , police do not have to see actual anti-social behaviour , but a constable in uniform has reasonable grounds for believing that the presence or behaviour of a group of two or more persons in any public place in the relevant locality has resulted , or is likely to result , in any members of the public being intimidated , harassed , alarmed or distressed …
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A new poll indicates Americans do n't agree with former Vice President Dick Cheney 's recent assertion that President Obama 's actions have increased the chances of a terrorist attack against the United States .
A new poll , conducted April 3 - 5 , shows support for President Obama 's plans in Afghanistan .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey also suggests that most people support the president 's plans in Afghanistan -- up to a point .
Seventy - two percent of those questioned in the poll , which was released Monday , disagree with Cheney 's view that some of Obama 's actions have put the country at greater risk , with 26 percent agreeing with the former vice president .
In a March 15 interview on CNN's " State of the Union with John King , " Cheney said the Bush administration 's anti-terror strategies " were absolutely essential to the success we enjoyed of being able to collect the intelligence that led us to defeat all further attempts to launch attacks against the United States since 9/11 . "
" I think that 's a great success story , " Cheney said .
" President Obama campaigned against it all across the country .
And now he is making some choices that , in my mind , that will in fact raise the risk to the American people of another attack . "
Vice President Joe Biden , in an interview last week with CNN's Wolf Blitzer , fired back , calling Cheney " dead wrong . "
On CNN's " The Situation Room , " Biden also said that the previous administration left the United States in a " weaker posture than we 've been any time since World War II : less regarded in the world , stretched more thinly than we ever have been in the past , two wars under way , virtually no respect in certain parts of the world . "
" We are more safe .
We are more secure , " he added .
" Our interests are more secure , not just at home , but around the world .
We are rebuilding America 's ability to lead . "
Keating Holland , CNN polling director , pointed out the partisan divide evident in the results .
" By a 53 percent to 46 percent margin , Republicans agree with Dick Cheney , " he said .
" But more than nine in 10 Democrats believe that Obama has not made the country less safe from terrorism .
They are joined by more than seven in 10 independents who do n't see an increase in the threat from terrorism since Obama took office . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted April 3 - 5 , before an American cargo ship captain was taken hostage by Somali pirates , and before Sunday 's successful action by the U.S. Navy to free the captain .
The poll also indicates that a majority of Americans , 53 percent , favor the war in Afghanistan , with 46 percent opposed .
And more than two - thirds of those questioned back the president 's plan to send roughly 20,000 more U.S. troops to the war - torn country , with 31 percent opposed to sending more American forces to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan .
Two out of three say they have a clear idea of what the United States is fighting for in Afghanistan .
But Americans seem to be willing to go only so far .
If Obama announced plans to send even more U.S. troops to Afghanistan , the poll suggests that 52 percent would oppose the move , with 45 percent in favor .
And even fewer want to see American action in neighboring Pakistan , a U.S. ally .
If U.S. troops in Afghanistan were to find enemy soldiers in Pakistan , only 37 percent of those questioned think the United States should take military action without first getting permission from the Pakistani government .
Sixty - one percent oppose such a move .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll of 1,023 Americans was conducted by telephone , and has a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
All About September 11 Attacks • Dick Cheney • Barack Obama
Representative Collin Peterson is furious that the Environmental Protection Agency is doing its job .
The Minnesota Democrat says the agency is trying to kill off the biofuels industry  to the dismay of the corn farmers and ethanol producers he represents .
He has vowed to vote against any bill , including climate change legislation , that might require the involvement of the E.P.A .
What inspired this tirade was an E.P.A. draft proposal showing how it intended to measure the greenhouse gas emissions from corn ethanol and other renewable fuels .
The agency said it will not make any final rules until it completes further research , but its preliminary findings were not flattering to corn ethanol .
The E.P.A. was only doing what Congress ordered in the 2007 energy bill , which required a quadrupling of annual ethanol production to 36 billion gallons by 2022 .
In practical terms , this meant more traditional corn ethanol , until other more advanced forms of ethanol could make their way out of the labs .
Scientists believe that various grasses and scrub trees that do not compete with food crops can someday be turned into fuel .
Congress hoped the ethanol mandate would produce a more climate - friendly fuel that could help reduce oil imports .
But just to make sure , it stipulated that ethanol from any source be cleaner than conventional gasoline .
It handed the job of measuring emissions to the E.P.A. , and told it to consider the fuel ’s entire life cycle .
The UK government 's reps in the European Union are pushing to gut the right of Internet users to access and contribute to networked services , replacing it with the " right " to abide by EULAs :
' Amendments to the Telecoms Package circulated in Brussels by the UK government , seek to cross out users ' rights to access and distribute Internet content and services .
And they want to replace it with a " principle " that users can be told not only the conditions for access , but also the conditions for the use of applications and services .
The amendments , if carried , would reverse the principle of end - to - end connectivity which has underpinned not only the Internet , but also European telecommunications policy , to date . '

The news that greeted friends of journalist Roxana Saberi this morning was better than they hoped : not only was the case against her suspended by Iranian judges , the Iranian government has decided to free her immediately .
Iran watchers will be making one of two cases today : that the freeing suggests nothing at all about Iran 's intentions toward the West ; Iran 's government wants to demonstrate to Europe ( in particular ) that it is capable of acting in good faith .
The other is that Iranian - United States relations have come a long way since 1/20 , and even in the wake of saber rattling , the presidency of Barack Obama has so flummoxed the Iranian leadership that they have no choice to vary their routine .
I do n't know which interpretation is correct , I would add , as a point of information , that Iran 's government is not monolithic ; that the bureaucracy and many judges consider themselves independent of the executive branch and the mullahs .
So maybe the release is a mixture of Iranian justice at work , to the extent that it sometimes comports with Western standards , as well as at attempt at over - the - Gulf cosmetology .
Seven journalists are still being held in Iranian prisons .
Saberi , a friend of many Western governments and journalists throughout the region ( Persian , Arab , European , American ) may have been a special case .

The government 's drug advisers are to consider next week whether to ban Spice Gold , a herbal smoking mixture that is as strong as some strains of skunk cannabis , and other " legal highs " .
Spice is sold on the internet and in " head shops " as a herbal high and a nicotine - free smoke , and even advertised as an " aromatic potpourri " .
It comes packaged in small sealed pouches holding 3g ( less than an eighth of an ounce ) .
But the former head of the Forensic Science Service 's drugs intelligence unit , Les King , yesterday told a European drugs conference in Lisbon : " Just a few months ago , it was found that a smoking mixture known as Spice was not the innocuous material it purported to be .
The claimed constituents , namely various herbs , were a Trojan horse . "
He said that the substance 's real psychoactive constituents were synthetic additives , such as ones that mimic the effects of some of the more powerful active ingredients in cannabis .
King told the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction conference that the Spice Gold smoking mixture had been imported first from China and had been around since 2006 .
It mostly contained an unidentified herbal matter , sold at about £ 15.50 for 3g and produced a " cannabis - like " effect .
There was also a more powerful type , Spice Diamond , on the market , and similar substances were sold as Yucatan Fire .
King is to give a presentation next week in London to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , where his colleagues will debate whether to recommend that Spice be banned in Britain .
The move follows a request from the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , to look at the availability and harmfulness of a series of " legal highs " including the herb Salvia divinorum , commonly referred to as magic mint or Mexican sage , which has a naturally occurring psychoactive ingredient .
But the advisory council , of which King is a member , will consider Spice first .
The " Trojan horse " properties of Spice were identified only last December by the THC Pharma laboratory in Germany , which is developing medicinal cannabis as synthetic imitations of the plant 's active ingredients .
Its research led to Germany and Austria banning Spice in January this year .
France decided to take the same action in February .
The first batches of Spice were seized in 2006 in Sweden and Jersey , but analysis failed to find any banned substances within them .
Early last year the European monitoring centre 's early warning system , which links police , customs officials and drug specialists around the EU , identified a dozen online distributors – half based in Britain and a third in the Netherlands – who were promoting Spice .
King , in a paper entitled New Drugs Coming Our Way delivered to the monitoring centre 's conference , said that many " designer drugs " had been discovered across the EU since the early 1990s .
These were psychotropic substances related to amphetamine and MDMA , the active ingredient in ecstasy , and were predominantly stimulants or hallucinogens .
As some of the drugs were banned in some EU states but not others , new law enforcement problems arose until a European - wide " joint action " on new synthetic drugs was developed in 1997 and expanded in 2005 .
" The term ' new ' referred to ' newly misused ' as in almost all cases the substances had been first synthesised many years ago , often as potential therapeutic agents , " said King .
" Since 1997 , over 80 substances have been reported via the early warning system . "
He added that in the past few years a much more diverse range of substances had appeared , many of them MDMA - like , or stimulants , or , less commonly , hallucinogens .
They included plant products such as Hawaiian Baby Woodrose , Kava and Kratom , unusual stimulants , ecstasy - style drugs such as BZP , which is now banned in four EU countries , and misused medicinal products .
They even included Fluorotropacocaine , the first designer drug based on cocaine .
King , who is the UK correspondent for the EU 's early warning system for new drugs , predicted that synthetic drugs would continue to dominate the " legal highs " market and that herbal products would remain relatively uncommon .
He suggested the emergence of these novel substances raised questions about how well placed the European authorities were to detect them .
" Event the best - equipped labor­atories in the EU can struggle to identify new substances , particularly if , as so often happens , neither pure reference mat­erials nor analytical data are available .
We must ask whether we are forever doomed to be reactive .
Can new substances be anticipated ? "
He told delegates the answer to his question was that it should be possible to anticipate new substances given a knowledge of the literature and the use of rules .

3g is in fact less than an eighth of an ounce .
This has been corrected .
Just How Green is That Electric Car , Anyway ?
With the push to reduce the carbon emissions from transportation , sometimes the newest developments , the latest technology , gets the spotlight .
By putting more hybrid and electric vehicles on the road , though , are we really getting “ greener ” vehicles ?
A report by an independent UK transportation group , Transport Watch , may have some surprising information for electric car aficionados .
If your electric vehicle is charged with electricity from a coal - fired power plant , then the CO2 emissions to fuel your EV are about double the amount emitted by a diesel engine , due to the inefficiencies in electrical power generation and transmission .
According to Transport Watch , only about 30 % of the energy generated by the power plant actually reaches the vehicle because of losses in the transmission route .
Of the energy delivered to the vehicle , 20 % is then lost to the batteries and electric motor .
This means that most EVs are only about 24 % efficient .
Contrast that with a modern diesel engine , which achieves an efficiency of 40 - 45 % on the fuel burned by the vehicle .
Granted , the internal combustion diesel engine does emit CO2 at the tailpipe , while an EV does not .
However , the CO2 emitted by the EV is not seen at the curb , leading to the assumption that electric cars decrease CO2 emissions overall .
“ We conclude that the notion that electric cars will reduce emissions is a fiction unless we hypothecate that the UK electricity generating industry will be de-carbonised . ” – Transport Watch
If a true low - carbon transportation initiative catches on , we might be seeing more diesels and less electric vehicles on the road , simply because of efficiency .
Coupled with the fact that manufacturing new EVs takes new technology , materials , and factory re-tooling , the CO2 emissions factor could mean that diesels are the cleanest transportation option we have right now .
If large - scale renewable energy electric power plants start feeding the grid , and EV owners can opt to choose clean energy for their cars , then a shift to an electric vehicle economy will begin to make the most ‘ green ’ sense .
Until then , however , EVs are still coal - powered vehicles …

This is an interesting look into what may have been seen on the Fox News Channel should it have existed prior to 1996 compared to the “ news ” they air regarding the Obama Administration .
Specifically , how would Fox News personalities react to the 51 day ATF standoff with David Koresh and the Branch Davidians in Waco , TX in 1993 .
Take a peep …
As news of the failed Waco raid broke , would Fox News ’ notoriously weepy and apocalyptic host Glenn Beck have broken down on the air and wept for the tyranny that he saw unfolding in the government ’s raid ?
While FBI negotiators tried to win the release of Koresh ’s followers , would Beck have warned viewers that the president would “ take your gun away one way or another “ ?
Amidst the 51 - day siege , would Beck have warned against the creeping “ totalitarian state ” inside America ?
Would the host have gravely announced that we ’d “ come to a very dangerous point in our country ’s long , storied history “ ?
Would Beck have routinely vilified President Clinton as a fascist ?
Would he have told viewers that he wanted to debunk the militia - movement conspiracy theory that the federal government was building prison camps , but that he just could n’t knock the story down — and that , at first glance , it appeared to be “ half true ” ?

In the interview , which lasts about 20 minutes , Williams explains the Twitter phenomenon , some of the applications the service has spawned , and also offers some of the reasons he thinks the company has been so successful .

The following is good news , but it deals - as with the matter of torture - with only a part of the problem .
It appears that the Obama administration has no intention of letting us know just who benefited in a large way from offshore tax avoidance and for how much .
One reason : it is likely that a large number of them also benefited indirectly from the bank bailout .
In other words , they double dipped : first they did n't pay any taxes and , second , they got a taxpayer subsidy .
It 's unlikely we 'll ever know , but it's one of the best explanations for all the insupportable secrecy about that the bank bailout .

- President Barack Obama today will propose to outlaw three offshore tax - avoidance techniques U.S. companies such as Caterpillar Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. want to use to save $ 190 billion over the next decade and make it riskier for Americans to stash money in tax - haven banks .
Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner are going after a strategy that allows U.S. - based multinational companies to effectively hide from the Internal Revenue Service the role their foreign subsidiaries play in shifting profits into low - tax jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands , an administration official said .
The proposal , affecting tax rules known as " check the box , " would net $ 86.5 billion in revenue between 2011 - 2019 by overhauling regulations created in Democrat Bill Clinton 's administration and later written into law by a Republican - controlled Congress after Clinton tried to withdraw the rules .
. . Obama also would shift the burden of proof to individuals when the IRS alleges assets are being hidden in certain offshore bank accounts , the White House said in a statement .
" This is bad stuff , " Kenneth Kies , a tax lobbyist at the Washington firm Federal Policy Group , said of Obama 's plans .
" This is going to be the biggest fight for the corporate community in the next two years . "
Kies represents General Electric Co. , Anheuser - Busch Cos. and Microsoft Corp. , among others . . .
In 2004 , U.S. - based multinational corporations paid about $ 16 billion in U.S. taxes while earning about $ 700 billion offshore , or an effective tax rate of about 2.3 percent , according to the White House statement .
The top marginal tax rate for U.S. companies is 35 percent ; drug companies such as Amgen Inc. and technology companies such as Microsoft are among companies that make the biggest use of tax - deferral benefits .
. . When the Clinton administration tried to rescind the benefits of the tax rules in such cases , companies mounted a lobbying effort and got Congress to back the rule , a White House official said .
Obama believes the rules have no economic substance other than avoiding U.S. tax , the official said .
Obama 's other corporate tax plans are patterned on those made in 2007 by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel , a New York Democrat , an administration official said .
. . For individuals , Obama will propose shifting the burden of proof when the IRS believes money is being hidden offshore .
In cases where individuals bank with financial institutions that have n't agreed to report certain account information to the IRS , the individual will have to prove he or she does n't own the account , rather than requiring the IRS to prove ownership . -

Department of Justice announcement : " James Tjahaja Riady will pay a record $ 8.6 million in criminal fines and plead guilty to a felony charge of conspiring to defraud the United States by unlawfully reimbursing campaign donors with foreign corporate funds in violation of federal election law , the Justice Department 's Campaign Financing Task Force and the United States Attorney in Los Angeles announced today .
In addition , LippoBank California , a California state - chartered bank affiliated with Lippo Group , will plead guilty to 86 misdemeanor counts charging its agents , Riady and John Huang , with making illegal foreign campaign contributions from 1988 through 1994 . . .
" The $ 8.6 million fine represents the largest sanction imposed in a campaign finance matter in the history of the United States . . .
During the period of August 1992 through October 1992 , shortly after Riady pledged $ 1 million in support of Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton 's campaign for the Presidency of the United States , contributions made by Huang were reimbursed with funds wired from a foreign Lippo Group entity into an account Riady maintained at Lippo Bank and then distributed to Huang in cash .
. .
" The purpose of the contributions was to obtain various benefits from various campaign committees and candidates for Lippo Group and LippoBank , including : access , meetings , and time with politicians , elected officials , and other high - level government officials .

Regional forces may hold sway over the two main parties ' fortunes
As India braces for another split verdict in the forthcoming general election , Mahesh Rangarajan analyses the decline of the country 's national parties .
India is completing a decade in which coalitions dominated by one or the other have held power .
Neither of the premier parties , Congress or the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) , is confident of leading their respective alliances to full power this time .
After five years at the helm , the alliance headed by Dr Manmohan Singh has much to smile about .
For four of these years , growth rates were well over 8 % and even now , amid a global slump , India will be the world 's second fastest growing economy .
Regional players ... now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government
Read your views on this article Yet , the Congress is a shadow of its former self .
It last secured a clear majority in the 543 - member lower house of the parliament a quarter of a century ago .
Its present coalition is sustained by an array of regional parties , who are now busy driving hard bargains in seat sharing .
Its rival , the BJP , is seeing its alliance actually fall apart .
For the first time since 1998 , it will have no ally in two key southern states , Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh .
Recently a long time ally in the eastern state of Orissa pulled away , in part due to the strident and violent campaign by the BJP 's cultural fraternal allies against religious minorities in the state last winter .
Excluded groups India 's last experience of a third coalition , then christened the United Front , was for two years from mid-1996 onwards .
Held together by support from the communists from outside , it was dominated by regional parties .
The BJP has failed to accommodate regional sentiment
The coalition government was headed by HD Deve Gowda , who moved in from the chief minister 's office in Karnataka .
He did not last long but more than one ambitious regional satrap sees him as precedent , not exception .
Given that Indian states can be large and populous , the term " regional " is something of a misnomer .
Uttar Pradesh , the most populous , has 190 million people , as many as Brazil .
Its chief minister Mayawati , may well be a contender .
She is both a woman and Dalit ; both excluded social groups able to get to power via political mobilisation via the ballot box .
States in the south and west have the added advantage of extensive external trade , with chief ministers very much at ease negotiating with transnational companies or the World Bank .
N Chandrababu Naidu lost power in 2004 in a landslide in Andhra Pradesh in southern India .
A pioneer in e-governance , he has forged state - level alliances with smaller parties and reached out to farmers and the rural poor .
The " bete noire " of Congress , he has moved away from the BJP .
Mr Naidu 's choice is symbolic of the re-emergence of the Third Front in Indian politics .
It is of course easier to define this space by explaining what it is not .
There is no one large all - India party at its core .
All these are parties that favour a more federal , decentralised polity .
Marginal players
In general , they lean more towards rural than urban voters .
Though not anti-reform , they would see welfare as contingent on more public action , not market forces .
Common to their growth is the decline of the larger national parties .
CHANGING FORTUNES
Seats won by Congress in 1984 elections : 404 .
In 2004 : 145 Seats won by BJP in 1984 elections : 2 . In 2004 : 138 Seats won by state and regional parties in 1991 elections : 51 .
In 2004 : 154 In Uttar Pradesh , the Congress and BJP between them won just 19 of the 80 seats in the last general elections .
The former is a marginal player in the entire Gangetic basin , not just in Uttar Pradesh but in Bihar and West Bengal .
In turn , the BJP has failed to emerge as an autonomous force in much of eastern and most of southern India .
Since its defeat in 2004 , it has also lost out on its ability to win over and hold on to alliances with regional players .
As elections near , with results out on 16 May after a five - phase poll across this vast land , India is certain to see another bout of coalition government .
But the baton may just pass from Congress hands .
It may well have to do business with a conglomerate of regional parties that drive a bargain to share power or worse still , hold it with support from the outside .
Such an arrangement will be shaky .
Congress still hopes to get enough seats , even if not its present 150 , to fashion a post - poll alliance that can continue to rule India .
Even here , a lower score would mean more bargaining power for state level parties .
While by no means certain , there is a clear trend at work .
The polity first saw the removal of national parties from key states by regional players .
These now hope to move from sharing power to shaping the federal government .
Fading appeal
The Congress party 's decline can be traced to the late 1980s .
This is when it lost its appeal to a vast section of the under classes , especially the religious minorities who felt it was compromising on pluralism at the cost of their physical security .
It also was unable to appeal to a new generation of leaders who mobilised those at the lower end of the caste pyramid .
Initially , the cultivating communities of north India and then the Dalits , once ostracised as " untouchables " , broke away .
Beyond Hindi speaking north India , regional parties also speak for a distinct local personality .
The BJP far less than the Congress never quite managed , except in Gujarat , to adequately accommodate regional sentiment .
Conventional wisdom has it that a gaggle of regional parties will find it difficult to provide cohesive government .
The two larger parties have a clear line of command , a leader whose authority is rarely , if ever , questioned by colleagues .
Conversely , collations have been held together by compromise not command .
Federal governments in India have yielded more , not less , space to states on matters ranging from the economy to culture .
Many regional leaders have held critical ministries like the defence portfolio from 1996 to 2004 .
Further , any such formation can only hold office by striking a deal with the Congress .
This may well serve as a check on any adventurism .
While such a coalition is unlikely to last a full term , it may open up new spaces in politics .
This was the case with VP Singh , who as prime minister ( 1989 - 90 ) redefined policies on positive discrimination in government employment .
Strange as it may sound , short - lived ministries can innovate in a chosen area of governance and leave a lasting mark on the polity .
The world 's largest democracy may well be at the cusp of major changes .
Only its voters know whether the satraps in the regions will have the last laugh .
Mahesh Rangarajan is a leading historian .
He teaches at Delhi University .
Here is a selection of your comments .
Mahesh Rangarajan provides an excellent preview of the upcoming elections .
While politics in India may be riddled with corruption and nepotism , the Indian constitution has done a remarkable job of bringing political power to the masses .
In this sense , democracy in India continues to be an evolving success .
However , the political structures are very inefficient , political debate is often unproductive , and the driving forces of the political parties are communal and divisive - rather than good governance for national progress .
The ideal governments in India , of course , would marry the technocratic success of modern Indian industry with the political success of its representative democracy .
One can only hope that this is n't too far off into the future .
Shantanu Rao , USA
This is excellent analysis of the prevalent political situation .
i would like to add that formation of the Mayavati led front is much more formidable combination because of its edge in states with 275 seats in the Lower House .
The Congress had won 64 of these while the BJP had won 38 .
Both are likely to lose nearly thirty seats .
The strength of two national parties that stands at 283 in the outgoing House may not cross 225 in the 15th House .
That will be invitation to political instability at the time when India needs to take hard and harsh economic decisions to limp out of the trauma of economic slow down .
But the combination that would emerge would attend to public actions rather than hitch the wagon to global market forces .
That is not a very healthy trend .
Sanghvi Vijay , India
In the opening lines you have said Congress and Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party .
If you were an unbiased writer you would have not included Hindu nationalist and just stuck to the party name .
But it is not the case .
The English speaking media has a bias and always labels BJP as communal and saffron party .
Is it a crime to be a Hindu in India ?
Why are Hindus always at the receiving end ?
Why not the Congress as a green party in every sense , of greed and all vices that has been the cause of the misfortune of this country .
Or call the communists as Red ?
Rasita , India Mahesh Rangarajan has not commented on the strength of regional parties who form a major part of the coalition govt .
Indian regional parties have been able to play a vital role in forming central government .
But still the major member of the coalition government will be only Congress or the BJP .
It has been demonstrated in the past that the effective campaigning and the timing of the election play a vital role in influencing the minds of the voters in India .
Indian voters are very matured and , therefore , clear verdict will be spelt out when the election date is closing .
I strongly feel that while the congress may get majority in the south , it will be BJP in the north India .
It has been very clearly demonstrated that BJP has been able to capture power in many states like Karnataka in the South where it had never ruled .
People in Tamil Nadu prefer BJP for central government for their long time planning like golden quadrilateral ( road sector ) .
Gopalan Subramanian , India !
Somehow
I feel that for greater stability and for quick decision making on important issues there needs to be a system where we have a single party at the helm in India .
The regional parties hold sway and keep the decision making hostage to their own whims ... the Indo - US nuclear deal was delayed and stomped over by the communists who are allies in the present ruling coalition led by the Congress Party .
In another case , the withdrawal of support from one of the allies AIADMK led to the untimely fall of the BJP party led coalition , causing unnecessary instability and draining the tax - payer 's money in another election .
Regional parties are not a solution to address regional concerns , they can and they should be done by elected representatives from those regions .
Coalition politics cannot be hailed as a democratic triumph especially not when the need of the hour is quick decision making , stability , and financial prudence .
I am personally appalled by the idea of coalition politics and the supporters of this system should realize that this is a misuse of democracy .
those who say that coalition politics gives voices to the regional concerns and keeps the ruling party in check , they will agree with me , that concerns can be addressed by elected representatives from that region , and ruling party is kept in check by the party in opposition , there is no need for another internal opposition .
Pulkit Nigam , USA
I fear that the rise of regional parties will eventually morph them into ethno-national parties .
That is , parties representing the interests of various states will eventually begin to see themselves as separate nations , and may eventually call for independence .
Tamil Nadu 's dominant regional parties already had a history of calling for independence - I fear that other parties may begin to endorse the interests of their ethnic groups over the interests of India as a whole .
It is a short path from regionalism to nationalism to separatism .
Anil , USA
The weakening of the national parties in India is symptomatic of inability of strong central power to address regional and local issues .
Unfortunately the regional parties that fill the vacuum are also narrow in vision and scope .
They tend to exploit the caste system or religion based sentiments .
In a way there is poetic justice in all this - the people of India having lacked credible party that can govern from the centre with adequate sensitivity to the regional issues and balance it prudently against central power , has voted itself into era of weak central government that is always at the mercy of regional power coalitions .
This is unlikely to change in near future .
Harjot Kahlon , USA
A narrative article with a gist of political players and their approaches to reach the pinnacle of power .
However , this article fails to analyse the decline of main parties as it set out to do in first place .
I suspect short sighted policies of these parties like allying with regional or smaller parties have cost them dearly .
I wish the electorate votes for a stable government as the country cannot afford a hung parliament and political horse trading
Laxman Karajgikar , UK
While agreeing to his ability to analyse the post election scenario in India , the main driving force in most parties is to share power some how .
The anti defection law makes a party to stay in the coalition .
We must not take Western democratic countries as yardsticks to evaluate India .
Many European countries have successful coalition governments .
The last BJP led coalition and the current UPA govt performance is reasonably good .
Think of Indian politics from Indian point of view is my humble suggestion .
Mind you a billion odd population with a large percentage of eligible voters use electronic machine where more than 40 % are illiterate and exercise their franchise under tremendous pressure of all sorts of bad and good influences .
Omkarnath Kamalapurkar , India I can not agree more to the author .
This would really going to be a very challenging time for India .
With regional parties looking into their own narrow interests , could well let down India as a nation .
These are the testing times for India on the front of national security ( terrorism ) , integrity ( naxalites ) and now the economic slowdown .
In a situation like this , India requires a stable government with a authoritative leader .
I hope that either BJP or congress would be able to form the government .
This is the best that India can hope for .
Abhishek Jain , India Indian Politicians , like in most places in the world are too eager for short term gain at any cost .
They do not cultivate statesmanship , practice respect for law and order , groom younger and educated leaders and essentially cultivate long range plan which is good for the nation and yet getaway with it .
Strong regional power is not the problem but economically free and astute electorate is the only answer .
Hungry and uninformed people can be easily manipulated .
We need strong and free press only who can cultivate astute electorate .
Somes Guha , USA
We Indians are yet too ignorant about our needs as citizen of India .
We collectively inculcate in our mind that , We as a society should have common aspiration to transform our selves in a homogeneous group , giving priority to national interest rather than our regional interest .
We require leaders who know needs of Nation and who will give prominence to national cause .
The leader who can project himself as a national leader and command respect of society through his thoughts and action through out the India .
A leader who gives priority to national integration and not to regional separatism .
Who is a firm believer in politics for national cause and not for personal cause .
We ourselves through public forums and groups must make the system change in desired direction and help to build a strong democratic society make the world look at us with respect .
Shirish Madhukar Nawathe , India Great article and nice to see democracy at work .
Mohan , USA I believe a two - party system like that in US is better for India than a patchwork of regional parties who can only form a government based on compromises resulting in indecisive coalitions and frequent general elections , the cost of which is ultimately borne by the public .
The existence of two major parties was closest to an absolute two - party system .
Their disintegration is likely to lead to further instability and chaos .
Irfan Alvi , USA Congress problems with losing votes actually began in the mid-1980's when it overturned the Shah Bano Maintenance Court judgement of India 's Supreme Court , an act that eventually led to the Babri Mosque dispute .
It was accused ( and still is ) of openly favouring Muslims over the Majority Hindu community .
The BJP has a problem in that its vision of a Nationalistic India does not appeal to much of Lower Caste Hindus , who see it ( rightly or wrongly ) as dominated by the Upper Castes .
Its Agenda also alienates much of the non-Hindi parts of the Country .
Only in Karnataka does it have a foothold outside North and West India .
I foresee another fractured mandate .
S Kumar , London , UK
It is now high time India should have a relook to its constitution as well as election policy in the light of new challenges of 21st Century .
Mere economic growth is meaningless when Human Development Index for India is worse than Sub - Saharan Countries .
India must learn from the constitutional provisions and election policy from USA & Germany in particular .
Indian youth are directionless , politicians are power Hungary & industrialists are selfish , poor & middle class in rural & urban are helpless .
Population , corruption & Reservation have taken front seats .
Dr Amrit Patel , USA I disagree with many of your comments .
You have joined with foreign journalists in branding BJP as the Hindu nationalist party .
It is more secular than Congress , which is a feudal party .
You have repeated at many places what common people already know very well .
You should write something new instead of repeating what others have written or painted earlier .
In the same stroke , you should brand the conservatives of UK , Germany , USA , Ireland , and many other countries where Christians are in majority as Christian nationalist parties .
Viswanathan , USA Before independence , India had only one party - the Indian National Congress , a coalition of myriad parties and interest groups brought together by the overriding desire to get the British out .
After independence , Mahatma Gandhi's advice to dissolve the Congress and let new parties be formed was rejected , but Congress under Nehru was a coalition .
Eventually , conflicting interests and electoral politics led to the breakup of Congress into multiple parties .
The so - called national parties , Congress and BJP , cannot win a municipal ward in large swathes of the country ; the Communists are confined to two small pockets , smaller than some so - called regional parties .
Since the eighties , coalitions rule at the federal level and in many states .
One salutary feature is that all the parties , with the exception of the Communists , share a common foreign and economic policy .
In the fifties and sixties , the press and the pundits in India and abroad , complained against one party rule and the lack of a two party system .
Now they complain about multi-party coalitions .
In course of time , it is probable that two loose coalitions , like Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. , would emerge .
Because of the parliamentary system , where party members cannot cross-vote ( as in the U.S. Congress ) on specific issues , Indian coalitions often split and reunite in various combinations .
These would be resolved in an entirely Indian fashion over the next few decades .
Thiruvengadam Ramakrishnan , U.S.A .
I believe the Congress party would emerge as the largest Party in the Lok Sabha .
Nazim Emamali , Trinidad
Thank you for an excellent analysis .
Yes , both Congress and BJP are losing their appeal to the advantage of the regional / state parties .
But , one should not be surprised if the Third Front crumbles after the election and its constituents behave like free moving particles ready to form any combination provided they get their share of the cake .
KP Fabian , India I 'm very much hopeful that Congress lead coalition will form new govt because newly formed third front will support congress lead coalition end of the election .
My best wishes to UPA Front .
Md Hafizur Rahman Azad , Bangladesh Indians have almost lost faith with the political parties .
Dynastic ambition , corruption , hero worship , fundamentalism has withered the political parties .
. Educated and urban folks are shy to vote .
Voting is dominated by the rural and slum folks who are given money , saris , liquor and fake promises to induce their vote in their favour .
But there no other alternative for the survival of the political system in these countries .
Compulsory voting and stringent qualification for the parliament and legislative members can bring some change in the political culture .
Is it possible ?
Only a cultural revolution can save the future democracy .
Mass media must initiate the revolution .
Samson Aseervatam , India Mahesh 's analysis of the Indian political situation is quite accurate and this article is a portrayal of hope in a dynamic and evolving polity .
It is quite encouraging to see that he can make sense of what I would have seen as a democratic process that successfully generates dysfunctional governments as the predictable result .
Thinking forward , I feel that the Indians have given a clear indication that regional sentiments are more important to them than national issues .
A decentralised governance where the states have most of the power is what the people want .
In such a situation it is meaningless to talk about national parties .
This is already true in many states like Uttar Pradesh , Bihar and West Bengal where the two national parties are almost nonexistent .
Over the years the prelude and the exercise of franchise in the general election has lost its charm .
What has emerged as a high political drama is the shambolic state the political system is put into after the election results are announced .
The greed to grab power permeates through everyone who is fortunate to win a seat in the parliament .
In this mad rush any combination of leftist , rightist or central parties is a possibility .
Being aware of this , the regional parties keep their options open and never rule out a post election alliance with whichever party is in a position to form a government .
It is therefore not surprising that these alliances of convenience are weak , indecisive and fragile in a country which needs bold decisions to eradicate illiteracy and poverty .
Unfortunately , in the present system there is no place for visionaries and is a perfect breeding ground for corrupt politicians .
Anirban Sarkar , United Kingdom
While I see a rise of local and regional parties as an expression of democracy , I also see the trend as negative given the ability of these parties to hold a nation to ransom at the expense of the nation .
I further think that the major parties have encouraged this move given their ability to divide and rule .
Politics based on region , caste and religious sentiments have never made good national policies .
Murli , UK
It is most unfortunate and pity that two main national parties are loosing their ground .
There needs to be an electoral reform which will stipulate that regional parties can only participate in state assembly election .
In order to marginalize these small and regional parties , BJP and Congress should reach some kind of tactical understanding where by either Congress or BJP depending upon number of seats they win , will form a Government and the other will ensure that the Government is not pulled down .
This will eliminate the smaller parties at some stage .
Keshav Sridhar , India
The article is proof of current crisis in Indian politics .
There is no party with proper policy or structure .
The regionalism has been a issue in India which has been sidelined for long .
The late IT service sector based boom is also coming to an end signalling more chaos .
This election will one step closer to end of Indian Tiger not only in terms of economics but in terms of social inequality , quality of India education system and hypocritical policies of regional and central governments and also the masses who have failed to deliver lessons to the most corrupt political system in the world .
Rabinder Henry , India
The regional parties who have ruled southern India have made them more developed in every aspect be it education , family planning , over all development of the region and the employment opportunities .
It is a wrong notion that they are going for divisive politics , though this could be the case with the states of the Hindi belt , where elections are fought on the caste lines but that is n't the case in southern India .
Though here parties are formed on linguistic basis and they really performing well with regard to serving the people and governing the state .
By electing the regional satraps instead of the national parties the people of south India are doing a great job in ensuring better governance in their respective states and this does not be understood that they would like to go for independence , they are for united India but with no clear mandate to the so called national parties which are more interested to increase their influence in the state where they do not have presence rather than on holding on the states which had gave them the power to rule .
I strongly suggest that at least south India is better ruled by the regional parties than the national level parties
Raj , India
The 2009 lok sabha elections lacks any attractions .
The mandate will definitely be fragmented .
The congress party will emerge as the single largest party .
The party is going to increase its tally by 25 - 35 seats .
The government is going to be formed by the congress led alliance ( UPA ) .
The smaller partners will play good bargain politics before lending support to the congress party .
The next five years is going to be very important for the country because of global financial crisis and increased volatile situation in South Asia .
The past government has done well in most of the areas except a few areas like controlling of illegal migrants who are becoming a security threat and also sucking up the precious resources .
The poorest of the poor , the dalits and tribals are being left out as always .
Muslims and Christians are feeling more safe under the congress led government .
Krishnendu Das , India I only wish this spirit of democracy that our big neighbour India has kept alive for more than half a century would spill over to others in South Asia .
Pakistan , Nepal , Sri Lanka , and my own Bangladesh have much to learn from India from its strict observance to democratic ideals despite being perhaps the most difficult nation on earth to rule .
Never have we ever heard the army in India pondering when would they assume power for " greater good " .
Despite India 's many faults , from denying Kashmiris , Assamese and numerous others from right of self - determination , and its huge mass of poor from the benefit of its continues economic growth , by and large it remained optimistic with the prospect of Democracy .
Whilst India has many things to learn from her neighbours , for example rural development from Bangladesh and sustained economic growth from Sri Lanka , India 's neighbours , has one great thing to learn from her .
That is the venerable word , democracy , which this subcontinent practised for many years , before the Europeans idolised and institutionalised it .
A Bangladeshi , UK Speaking to my cousin in India about the upcoming election , I said " Do n't vote BJP or I 'll smack you " .
His reply , " What should I do then ?
Ineffectual Congress ?
United Front ? "
I think his words really summed up , as this article did , the political crisis in India .
A 'vote for nobody ' attitude will eventually paralyse India 's democratic system .
A change is needed .

I also agree that a two party system will provide for a more stable and quick decision making people at the centre but at the same time there should be a system in place where people can reject a candidate who stands for election if they find him / her not to there liking or eligible .
Otherwise a three party system would be more appropriate .

So I gather by now you ’ve all heard the terrible news about the guys behind The Pirate Bay torrents search site have been found guilty with lots of help from the US entertainment industry and their lackey trade groups .
While everyone and their brother seems to be bemoaning this latest victory – which is pyrrhic at best – by the entertainment I am surprised by two things .
First – who in their right mind did n’t expect this outcome .
Come on get your head out of the sand for five minutes and face the fact that the multi-billion dollar might of a global entertainment industry could have shit bricks and they would have still won .
Second – if you think it will stop here or that the decision in anyway will affect the Pirate Bay search business then you are sadly mistaken .
The four people behind Pirate Bay have already made it clear that they have planned for this contingency and spread their servers around the world in such away that they are going to be very difficult to shutdown .
As well it did n’t matter who won in court this time around because you can be assured that in either case the appeals would have been filed before the ink was dry .
What is interesting is to read all the various hyperbole that has been circulating throughout the tech blogosphere this morning .
Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter Sunde and Carl Lundström have been described as being everything from the ones responsible for the world ’s most notorious file - sharing site to being money grubbing opportunists who caused the entertainment industry great financial harm .
Ya okay we ’ll let you roll with that for a minute or two while Sony Music Industry , Warner Bros. , EMI and Columbia Pictures decide how to divvy up the $ 3.6 million award for damages .
The thing is that for all the accusations of Pirate Bay being a file sharer the argument is fundamentally flawed .
Pirate Bay as a site does not host any of the files that they are accused of sharing .
All they are doing is providing a search engine interface for torrents that point to both legal and illegal content .
It ’s not like they are twisting anyone ’s arm to download anything – they are providing a service not a file depot .
This would be like suggesting that Google or Microsoft Live are file sharers because they provide links to downloadable content .
If the grounds that the entertainment industry used against Pirate Bay are valid by even the farthest stretch of the imagination then the same arguments should be used against Google and Microsoft .
After all a simple search for Rolling Stones MP3’s on both of those search engines will give you a multitude of download links .
Think not ?
Then think again
While using torrents actually is more difficult until you get use to downloading them both Google and Microsoft through their respective search engines provide direct links to easily downloadable files .
so what is the difference here ?
As Paul O’Flaherty pointed out this morning
The entertainment industry is a monolithic conglomeration of companies that would rather litigate than innovate and have proven time and time again that the pursuit of money and protecting their outdated business model is all that matters to them .
What better direction to take than to go after those with the deepest pockets ?
Especially now that they have a precedent ruling against what is essentially just a search engine .
Why is it okay for Microsoft or Google to use the exact same excuse that the guys running Pirate Bay used and yet while they go to jail , Google and Microsoft get a free pass .
This story is far from being done but in the meantime everyone talking about this bullshit decision will carry on with misleading information about how these file sharers are getting what they deserve and racking up the pageviews as they go .
In the end though there is no difference between them and any other search engine provider – they just made a better target and better press .

I imagine this is what all comics were like in medieval Europe before they developed linear perspective in the Renaissance .

Some scientists at the University of East Anglia in England , with aims only for the betterment of humanity , we 're sure , have developed lip - reading software that can not only pick up words based on mouth shapes , but can even figure out what language you 're speaking -- always a handy thing when understanding speech , we 've found .
Languages it can identify include English , French , German , Arabic , Mandarin , Cantonese , Italian , Polish , and Russian , and recognition is based on telltale " articulators " of tongue , jaw and lip movement .
The software statistically analyzed the face movements of bilingual and trilingual speakers to draw out the specific defining characteristics , and could by used by the deaf , military and police organizations , or by on - board ship computers that fear for their safety and the integrity of the mission .

In some schools the vaccination uptake is as low as 14.8 % Health officials say they are " highly alarmed " that the number of measles cases being investigated in mid and west Wales has reached 109 .
They have issued an urgent warning that vaccination is the only way to stop the virus spreading but are disappointed with the uptake in schools so far .
There are 11 confirmed cases , five are in Pembrokeshire and six in Llanelli .
There are also suspected cases in Powys , Ceredigion , Swansea , Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend .
Dr Mac Walapu , consultant in communicable disease control for the National Public Health Service said the 109 figure was alarming as there were only 39 cases in Wales last year , 13 in 2007 and none in 2005 .
He said anyone who had not received the full two doses of the MMR vaccine was at risk from measles and should come forward for immunisation .
Cases are occurring across all age groups from children as young as five months to adults in their late 40s .
Confirmed measles outbreaks Llanelli : 43 cases .
6 confirmed , 19 probable , 18 suspected South Pembs : 14 cases .
3 confirmed , 11 probable Burry Port : 5 probable cases Source : NPHS
There are three separate outbreaks in Llanelli , Burry Port and south Pembrokeshire accounting for 62 of the cases .
Of the 47 other cases , six are in Pembrokeshire , six in Carmarthenshire , four in Ceredigion , one in Powys , 15 in Swansea , five in Neath Port Talbot and 10 in Bridgend .
Two of the six other cases in Pembrokeshire have been confirmed as measles .
There is no clear connection between these and the three outbreaks .
" Last month the NPHS wrote to all parents or guardians of unvaccinated children in south Pembrokeshire and Llanelli urging them to have their children vaccinated but the response was disappointing , particularly in Llanelli , " he said .
" In some schools , the vaccination uptake is as low as 14.8 per cent .
The only way this will stop is for people to come forward for the MMR vaccine
Dr Mac Walapu
" To see so many cases of measles at one time is highly alarming .
" It is of great concern to us that in the Llanelli area alone there are 800 primary school children and 2,100 secondary school children who are vulnerable .
" The virus will continue to circulate until the susceptible population have been infected and the only way this will stop is for people to come forward for the MMR vaccine . "
He said measles is highly contagious and could have dangerous consequences .
Many people who catch measles will have a fever , a rash and feel generally unwell .
Typically , people ware infectious from a few days before the onset of their rash until four to five days afterwards .
Dr Walapu added : " If your child is unwell and you suspect it is measles , you should contact your GP .
" Your child should not attend school or nursery for five days after the rash starts .
" Most people make a full recovery but there is a rare possibility of severe complications including serious eye disorders , deafness , brain damage and even death .
" After completing a two - dose course of the MMR vaccine - which also offers protection against mumps and rubella - 99 % of children will be protected against measles . "

WASHINGTON  When Newt Gingrich ’s Congress was moving full - speed in its efforts to shrink the government more than a dozen years ago , Ralph G. Neas , an indefatigable champion of liberal causes , threw up his hands and declared that his side had been outmaneuvered .
Liberals who had grown up pressing their case with marches and old - fashioned door - knocking campaigns , Mr. Neas said , were no match for conservatives with big business allies and a commanding understanding of the new talk - radio , cable - news battlefield , where former President Bill Clinton ’s signature health care plan lay bleeding .
Recent days have found Mr. Neas in a new perch , preparing to join the coming fight over President Obama ’s sweeping health care proposals , with plans to coordinate a campaign of television advertisements , “ blogger outreach ” and community meetings .
This time , he is supported by his own phalanx of big business backers , including the Exelon power company and Giant food stores .
“ We get another chance to do it again , and win this time , ” he said in an interview in his new office at the National Coalition on Health Care , which recently named him its chief executive .
HANOVER ( Reuters ) - German twenty - somethings would ditch their spouses and do without a car in a heartbeat if they had to choose between having them or Internet access or a mobile phone , according to an industry study .

In a survey by German broadband association Bitkom around 84 percent of respondents aged 19 - 29 said they would rather do without their current partner or an automobile than forego their connection to the Web .
Living without a mobile phone was also unthinkable for 97 percent of those questioned in that age range .
Nevertheless , Bitkom president August - Wilhelm Scheer said on Monday in Hanover that did not mean that “ the Web is an anonymous medium that leads to social indifference . ”
One of the main themes at this year ’s annual tech trade fair CeBit in Hanover is what the organizers have dubbed “ Webciety , ” short for WorldWideWeb society .
Bitkom said 1,000 people had taken part in the survey , and one in two people said they had made new friends thanks to chat forums and Internet communities .
Around 8 percent said they had found a new partner thanks to online relations .
“ The Web creates real relationships and does not result in autism and dehumanization , ” said Scheer , who admitted he gets nervous when he does not have Internet access while on vacation .
Still , Scheer said , there was a digital divide in Germany that needed to be bridged .
“ There ’s a gap and it ’s not with 30 - year - olds or 40 - year - olds it ’s with those 50 years of age and above , ” Scheer said .
The way people in their forties and those in their twenties used the Web did not differ much , Scheer said , but the difference to someone in their mid-fifties was significant .
“ One of the main challenges in society today is to ensure that all age groups are up to par when it comes to the Internet , ” Scheer said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Wall Street faces curbs on risk taking and the prospect of lower profits under sweeping U.S. proposals to prevent a repeat of the credit crisis .
The Obama administration ’s plan to rewrite financial rules , announced on Thursday , would create a single regulator to monitor any firm whose failure could threaten the financial system , while also tightening rules for big hedge funds and private equity firms .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congress “ comprehensive reform ” was needed to prevent a repeat of the current credit crisis , the most virulent since the 1930s .
“ Not modest repairs at the margin , but new rules of the game . ”
The proposals Geithner presented also require large , interconnected institutions to hold more capital , provide for derivatives to be traded on an exchange , and give the government authority to shut down troubled financial firms .
Leaders from the Group of 20 rich and emerging nations gather for a meeting next Thursday in London at which regulatory reform will be high on the agenda .
President Barack Obama will make the case that Washington is moving forward boldly and others must step up to do the same .
“ Our hope is that we can work with the Europeans on a global framework ... which has appropriate global oversight , so that we do n’t have a balkanized system at the global level like we had at the national level , ” Geithner said .
Under the plan he laid out for the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee , one entity would be responsible for ensuring systemic stability over both major institutions and critical payments and settlement systems .
Many lawmakers have considered giving the Federal Reserve that role .
Currently , a variety of regulators control different parts of the banking system , and some participants in insurance and other sectors largely fall between the regulatory cracks .
“ We have a moment of opportunity now .
We do n’t want to waste this opportunity , ” Geithner said .
“ We need to act . ”
HEDGE FUNDS , PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS FACE SCRUTINY
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro , whose agency came under harsh criticism for not seeing the current crisis coming , said the agency should not be sacrificed in order to set up an overarching regulator .
“ Even as attention focuses on reconsidering the management of systemic risk , investor protection and capital formation ... cannot be compromised , ” she told lawmakers .
In one key move , Geithner said hedge fund advisers and others who control big pools of capital like private - equity funds and venture capital firms should be forced to register with the SEC .

Some European officials , notably in Germany , have long sought registration of hedge funds and criticized free - wheeling hedge fund operators in the United States for helping create an environment that permitted excessive risk - taking .
Geithner used the example of American International Group to make the point that companies like insurers were taking huge risks on exotic products like credit default swaps that were barely understood by some market participants .
“ Let me be clear : the days when a major insurance company could bet the house on credit default swaps with no one watching and no credible backing to protect the company or taxpayers from losses must end , ” Geithner said .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
He promised “ unparalleled transparency ” for the market for derivatives related to stocks , bonds , currencies or other financial instruments or risks .
Dealers would have to clear derivatives contracts through central counterparties so they could be monitored .
Analysts said the proposals potentially were as significant as the Depression - era Glass - Steagall provisions that set up barriers between commercial banks and investment banks .
That law was swept aside in 1999 , permitting companies to mix banking with other financial activities .
Geithner wants a regime that would subject systemically important firms to more scrutiny than smaller ones .
“ If you ’re a systemically important company , you are ultimately backed by taxpayers , not just shareholders , so it makes sense to look at regulation this way , ” said Karen Shaw Petrou , managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics in Washington .
These large firms would be required to hold more capital than other financial companies , and would face tougher liquidity , counterparty and risk - management rules .
The systemic risk regulator would get powers to order prompt corrective action if capital levels decline , similar to the power the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp has for banks .
Despite the strong prescriptions to increase scrutiny , the administration signaled some flexibility on accounting .
For example , so - called fair value accounting rules will be reviewed to try to identify changes that could reduce wild swings in profit and capital levels as markets move up and down .
Similarly , accounting for loan loss reserves might be revised to ensure firms are setting aside enough money to get through rough economic spots without collapsing .
How did cap and trade , hatched as an academic theory in obscure economic journals half a century ago , become the policy of choice in the debate over how to slow the heating of the planet ?
And how did it come to eclipse the idea of simply slapping a tax on energy consumption that befouls the public square or leaves the nation hostage to foreign oil producers ?
The answer is not to be found in the study of economics or environmental science , but in the realm where most policy debates are ultimately settled : politics .
Many members of Congress remember the painful political lesson of 1993 , when President Bill Clinton proposed a tax on all forms of energy , a plan that went down to defeat and helped take the Democratic majority in Congress down with it a year later .
Cap and trade , by contrast , is almost perfectly designed for the buying and selling of political support through the granting of valuable emissions permits to favor specific industries and even specific Congressional districts .
That is precisely what is taking place now in the House Energy and Commerce Committee , which has used such concessions to patch together a Democratic majority to pass a far - reaching bill to regulate carbon emissions through a cap - and - trade plan .
It 's enough to make a historian weep .
While General Motors chainsaws brands off its core like old - growth redwood , Europe 's automakers think they have a better idea : turn themselves into carbon copies of GM .
The latest : Porsche and VW .
Instead of pursuing a shareholder takeover of Volkswagen , as it's been doing for more than a year , Porsche 's struck a deal with Germany 's largest automaker in which the two will combine all their management operations under one roof .
The car brands include Porsche , Volkswagen , SEAT , Skoda , Bentley , Bugatti , Audi , and Lamborghini ( we 're not forgetting anyone , are we ? )
Porsche said in a statement that the new operation would ensure it retains its independence .
We shall see .
The epic tilt in the balance of power , meanwhile , is leaving America 's automakers in the dust .
Ford has already spun off most of its acquisitions from the 1990s and 2000s , including Jaguar , Land Rover and Aston Martin .
At GM , plans to sell off HUMMER , Saab and Saturn are well underway -- with thought being given to handing control of Opel over to Fiat , too .
Chrysler , which always seems to find a dance partner , is heading into the arms of Fiat , another automaker that thinks it can juggle an armful of brands better than the Americans , and do so through the classic ups and downs of the auto industry .
Fiat 's already in the process of taking control of Chrysler , Jeep and Dodge - - and if Opel also comes its way , it will have built a global operations that builds everything from the Jeep Wrangler to the Maserati Granturismo .
And now with the latest from this morning , GM may be seeking a chunk of the new Fiat - Chrysler in exchange for Fiat running its Opel subsidiary around the world .
Sigh .
Overreaching is nothing new in the auto industry , and in this latest ten - year cycle , the players who remain on the sidelines get left out of the headlines .
But while alliances like Renault - Nissan struggle with integration and making their virtual mergers work , the temptation to create megacompanies with constellations of brands still hold .
Fiat and VW / Porsche may succeed where others have failed -- but are shoppers ready to accept Dodge Rams and Fiat 500s on the same showrooms floor ?
Or a Buick Astra built by Fiat - Opel for GM , which also indirectly has a stake in Chrysler ?

GOP 's Civil Liberties Hypocrisy Just as Republicans have refashioned themselves as fiscal conservatives in the age of Obama , apparently forgetting that they allowed a budget surplus to be transformed into a record deficit while George W. Bush was President , they now seem to be taking up the cause of civil liberties – at least as far as right - wing groups are concerned .

What has piqued their interest is a recent Department of Homeland Security assessment , sent to all local , state and tribal law enforcement agencies , detailing the potential terrorist threat posed by right - wing extremists .
Significantly , the assessment concludes that “ lone wolves and small terrorist cells embracing violent right - wing extremist ideology are the most dangerous domestic terrorism threat in the United States . ”
By citing right - wing extremists as the most significant domestic security threat , the report marks a radical departure from the Bush administration , which placed greater emphasis on the supposed threat posed by “ homegrown ” Islamic extremists , and often targeted liberal and left - wing activist s for surveillance and harassment , under the vague umbrella of “ counter - terrorism . ”
Although the new DHS assessment does not contain any specific information on impending terrorist attacks , or single out any specific organizations , it generally warns that many current political and economic conditions parallel those of the 1990s , which saw a rise in right - wing extremism culminating in the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people on April 19 , 1995 .
But because the report argues that some on the Right may be motivated to join extremist organizations , conservatives are complaining that the DHS has unfairly singled out citizens concerned about gun rights , taxes and immigration control .
Conservatives also claim to be outraged over speculation in the report that disgruntled Iraq and Afghanistan veterans could be recruited by right - wing extremist groups .
“ To characterize men and women returning home after defending our country as potential terrorists is offensive and unacceptable , ” said House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio .
Others are more generally decrying the report as an unwarranted political attack on the conservative movement .
“ The recent DHS report … has nothing to do with protecting our country from the current threat of terrorism , ” wrote conservative commentator JR Dieckmann .
“ It has everything to do with gathering information on people and groups who oppose the Obama regime in Washington . ”
Jim Clymer , chairman of the right - wing Constitution Party , called the report “ an egregious case of political profiling , ” adding : “ It ’s indeed a frightening reality when those who subscribe to a constitutionally based political view are characterized as potentially violent . ”
Selective Outrage
To some , however , the conservative outrage over the DHS report may smack of hypocrisy .
There were few complaints from the Right , it has been pointed out , when the DHS in January 2009 issued an assessment on the threat that left - wing extremists pose , particularly when it comes to committing cyber attacks .
And of course , there was no comparable outrage over political and religious profiling during the Bush years .
The outrage may seem all the more selective considering that the Bush administration often went beyond mere “ profiling ” to active surveillance , harassment and even prosecutions of non-violent political organizations that opposed the Bush agenda .
Under Bush ’s Justice Department , the FBI and other law enforcement agencies often seemed more interested in containing the dissent inspired by policies such as the Iraq War than they were in thwarting actual terrorist activities .
Following a move in 2002 by Attorney General John Ashcroft to loosen restrictions that had been placed on the FBI after the COINTELPRO political - spying scandal of the 1970s , the FBI soon began collecting information on and targeting all sorts of progressive organizations .
In 2003 , the FBI sent a memorandum to local law enforcement agencies before planned demonstrations against the war in Iraq .
The memo instructed local law enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for “ possible indicators of protest activity and report any potentially illegal acts to the nearest FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force . ”
Then , prior to the 2004 Democratic and Republican national conventions , the JTTF raided the homes of activists who were organizing demonstrations , while FBI agents in Missouri , Kansas and Colorado spied on and interrogated activists .
[ NYT , Aug. 16 , 2004 ]
The FBI also began collecting thousands of pages of internal documents on civil rights and antiwar groups including the American Civil Liberties Union , Greenpeace and United for Peace and Justice .
Leslie Cagan , the national coordinator for UFPJ , said that she was particularly concerned that the FBI ’s counterterrorism division was discussing the coalition ’s operations .
“ We always assumed the FBI was monitoring us , but to see the counterterrorism people looking at us like this is pretty jarring , ” Cagan said .
Further revelations of the government improperly classifying antiwar groups as terrorist threats continued to surface .
In December 2005 , for example , NBC News revealed the existence of a secret 400 - page Pentagon document listing 1,500 “ suspicious incidents ” over a 10 - month period , including dozens of antiwar demonstrations that were classified as a “ threat . ”
More recently , the state of Maryland notified dozens of nonviolent activists that they were wrongfully labeled as terrorists in the federal terrorism database .
Among those notified were Ardeth Platte and Carol Gilbert , two nuns who have spent their lives protesting nuclear weapons and war through nonviolent acts of civil disobedience .
“ To be labeled a terrorist is really very hard to hear and to accept when your whole life has been one of loving nonviolence , ” Platte said .
“ Does civil dissent and civil unrest mean that people are going to be labeled as terrorists ? ”
[ For more on this , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Are You Palling Around With Terrorists ? ” ]
Yet , with a few notable exceptions , Republicans in Congress largely remained silent every time a new abuse of power was revealed .
In some cases , Republicans even seemed to endorse the targeting of Bush - era dissenters .
“ The administration has not only the right , but the duty , in my opinion , to pursue Fifth Column movements , ” Sen. Lindsay Graham , R - South Carolina , once told Attorney General Alberto Gonzales during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing .
Who ’s a Threat ?
Beyond the seeming hypocrisy of the GOP ’s selective outrage over political profiling and civil liberties , there is also the larger question of whether the DHS report accurately assesses the nation ’s most pressing internal security concerns .
Underlining the Republican critiques of the report is their annoyance that the focus of the campaign against terrorism has shifted away from leftists and Muslims and towards constituencies that currently make up the base of the Republican Party .
After years of the U.S. government targeting groups and individuals that are out of step with what Republicans consider the “ American mainstream , ” suddenly , the Department of Homeland Security is highlighting individuals on the Right as potential threats .
Although Republicans may not welcome this new emphasis , there is ample reason to believe that right - wing extremists pose at least as great a threat to domestic security as Islamic extremists , and certainly a greater threat than antiwar and environmental activists on the Left .
While some left - wing organizations , such as the Weather Underground in the 1970s and the Earth Liberation Front in the 1990s , have undoubtedly carried out bombings and arson attacks , these acts have been carried out largely against empty buildings , including both government and corporate targets .
Human casualties have been a rare and mostly unintended result .
Right - wing and white supremacist organizations , on the other hand , have consistently targeted human life , from the Southern lynchings and church bombings of the Ku Klux Klan to the abortion clinic bombings and right - wing militia violence of the 1990s .
And as the DHS report points out , there are many parallels between the current era and the 1990s .
Then , just as now , the country was experiencing an economic downturn , with factories being closed down and jobs being shipped overseas .
There was a backlash against immigration policies and federal efforts at gun control , and some disgruntled Gulf War veterans , including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh , were attracted to the right - wing militia movement .
A similar dynamic is taking place today .
Not only is the country experiencing a severe economic crisis , but there are also the same concerns regarding gun control , immigration and other hot - button issues .
Recent attacks on a Unitarian Church and on three Pittsburgh police officers indicate that there is abundant reason to worry about a rise in right - wing violence that is motivated by perceived political grievances .
In the July 2008 shooting at the Unitarian Church in Knoxville , Tennessee , gunman Jim David Adkisson opened fire on people attending a youth performance , killing two and wounding seven .
He later told police that he was motivated by “ his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country , ” according to the sworn affidavit of a police officer who questioned the confessed killer .
The attack on the Pittsburgh police earlier this month also seemed to have a right - wing extremist motivation .
The shooter , Richard Poplawski , had been stockpiling guns and ammunition , fearing that the Obama administration was poised to ban guns , and that the police would be unable to deal with the ensuing chaos brought about by the economic downturn .
He was also upset about recently losing his job , according to friends .
History of Violence
There is also reason to believe that some returning military veterans are increasingly attracted to right - wing extremism .
The DHS assessment cites a report issued by the FBI in 2008 – during the Bush administration – that some returning military veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have joined extremist groups with violent tendencies .
“ Although individuals with military backgrounds constitute a small percentage of white supremacist extremists , ” the FBI concluded , “ they frequently occupy leadership roles within extremist groups and their involvement has the potential to reinvigorate an extremist movement suffering from loss of leadership and in - fighting during the post - 9/11 period . ”
The FBI noted that the military training that veterans bring to the right - wing extremist movement may increase the ability of lone offenders to carry out violence from the movement ’s fringes .
Also , as the DHS notes , there is evidence that right - wing extremists have already begun to infiltrate the armed forces , both for the training that the military provides , and to recruit other service members to their cause .
The DHS cites a Southern Poverty Law Center study , which documented in 2006 that “ large numbers of potentially violent neo -Nazis , skinheads , and other white supremacists are now learning the art of warfare in the armed forces . ”
Relying on interviews with Defense Department investigators , the SPLC determined that thousands of soldiers in the Army alone are involved in extremist activity .
" We ’ve got Aryan Nations graffiti in Baghdad , ” Defense Department detective Scott Barfield told the civil rights organization .
Neo -Nazis “ stretch across all branches of service , ” Barfield elaborated .
“ They are linking up across the branches once they ’re inside , and they are hard - core . ”
Although the references in the DHS report to military veterans have generated the fiercest criticism from Republicans , there is actually much evidence that some returning veterans have violent tendencies and may pose a threat to public safety .
While Gulf War veteran McVeigh is the most often cited example of a disgruntled veteran using his military experience to wage war against the United States , he is not the only example .
John Allen Muhammad , the so - called “ Beltway Sniper ” who terrorized the Washington , DC area for three weeks in the fall of 2002 , was also a veteran of the Gulf War .
He qualified as an “ expert ” with the M16 , which is the highest rating the Army grants in three levels of marksmanship .
He was also attached to a West Coast army base famous for its sniper training program , which used the motto “ One shot , one kill . ”
Prior to his service in the military , Muhammad was considered friendly and non-violent .
By the time he divorced his second wife in 1999 , however , there were indications of increasingly violent tendencies .
His spouse sought a court protection order against him and court records show that she twice accused him of domestic violence .
“ I am afraid of John , ” Mildred Green Muhammad wrote in a complaint on March 3 , 2000 .
“ He was a demolition expert in the military .
He ’s behaving very , very irrational .
Whenever he does talk with me , he always says that he ’s going to destroy my life and I hang up the phone . ”
VA Cost - Cutting
While few would argue that the military is to blame for the murderous choices made by McVeigh and Muhammad , there does seem to be a well - established correlation between military service and violent tendencies , especially when vets do n’t get the support they need upon returning home .
With increasing numbers of veterans experiencing post - traumatic stress disorder , there has been a sharp rise in the incidence of domestic violence , which has reached “ historic frequency , ” according to a new book by Helen Benedict called The Lonely Soldier .
Benedict notes that post - traumatic stress disorder rates appear to be higher among Iraq veterans than among those who have served in Afghanistan or even in Vietnam .
“ One of the symptoms of this disorder , ” she notes , “ is uncontrollable violence . ”
“ Domestic violence rates among veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) are higher than those of the general population , ” further notes an October 2006 article in the Journal of Marital and Family Therapy .
And yet , even as the link between PTSD and domestic violence became increasingly clear , the cash - strapped Department of Veterans Affairs moved to cut benefits to veterans suffering from the disorder .
As the Iraq War lasted longer and required more troops than the Bush administration had anticipated , evidence emerged that the military was working to ensure that Iraq veterans not be diagnosed with PTSD , a condition that obligates the military to provide intensive long - term care , including the possibility of lifetime disability payments .
In June 2008 , an e-mail surfaced written by Norma Perez , Ph.D. , a VA psychologist who coordinates PTSD cases .
She wrote , “ Given that we are having more and more compensation - seeking veterans , I 'd like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of PTSD straight out .
Consider a diagnosis of adjustment disorder . ”
So , instead of decrying the DHS report for “ singling out ” military veterans for terrorism - related concerns , perhaps Republicans in Congress would do better to ensure that the VA receives the funding it needs to properly address the emotional problems that returning veterans may have .
There also might be some self - criticism from Republicans and conservative commentators for their failure to speak out when the Bush administration was using the broad brush of “ terrorism ” to paint anti-war , environmental and various leftist groups as potential threats to the nation ’s security .

In yet another break with its campaign promise to fight to restore civil liberties and privacy , the Obama Administration has made a breathtaking claim of state secrets to block a public interest organization from suing the government for illegal surveillance .
There is not a scintilla of difference in the legal position of President Obama and the position of President Bush in trying to quash any effort to challenge unlawful surveillance by the government .
It appears the “ yes we can ” means “ yes we can do most anything that we want ” when it comes to unlawful programs .
I discussed this story on this segment of MSNBC Countdown .
The Administration is moving to kill a lawsuit brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation on behalf of AT&T customers who were unlawfully intercepted by the government .
Not only is the Administration making an extreme argument under the military and state secrets doctrine but it is claimed that citizens cannot sue , even if the government engages in unlawful surveillance , under the Patriot Act .
Due to changes put through with Democratic support , the statute is being used to block any lawsuit unless the citizens can show that there was “ willful disclosure ’ ” of the communications by the government .
Congress passed the new language last summer with the support of then Sen.
Obama in a complete caving into the powerful telecommunications lobby .
Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker has been addressing the impact of this law in dozens of public interest lawsuits .
At the same time , the Obama administration is invoking state secrets to try to prevent the review of evidence in the case of the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation .
The Administration has even threatened to remove a document from the Court after Judge Walker ruled against it — a position that exceeds even the Bush Administration .

‘s latest film “ ” ( “ “ ) shown at Cannes Film Festival , drops his distinctive comic melodrama for the best tradition of “ film noir , ” the dark and stylish film genre used in many crime dramas .
Oscar - winning director Almodovar ( for foreign - language film with “ ” and original screenplay for “. ” ) described his 17th film and with the highest budget yet of 11 million euros ( $ 14.16 million ) , as “ the story of my love for the cinema . ”
“ The film noir genre is one of my favorites .
The fact this film was really “ black ” was what was very satisfying . ” enlarge the photos below
The film stars recent Oscar winnerin the role of a tragedy - dogged aspiring actress .
“ Broken Embraces ” centers on a quartet of characters in the movie business whose lives are interwoven in a torrid tale of love , power , secrecy , betrayal and vengeance .
There is the actress Lena ( Cruz ) , script writer and director Mateo ( ) , film producer Judith ( ) and unscrupulous financier Ernesto ( ) .
“ While the movie as a whole is thoroughly engrossing and all the movie references and subplots involving the cinema world undoubtedly enrich his story , this is a pretty minor film from the filmmaker .
It feels like more of an exercise in plotting and movie nostalgia than a story about real people …
… For all this window dressing , “ Broken Embraces ” remains a 1950s - style Douglas Sirk melodrama with breathless revelations in the final reel .
One or two stretch credibility about as far as it will go .
Cruz and Homar do play their parts with flair though .
Cruz , who is given an Audrey Hepburn hairdo in the movie within the movie , is glamorous , ambitious and utterly in love with her new man . ”
HollywoodReporter “ Pedro Almodovar offers nothing new in his latest feature , “ Abrazos Rotos ” ( “ Broken Embraces ” ) , but that ’s probably enough for his devout followers .
With solid performances and a script that ’s never too hard on the ears , Spain ’s superstar director merely repeats the themes and conflicts of his greatest hits .
With secretive family issues , tortured artists , melodramatic events and slight humor all in play , Almodovar dutifully plays to his base … ” IndieWire “ It ’s curious to reflect that the great Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar , once the enfant terrible of European cinema , turns 60 this year .
In his maturity , he remains a distinctive stylist and a dazzling film - maker with technique to burn .
Yet while his new film Broken Embraces parades his many virtues , it treads water rather than breaks new ground .
Despite its rich , vivid palette , Broken Embraces feels like Almodóvar ’s take on noir dramas of the 40s and 50s …
… He is at his best in such films as Live Flesh , All About My Mother and Volver , with their personal , deeply felt narratives .
Instead , Broken Embraces often feels like a schematic exercise , an ingenious puzzle that requires a film within a film to supply answers …
One hopes Broken Embraces is a breather for Almodovar , a chance to take stock of the themes that intrigue him .
Next time , a simpler , more affecting story would be welcome . ”
Telegraph “ The action unfolds in flashback .
Mateo Blanco ( a likeable , low - key Lluis Homar ) is a blind screen writer and former film director who is now confined to his Madrid apartment where he grapples with his tumultuous past .
He recalls in particular the mid-1990s , where he fell in love with Lena ( Cruz ) , a tremulous , sad - eyed beauty who traded on her charms to become the mistress of a domineering magnate , Ernesto Martel ( Jose Luis Gomez ) …
… Fans of Almodovar will get plenty of what they expect here – rich saturated colours , hyper plotting , stylistic pyrotechnics and off - centre comedy .
But there are carefully nuanced male characters too and the bleak , distant tone coupled with the unassuaged pain of the leads is a new departure for the director … ”
ScreenDaily “ Films about filmmaking are almost invariably deeply personal works for their director .
Fellini’s 8 ½ , Truffaut ’s Day For Night : both movies contain the creative essence and the artistic insecurities of the filmmaker laid bare with a candour that is not always present in their other work .
But the same is not true of Pedro Almodovar ’s Broken Embraces , a polished , handsomely - mounted picture which nevertheless leaves you with a sense of deflated emptiness …
… The layered structure of the story is echoed effectively by the use of reflections and images within images in the film .
There is , it has to be said , no shortage of ideas here , and cineastes will have fun spotting all the movie references .
Still , ultimately a fundamental problem stems from just that : the film feels like a mixed bag of smart ideas and nods to other pictures , rather than a coherent , distinct work of art . ”
TimesOnline “ Partly a film about films and partly a film about love , Pedro Almodovar ’s “ Broken Embraces ” ca n’t quite decide where its allegiances lie .
A restless , rangy and frankly enjoyable genre - juggler that combines melodrama , comedy and more noir - hued darkness than ever before , the pic is held together by the extraordinary force of Almodovar ’s cinematic personality .
But while its four - way in extremis love story dazzles , it never really catches fire … ” Variety “ Pedro Almodóvar has always managed to combine elegance and exuberance , and his latest movie is no exception : a richly enjoyable piece of work , slick and sleek , with a sensuous feel for the cinematic surfaces of things and , as ever , self - reflexively infatuated with the business of cinema itself .
Yet I wonder if Almodóvar is n’t in danger of retreading old ideas .
It does n’t quite match the heartfelt power of his 2006 Cannes film festival contender , Volver ; Broken Embraces is always conspicuously concerned with passion , but without being itself fully passionate …
… The film - within - a - film motif is head - spinningly sophisticated , though the theme of cinema itself within cinema ( traditionally rather overrated by cinephiles in terms of interest and importance ) is kept fresh and alive through Almodóvar ’s sheer energy . ”

One of the interesting decisions that a programmer must make at the start of a 3D project is figuring out what scale to work in , because the renderer does n’t care .
Perhaps you want to set things up so that nearby things are a unit away , and the stuff in the distance is 100,000 units away .
Or nearby is 0.00001 and far is 0.0001 .
It ’s up to you to pick a scale and to decide what the arbitrary units mean .
Are you working in meters ?
Feet ?
Cubits ?
Fathoms ?
The effective range of an African swallow carrying a coconut ?
In Unreal Tournament , characters were around 160 units tall .
( I think that the intent was for 128 units to = 1 meter . )
In my day job , we work with a system where 1 unit = 1 meter .
While the renderer does n’t care , it ’s important to devise a system that makes sense to programmers and artists so that making content is as easy as possible .
If you make something like 1 unit = 2.333 meters , then your artist making a 1.5 meter object is going to use a calculator all day and then spend their evenings plotting how they plan to conceal the body after they murder you .
Perhaps 1 unit = 1 kilometer seems reasonable , but making furniture that ’s 0.0005 tall is going to be really annoying .
In this program , I ’ve decided to eschew using real - world measurements and adopt an arbitrary system of measurement where 1 unit = 1 window .
A building that ’s 20 units wide will have 20 windows across its face *.
1 unit will also equal 1 traffic lane , so a road 5 units wide will be 5 lanes .
Is the typical building window really the same width as a traffic lane ?
I do n’t know , but I ’m betting it ’s close enough to look believable from a vantage point over the city , which is how the place will be viewed .
* And by “ window ” I mean an 8×8 little square of pixels .
I might have black lines in the space to make that square look like ( say ) two windows side - by - side , but it ’s still a window as far as the program is concerned .
This scale will make it easy to track how I ’m using land .
I allocate space for my city : 1024 x 1024 .
According to Wikipedia , a U.S. traffic lane is 12 feet which works out to about 4 meters .
So my city will be about 4 kilometers on a side , or ~ 16Km2 and have just over a million individual 4 - meter plots that can be assigned as space for buildings or streets .
If you ’re a non-programmer you ’re probably wondering why we use odd values like 256 or 1,024 instead of nice , round values like 200 or 1,000 .
The reason for this is because our base 10 numbering system is bothersome and messy .
At least for programming .
( Arguably for everything else as well , although I ’ll bet that assertion is flamebait in some circles . )
One thing you end up doing all the time in programming is subdividing things .
Searching , sorting , and grouping things usually involves taking whatever stuff you ’ve got and cutting the group in half until it ’s found , sorted , or organized .
Let ’s take a group of 1,000 things and repeatedly divide it in half and see how it goes : 1,000 , 500 , 250 , 125 , 62.5 , 31.25 , 15.625 , 7.8125 , 3.90625 , 1.953125 , 0.9765625
Now let ’s try it with 1,024 : 1024 , 512 , 256 , 128 , 64 , 32 , 16 , 8 , 4 , 2 , 1 But hey , we have the same number of numeric digits as we have fingers , and that ’s pretty awesome , right ?
So I take my city and mark areas of it as “ streets ” .
The streets will be invisible in the final version , but I ’m rendering them here as blue lines so I can see what I ’m doing .
Now I place 20 big impressive skyscrapers in the middle area of the map .
These are buildings with a large footprint and they range from 45 to 55 units tall .
( And since units are windows , that ’s how many stories tall they are .
Next I scatter around a few dozen smaller buildings .
These are just as elaborate as the last batch , but these range from 25 to 35 stories tall .
And finally I fill in the remaining empty space with simple cube buildings .
4,752 buildings .
The framerate is still shockingly high considering what I ’m asking of the GPU .
Still , I ’m well under 100 FPS now and I ’m betting this would be unacceptably choppy on low - end hardware .
On the other hand , I have made no effort to optimize things yet .
I do n’t even know where the current bottleneck is .
That will come in a later step , when I have a little more of the technology written .
I try turning off the dev background and the blue “ roads ” and seeing what it looks like .
Disappointingly , the place looks a little … homogeneous :
Looking back to my reference pictures , I notice that each building seems to have its own color .
This is either due to the color of the interior lights , the color of the interior stuff like walls and carpeting , or the tint of the windows .
In any case , each building has a slightly different tint .
I pick a narrow band of hues and apply them to each building :
It ’s hard to see in this screenshot , but the overall effect is pretty striking .
It adds another layer of randomness to the world , so that even if two adjacent buildings happen to be using the same texture , they ’ll likely be different colors .
COUNTERPOINT : Uh , in the middle of this screenshot are 3 buildings the same texture and color .
Ugh .
I cruise around the city and take notes :
I notice some buildings do n’t look quite right .
Yellow , blue , and white lights look fine .
Green and red hues look wrong .
This suggests that the real source of the color is the type of light used in the building .
I do see some greenish windows in the photos ( albeit very pale ) but they look wrong in my simplified little world .
The window distribution is just too uniform .
As I pointed out last time , some buildings should have spaces of dark areas .
Right now all buildings are unbroken grids of windows , and it just feels monotonous .
Related to the above : I think some protruding ledges , rooftop A/C units , and other clutter would help a lot , particularly if those items were simple black silhouettes against all of these white grids .
As some people have pointed out :
The “ mirroring ” is quite noticeable in some places .
The window pattern on the east side of every building will be an exact mirror image of the front , so that when you look at the northeast corner it ’s like a Rorschach blot test .
Same goes for the west and south walls .
This is due to the cheap way I used to map textures onto walls .
It was quick & dirty , and I thought it would be fine , but the mirroring is too obvious .
How I think it needs to work is that I need to wrap a texture around a building , except that when I turn a corner I should step back exactly 1 window .
This means the windows at the end of one wall will be identical to the column of windows that begins the next .
Since those windows ostensibly look into the same room , their lighting pattern needs to match or it looks screwy .
I do n’t like the rigid grid of streets .
Some angled or curving streets would help a lot , but that would add huge complexity to the program .
Right now the fact that streets run perfectly along an axis without obstruction simplifies many things .
I think I ’ll live with this problem for now rather than over - complicating things .
We ’re probably 15 or so hours into this 30 hour adventure .
Still on my to - do list :
With the Iranian Presidential election being held next month , a news outlet in Iran is reporting that the country has blocked access to Facebook to prevent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's rival from spreading his message .
US reporters in the country 's capital , Tehran , back the claims that the site is inaccessible .
An AFP report translates :
Access to the Facebook site was prohibited several days ahead of the presidential election , " Ilna [ Iranian Labour News Agency ] , considered close to Iranian reformists , said in reference to the June 12 vote .
" According to certain Internet surfers , the site was banned because supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi were using Facebook to better disseminate the candidate 's positions . "
An employee of an Internet service provider who requested anonymity said the ministry of communications and information technology had announced the decision .
However , there was no immediate comment from the authorities on the claims .
Former prime minister Mousavi is backed by two - time ex-reformist president Mohammad Khatami and the main reformist parties .
He is considered to be the main rival to hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who is seeking a second four - year term .
The story is almost certainly true : the BBC reports that CNN employees in Tehran cannot visit Facebook : their ISPs deliver the message " Access to this site is not possible . "
The block , meanwhile , makes a total mockery of Iran 's supposed " elections " : Iranian television and radio are already state - controlled , and putting a lockdown on websites like Facebook further limits the potential for open discussion of the candidates .
Ahmadinejad 's opponent , Mir Hossein Mousavi , currently has over 4,500 Facebook fans on one fan page , and multiple fan pages are said to exist .
Facebook has responded to the incident , calling it " a shame " .
" An outrage " might be the more appropriate word choice .
According to Korean news site Chosun Online , Sony has ceased supplying South Korea with PS3s for the time being in order to prevent Japanese tourists from picking up the console at a cheaper price point .

" We are troubled by ' reverse - importing ' , which is when products exported into South Korea are flown back into Japan , " said a Sony employee .
With the depreciating South Korean Won and the strong Japanese Yen , South Korea is an even more attractive shopping destination for Japanese shoppers .
The PS3 prices at 448,000 won in South Korea , and it goes for around ¥ 39,900 in Japan .

Since Korea offers lower retail prices , the Japanese have traditionally visited the Korean Peninsula to pick up luxury items such as designer bags at " discount " prices .
However , South Korea and Japan use different voltage frequencies with the nominal voltage for South Korea being 220/380 and being 100/200 for Japan .
Those picking up a Korean PS3 for Japan will need a converter .

( CNN ) --
Health officials say the H1N1 virus , commonly known as the swine flu , is likely to cause more illnesses and deaths in the United States , even though much of the initial anxiety has eased .
A researcher investigates swine flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported higher levels of flu activity than the average for mid-May and an unusual number of outbreaks in schools .
Some clinics reported high numbers of respiratory diseases more commonly seen during the peak of flu season .
" We do think that the way the virus is spreading in the U.S. , we are not out of the woods , and the disease is continuing , " said Dr. Anne Schuchat , interim deputy director for science and public health program at the CDC in a news conference this week .
In the United States , six deaths have been linked to the swine flu , although it 's unclear whether these were caused by the virus or pre-existing conditions .
Nationwide , at least 5,123 cases of H1N1 flu have been reported , although the actual number of people affected may be higher .
New data released by the CDC Tuesday showed that the majority of the 30 patients who were hospitalized with H1N1 in California had other medical conditions , such as chronic heart and lung disease , suppressed immune system , diabetes , and obesity .
None of the patients died .
Case characteristics
A sample of 30 hospitalized patients with H1N1 had the following chronic illnesses : Chronic lung disease 37 percent Other immunosuppresion 20 percent Chronic cardiac disease 17 percent Diabetes 13 percent Obesity 13 percent Seizure disorder 17 percent
Source : CDC
They had fevers , coughs , vomiting and shortness of breath , according to the CDC report that examined the patients .
Six of them were admitted to the intensive care unit and four required mechanical ventilation .
See an explanation of H1N1 flu »
Five of them were pregnant -- two of the fetuses did not survive .
Earlier this month , Judy Dominguez Trunnell became the first U.S. resident to die from complications of the H1N1 flu .
Her daughter was delivered via emergency Caesarean section .
Dominguez Trunnell felt body aches and numbing in the left side of her face and went to the hospital , her husband , Steven Trunnell , told CNN 's Larry King .
Watch the interview . »
Trunnell has filed a wrongful death claim against Smithfield Foods , a pork and meat producer , alleging that the company 's actions may have contributed to the virus ' creation .
" She was a healthy , pregnant woman who was eight months pregnant until she contracted the virus , " he said .
" She became acutely ill , but she was never diagnosed with any major medical complications of any kind . "
Health officials have said repeatedly since the outbreak 's beginning that the virus cannot be contracted from eating pork .
Pregnancy increases the risk of certain medical problems and creating complications from the flu , Schuchat said .
" There is some immunosuppression that occurs during pregnancy , " she said .
" There maybe also a role of the mechanical effect of pregnancy in decreasing the lung capacity that maybe you 're not easily able to handle lung infection or respiratory problems . "
Early steps toward an H1N1 vaccine are being taken .
The process could take between five and six months from the time the virus appeared to when the vaccine would be available to the public , officials have said .
Tom Skinner , a CDC spokesman , said the agency has sent H1N1 strains to roughly seven labs around the world to use in the first steps of vaccine development .
The CDC expects to get the viruses back from the institutions by the end of the month and " if we do go in the direction of producing a vaccine , we could see the production of pilot lots , and clinical trials , beginning as soon as late June . "
Though the initial surveillance of the California cases indicates that most healthy patients recovered and were discharged after short hospital stays , those with other medical conditions had greater complications .
" Our best estimate right now is that the fatality [ with the H1N1 ] is likely a little bit higher than seasonal influenza , but not necessarily substantially higher , " Schuchat said .
The seasonal flu kills 36,000 people every year .
While people of all ages get the seasonal flu , its complications more severely affect older people or those with weakened immune systems .
About 95 percent of people who die from the seasonal flu are 65 years old and above , according to the World Health Organization .
Many of the confirmed and probable cases for the H1N1 virus have been younger people between the ages of 5 and 24 .
" The hospitalizations that we 're tracking have this disproportionate occurrence among younger persons , " Schuchat said .
" That 's very unusual to have so many people under 20 requiring hospitalization and in some of those intensive care units . "
While there have been no deaths in that age group in the United States , Schuchat said : " We would not be surprised to see serious hospitalizations and deaths occurring in people in this age group and I think we need to be prepared for that . "
" It 's important to dispel the idea that we 're out of the woods , or that this was a problem that really did n't merit response , " she said .
" Influenza is unpredictable , and we really need to stay attuned to that , to be prepared for surprises in the days and weeks ahead . "
And the flu viruses can mutate .
Dr. Dan Jernigan , deputy director for the CDC 's influenza division said last week , " We 're not seeing significant evidence of any mutation towards more virulence in the U.S. "
H1N1 flu activity has been confirmed in 22 states and appears to be most active in the Southwest .
In April , concerns about the H1N1 virus prompted travel warnings , airport checks and school closures .
The outbreak has sickened 9,830 people worldwide and caused at least 79 deaths -- mostly in Mexico , according to the WHO .
Last month , U.S. officials discouraged all nonessential travel to Mexico after the flu strain killed dozens of people there .
On Friday , the CDC downgraded its warning and advised people with medical complications , advanced age or pregnancy to check with a doctor before going on a trip to Mexico .
CNN medical senior producers Saundra Young and Shahreen Abedin contributed to this report .

RedditというのはUSの技術者を中心に人気のあるソーシャルニュースサイトで，Pythonを使って書かれている(バックエンドはと言うとPostgreSQL(Slony ))。もともとLispで書かれていて，web.pyというフレームワークを生み出したりもしている。まあ一言で言うとRedditを作っている連中は面白い。Redditのコードが公開されていて，だれでもクローンを作ることができる，とかね。2，3歩先を行っている。
PyCon 2009 のキーノート でRedditのFounderたちがキーノートスピーチをしたんだけど，その時の質問「なぜRedditがLispからPythonに移行して，Pythonを使い続けているのか」という質問に対する答えが面白い。ブログに要約を書いてくれている人がいたので，ちょっと翻訳してみた。
なぜReddit がPythonを使うのか
Steve Huffman とAlexis OhanianがPyConでキーノートスピーチをしているとき，誰かがこう質問したんだ。「何でRedditはLispからPythonに移行したのか？」。
移行の理由はそんなに面白くないけど，なぜPythonにとどまっているかという理由は興味深い。SteveはRedditがPythonを使い続ける理由として，2つの「大きな」理由を言ってる。
Pythonを使い続ける最も大きな理由...そうだなあ，大きな理由が2つあるよ。ひとつめの理由はライブラリ。Pythonには全部のライブラリがそろっている。僕たちは開発を進めてきた課程で，たくさんの技術や，たくさんのアーキテクチャを学んできた。たとえば，僕がコネクションプールについて理解していなかったとしても，僕はただ単にライブラリを探してきて使うことができる。それからコネクションプールについて理解して，自分たちでライブラリを書けばいい。Webフレームワークについても理解する必要はない。自分たちのフレームワークを作る時が来るまで，他の人が作ったフレームワークを使うだけだ。その他の多くの技術を使う前に学ぶ必要はないんだ。だってPythonにはほとんど全ての種類のライブラリが備わっているのだから。これからも，僕たちはもっと多くの技術を学び続ける。そして自分たちの手でライブラリを作る。技術を自分たち流に変えるためにね。このような手法を使うことで，自分流に変換する作業をとってもとっても簡単にすることができるんだ。
もうひとつ，僕たち をPythonにつなぎ止めておく理由は，これは最も大きな理由なんだけど，Pythonのコードが読みやすく書きやすい，ということなんだ。たとえば僕たちが新しい技術者を雇うとき。Pythonが書ける技術者を雇うことはまずないわけだけど。僕はただ「ぜんぶPythonで書いてね」と言うだけだ。そう言うだけで，彼らの書いたコードを僕は読むことができる。これはすごいことなんだけど，僕は部屋越しにコードが良いか悪いかを見分けることができるんだ。というのは，良質なPythonのコードはとても明確な構造を持っているから。これが僕の仕事をより楽にしてくれるんだ。Pythonのコードはとんでもなく表情豊かで，とんでもなく読みやすく，そしてとんでもなく書きやすい。だから僕は仕事をスムーズに運べるというわけさ。
ちなみに，彼らのキーノートスピーチの動画がネットに上がっている。You'll find how funky they are by seeing it :-) .
It ’s really pretty simple .
Foreign backpackers go to Australia .
For several weeks , they ’ll wander the country , get drunk and … I do n’t know … go to the opera .
When the trip ’s over , these visitors file fake income claims , which get them thousands of dollars in tax refunds – despite not having actually worked ( and thus not having paid any taxes ) .
Through word of mouth , and probably a few blog posts , word has spread , and it ’s really kicking Aussie authorities in the wallet .
And , the government is powerless .
By the time they catch up with fraudsters , there usually is n’t much money left .
Off course , the amounts are known to be too small for the Australian Tax Office to pursue them overseas .
But , this is illegal .
Of the hundreds of thousands of backpackers who visited Australia last year , 44 were prosecuted successfully .
Knowing my luck , I would have been one of them .
Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint at any age .
It affects almost half of adults 60 and older , according to the National Institutes of Health .
It 's no secret that U.S. residents work hard , vacation infrequently , and struggle to get a good night 's sleep ( or so we 're told by studies funded by the sleeping pill industry ) .
There are a host of reasons for our unrest , largely rooted in the cultural tendency toward work work work and the resulting stress over family and home tasks undone that all keeps us up at night .
Some American parents struggle just to stuff the kids with Eggos , work all day , get the kids from day care or an after school program , shovel a fatty burger in them , yell about the homework , then crash .
Already known for their liberal vacation policies and their culinary indulgences , French residents were found in a new study to spend more time sleeping and eating than anyone else in wealthy nations .
2 hours a day ?!
The French spend more than 2 hours a day eating , twice the rate in the United States , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , which aims to promote democracy and a market economy among 30 nations .
The OECD is located in France , so it 's not clear how they found the time to do the study , but I digress .
More results :
The French sleep about 9 hours a day , the report finds .
U.S. residents were n't exactly asleep on the job in this category , coming 2nd place by sleeping a reported and quite surprising 8.7 hours a day , the OECD reports .
One has to wonder if this study is slightly out of whack , or if all this serious sleeping calls into question the many studies ( again , many of them funded by the sleep industry ) that say we Americans do n't get enough .
While 8.7 hours is a lot more than I ever get , it might at least be a good number to toss into an equation to generate some sort of admittedly inexpert average .
Bear with me during a little math :
Last year , a study by the University of Maryland concluded that Americans get about 8 hours of sleep a night , possibly more in recent years .
Our figures so far ( 8.7 and 8 ) contrast with the 7 or fewer hours ( of substandard sleep , of course ) often cited in studies funded by the National Sleep Foundation , which in turn is funded in part by drug companies that make sleep aids .
( I ca n't think of why an organization promoting democracy and free markets — the OECD — would desire to skew sleep numbers one way or the other , so unless their goal was to make France and the U.S. both look lazy . )
Some let 's do some serious rounding and call 8 hours our back - of - the - envelope - and - probably - not - too - far - off number .
Good luck getting yours tonight .
Women work more
Nodding off ?
Okay , back to the OECD study : Announced this week , it is based on time - use surveys done in 2006 on nationally representative samples of thousands of people .
Among other findings :
In all the countries surveyed , men report more leisure time than women .
This gender gap is largest in Italy , where men top women by 80 minutes per day .
The gap is just under 40 minutes in the United States , and smallest ( less than 5 minutes ) in Norway .
Turkey is the most sociable nation surveyed , spending 35 percent of leisure time entertaining friends .
None of the countries is very physically active : Spain reports the highest proportion of leisure time spent doing regular physical activities , at 13 percent .

Recently , the Conficker / Downadup worm infected several hundred machines and critical medical equipment in an undisclosed number of U.S. hospitals .
The attacks were not widespread ; however , Marcus Sachs , director of the SANS Internet Storm Center , told CNET News that it raises the awareness of what we would do if there were millions of computers infected in hospitals or in critical infrastructure locations .
It 's not clear how the devices ( including heart monitors , MRI machines and PCs ) got infected .
Infected computers were running Windows NT and Windows 2000 in a local area network ( LAN ) that was n't supposed to be Internet accessible , but the LAN was connected to one with direct Internet access .

A patch was released by Microsoft last October by November that fixes the problem , but the computers infected were reportedly too old to be patched .
U.K. Hospitals Infected with Conficker in January
This past January , The Register U.K. reported that hospitals in Sheffield were found to be infected with the Conficker / Downadup worm .
The infections illustrate dangers that can arise from connecting critical networks , such as those in hospitals and in SCADA ( Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ) systems used by utility companies and other critical infrastructure providers that are networked and configured to connect to the Internet .
For years SCADA systems were separated from public networks , but not anymore .
More utility companies use remote access and other Internet - based technologies to give their workers access to the control systems when they 're not in the plant to cut costs .
So far no evidence of compromised computers leading to a disruption of service has been found , but the potential exists .
Texas Dept of Public Safety Computers Infected
A recent report from SpamFighter.com says that the Texas Department of Public Safety ( DPS ) was also infected by the Conficker / Downadup worm on April 17 , 2009 .

The infection prevented approximately 2,000 state troopers from sending emails from their DPS computers and disrupted the issuance of Texas drivers licenses .
The attack seemed to have affected DPS computers state wide .
Estimated Economic Cost of Conficker : $ 9.1 billion
A recent report from the Cyber Secure Institute claims that the economic loss due to the Conficker / Downadup worm could be as high as $ 9.1 billion based on their previous studies into the average cost of such malware attacks .
( Source : zdnet.com )
That estimate may actually be low , since it considered only a limited infection rate ( 200,000 infected hosts ) and the Conficker / Downadup worm is still active .
The most recent estimate of computers infected with the Conficker / Downadup worm is 3.5 million .

ALGIERS ( Reuters ) - World oil prices could recover to $ 60 per barrel by the end of the year if demand in the global economy picks up , OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al - Badri told Reuters in an interview on Sunday .
He said now was too soon to judge if fresh output cuts would be needed when OPEC holds its next meeting on May 28 , and said it would take at least until the end of this year for inventories of stockpiled oil to return to normal levels .
But al - Badri said there was a glimmer of hope of an economic recovery and described as exaggerated an International Energy Agency ( IEA ) forecast earlier this month that oil demand in 2009 would be sharply lower than previously expected .
Asked to predict what will happen to the price of oil -- currently around $ 51 per barrel -- al - Badri said : “ I think it will be $ 60 odd by the end of the year if we see some change on the demand side . ”
“ We are seeing at this time a glimmer of hope of recovery .
If that ’s the case I ’m sure demand will be up , ” he told Reuters during a visit to OPEC member Algeria .
STUDYING WORLD ECONOMY
OPEC -- or the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- will meet next month to decide if further output cuts are needed to lift an oil price that has fallen by two - thirds in the past 9 months as the global slump has depressed demand for fuel .
The OPEC official said the organization would base its decision on how well members , who pump over a third of the world ’s oil , were complying with previously agreed output cuts , and on an analysis of the state of the world economy .
“ If there is a real recovery then we will see more improvement in the coming month , then we will decide at that time but .. it is really difficult to judge right now at this time , ” he told Reuters .
Balance would be restored to the world oil market but “ not before the end of this year , ” al - Badri said .
Asked how fast the stockpiles of oil , which include millions of barrels of crude being stored on tanker vessels , will come down , al - Badri said : “ Slowly .
I do n’t think they will come down very quickly .
We are working on that . ”
He said the target was to reduce inventories from their level now of 60 days of forward cover to 52 days .
“ We have to work hard and then , before the end of this year ( this can be achieved ) , ” al - Badri said .
Commenting on the IEA ’s prediction earlier this month that world oil demand will dive by 2.4 million barrels per day in 2009 because of the impact of prolonged recession , al - Badri said : “ It is just an exaggerated number . ”
He also expressed skepticism about calls from some energy consumers for OPEC , instead of shoring up the oil price , to let it fall further to stimulate economic recovery .
“ We already contributed more than 50 percent of our income to stimulate demand ...
So what other stimulus do you want from us ? ” he said .
“ Some of our member countries , not all of them , a few of them , their cost to produce a barrel of oil is more than $ 30 . ”
A 5.0 earthquake struck southeast of Los Angeles International Airport this evening , causing significant shaking across Southern California .
[ Update : Quake was downgraded to 4.7 . ]
The temblor hit about 8:30 p.m. a mile from the South Bay community of Lennox .
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries , but authorities said they were receiving numerous calls about the temblor .
A 3.0 aftershock occurred a few minutes later near Lennox .
Check out the USGS quake map .
Update at 8:58 p.m. :
The temblor started about 8.4 miles below the surface , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
Residents in the Lennox area said china fell off shelves , but there were no reports of more serious damage .
The Los Angeles Fire Department is on " emergency quake mode " as a precaution .
It 's unclear what fault the quake struck on .
The Newport - Inglewood fault , which has produced several powerful temblors , runs through that general area .
Updated at 9:10 p.m. :
An initial assessment by the Los Angeles Fire Department found " no major structural damage , no serious injuries , " according to spokesman Brian Humphrey 's Twitter feed .
Updated at 9:20 p.m. :
At the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Lennox station , deputies said the shaking was brief but intense .
" It was pretty strong but over in about 10 seconds , " said Lt. Kent Wegener .
" There are no [ immediate ] reports of damage .
At this point , we are checking all the critical facilities and getting our ducks in a row . "
Los Angeles County
Fire officials also said they had not received damage reports in residential or industrial areas , including the coastal refineries .
Update at 9:35 p.m. : KCAL interviewed moviegoers at a shopping mall in Redondo Beach who said the quake shook the screen and caused some ceiling tiles to fall .
But firefighters said there was no serious damage or injuries .
KCAL also reported numerous burglar alarms going off and some people cutting themselves on glass .
Updated at 9:50 p.m. :
In Hawthorne , firefighters were called to Chadron Avenue , near Crenshaw Boulevard , where a light pole was damaged during the earthquake .
One man also suffered a heart attack , but it was unclear whether that was connected .
“ Luckily , nothing major so far , ” said Hawthorne Police Lt. Michael Ishii .
The earthquake was “ a bit deep , ” said U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Susan Hough – originating 8.4 miles below the surface .
“ That tends to make it less sharp – less of a jerky , abrupt motion , ” Hough said .
As a result , most of the region felt the quake largely as a rolling motion , though some closer to the center felt more of a jolt .
Lucy Jones , seismologist at the U.S. Geological Survey , said the earthquake appears to be consistent with a rupture on the Newport - Inglewood fault .
( She said the quake was too small to break the surface , so they can't definitively identify faults . )
Jones said this fault is n't typically thought to be capable of producing a major quake like the San Andreas fault .
But it was responsible for the 1933 Long Beach earthquake , which measured about 6.3 in magnitude .
The Long Beach quake was about as big as seismologists expect from this fault , she said .
" There have been numerous magnitude 3s on it over the years , a cluster of them in the 1980s , " she said .
" In general , it 's an active area . "
The quake was initially logged as a magnitude 5 by automatic sensors , but as more data came in , seismologists downgraded it to a magnitude 4.7 .
It also had an aftershock with a magnitude 3.1 about six minutes later .
So far , Jones said , 12,000 people have reported feeling the shaking , including some people in San Diego .
She was not surprised at the number of people reporting because the quake shook a pretty densely populated area .
Nothing about the quake or its aftershocks looked unusual , she said .
" It ’s a real garden variety California earthquake so far . "
What ’s notable about it is location with respect to people .
She said the most similar earthquake to this one was a temblor that shook the Inglewood area in 1920 , and that one was classified as a " minor damaging shock . "

A man was literally left with little more than the shirt on his back after a group of gun-toting robbers made off with nearly everything they could get from him – including his clothes .
The victim was in his car with a friend on Ravenal St. , near Weston Rd. and St. Clair Ave.
W. , shortly before midnight when three men jumped into the vehicle and demanded money , said police .
They pulled out guns and robbed the man , taking his wallet , his iPod and his cell phone .
They also took his pants and his shoes , leaving him in a t - shirt and socks and then fled .
So far , police are n't entirely sure why the robbers wanted the man 's clothes .
Officers searched the area – a residential neighbourhood bordered by several parks and an industrial area – but have n't made any arrests .
Police say the victim does n't know the men who robbed him .
Anyone with information on the robbery is asked to contact police at 416- 808- 1200 or leave an anonymous tip with Crime Stoppers at 416-222- TIPS ( 8477 )
Big Brother is using GPS to follow you !
Here ’s a disturbing decision from Wisconsin regarding the use of GPS tracking devices by the police .
The judge said the police do n’t even need a warrant !
Wisconsin police can attach GPS to cars to secretly track anybody ’s movements without obtaining search warrants , an appeals court ruled Thursday .
However , the District 4 Court of Appeals said it was “ more than a little troubled ” by that conclusion and asked Wisconsin lawmakers to regulate GPS use to protect against abuse by police and private individuals .
As the law currently stands , the court said police can mount GPS on cars to track people without violating their constitutional rights — even if the drivers are n’t suspects .
Officers do not need to get warrants beforehand because GPS tracking does not involve a search or a seizure , Judge Paul Lundsten wrote for the unanimous three - judge panel based in Madison .
That means “ police are seemingly free to secretly track anyone ’s public movements with a GPS device , ” he wrote .
One privacy advocate said the decision opened the door for greater government surveillance of citizens .
Meanwhile , law enforcement officials called the decision a victory for public safety because tracking devices are an increasingly important tool in investigating criminal behavior .
This decision is ridiculous on its face and I suspect will eventually be overturned by the U.S Supreme Court .
With this decision the police can track anyone at any time for any reason !
It only highlights how things are dramatically changing in today ’s world .
Using technology , you can follow people , listen in on their conversations and do all sorts of spying !
It sounds like fun in a way , until someone does it to you .
I suspect the courts with be busy with this topic for years to come .

It 's a simple idea , but there just is n't one already .
I 'm not a wonderful hacker : the code looks like shit .
Now I 've gotten to the point that it should work .
The pieces have finally come together to the point where I should be able to just tell it to go , sit back , and watch my hard drive totally change .
But I have n't .
For the last half an hour , I 've been sitting here trying to figure out if there 's some problem I 'm not aware of , or what fail - safes I can quickly hack into it .
If it works , I will have a hard drive with all the files defragmented , but with free space scattered around at random intervals .
I think I can correct that by just making multiple passes over the drive .

Unmoored from the Democratic Party , Joe Lieberman is free to show his true colors .
And he is n’t sounding like he is acquainted with what we might call sanity .
“ If we just pick up like Tom Harkin - [ IA ] Barbara Boxer -[ CA ] John Kerry - [ MA ] Edward M. Kennedy -[ MA ] Russell Feingold -[ WI ] Robert C. Byrd -[ WV ]
Ned Lamont wants us to do , get out by a date certain , it will be taken as a tremendous victory by the same people who wanted to blow up these planes in this plot hatched in England , ” Mr. Lieberman said at a campaign event in Waterbury , Conn .
“ It will strengthen them , and they will strike again . ”
“ I ’m worried that too many people [ Christropher Dodd -[ CT ] , Hillary Clinton -[ NY ] , Diane Feinstein -[ CA ] , Barack Obama -[ IL ] , Joseph Biden - [ DE ] , Jay Rockefeller - [ WV ] , Jack Reed - [ RI ] ] , both in politics and out , do n’t appreciate the seriousness of the threat to American security and the evil of the enemy that faces us , ” Mr. Lieberman said at the Waterbury event .
He called that threat “ more evil , or as evil , as Nazism and probably more dangerous than the Soviet Communists we fought during the long cold war . ”
I think Ned Lamont ’s response to this was spot on .
“ Wow , ” Mr. Lamont said , after twice asking a reporter to read Mr. Lieberman ’s remark about him .
“ That comment sounds an awful lot like Vice President Cheney ’s comment on Wednesday .
Both of them believe our invasion of Iraq has a lot to do with 9/11 .
That ’s a false premise . ”
To say the least , it is a false premise .
I ’m also quite amazed to see Lieberman equate the evil of Islamic terrorism to that of the Nazis .
I ’m even more amazed to see him suggest that they represent a greater danger than the Soviet Union did .
That ’s unhinged fearmongering .
Just out of curiosity , I went back this morning and re-read Franklin Delano Roosevelt ’s speech to the nation after the attack on Pearl Harbor [ posted below the fold ] .
I was looking , in particular , for any appeal to fear .
I was looking for any demonization of the enemy , any accusations that they were ‘ evil ’ .
I was looking to see what he appealed to in order to rally the nation for what would be our greatest struggle as a nation .
I did n’t find anything that resembled the bullshit that Joe Lieberman is spewing .
You know what ?
He just said this , “ The facts of yesterday speak for themselves .
The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation . ”
That is how things stood on September 12 , 2001 .
We did n’t need George W. Bush to explain to us that , “ Hostilities exist .
There is no blinking at the fact that our people , our territory and our interests are in grave danger . ”
We understood that .
All we required was an explanation for who attacked us , why we were attacked , and how we might dissuade people from attacking us again .
We quickly learned that the terrorists were natives of Jordan , the United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia , and Egypt .
All of these countries are formally allied with the United States and have been allied with us dating back to the Cold War .
Clearly , we were dealing with a political statement about our relationship with the rulers of those nations .
But we were not told this .
Instead , we were told that we were attacked because these ‘ folks ’ hate our freedom .
That was the first betrayal .
The second betrayal was suggesting that Saddam Hussein had anything to do with 9/11 , or that regime change in Iraq would matter to dissident groups in Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia .
Let ’s talk about freedom for a moment , because it is important .
When we look at a group like al - Qaeda , we need to keep two things in our head simultaneously .
First , they want to change conditions in their countries , but are powerless to do so through traditional political means .
Their powerlessness arises from the powerful internal security forces used to protect the House of Saud , the Hashemite King of Jordan , and the President - for - Life Hosni Mubarak .
The second thing to remember is that these terrorists are not looking to replace their despots with Jeffersonian democracies , but with Islamic theocracies .
It is in this latter sense that they lose the right to the sympathy a Republic like the United States might feel for those yearning to topple tyranny .
Bush has spelled out a vision for the Middle East wherein the people will have participatory democracy .
The theory is that they will opt for Jeffersonian democracy if given the ballot , as opposed to opting for something more akin to what Usama bin-Laden wants .
But we have had three electoral processes in the Middle East since Saddam was toppled .
In Lebanon , Hizbollah gained seats and was awarded ministries .
In Palestine , Hamas emerged victorious , leading to Israel ’s imprisonment of a big chunk of their parliament .
In Iraq , they chose to elect theocratic Shi’a parties aligned with Axis - of - Evil member , Iran .
Events such as these are world changing .
And they are complicated .
We have a President that , prior to deciding to invade Iraq , did n’t even know that the Islam has a Sunni branch and a Shi’a Branch .
I know that Joe Lieberman was aware of that , but it does not seem to have better informed his thinking .
The terrorism we face today may , indeed , have a broader ideological basis than the pre-9/11 terrorism .
That terrorism was about our cozy relationship with tyrants in the Middle East .
The new terrorism may be about our complicity in the killing of hundreds of Lebanese , and the deaths of tens and tens of thousands of civilians in Iraq .
It may be simple revenge .
But to compare jihadist ideology to Nazism is a gross exaggeration .
Ahmadinejad and other firebrand ’s rhetoric aside , the goals of the terrorists remain political .
They pose no existential threat to the United States , and they pose no realistic existential threat to Israel .
As for the Soviet Union , their record does not compare favorably with the record of Khomeini ’s Iran , Assad ’s Syria , or with Hizbollah and Hamas .
The Soviet Union killed millions of their own citizens and ruthlessly oppressed Ukrainians , Lithuanians , Georgians , Uzbeks , Kazakhs , Moldovans , Poles , Czechs , Hungarians , Romanians , Slovaks , Jews , and other ethnic groups .
They had enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world and authorized their use in Cuba in 1962 .
Marxist - Leninism represented a coherent , non-sectarian , ethnic , or national ideology that had broad appeal .
Islamic terrorism remains divided along sectarian , ethnic , and national lines .
There is no prospect of an Islamic ruler uniting the terrorists under their banner and going forth to oppress non-Muslims .
There is no prospect of the terrorists capturing any territory other than by the very ballot box that Bush cynically pushes as the solution .
There is no sense in which Islamic terrorism represents even the tiniest threat to us when compared to the Soviet Union .
Nor does it pose a similar threat to the Soviet ’s brand of communism for the people under their thumb .
To suggest otherwise is to either display the grossest ignorance of history and current conditions , or to engage in the basest of political fearmongering .
The solution to Islamic terrorism begins in the occupied territories of Israel .
Once that conlict has a settlement , the swamp that breeds terrorism will be largely drained .
But we will still have to worry so long as our allies in the Middle East are oppressive and corrupt and we are seen as their enablers and protectors .
Joe Lieberman has now shown that he is little different from Dick Cheney in his vision of the Middle East .
In both cases they say our very nation is in peril , and yet neither of them call upon us to make any sacrifice .
When Roosevelt saw an existential threat emerging overseas he acted ( and it required leadership ) .
The draft began in October 1940 .
By the early summer of 1941 , President Roosevelt asked the U.S. Congress to extend the term of duty for the draftees beyond twelve months .
The United States House of Representatives approved the extension by a single vote .
The Senate approved it by a wider margin , and Roosevelt signed the bill into law .
For Cheney and Lieberman to compare the threat of terrorism to Nazism and the Soviet Empire , and to see Iraq go down in flames without even calling for a draft …is about the most irresponsible thing I ’ve ever seen .
If they are right , then they will have lost the war and the country because they could n’t disrupt our college kids ’ plans .
But , they are wrong .
December 8 , 1941 Yesterday , December 7 , 1941 – a date which will live in infamy – the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan .
The United States was at peace with that nation and , at the solicitation of Japan , was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific .
Indeed , one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in Oahu , the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to the Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message .
While this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations , it contained no threat or hint of war or armed attack .
It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago .
During the intervening time the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace .
The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces .
Very many American lives have been lost .
In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu .
Yesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against Malaya .
Last night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong .
Last night Japanese forces attacked Guam .
Last night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands .
Last night the Japanese attacked Wake Island .
This morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island .
Japan has , therefore , undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area .
The facts of yesterday speak for themselves .
The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation .
As Commander - in - Chief of the Army and Navy , I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense .
Always will we remember the character of the onslaught against us .
No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion , the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory .
I believe I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger us again .
Hostilities exist .
There is no blinking at the fact that our people , our territory and our interests are in grave danger .
With confidence in our armed forces – with the unbounded determination of our people – we will gain the inevitable triumph – so help us God .
I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday , December seventh , a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire . ”
